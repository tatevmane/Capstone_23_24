"A.B. v. Shilo Inn, Salem, LLC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143289.pdf","OPINION AND ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT  SUMMIT HOTEL TRS 085, LLC'S MOTION TO  DISMISS IMMERGUT, District Judge. Plaintiff A.B. (""Plaintiff"") filed a complaint against  Defendants Shilo Inn, Salem, LLC (d.b.a. Shilo Inn  Salem) and Summit Hotel TRS 085, LLC (d.b.a.  Residence  Inn  Portland  Airport)  (collectively,  ""Defendants"") in this Court on March 16, 2023. ECF 1.  Plaintiff alleges a violation of the Trafficking Victims  Protection Reauthorization Act (""TVPRA""), 18 U.S.C. §  1589 et seq., arising out of her being sex trafficked at a  two Oregon hotels. Id. at ¶¶ 127-131. On June 13, 2023,  Defendant Summit Hotel TRS 085, LLC (""Summit  Hotel"") filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint in  its entirety with [*2]  prejudice for failure to state a claim.  ECF 17 at 1. In the alternative, Defendant moves to  strike portions of Plaintiff's complaint or the complaint in  its entirety. Id. at 1-2. Plaintiff filed a Response in  Opposition on June 27, 2023, ECF 22, and Defendant  filed a Reply on July 11, 2023, ECF 25. On August 10,  2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority.  ECF 29. Before this Court is Defendant Summit Hotel's Motion to  Dismiss. ECF 17. For the following reasons, this Court  GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's  complaint for failure state a claim. Accordingly, as  Plaintiff's sole claim against Defendant is dismissed, this  Court DENIES as moot Defendant's motion to strike.                      Page 2 of 6 LEGAL STANDARDS A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim may be  granted only when there is no cognizable legal theory to  support the claim or when the complaint lacks sufficient  factual allegations to state a facially plausible claim for  relief. Shroyer v. New Cingular Wireless Servs., Inc.,  622 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir. 2010). In evaluating the  sufficiency of a complaint's factual allegations, the court  must accept as true all well-pleaded material facts  alleged in the complaint and construe them in the light  most favorable [*3]  to the non-moving party. See  Daniels-Hall v. Nat'l Educ. Ass'n, 629 F.3d 992, 998 (9th  Cir. 2010). To be entitled to a presumption of truth,  allegations in a complaint ""may not simply recite the  elements of a cause of action, but must contain  sufficient allegations of underlying facts to give fair  notice and to enable the opposing party to defend itself  effectively."" Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1216 (9th Cir.  2011). The court must draw all reasonable inferences  from the factual allegations in favor of the plaintiff.  Newcal Indus., Inc. v. Ikon Office Sol., 513 F.3d 1038,  1043 n.2 (9th Cir. 2008). The court need not, however,  credit the plaintiff's legal conclusions that are couched  as factual allegations. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,  678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). A complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations to  ""plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief, such that it is  not unfair to require the opposing party to be subjected  to the expense of discovery and continued litigation.""  Starr, 652 F.3d at 1216. ""A claim has facial plausibility  when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the  court to draw the reasonable inference that the  defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged."" Iqbal,  556 U.S. at 678 (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550  U.S. 544, 556, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929  (2007)). ""The plausibility standard is not akin to a  probability requirement, but it asks for more than a  sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.""  Mashiri v. Epsten Grinnell & Howell, 845 F.3d 984, 988  (9th Cir. 2017) (quotation marks omitted) (quoting Iqbal,            556 U.S. at 678). BACKGROUND The following facts are taken from the complaint, [*4]   and are accepted as true, for purposes of this motion.  Plaintiff was 22 years old when she was first trafficked in  Oregon. ECF 1 at ¶ 5. Beginning in September 2012  through March 2013, Plaintiff alleges she was sold by  her trafficker for sex at the Shilo Inn Salem and  Residence  Inn  Portland  Airport  (""Residence  Inn  Portland""). Id. at ¶¶ 26, 28, 44. A. Plaintiff's Trafficking at the Residence Inn  Portland Defendant Summit Hotel owns and operates the  Residence Inn Portland. Id. at ¶ 15. While at the  Residence Inn Portland, Plaintiff was sold by her  trafficker to at least seven ""clients""—otherwise referred  to as ""buyers""—per night. Id. at ¶ 47. Plaintiff's trafficker  would book her at the Residence Inn Portland anywhere  from one to four nights at a time. Id. at ¶ 48. Plaintiff was  placed at the hotel up to two times in the same month,  for approximately six to twelve stays over four to five  months. Id. Plaintiff alleges that she was trafficked there  from February 28, 2013 through March 2, 2013; March  11, 2013 through March 12, 2013, and March 19, 2013  through March 21, 2013. Id. Plaintiff was trafficked to  ""clients"" through internet advertisements for commercial  sex posted on the following [*5]  dates: December 16,  2012; December 19, 2012; December 26, 2012;  February 5, 2013; February 7, 2013; February 19, 2013;  and February 25, 2013 through February 27, 2013. Id.  at ¶ 46. Plaintiff alleges that during the seven-month period  during which she was trafficked, there were ""obvious  signs"" of Plaintiff being sex trafficked at the Residence  Inn Portland. Id. at ¶ 61. These signs of sex trafficking  included  Plaintiff's  lack  of  eye  contact  and  malnourishment, the rental of a room with cash or debit  by a man for a woman who did not enter the hotel at the  same time, and constant foot traffic to and from  Plaintiff's room. Id. In addition, Plaintiff's room exhibited  signs of commercial sex work: used condoms in the  trash, bottles of lubricants, boxes of condoms, and  excessive requests for towels and linens. Id. at ¶¶ 61,  111. Plaintiff alleges that her trafficker always booked the  rooms directly from the front desk using a Residence  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143289, *2 Page 3 of 6 Inn Portland employee's discount card, although her  trafficker was not an employee and that data was  allegedly known to Defendant via the central reservation  system. Id. at ¶¶ 49, 51. After booking the room, her  trafficker would get two keys and take one key [*6]  to  Plaintiff, who would be waiting in the car. Id. at ¶ 49.  After waiting in the car while her trafficker checked in,  Plaintiff would walk to the hotel room by herself, without  ever having registered as a guest. Id. While Plaintiff was  with ""buyers,"" Plaintiff's trafficker used hotel wi-fi to post  advertisements, set up ""dates,"" and record Plaintiff's  sexual acts. Id. at ¶ 52. Plaintiff alleges that such  recordings would have signaled large amounts of data  usage identifiable to the hotel. Id. at ¶ 53. Plaintiff encountered the same hotel staff over the  course of the time she was trafficked on the property. Id.  at ¶ 60. Despite the alleged use of surveillance cameras  throughout the hotel, no help or attention was given to  Plaintiff by any hotel staff. Id. at ¶ 59. At an unspecified  time, Plaintiff and her trafficker were arrested on  property while registered guests. Id. at ¶ 58. B. Defendant's Alleged Knowledge of Sex  Trafficking In her complaint, Plaintiff highlights the intersection of  the sex trafficking and hotel industries, asserting that  hotels play a ""crucial role in the sex trade"" by offering  anonymity and non-traceability to those involved in sex  trafficking. Id. at ¶¶ 65, 67. [*7]  As a result, Plaintiff  alleges that, in addition to implementing anti-trafficking  policies, ""[t]raining hotel staff to identify the signs of sex  trafficking and sexual exploitation is a critical and  obvious legal obligation for Defendant[]."" Id. at ¶¶ 66,  123-24. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant, as a hotel  owner and operator, was ""cognizant of [its] role and  responisbilt[y] in the sex trafficking industry for years.""  Id. at ¶ 84. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant was apprised of  instances of sex trafficking at the Residence Inn  Portland. Id. at ¶ 91. Plaintiff references three online  reviews of the hotel ranging from 2017 to 2022, which  describe a gang shooting, lack of cleanliness, evidence  of drug use, theft, and general criminal activity. Id. at ¶  93. Plaintiff asserts that ""online reviews similar to those  outlined above provided Defendant with actual and/or  constructive knowledge of sex trafficking, commercial  sex, forced prostitution, and the foreseeable risk of sex  trafficking at the Residence Inn Portland."" Id. at ¶ 94. DISCUSSION A. Anonymity Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  10(a) This Court first addresses Plaintiff's request for  anonymity under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(a).  ECF 1 at ¶ 13. Due to Plaintiff's status as a victim [*8]   of sex trafficking and the ""sensitive nature"" of the  allegations in this case, Plaintiff seeks leave of this  Court to proceed under the pseudonym ""A.B."" Id. Under  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(a), a complaint must  ""name all the parties."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(a). ""In this  circuit, we allow parties to use pseudonyms in the  'unusual case' when nondisclosure of the party's identity  is necessary . . . to protect a person from harassment,  injury, ridicule or personal embarrassment."" Does I thru  XXIII v. Advanced Textile Corp., 214 F.3d 1058, 1067- 68 (9th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks and citation  omitted). ""[A] party may preserve his or her anonymity in  judicial proceedings in special circumstances when the  party's need for anonymity outweighs prejudice to the  opposing party and the public's interest in knowing the  party's identity."" Id. at 1068. The Ninth Circuit does not  require  a  plaintiff  to  obtain  leave  to  proceed  anonymously before filing an anonymous pleading. A.B.  v. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., 484 F. Supp. 3d 921,  945 (D. Or. 2020) (citation omitted). Because this Court  finds the need for anonymity outweighs any prejudice to  the Defendants and the public, this Court grants leave  for Plaintiff to proceed under the pseudonym ""A.B."" in  this case. B. TVPRA Claim Defendant Summit Hotel moves to dismiss Plaintiff's  complaint, arguing that Plaintiff has not stated a claim  for relief under the TVPRA [*9]  because Plaintiff has  failed to name the proper party and has not sufficiently  alleged the elements of a TVPRA claim. ECF 17 at 3-4.         2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143289, *5 Page 4 of 6 As an initial matter, this Court addresses Defendant's  argument that Plaintiff's claim fails because Plaintiff has  not named the proper party. Defendant contends that it  only leases the Residence Inn Portland, while an  unnamed operating company manages and operates  the Residence Inn Portland through a franchise  agreement. Id. at 3. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff has  failed to allege facts that Defendant, as a building  lessee and brand franchisee, is directly liable for  Plaintiff's alleged injuries under the TVPRA. Id. at 3-4.  However, Defendant has failed to provide any evidence  of its management structure in support of its motion.  Moreover, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Summit Hotel  is the ""hotel owner, operator, manager, and supervisor""  and that it ""controls all training, procedures, and policies  for the Residence Inn Portland."" ECF 1 at ¶ 15. For the  purposes of this motion, this Court accepts as true the  facts as alleged by Plaintiff in the complaint and  evaluates Defendant's motion on the merits accordingly.  See Daniels-Hall, 629 F.3d at 998. This Court next addresses [*10]  the merits of Plaintiff's  TVPRA claim. The TVPRA provides a private right of  civil action for victims of sex trafficking. Ditullio v.  Boehm, 662 F.3d 1091, 1094 (9th Cir. 2011). Section  1591 of the TVPRA defines sex trafficking as  commercial sex activity either involving a minor or  where ""force, threats of force, fraud, coercion . . . , or  any combination of such means [is] used to cause [a]  person to engage in a commercial sex act."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a). In outlining the private right of civil action for  victims, Section 1595 provides that victims: may bring a civil action against the perpetrator (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  or  attempts  or  conspires to benefit, financially or by receiving  anything of value from participation in a venture  which that person knew or should have known has  engaged in an act in violation of this chapter) in an  appropriate district court of the United States and  may recover damages and reasonable attorney  fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) (emphasis added). As such, the  statute affords a civil remedy both against individuals  who  directly  perpetrate  trafficking  and  against  individuals who financially benefit from participation in  the trafficking venture. Ditullio, 662 F.3d at 1094 n.1. As  a remedial statute, courts construe this statute liberally.  A.B. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 532 F. Supp.    3d 1018, 1024 (D. Or. 2021). Plaintiff brings a direct liability claim against Defendant  Summit Hotel [*11]  under a financial beneficiary theory.  To state a financial beneficiary claim under Section  1595(a), Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court  can reasonably infer that Defendant (1) knowingly  benefited financially (2) from ""participation in a venture""  (3) that Defendant ""knew or should have known""  engaged in sex trafficking as defined in 18 U.S.C. §  1591. J.C. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., No. 20-CV-00155- WHO, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL  6318707, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 28, 2020) (citation  omitted); see id. Defendant does not dispute the first  element,  that  Defendant  knowingly  benefited  financially. However, Defendant argues that Plaintiff  fails to plead facts sufficient to establish that Defendant  participated in a venture or knew or should have known  of its participation in a venture engaged in sex  trafficking. This Court addresses each argument in turn. 1. Participation in a Venture Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint,  arguing that Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently plead that  Defendant ""participated in a venture"" that was engaged  in sex trafficking. ""[T]he phrase 'participation in a  venture' requires [a plaintiff] to 'allege that the  [defendant] took part in a common undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit.'"" Doe #1 v.  Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 725 (11th Cir. 2021);  see also J.M. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., No.  222CV00672KJMJDP, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190054,  2022 WL 10626493, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 18, 2022). To  satisfy the ""participation"" element of a civil TVPRA  claim, Plaintiff [*12]  need not allege that Defendant had  actual knowledge of a venture engaged in trafficking by  ""force, threats of force, fraud, [or] coercion"" or that  Defendant performed an overt act in furtherance of the  venture. A.B., 532 F. Supp. 3d at 1025; see 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a); cf. Does 1-6 v. Reddit, Inc., 51 F.4th 1137,  1141 (9th Cir. 2022) (observing that TVPRA's criminal  standard is ""higher"" than the civil standard and requires          2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143289, *9 Page 5 of 6 actual knowledge). However, ""[i]n the absence of direct  association with traffickers, [Plaintiff] must 'allege at  least a showing of a continuous business relationship  between the trafficker and [Defendant] such that it would  appear that the trafficker and [Defendant] have  established a pattern of conduct or could be said to  have a tacit agreement.'"" Doe v. Mindgeek USA Inc.,  558 F. Supp. 3d 828, 837 (C.D. Cal. 2021) (citations  omitted). This Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to plausibly  establish Defendant's participation in a venture engaged  in sex trafficking. Plaintiff alleges that ""[t]here was a  continuous business relationship through the rental of  rooms between Plaintiff's traffickers, Defendants . . . . ,  and the hotels they operated and owned."" ECF 1 at ¶  117. In alleging this business relationship, Plaintiff  asserts  that  Defendant  knowingly  or  negligently  provided lodging to her trafficker, as well and lodging  and anonymity [*13]  to ""buyers."" Id. at ¶ 118. However,  Plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to establish a  tacit agreement between Defendant and Plaintiff's  trafficker, that the venture would involve commercial sex  activity by ""force, threats of force, fraud, [or] coercion,""  as required for relief under the TVPRA. See 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a). Plaintiff alleges that the ""the Residence Inn Portland  employees openly observed signs of [sex] trafficking  [and] did not aid Plaintiff."" ECF 1 at ¶ 92. For example,  Plaintiff plausibly alleges the following indicators of  commercial sex activity: bottles of lubricants, boxes of  condoms, used condoms in the trash, excessive request  for towels and linens, room rentals by Plaintiff's trafficker  with cash or debit, room rental by a man for a woman  who did not enter the hotel at the same time, and  consistent foot traffic to Plaintiff's room. Id. at ¶ 61.  Plaintiff claims that the Residence Inn Portland had  numerous surveillance cameras throughout the hotel  displaying ""unusual and suspicious"" behavior. Id. at ¶  59. Although Plaintiff encountered the same hotel staff  over the period in which she was trafficked, ""no help or  attention was given to [Plaintiff] by any hotel staff.""  Id. [*14]  at ¶¶ 59-60. In considering these allegations,  this Court notes that Plaintiff fails to allege facts to  establish that any particular Residence Inn employee  witnessed these signs or was otherwise aware of  Plaintiff's trafficking. Although Plaintiff plausibly alleges      indicia of commercial sex activity, when the victim is an  adult, Section 1591 only provides a remedy for  commercial sex activity involving ""force, threats of force,  fraud, [or] coercion."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Because  these allegations alone are not sufficient for this Court to  conclude that Defendant ever witnessed signs of  commercial sex activity by ""force, threats of force, fraud,  [or] coercion,"" as opposed to commercial sex activity  generally, these facts do not establish Defendant's  participation in a venture engaged in sex trafficking  under the TVPRA. Plaintiff also alleges that her trafficker would book  rooms at the hotel with a Residence Inn Portland  employee's discount card without being an employee,  which Plaintiff asserts was data known to Defendant  through the central reservation system. Id. at ¶¶ 49, 51.  While Plaintiff was with a ""buyer,"" Plaintiff's trafficker  would often use the hotel's wi-fi to record the sex acts  taking place inside the [*15]  room, which would have  signaled large amounts of data usage identifiable by the  hotel. Id. at ¶¶ 52-53. Plaintiff further alleges that  Defendant ""failed or refused to require any human  trafficking training despite knowing that trafficking was  occurring at [the Residence Inn Portland]."" Id. at ¶ 15.  Plaintiff seems to suggest by these allegations that  Defendant had an affirmative duty to monitor hotel  systems for indicators of trafficking or provide training to  employees. However, ""the TVPRA does not impose an  affirmative duty to police and prevent sex trafficking.""  A.B., 532 F. Supp. 3d at 1027. Accordingly, this Court  finds that these facts as pled also do not amount to  participation under the TVPRA. Accordingly, this Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to  allege  facts  sufficient  to  establish  Defendant's  participation in a venture engaged in sex trafficking by  force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion. 2. Actual or Constructive Knowledge Defendant Summit Hotel also moves to dismiss  Plaintiff's complaint by arguing that Plaintiff has failed to  sufficiently plead that Defendant ""knew or should have  known"" of its participation in a venture engaged in sex  trafficking. To establish the knowledge element of her  TVPRA [*16]  claim, Plaintiff need only assert facts  supporting Defendant's constructive knowledge of the  venture in which it allegedly participated, i.e., that    2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143289, *12 Page 6 of 6 Defendant ""rented rooms to people [it] knew or should  have known were engaging in sex trafficking."" B.J. v. G6  Hosp., LLC, No. 22-CV-03765-MMC, 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 88180, 2023 WL 3569979, at *5 (N.D. Cal. May  19, 2023) (citation omitted). In alleging Defendant's knowledge, Plaintiff likewise  relies on the indicators of Plaintiff's sex trafficking  outlined above—including the use of an employee  discount and signs of commercial sex activity in the  room—to argue that Defendant had personal knowledge  of Plaintiff's sex trafficking. Highlighting the intersection  of sex trafficking and the hotel industry writ large,  Plaintiff further asserts that Defendant has been  generally ""cognizant of [its] role and responsibilit[y] in  the sex trafficking industry for years."" ECF 1 at ¶ 84.  Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant has been aware of  sex trafficking occurring on-site at the Residence Inn  Portland. Id. at ¶ 91. Plaintiff points to a number of hotel  reviews of the property, which include allegations of a  gang shooting, drug use, and theft on-site. Id. at ¶ 93.  Plaintiff alleges that similar online reviews provided  Defendant with actual or constructive knowledge [*17]   of sex trafficking at the Residence Inn Portland. Id. at ¶  94. These allegations, even when viewed in the light most  favorable to Plaintiff, fall short of plausibly alleging  Defendant knew or should have known of its  participation in a venture engaged in sex trafficking.  Plaintiff has failed to allege that any hotel employees  witnessed the above-described indicators of Plaintiff's  trafficking or were otherwise on notice of commercial  sex activity by ""force, threats of force, fraud, [or]  coercion,"" as opposed to commercial sex activity  generally. See 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Absent such  allegations,  Plaintiff  fails  to  plausibly  establish  Defendant ""should have known"" of Plaintiff's trafficking.  Moreover,  general  knowledge  of  sex  trafficking  occurring at hotels across the United States is  insufficient on its own to establish knowledge under the  TVPRA. See A.B., 484 F. Supp. 3d at 938. Finally,  although Plaintiff highlights various allegations of  criminal activity in reviews of the Residence Inn  Portland, Plaintiff fails to cite to a single review which  includes a report of sex trafficking or a review posted  prior to the period of Plaintiff's trafficking. This Court  finds that Plaintiff has failed to plausibly allege  Defendant's actual [*18]  or constructive knowledge of  its participation in a venture engaged in sex trafficking. Plaintiff has not alleged facts sufficient to state a  financial  beneficiary  claim  under  the  TVPRA.  Accordingly, this Court GRANTS Defendants' motion to  dismiss Plaintiff's TVPRA claim against Defendant with  leave to amend."
"A.D. v. Best Western Int_l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150376.pdf","OPINION AND ORDER This matter comes before the Court on review of defendant Apex Hospitality LLLP's Motion to Dismiss Second  Amended Complaint, Motion for More Definite Statement, and Motion to Strike (Doc. #45) and Best Western  International, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint and Motion to Strike (Doc. #46) filed  on May 19, 2023. Plaintiff filed a Consolidated Response in Opposition (Doc. #53) on June 26, 2023. Both  defendants filed Replies. [*2]  (Docs. ##54, 55.) Plaintiff filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority (Doc. #55) on  August 8, 2023. I. On April 14, 2023, the Court granted in part defendants' motions to dismiss with leave to file an Amended  Complaint. A.D. v. Best W. Int'l, Inc., No. 2:22-CV-651-JES-NPM, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65972, 2023 WL 2955712  (M.D. Fla. Apr. 14, 2023). On May 5, 2023, plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (Doc. #44) and defendants  have now essentially renewed their motions to dismiss. Page 2 of 6 Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a Complaint must contain a ""short and plain statement of the claim  showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This obligation ""requires more than labels and  conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,  550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion  to dismiss, the Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most  favorable to plaintiff, Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal  conclusions without adequate factual support are entitled to no assumption of truth,"" Mamani v. Berzaín, 654 F.3d  1148, 1153 (11th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). Plaintiff's (second) amended complaint is brought pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act  (TVPRA). As previously stated, The TVPRA is a criminal statute that also provides a civil remedy to victims of sex trafficking. Section 1591(a)  of the Act imposes criminal liability [*3]  for certain sex trafficking: (a) Whoever knowingly-- (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the  United States, recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains, patronizes, or  solicits by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture which has engaged in  an act described in violation of paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting the violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless disregard  of the fact, that means of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion described in subsection (e)(2), or any  combination of such means will be used to cause the person to engage in a commercial sex act, or that the  person has not attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act, shall be  punished as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C.A. § 1591(a). In addition to a criminal punishment, the TVPRA provides the following civil remedy: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this chapter may bring a civil action against the perpetrator (or  whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a venture [*4]   which that person knew or should have known has engaged in an act in violation of this chapter) in an  appropriate district court of the United States and may recover damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Thus, the TVRPA authorizes a victim of sex trafficking to bring a direct civil claim against the perpetrator of the  trafficking and a ""beneficiary"" civil claim against ""whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving  anything of value from participation in a venture which that person knew or should have known has engaged in  an act in violation of [the TVPRA]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). To state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA, Plaintiff must plausibly allege that the defendant ""(1) knowingly benefited (2) from participating in a  venture; (3) that venture violated the TVPRA as to [A.D.]; and (4) [Defendants] knew or should have known that  the venture violated the TVPRA as to [A.D.]."" Doe v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 726 (11th Cir. 2021). A.D. v. Best W. Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65972, [WL] at *1-2. The Court will consider each of the elements  as applied to the amended pleading. II. The operative amended complaint alleges the following: Defendant Best Western knows and has known for years  that sex trafficking and prostitution occur at their branded hotel locations. Defendant Apex also knows and [*5]  has  known for years of both occurring specifically at the Best Western Fort Myers Inn and Suites (BW Ft. Myers Hotel).  (Doc. #44, ¶¶ 2-3.) This action for damages is brought by the Plaintiff, identified by her initials A.D., a survivor of  sex trafficking under the TVPRA. (Id. at ¶ 12.) 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150376, *2 Page 3 of 6 ""With knowledge of the problem, and as a direct and proximate result of Defendants' multiple failures and refusals  to act, mandate, establish, execute, and/or modify their anti-trafficking efforts at the BW Ft. Myers Hotel, A.D. was  continuously sex trafficked, sexually exploited, and victimized repeatedly at the BW Ft. Myers Hotel."" (Id. at ¶ 17.)  Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel operating venture and knowingly benefited from this venture  through room rentals, profits, third party fees, and the value of the ""good will"" of the Best Western® brand. The  venture knew or should have known that they were profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking of A.D.,  in violation of the TVPRA."" (Id. at ¶ 18.) Plaintiff further alleges that Best Western and Apex participated in a hotel operating venture that included staff at  the BW Ft. Myers Hotel. Apex owns the BW Ft. Myers [*6]  Hotel pursuant to a membership agreement entered into  with Best Western. Plaintiff alleges an agency relationship through Best Western's exercise of ongoing and  systemic right to control over BW Ft. Myers Hotel. (Id. at ¶¶ 29-32.) Best Western makes decisions that directly  impact the operations and maintenance of BW Ft. Myers Hotel. (Id. at ¶ 40.) Apex directly offered public lodging  services at the BW Ft. Myers Hotel where A.D. was trafficked for sex. (Id. at ¶ 56.) During at least 2010 to 2012, emails were exchanged by employees of Best Western that related to sex trafficking  in hotels, and Apex held meetings through trade organizations on the issue. (Id. at ¶¶ 64-65.) Best Western had  actual and/or constructive knowledge of sex trafficking, including A.D.'s sex trafficking and victimization, at BW Ft.  Myers Hotel and it failed to ""implement and enforce any of its own policy or policies and protect Plaintiff A.D. from  being sex trafficked"", and failed to take action to prevent trafficking. (Id. at ¶ 69.) ""Defendants and their employees and staff consistently rented rooms to A.D. and her traffickers despite obvious red  flags and indicators of sex trafficking and suspicious activity, [*7]  thereby participating in a venture that knew or  should have known violated the TVPRA."" (Id., ¶ 106.) No one at the corporate level used surveillance and security  to prevent the sex trafficking of A.D. from occurring at the BW Ft. Myers Hotel. (Id., ¶ 110.) Apex employees and staff openly observed signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. Apex received revenue and  a percentage was provided to Best Western. (Id., ¶ 118.) Through Best Western's relationship with the staff at the  BW Ft. Myers Hotel, it benefited or received royalty payments, licensing fees, membership fees and dues,  reservation fees, and percentages of the gross room revenue. (Id., ¶ 119.) Plaintiff alleges that defendants benefit  from the steady stream of income that sex traffickers bring to their hotel brands and from their reputation for privacy,  discretion, and the facilitation of commercial sex. (Id., ¶¶ 130-131.) Plaintiff alleges that defendants maintained their  deficiencies and knowingly benefited by maximizing profits by reducing the cost of training employees on how to  spot human trafficking. (Id., ¶ 133.) III. As previously stated, plaintiff must sufficiently plead that a defendant knowingly benefited from [*8]  participating in  a venture, that the venture violated the TVPRA, and that defendants knew or should have known that the venture  violated the TVPRA. A. Knowingly Benefited To satisfy the first element of a TVPRA beneficiary claim, plaintiff must allege that defendant ""knew it was receiving  some value from participating in the alleged venture."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. As the Eleventh Circuit  stated, ""Knowingly benefits"" means ""an awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of mind in which  a person has no substantial doubt about the existence of a fact."" Knowledge, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed.  2019). And Section 1595(a) explains that a defendant may benefit ""financially or by receiving anything of  value."" Accordingly, a plaintiff like the Does must allege that the defendant knew it was receiving some value  from participating in the alleged venture. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150376, *5 Page 4 of 6 Id. at 723-24. In the absence of a more stringent statutory pleading requirement, knowledge ""may be alleged  generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Alleging a ""continuous business relationship"" is sufficient to show a knowing  benefit. G.G. v. Salesforce.Com, Inc., No. 22-2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *16 (7th  Cir. Aug. 3, 2023). The Court previously found this element could be satisfied at this stage of the proceedings. A.D.  v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68586, [WL] at *6. B. Participation in Venture - Franchisor Plaintiff must allege that the [*9]  benefits received by Best Western were from ""participation in a venture"" which  defendants knew or should have known has engaged in an act in violation of the TVPRA. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). The  Eleventh Circuit rejected the statutory definition of ""participation in a venture"" found in the criminal provision, §  1591(e)(4), which defined ""participation in a venture"" as ""knowingly assisting, supporting or facilitating a violation of  subsection (a)(1)."" Instead, the Eleventh Circuit held that ""participation in a venture"" in the civil context requires that  plaintiff allege that the franchisor ""took part in a common undertaking or enterprise involving risk and potential  profit."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel operating venture and knowingly benefited from this venture  through room rentals, profits, third party fees, and the value of the ""good will"" of the Best Western® brand. The  venture knew or should have known that they were profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking of A.D.,  in violation of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #44, ¶ 18.) Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel operating  venture"" in connection with BW Ft. Myers Hotel for potential profit. (Id. at ¶ 59.) Plaintiff alleges [*10]  that Best  Western had actual and/or constructive knowledge of sex trafficking, including A.D.'s sex trafficking and  victimization, at BW Ft. Myers Hotel and it ""failed to implement and enforce any of its own policy or policies and  protect Plaintiff A.D. from being sex trafficked"", failed to take action to prevent trafficking so that it could continue to  profit, and failed to address the open and obvious presence of human trafficking on hotel properties. (Id. at ¶ 69.)  Best Western is alleged to have demonstrated actual and/or constructive knowledge of the ""rampant culture of sex  trafficking"" at their properties around the country, including through news stories and online reviews. (Id. at ¶¶ 71- 72.) These additional facts in the Second Amended Complaint do not remedy the problem in the original pleading as to  Best Western. ""[A]s the Eleventh Circuit has acknowledged, the alleged venture can be a 'commercial venture' like  running or expanding a business. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22-2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023  WL 4944015, at *6 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023) (citing Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 727 (emphasis added)). However,  as before, ""[t]he 'participation' in the sex trafficking venture is essentially that the franchisor and the hotel operator  did not fight hard enough to keep these traffickers from using their hotel. [*11]  The Complaint acknowledges that  Defendants opposed sex traffickers, but fault defendants for taking ineffective steps to curtail the traffickers. This  hardly sounds like participating in a venture."" A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68586, [WL] at  *7. The Court finds that Best Western must be dismissed because the Second Amended Complaint does not  sufficiently plead that it participated in a sex trafficking venture beyond participation in shared revenue as part of its  normal role as a franchisor. See A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., No. 2:22-CV-648-JES-NPM, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  68586, 2023 WL 3004547, at *4 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 19, 2023) (collecting cases). C. Participation in Venture - Franchisee ""In order to plead Defendants participated in a venture, Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court could  reasonably infer the hotels 'could be said to have a tacit agreement' with the trafficker. Plaintiff need not show that  defendants had actual knowledge of the participation in the sex-trafficking venture."" Doe v. Rickey Patel, LLC, No.  0:20-60683-WPD-CIV, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 30, 2020) (citation  omitted). In other words, plaintiff can show a ""continuous business relationship"" to show participation. J.G. v.  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150376, *8 Page 5 of 6 Northbrook Indus., Inc., 619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1235 (N.D. Ga. 2022); S. Y. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 519  F. Supp. 3d 1069, 1081 (M.D. Fla. 2021). As to Apex, the 'participation' is based upon the relationship between the traffickers and the hotel. The fact that  Trafficker 2 spent all day loitering around the parking lot without consequences and that a ""procession of men"" who  were not registered [*12]  guests were openly going into a room support participation in the venture. (Id. at ¶¶ 88,  90.) ""Defendants and their employees and staff consistently rented rooms to A.D. and her traffickers despite  obvious red flags and indicators of sex trafficking and suspicious activity, thereby participating in a venture that  knew or should have known violated the TVPRA."" (Id. at ¶ 106.) These facts at least plausibly infer that employees  of Apex were participating in an enterprise involving risk and knowingly benefiting from the risk. Red Roof Inns, Inc.,  21 F.4th at 725 (citing Ricchio v. McLean, 853 F.3d 553, 556-58 (1st Cir. 2017) (agreeing with First Circuit that an  operator's association with traffickers to serve a business objective establishes participation in a venture with a sex  trafficker). D. Knowledge This element requires the plaintiff to allege that the defendant had either actual or constructive knowledge that the  venture violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff. Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Knowledge requires an awareness or  understanding of a fact or circumstance, while constructive knowledge is knowledge that one should have 'using  reasonable care or diligence'. Id. (citing Black's Law Dictionary). The 'red flags' supporting knowledge include payments in cash, large amounts of used condoms and bodily [*13]   fluids on the sheets and towels, A.D.'s physical appearance, excessive requests for sheets and cleaning services,  the personal relationship between the front desk employees, manager, and A.D.'s traffickers, and the direct  employee encounters with A.D. and her traffickers inside BW Ft. Myers Hotel. (Doc. #44, ¶ 111.) Apex employees  and staff openly observed signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. Instead, Apex profited from the rooms rented  by her traffickers or at the direction of her traffickers. (Id. at ¶ 118.) Plaintiff alleges a continuous business venture.  (Id. at ¶ 121.) The facts supporting something other than simple observations are: (1) ""The personal relationship  between the front desk employees, manager, and A.D.'s traffickers;"" and (2) ""The direct employee encounters with  A.D. and her traffickers inside BW Ft. Myers Hotel."" (Id. at ¶ 111.) In terms of constructive knowledge, reviews  specific to BW Ft. Myers reflect comments about the absence of security, ""shady people hanging out in the parking  lot"", and ""at midnight there were woman screaming and ppl partying in the parking lot and the front desk didn't even  hear it. Ridiculous."" (Id. at ¶ 72.) The Court finds these [*14]  facts are sufficient to plausibly allege knowledge at this stage of the proceedings. An  overt or direct act is not required. See, e.g., K.H. v. Riti, Inc., No. 1:22-CV-3404-MHC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  93374, 2023 WL 3644224, at *4 (N.D. Ga.

LEXIS 150380.pdf","OPINION AND ORDER This matter comes before the Court on review of defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss  Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (Doc. #56) filed on June 1, 2023, and R & M Real Estate Company, Inc.,  Robert Vocisano, and Mario Vocisano's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (Doc. #57) filed  on June 7, 2023. Plaintiff filed a Consolidated Response in Opposition (Doc. #62) on July 3, 2023. Both defendants  filed Replies. (Docs. ## 65, 66.) Plaintiff [*2]  filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority (Doc. #67) on August 8, 2023. I. On April 19, 2023, the Court granted in part defendants' motions to dismiss with leave to file an Amended  Complaint. A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., No. 2:22-CV-646-JES-NPM, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68588, 2023 WL  3004545, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 19, 2023). On May 10, 2023, plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (Doc. #50)  and defendants have now essentially renewed their motions to dismiss. Page 2 of 6 Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a Complaint must contain a ""short and plain statement of the claim  showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This obligation ""requires more than labels and  conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,  550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion  to dismiss, the Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most  favorable to plaintiff, Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal  conclusions without adequate factual support are entitled to no assumption of truth,"" Mamani v. Berzaín, 654 F.3d  1148, 1153 (11th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). Plaintiff's (second) amended complaint is brought pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act  (TVPRA). As previously stated, The TVPRA is a criminal statute that also provides a civil remedy to victims of sex trafficking. Section 1591(a)  of the Act imposes criminal liability for certain sex trafficking: [*3]  (a) Whoever knowingly-- (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the  United States, recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains, patronizes, or  solicits by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture which has engaged in  an act described in violation of paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting the violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless disregard  of the fact, that means of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion described in subsection (e)(2), or any  combination of such means will be used to cause the person to engage in a commercial sex act, or that the  person has not attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act, shall be  punished as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C.A. § 1591(a). In addition to a criminal punishment, the TVPRA provides the following civil remedy: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this chapter may bring a civil action against the perpetrator (or  whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a venture which  that person knew or [*4]  should have known has engaged in an act in violation of this chapter) in an  appropriate district court of the United States and may recover damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Thus, the TVRPA authorizes a victim of sex trafficking to bring a direct civil claim against the perpetrator of the  trafficking and a ""beneficiary"" civil claim against ""whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving  anything of value from participation in a venture which that person knew or should have known has engaged in  an act in violation of [the TVPRA]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). To state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA, Plaintiff must plausibly allege that the defendant ""(1) knowingly benefited (2) from participating in a  venture; (3) that venture violated the TVPRA as to [A.D.]; and (4) [Defendants] knew or should have known that  the venture violated the TVPRA as to [A.D.].""

The Court will consider each of the  elements as applied to the amended pleading. II. The operative amended complaint alleges the following: Defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc. (Choice Hotels)  knows and has known for years that sex trafficking and prostitution occur at their branded hotel locations.  Defendants R&M Real [*5]  Estate Company, Inc., Robert Vocisano, and Mario Vocisano (R&M Real Estate  collectively) also know and have known for years of both occurring specifically at the Comfort Inn & Executive  Suites Naples (Comfort Inn). (Doc. #50, ¶¶ 2-3.) This action for damages is brought by the Plaintiff, identified by her  initials A.D., a survivor of sex trafficking under the TVPRA. (Id. at ¶ 12.) 2023 U.S. Dist.

(Id. at ¶ 18.)  Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel operating venture and knowingly benefited from this venture  through room rentals, profits, third party fees, and the value of the ""good will"" of the Choice® brand. The venture  knew or should have known that they were profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking of A.D., in  violation of the TVPRA."" (Id. at ¶ 19.) Plaintiff further alleges that Choice Hotels and R&M Real Estate participated in [*6]  a hotel operating venture that  included staff at the Comfort Inn. R&M Real Estate owns the Comfort Inn pursuant to a franchise agreement  entered into with Choice Hotels. Plaintiff alleges an agency relationship through Choice Hotels' ""exercise of ongoing  and systemic right of control over the Comfort Inn hotel."" (Id. at ¶¶ 29-32.) Choice Hotels makes decisions that  directly impact the operations and maintenance of their branded hotels, including the Comfort Inn. (Id. at ¶ 39.)  R&M Real Estate directly offered public lodging services at the Comfort Inn where A.D. was trafficked for sex. (Id. at  ¶ 49.) Defendants ""participated in a hotel operating venture in connection with the management and operating of  the Comfort Inn hotel involving risk and potential profit."" (Id. at ¶ 52.) During at least 2008 to 2012, emails were exchanged by employees of Choice Hotels that related to sex trafficking  in hotels, including the Comfort Inn. (Id. at ¶ 57.) Choice Hotels had actual and/or constructive knowledge of sex  trafficking, including A.D.'s sex trafficking and victimization, occurring on its branded property. (Id. at ¶ 63.) Choice  Hotels continued to permit and profit from male clientele who [*7]  rented hotel rooms to buy sex despite having  access to sex trafficking indicators. (Id. at ¶ 75.) In 2017, a reviewer described the Comfort Inn as having prostitutes  hanging out in the parking lot at night. (Id. at ¶ 79e.) In 2020, another reviewed the Comfort Inn noting that it was  known for drugs and prostitution and that the owner knows it means money ""coming into his degenerate  establishments."" (Id. at ¶ 79j.) Choice Hotels monitors customer reviews. (Id. at ¶ 81.) R&M Real Estate employees and staff openly observed signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. R&M Real  Estate received revenue and a percentage was provided to Choice Hotels. (Id. at ¶ 108.) Through Choice Hotels'  relationship with the staff at the Comfort Inn, it benefited or received royalty payments, licensing fees, membership  fees and dues, reservation fees, and percentages of the gross room revenue. (Id. at ¶ 109.) Through their  ""continuous business venture of renting hotel rooms"", R&M Real Estate knowingly benefited. (Id. at ¶ 111.) Plaintiff  alleges that defendants benefit from the steady stream of income that sex traffickers bring to their hotel brands and  from their reputation for privacy, discretion, and [*8]  the facilitation of commercial sex. (Id., ¶¶ 120-121.) III. As previously stated, plaintiff must sufficiently plead that a defendant knowingly benefited from participating in a  venture, that the venture violated the TVPRA, and that defendants knew or should have known that the venture  violated the TVPRA. A. Knowingly Benefited To satisfy the first element of a TVPRA beneficiary claim, plaintiff must allege that defendant ""knew it was receiving  some value from participating in the alleged venture."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. As the Eleventh Circuit  stated, ""Knowingly benefits"" means ""an awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of mind in which  a person has no substantial doubt about the existence of a fact."" Knowledge, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed.  2019). And Section 1595(a) explains that a defendant may benefit ""financially or by receiving anything of  value."" Accordingly, a plaintiff like the Does must allege that the defendant knew it was receiving some value  from participating in the alleged venture. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150380, *5 Page 4 of 6 Id. at 723-24. In the absence of a more stringent statutory pleading requirement, knowledge ""may be alleged  generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Alleging a ""continuous business relationship"" is sufficient to show a knowing  benefit. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22-2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *16 (7th  Cir. Aug. 3, 2023). The Court [*9]  previously found this element could be satisfied at this stage of the proceedings.  A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68588, [WL] at *3. B. Participation in Venture - Franchisor Plaintiff must allege that the benefits received by Choice Hotels were from ""participation in a venture"" which  defendants knew or should have known has engaged in an act in violation of the TVPRA. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). The  Eleventh Circuit rejected the statutory definition of ""participation in a venture"" found in the criminal provision, §  1591(e)(4), which defined ""participation in a venture"" as ""knowingly assisting, supporting or facilitating a violation of  subsection (a)(1)."" Instead, the Eleventh Circuit held that ""participation in a venture"" in the civil context requires that  plaintiff allege that the franchisor ""took part in a common undertaking or enterprise involving risk and potential  profit."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel operating venture and knowingly benefited from this venture  through room rentals, profits, third party fees, and the value of the ""good will"" of the Choice® brand. The venture  knew or should have known that they were profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking of A.D., in  violation of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #50, ¶ 19.) Plaintiff alleges that [*10]  defendants ""participated in a hotel operating  venture"" in connection with the Comfort Inn for potential profit. (Id. at ¶ 52.) Plaintiff alleges that Choice Hotels ""had  actual and/or constructive knowledge of sex trafficking, including A.D.'s sex trafficking and victimization,"" at its  branded property and it ""failed to implement and enforce any of its own policy or policies and protect Plaintiff A.D.  from being sex trafficked"", failed to take action to prevent trafficking so that it could continue to profit, and failed to  address the open and obvious presence of human trafficking on hotel properties. (Id. at ¶ 63.) Choice Hotels is  alleged to have demonstrated actual and/or constructive knowledge of the ""rampant culture of sex trafficking"" at  their properties around the country, including through news stories and online reviews. (Id. at ¶ 78.) These additional facts in the Second Amended Complaint do not remedy the problem in the original pleading as to  Choice Hotels. ""[A]s the Eleventh Circuit has acknowledged, the alleged venture can be a 'commercial venture' like  running or expanding a business. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22-2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023  WL 4944015, at *6 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023) (citing Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 727 (emphasis added)). However,  as before, ""[t]he 'participation' in the sex trafficking [*11]  venture is essentially that the franchisor and the hotel  operator did not fight hard enough to keep these traffickers from using their hotel. The Complaint acknowledges that  Defendants opposed sex traffickers, but fault defendants for taking ineffective steps to curtail the traffickers. This  hardly sounds like participating in a venture."" A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68588, [WL] at  *4. The Court finds that Choice Hotels must be dismissed because the Second Amended Complaint does not  sufficiently plead that it participated in a sex trafficking venture beyond participation in shared revenue as part of its  normal role as a franchisor. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 726-27 (""These allegations may suggest that the  franchisors financially benefitted from renting hotel rooms to the Does' sex traffickers. But they do nothing to show  that the franchisors participated in a common undertaking involving risk or profit that violated the TVPRA—i.e., the  alleged sex trafficking ventures.""). C. Participation in Venture - Franchisee ""In order to plead Defendants participated in a venture, Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court could  reasonably infer the hotels 'could be said to have a tacit agreement' with the trafficker. Plaintiff need not show that  defendants had actual [*12]  knowledge of the participation in the sex-trafficking venture."" Doe v. Rickey Patel, LLC,  No. 0:20-60683-WPD-CIV, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 30, 2020)  (citation omitted). In other words, plaintiff can show a ""continuous business relationship"" to show participation. J.G.  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150380, *8 Page 5 of 6 v. Northbrook Indus., Inc., 619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1235 (N.D. Ga. 2022); S.Y. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.,  519 F. Supp. 3d 1069, 1081 (M.D. Fla. 2021). As to R&M Real Estate, the 'participation' is based upon the relationship between the traffickers and the hotel.  ""Trafficker 2 created relationships with several employees at the Comfort Inn. Trafficker 2 utilized his relationships  with Comfort Inn employees, asking them to serve as lookouts and notify Trafficker 2 if police came to the hotel.""  (Doc. #50, ¶ 98.) Defendants knew or should have known that A.D. was being trafficked because A.D. and  Trafficker 2 were once arrested at the hotel, and hotel staff gave A.D. her cash deposit back in an envelope with her  name on it when she was released later that day. Trafficker 2 had a relationship with housekeeping staff to act as a  lookout and no the day of the arrest the housekeeping staff members alerted A.D. and Trafficker 2. Despite the  arrest, they were able to return to the hotel. Other red flags include excessive requests for sheets, a personal  relationship between staff and the trafficker, and direct employee encounters. (Id. at ¶ 101.) These facts at [*13]  least plausibly infer that employees of the Comfort Inn were participating in an enterprise  involving risk and knowingly benefiting from the risk. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 725 (citing Ricchio v. McLean,  853 F.3d 553, 556-58 (1st Cir. 2017) (agreeing with First Circuit that an operator's association with traffickers to  serve a business objective establishes participation in a venture with a sex trafficker). D. Knowledge This element requires the plaintiff to allege that the defendant had either actual or constructive knowledge that the  venture violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff. Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Knowledge requires an awareness or  understanding of a fact or circumstance, while constructive knowledge is knowledge that one should have 'using  reasonable care or diligence'. Id. (citing Black's Law Dictionary). The 'red flags' supporting knowledge include payments in cash, large amounts of used condoms and bodily fluids  on the sheets and towels, A.D.'s physical appearance, excessive requests for sheets and cleaning services, the  personal relationship with staff and A.D.'s trafficker, and the direct employee encounters with A.D. and her trafficker  inside the Comfort Inn. (Doc. #50, ¶ 101.) R&M Real Estate employees and staff openly observed signs of  trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. [*14]  The Court finds these facts are sufficient to plausibly allege knowledge at this stage of the proceedings. An overt or  direct act is not required, although direct acts were involved by employees in this case. See, e.g., K.H. v. Riti, Inc.,  No. 1:22-CV-3404-MHC, 2023 U.S. Dist.

Plaintiff filed  a Consolidated Response in Opposition (Doc. #56) on  July 3, 2023. Both defendants filed Replies. (Docs. ##  60, 61.) Plaintiff filed a Notice [*2]  of Supplemental  Authority (Doc. #62) on August 8, 2023. I. On April 19, 2023, the Court granted in part defendants'  motions to dismiss with leave to file an Amended  Complaint. A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., No. 2:22-CV- 648-JES-NPM, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68586, 2023 WL  3004547, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 19, 2023). On May 9,  2023, plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (Doc.  #46) and defendants have now essentially renewed  their motions to dismiss. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a  Complaint must contain a ""short and plain statement of  the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.""  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This obligation ""requires more  than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation  of the elements of a cause of action will not do."" Bell Atl.  Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955,  167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). In deciding a  Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court must accept  all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take  them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, Erickson v.  Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d  1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal conclusions without adequate  factual support are entitled to no assumption of truth,""  Mamani v. Berzaín, 654 F.3d 1148, 1153 (11th Cir.  2011) (citations omitted). Page 2 of 5 Plaintiff's (second) amended complaint is brought  pursuant  to  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act (TVPRA). As previously stated, The TVPRA is a criminal statute that also provides  a civil remedy to victims of sex trafficking. Section  1591(a) of the Act imposes criminal liability for  certain sex trafficking: (a) Whoever [*3]  knowingly-- (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or  within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction  of the United States, recruits, entices, harbors,  transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains,  patronizes, or solicits by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C.A. § 1591(a). In addition to a criminal  punishment, the TVPRA provides the following civil  remedy: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have [*4]  known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Thus, the TVRPA authorizes a victim of sex  trafficking to bring a direct civil claim against the  perpetrator of the trafficking and a ""beneficiary"" civil  claim  against  ""whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of [the TVPRA]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). To  state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA, Plaintiff must plausibly allege that the  defendant ""(1) knowingly benefited (2) from  participating in a venture; (3) that venture violated  the TVPRA as to [A.D.]; and (4) [Defendants] knew or should have known that  the venture violated the TVPRA as to [A.D.]."" Doe  v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 726 (11th Cir.  2021). A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  68586, [WL] at *2. The Court will consider each of the  elements as applied to the amended pleading. II. The operative amended complaint alleges the following:  Defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc. (Choice  Hotels) knows and has known for years that sex  trafficking and prostitution occur at their branded hotel  locations. Defendant Tampa Bay Hotels, LLC [*5]   (Tampa Bay) also knows and has known for years of  both occurring specifically at the Comfort Suites at  Fairgrounds Casino (Comfort Suites) located in Tampa,  Florida. (Doc. #46, ¶¶ 2-3.) This action for damages is  brought by the Plaintiff, identified by her initials A.D., a  survivor of sex trafficking under the TVPRA. (Id. at ¶  12.) ""With knowledge of the problem, and as a direct and  proximate result of Defendants' multiple failures and  refusals to act, mandate, establish, execute, and/or  modify their anti-trafficking efforts at the Comfort Suites  hotel, A.D. was continuously sex trafficked, sexually  exploited, and victimized repeatedly at the Comfort  Suites hotel."" (Id. at ¶ 18.) Plaintiff alleges that  defendants ""participated in a hotel operating venture  and knowingly benefited from this venture through room  rentals, profits, third party fees, and the value of the  ""good will"" of the Choice® brand. The venture knew or  should have known that they were profiting from sex  trafficking, including the sex trafficking of A.D., in  violation of the TVPRA."" (Id. at ¶ 19.) Plaintiff further alleges that Choice Hotels and Tampa  Bay participated in a hotel operating venture that  included staff at [*6]  the Comfort Suites. Tampa Bay  owns the Comfort Suites pursuant to a franchise  agreement entered into with Choice Hotels. Plaintiff  alleges an agency relationship through Choice Hotels'  ""exercise of ongoing and systemic right of control over  the Comfort Suites hotel."" (Id. at ¶¶ 29-32.) Choice  Hotels makes decisions that directly impact the  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150391, *2 Page 3 of 5 operations and maintenance of their branded hotels,  including the Comfort Suites. (Id. at ¶ 39.) Tampa Bay  directly offered public lodging services at the Comfort  Suites where A.D. was trafficked for sex. (Id. at ¶ 49.)  Defendants ""participated in a hotel operating venture in  connection with the management and operating of the  Comfort Suites hotel involving risk and potential profit.""  (Id. at ¶ 52.) During at least 2008 to 2012, emails were exchanged by  employees of Choice Hotels that related to sex  trafficking in hotels, including the Comfort Suites. (Id. at  ¶ 57.) Choice Hotels had actual and/or constructive  knowledge of sex trafficking, including A.D.'s sex  trafficking and victimization, occurring on its branded  property. (Id. at ¶ 63.) Choice Hotels continued to permit  and profit from male clientele who rented hotel rooms to  buy sex despite having [*7]  access to sex trafficking  indicators. (Id. at ¶ 75.) Defendants ""had actual or  constructive knowledge of law enforcement activity at  the Comfort Suites hotel reporting sexual battery, drug  dealing and other illicit activities occurring at the hotel.""  (Id. at ¶ 87.) Tampa Bay employees and staff openly observed signs  of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. Tampa Bay  received revenue and a percentage was provided to  Choice Hotels. (Id. at ¶ 104.) Through Choice Hotels'  relationship with the staff at the Comfort Suites, it  benefited or received royalty payments, licensing fees,  membership fees and dues, reservation fees, and  percentages of the gross room revenue. (Id. at ¶ 105.)  Through their ""continuous business venture of renting  hotel rooms"", Tampa Bay knowingly benefited. (Id. at ¶  107.) Plaintiff alleges that defendants benefit from the  steady stream of income that sex traffickers bring to  their hotel brands and from their reputation for privacy,  discretion, and the facilitation of commercial sex. (Id., ¶¶  116-117.) III. As previously stated, plaintiff must sufficiently plead that  a defendant knowingly benefited from participating in a  venture, that the venture violated the TVPRA, [*8]  and  that defendants knew or should have known that the  venture violated the TVPRA. A. Knowingly Benefited To satisfy the first element of a TVPRA beneficiary  claim, plaintiff must allege that defendant ""knew it was  receiving some value from participating in the alleged  venture."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. As the  Eleventh Circuit stated, ""Knowingly benefits"" means ""an awareness or  understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of  mind in which a person has no substantial doubt  about the existence of a fact."" Knowledge, Black's  Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). And Section  1595(a) explains that a defendant may benefit  ""financially or by receiving anything of value.""  Accordingly, a plaintiff like the Does must allege  that the defendant knew it was receiving some  value from participating in the alleged venture. Id. at 723-24. In the absence of a more stringent  statutory pleading requirement, knowledge ""may be  alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Alleging a  ""continuous business relationship"" is sufficient to show a  knowing benefit. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22- 2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015,  at *16 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023). The Court previously  found this element could be satisfied at this stage of the  proceedings. A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 68586, [WL] at *3. B. Participation in Venture - Franchisor Plaintiff must allege that the benefits received by Choice  Hotels were from ""participation in [*9]  a venture"" which  defendants knew or should have known has engaged in  an act in violation of the TVPRA. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a).  The Eleventh Circuit rejected the statutory definition of  ""participation in a venture"" found in the criminal  provision, § 1591(e)(4), which defined ""participation in a  venture""  as  ""knowingly  assisting,  supporting  or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)."" Instead, the  Eleventh Circuit held that ""participation in a venture"" in  the civil context requires that plaintiff allege that the  franchisor ""took part in a common undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit."" Red Roof  Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture and knowingly benefited from this  venture through room rentals, profits, third party fees,  and the value of the ""good will"" of the Choice® brand.  The venture knew or should have known that they were  profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking  of A.D., in violation of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #46, ¶ 19.)  Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture"" in connection with the Comfort Suites  for potential profit. (Id. at ¶ 52.) Plaintiff alleges that  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150391, *6 Page 4 of 5 Choice  Hotels  ""had  actual  and/or  constructive  knowledge of sex [*10]  trafficking, including A.D.'s sex  trafficking and victimization,"" at its branded property and  it ""failed to implement and enforce any of its own policy  or policies and protect Plaintiff A.D. from being sex  trafficked"", failed to take action to prevent trafficking so  that it could continue to profit, and failed to address the  open and obvious presence of human trafficking on  hotel properties. (Id. at ¶ 63.) Choice Hotels is alleged to  have  demonstrated  actual  and/or  constructive  knowledge of the ""rampant culture of sex trafficking"" at  their properties around the country, including through  news stories and online reviews. (Id. at ¶ 78.) These additional facts in the Second Amended  Complaint do not remedy the problem in the original  pleading as to Choice Hotels. ""[A]s the Eleventh Circuit  has acknowledged, the alleged venture can be a  'commercial venture' like running or expanding a  business. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22-2621,  2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *6  (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023) (citing Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21  F.4th at 727 (emphasis added)). However, as before,  ""[t]he 'participation' in the sex trafficking venture is  essentially that the franchisor and the hotel operator did  not fight hard enough to keep these traffickers from  using their hotel. The Complaint acknowledges that  Defendants opposed sex traffickers, [*11]  but fault  defendants for taking ineffective steps to curtail the  traffickers. This hardly sounds like participating in a  venture."" A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 68586, [WL] at *4. The Court finds that Choice Hotels must be dismissed  because the Second Amended Complaint does not  sufficiently plead that it participated in a sex trafficking  venture beyond participation in shared revenue as part  of its normal role as a franchisor. Red Roof Inns, Inc.,  21 F.4th at 726-27 (""These allegations may suggest that  the franchisors financially benefitted from renting hotel  rooms to the Does' sex traffickers. But they do nothing  to show that the franchisors participated in a common  undertaking involving risk or profit that violated the  TVPRA—i.e., the alleged sex trafficking ventures.""). C. Participation in Venture - Franchisee ""In order to plead Defendants participated in a venture,  Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court could  reasonably infer the hotels 'could be said to have a tacit  agreement' with the trafficker. Plaintiff need not show  that  defendants  had  actual  knowledge  of  the  participation in the sex-trafficking venture."" Doe v.  Rickey Patel, LLC, No. 0:20-60683-WPD-CIV, 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (S.D.  Fla. Sept. 30, 2020) (citation omitted). In other words,  plaintiff can show a ""continuous business relationship""  to show participation. J.G. v. Northbrook Indus., Inc.,  619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1235 (N.D. Ga. 2022); S.Y. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 519 F. Supp. 3d 1069,  1081 (M.D. Fla. 2021). As to Tampa Bay, the 'participation' [*12]  is based upon  the relationship between the traffickers and the hotel.  Trafficker 2 routinely instructed A.D. to rent multiple  rooms in her name using cash with one room facing the  parking lot to monitor when buyers would arrive. There  would be ""a parade of unregistered male guests coming  in and out of the hotel room at all times of day."" (Doc.  #46, ¶¶ 95-96.) ""The rooms were rented by night and  the next morning A.D. in her disheveled, drug induced  state, would go to the front desk and extend the stay.""  (Id. at ¶ 97a.) Other red flags include excessive  requests for sheets, a personal relationship between  staff and the trafficker, and direct employee encounters.  (Id. at ¶ 97j-l.) These facts at least plausibly infer that employees of the  Comfort Suites were participating in an enterprise  involving risk and knowingly benefiting from the risk.  Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 725 (citing Ricchio v.  McLean, 853 F.3d 553, 556-58 (1st Cir. 2017) (agreeing  with First Circuit that an operator's association with  traffickers to serve a business objective establishes  participation in a venture with a sex trafficker). D. Knowledge This element requires the plaintiff to allege that the  defendant had either actual or constructive knowledge  that the venture violated the TVPRA as to the  plaintiff. [*13]  Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725.  Knowledge requires an awareness or understanding of  a fact or circumstance, while constructive knowledge is  knowledge that one should have 'using reasonable care  or diligence'. Id. (citing Black's Law Dictionary). The 'red flags' supporting knowledge include payments  in cash, large amounts of used condoms and bodily  fluids on the sheets and towels, A.D.'s physical  appearance, excessive requests for sheets and cleaning  services, the personal relationship with staff and A.D.'s  trafficker, and the direct employee encounters with A.D.  and her trafficker inside the Comfort Suites. (Doc. #46, ¶  99.) Tampa Bay employees and staff openly observed  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150391, *9 Page 5 of 5 signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. (Id. at ¶ 104.) The Court finds these facts are sufficient to plausibly  allege knowledge at this stage of the proceedings. An  overt or direct act is not required. See, e.g., K.H. v. Riti,  Inc., No. 1:22-CV-3404-MHC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  93374, 2023 WL 3644224, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 17,  2023) (collecting cases of direct association between  hotel and trafficker); J.C. v.

As previously stated, Page 2 of 5 The TVPRA is a criminal statute that also provides  a civil remedy to victims of sex trafficking. Section  1591(a) of the Act imposes criminal liability for  certain sex trafficking: (a) Whoever knowingly-- (1)  in  or  affecting  interstate  or  foreign  commerce, [*3]  or within the special maritime and  territorial jurisdiction of the United States, recruits,  entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains,  advertises, maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any  means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C.A. § 1591(a). In addition to a criminal  punishment, the TVPRA provides the following civil  remedy: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in [*4]  an appropriate  district court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a).

(Id. at ¶ 52.) During at least 2008 to 2012, emails were exchanged by  employees of Choice Hotels that related to sex  trafficking in hotels, including the Quality Inn. (Id. at ¶  57.) Choice Hotels had actual and/or constructive  knowledge of sex trafficking, including A.D.'s sex  trafficking and victimization, occurring on its branded  property. (Id. at ¶ 63.) Choice Hotels continued to permit  and profit from male clientele who rented hotel rooms to  buy sex despite having access to sex trafficking [*7]   indicators. (Id. at ¶ 75.) In 2018, a reviewer described  the Quality Inn as being in a seedy part of Naples, ""[d]id  not feel safe."" (Id. at ¶ 79k.) Choice Hotels monitors  customer reviews. (Id. at ¶ 81.) Defendants had ""actual  or, at a minimum, constructive knowledge that the rental  of rooms was for the purpose of sex trafficking A.D., in  violation of the TVPRA."" (Id. at ¶ 105.) R&M Real Estate staff openly observed signs of  trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. R&M Real Estate  received revenue and a percentage was provided to  Choice Hotels. (Id. at ¶ 106.) Through Choice Hotels'  relationship with the staff at the Quality Inn, it benefited  or  received  royalty  payments,  licensing  fees,  membership fees and dues, reservation fees, and  percentages of the gross room revenue. (Id. at ¶ 107.)  Through their ""continuous business venture of renting  hotel rooms"", R&M Real Estate knowingly benefited. (Id.  at ¶ 109.) Plaintiff alleges that defendants benefit from  the steady stream of income that sex traffickers bring to  their hotel brands and from their reputation for privacy,  discretion, and the facilitation of commercial sex. (Id., ¶¶  118-119.) III. As previously stated, plaintiff must sufficiently [*8]  plead  that a defendant knowingly benefited from participating  in a venture, that the venture violated the TVPRA, and  that defendants knew or should have known that the  venture violated the TVPRA. A. Knowingly Benefited To satisfy the first element of a TVPRA beneficiary  claim, plaintiff must allege that defendant ""knew it was  receiving some value from participating in the alleged  venture."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. As the  Eleventh Circuit stated, ""Knowingly benefits"" means ""an awareness or  understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of  mind in which a person has no substantial doubt  about the existence of a fact."" Knowledge, Black's  Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). And Section  1595(a) explains that a defendant may benefit  ""financially or by receiving anything of value.""  Accordingly, a plaintiff like the Does must allege  that the defendant knew it was receiving some  value from participating in the alleged venture. Id. at 723-24. In the absence of a more stringent  statutory pleading requirement, knowledge ""may be  alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Alleging a  ""continuous business relationship"" is sufficient to show a  knowing benefit. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22- 2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015,  at *16 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023). The Court previously  found this element could be satisfied at this stage of the  proceedings. A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 67832, [WL] at *3. B. Participation in [*9]  Venture - Franchisor Plaintiff must allege that the benefits received by Choice  Hotels were from ""participation in a venture"" which  defendants knew or should have known has engaged in  an act in violation of the TVPRA. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a).  The Eleventh Circuit rejected the statutory definition of  ""participation in a venture"" found in the criminal  provision, § 1591(e)(4), which defined ""participation in a  venture""  as  ""knowingly  assisting,  supporting  or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)."" Instead, the  Eleventh Circuit held that ""participation in a venture"" in  the civil context requires that plaintiff allege that the  franchisor ""took part in a common undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit."" Red Roof  Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture and knowingly benefited from this  venture through room rentals, profits, third party fees,  and the value of the ""good will"" of the Choice® brand.  The venture knew or should have known that they were  profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking  of A.D., in violation of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #47, ¶ 19.)  Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture"" in connection with the Quality Inn for  potential [*10]  profit. (Id. at ¶ 52.) Plaintiff alleges that  Choice  Hotels  ""had  actual  and/or  constructive  knowledge of sex trafficking, including A.D.'s sex  trafficking and victimization,"" at its branded property and  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150397, *6 Page 4 of 5 it ""failed to implement and enforce any of its own policy  or policies and protect Plaintiff A.D. from being sex  trafficked"", failed to take action to prevent trafficking so  that it could continue to profit, and failed to address the  open and obvious presence of human trafficking on  hotel properties. (Id. at ¶ 63.) Choice Hotels is alleged to  have  demonstrated  actual  and/or  constructive  knowledge of the ""rampant culture of sex trafficking"" at  their properties around the country, including through  news stories and online reviews. (Id. at ¶ 78.) These additional facts in the Second Amended  Complaint do not remedy the problem in the original  pleading as to Choice Hotels. ""[A]s the Eleventh Circuit  has acknowledged, the alleged venture can be a  'commercial venture' like running or expanding a  business. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22-2621,  2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *6  (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023) (citing Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21  F.4th at 727 (emphasis added)). However, as before,  ""[t]he 'participation' in the sex trafficking venture is  essentially that the franchisor and the hotel operator did  not fight hard enough to [*11]  keep these traffickers  from using their hotel. The Complaint acknowledges that  Defendants  opposed  sex  traffickers,  but  fault  defendants for taking ineffective steps to curtail the  traffickers. This hardly sounds like participating in a  venture."" A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 67832, [WL] at *5. The Court finds that Choice Hotels must be dismissed  because the Second Amended Complaint does not  sufficiently plead that it participated in a sex trafficking  venture beyond participation in shared revenue as part  of its normal role as a franchisor. Red Roof Inns, Inc.,  21 F.4th at 726-27 (""These allegations may suggest that  the franchisors financially benefitted from renting hotel  rooms to the Does' sex traffickers. But they do nothing  to show that the franchisors participated in a common  undertaking involving risk or profit that violated the  TVPRA—i.e., the alleged sex trafficking ventures.""). C. Participation in Venture - Franchisee ""In order to plead Defendants participated in a venture,  Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court could  reasonably infer the hotels 'could be said to have a tacit  agreement' with the trafficker. Plaintiff need not show  that  defendants  had  actual  knowledge  of  the  participation in the sex-trafficking venture."" Doe v.  Rickey Patel, LLC, No. 0:20-60683-WPD-CIV, 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (S.D.  Fla. Sept. 30, 2020) (citation omitted). In other  words, [*12]  plaintiff can show a ""continuous business  relationship"" to show participation. J.G. v. Northbrook  Indus., Inc., 619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1235 (N.D. Ga.  2022); S.Y. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 519 F.  Supp. 3d 1069, 1081 (M.D. Fla. 2021). As to R&M Real Estate, the 'participation' is based upon  the personal relationship between staff and the  traffickers, and direct employee encounters with A.D.  and Trafficker 21 inside the Quality Inn. (Doc. #47, ¶¶  99, 107.) Trafficker 2 kept A.D. confined to her room  and the procession of men was open and obvious to  anyone working at the Quality Inn. (Id. at ¶ 97.)  Trafficker 2 gave the housekeeper $100 to keep quiet  about seeing a gun, $10,000 in cash, and drugs while  cleaning the room. (Id. at ¶ 99.) ""Through the R&M  Defendants and Choice's continuous business venture  of renting hotel rooms, which were used for trafficking  A.D. at the Quality Inn hotel, the R&M Defendants  knowingly benefited or received something of value from  activity that its facilitation of or participation in a venture  which it knew or should have known had violated the  TVPRA through the rental of rooms where A.D. was  trafficked."" (Id. at ¶ 109.) These facts at least plausibly infer that employees of the  Quality Inn were participating in an enterprise involving  risk and knowingly benefiting from the risk. Red Roof  Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 725 (citing Ricchio v. McLean, 853  F.3d 553, 556-58 (1st Cir. 2017) (agreeing with [*13]   First Circuit that an operator's association with  traffickers to serve a business objective establishes  participation in a venture with a sex trafficker). D. Knowledge This element requires the plaintiff to allege that the  defendant had either actual or constructive knowledge  that the venture violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff.  Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Knowledge requires an  awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance,  while constructive knowledge is knowledge that one  should have 'using reasonable care or diligence'. Id.  (citing Black's Law Dictionary). The 'red flags' supporting knowledge include payments  in cash, large amounts of used condoms and bodily  fluids on the sheets and towels, A.D.'s physical  appearance, excessive requests for sheets and cleaning  services, the personal relationship with staff and A.D.'s  trafficker, and the direct employee encounters with A.D.  and her trafficker inside the Quality Inn. (Doc. #47, ¶  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150397, *10 Page 5 of 5 99.) R&M Real Estate employees and staff openly  observed signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. (Id.  at ¶ 106.) The Court finds these facts are sufficient to plausibly  allege knowledge at this stage of the proceedings. An  overt or direct act is not required. See, e.g., [*14]  K.H.  v. Riti, Inc., No. 1:22-CV-3404-MHC, 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 93374, 2023 WL 3644224, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Apr.  17, 2023) (collecting cases of direct association  between hotel and trafficker); J.C. v.

Supp. 3d 1228, 1239 (N.D. Ga.  2022) (employees acted as lookouts for Plaintiff's  traffickers). Accordingly, it is now ORDERED: 1. Defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc.'s  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended  Complaint (Doc. #53) is GRANTED and defendant  is dismissed with prejudice. 2. Defendant R & M Real Estate Company, Inc.,  Robert Vocisano, and Mario Vocisano's Motion to  Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint  (Doc. #54) is DENIED.

B.M. v. Wyndham Hotels.pdf,"ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN  PART DEFENDANTS WYNDHAM HOTELS &  RESORTS, INC.'S AND CHOICE HOTELS  INTERNATIONAL, INC.'S MOTIONS TO DISMISS  WITH LEAVE TO AMEND; DENYING CHOICE [*2]   HOTELS INTERNATIONAL, INC.'S MOTION TO  STRIKE; ALLOWING PLAINTIFF TO PROCEED WITH  A PSEUDONYM; SETTING CASE MANAGEMENT  CONFERENCE ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2020 AT 10:00  A.M. Plaintiff B.M. is a survivor of sex trafficking. She brings  this action against three hotel chains alleging violation of  Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act  (""TVPRA"") for profiting from her sex trafficking. Before the Court are two motions: (1) Defendant  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.'s (""Wyndham"") Motion  to Dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  12(b)(6) at ECF 32 and (2) Defendant Choice Hotels  International, Inc.'s (""Choice"") Motion to Dismiss under  Rule 12(b)(6) and Motion to Strike under Rule 12(f) at  ECF 49. The Court heard oral arguments on July 9,  2020. For the reasons stated below, the Court GRANTS  IN PART and DENIES IN PART both Motions to  Dismiss WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. Choice's Motion to  Strike is DENIED. I. BACKGROUND Unless otherwise noted, the following factual allegations  are drawn from the Complaint, ECF 1 (""Compl.""). Defendant Wyndham is ""one of the largest hotel brands  Page 2 of 11 in the world with nearly 9,000 branded properties in  more than eighty (80) countries."" Compl. ¶ 10. Super 8®  by Wyndham (""Super 8"") is a Wyndham ""brand  property."" Id. ¶ 10(b). Defendant [*3]  Choice is another  large worldwide hotel brand. Id. ¶ 11. Clarion Inn is a  Choice ""brand property."" Id. ¶ 11(a). Defendant G6  Hospitality, LLC (""G6"") is ""one of the largest motel  brands in the world."" Id. ¶ 12. Motel 6 South (""Motel 6"")  is a G6 ""brand property."" Id. ¶ 12(a). Plaintiff B.M. was trafficked for commercial sex as  minor at hotels in Santa Clara County, California,  including Super 8, Clarion Inn, and Motel 6. Compl. ¶¶  4, 6. B.M. was first subjugated to sex trafficking in  2014 at Defendants' hotels when she was sixteen years  old. Compl. ¶ 67. For two years, B.M.'s traffickers rented  two adjoining rooms at a Super 8 hotel and Clarion Inn.  Id. ¶ 68. B.M. and other girls were forced to perform  commercial sex acts with ten to fifteen men a day. Id. A  procession of adult men would enter B.M.'s room, stay  for 15 minutes to an hour on average, and then leave.  Id. ¶ 71. The adult men arriving at B.M.'s room were  ""typically middle-aged men of a variety of races,"" and  none of them ""appeared to be age-appropriate  contemporaries of the minor Plaintiff."" Id. ¶ 72. None of  her visitors acted ""as though they were a guardian or  relative"" of B.M. Id. B.M. alleges that Defendants knew  or should [*4]  have known that B.M. was being sex  trafficked due to: (1) large amounts of used condoms,  empty lube bottles, and other sex related items in the  hotel room; (2) payments for the rooms in cash; (3)  B.M.'s physical appearance (malnourished, bruised, and  beaten); (4) a continuous procession of older men  entering and leaving B.M.'s room; and (5) excessive  requests for sheets, cleaning supplies, and room  service. Id. ¶ 74. B.M. brings this action pursuant to the TVPRA against  Defendants Wyndham, Choice, and G6 (together,  ""Defendants""). Compl. ¶¶ 2, 8. B.M. alleges that all  Defendants knowingly benefited from facilitating the sex  trafficking venture in which B.M. was victimized in  violation of the TVPRA. Id. ¶¶ 5, 8. As to Wyndham specifically, B.M. alleges that Wyndham  was on notice of repeated incidences of sex trafficking  occurring on its Super 8 branded properties. Id. ¶ 64 (a)- (d). According to Plaintiff, Wyndham failed to implement  its  anti-trafficking  policies  to  prevent  related  misconducts and continues to profit from the business  trafficking brings. Id. ¶ 64(f). The Complaint cites  multiple news reports and online reviews (for example  on www.tripadvisor.com) to allege Wyndham had  actual [*5]  or constructive knowledge of the sex  trafficking occurrences at its Super 8 branded hotels  throughout the country, and argues that Wyndham's  knowledge facilitated the sex trafficking of B.M. Id. ¶  64(n). B.M. further contends that Wyndham was in an  agency relationship with the Super 8 hotels through its  ""exercise of an ongoing and systematic right of control  over Super 8® hotels,"" including how the hotels  conducted daily business. Id. ¶ 64(k). Wyndham also  ""held out Super 8 branded hotels to the public as  possessing authority to act on its behalf."" Id. ¶ 64(l). Similarly, with regard to Choice, B.M. alleges that  Defendant Choice had constructive knowledge of sex  trafficking occurring on its branded hotel properties.  Compl. ¶ 65(c). According to Plaintiff, Choice knew or  should have known that Clarion Inn hotels where  Plaintiff was trafficked ""were in areas known for high  incidences of crime and prone to sex trafficking activity  on and around the hotel premises, including when  Plaintiff was trafficked."" Id. ¶ 65(d). Choice allegedly  failed to implement policies to protect B.M. from being  trafficked and continues to profit from the business sex  trafficking brings. Id. ¶ 65(a). B.M. alleges [*6]  that  Clarion Inn employees threatened to eject B.M. and her  traffickers, but never took further action. Id. ¶ 69.  Despite the threats, B.M. and other victims continued to  be trafficked on the premises. Id. B.M. also cites news  reports and online reviews on www.facebook.com to  allege Choice's actual or constructive knowledge of the  sex trafficking occurrences at its Clarion Inn hotels  throughout the country and argues that Choice's  knowledge facilitated the sex trafficking of B.M. Id. ¶  65(j). As to the relationship between Choice and the  Clarion Inn, B.M. contends that the two were in an  agency relationship through Choice's ""exercise of an  ongoing and systematic right of control over Clarion  Inn® hotels,"" including how Clarion Inn hotels conducted  daily business. Id. ¶ 65(g). Choice also ""held out Clarion  Inn® branded hotels to the public as possessing  authority to act on its behalf."" Id. ¶ 65(h). On January 29, 2020, B.M. filed this lawsuit against all  Defendants. Compl. On March 25, 2020, Wyndham filed  a motion to dismiss. Wyndham's Motion to Dismiss  Complaint Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (""Wyndham  Motion""), ECF 32. B.M. filed an opposition, and  Wyndham replied. ECF 59; ECF 62. On April 10, 2020,  Choice [*7]  filed a motion to dismiss and motion to  strike. Choice's Motion to Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6),  Motion to Strike under Rule 12(f) (""Choice Motion""),  ECF 49. B.M. filed an opposition, and Choice replied.  ECF 58; ECF 60. G6 has answered the Complaint. ECF  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *2 Page 3 of 11 47. II. MOTIONS TO DISMISS A. Legal Standard 1. Motion to Dismiss ""A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil  Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon  which relief can be granted 'tests the legal sufficiency of  a claim.'"" Conservation Force v. Salazar, 646 F.3d  1240, 1241-42 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Navarro v. Block,  250 F.3d 729, 732 (9th Cir. 2001)). When determining  whether a claim has been stated, the Court accepts as  true all well-pled factual allegations and construes them  in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Reese v. BP  Exploration (Alaska) Inc., 643 F.3d 681, 690 (9th Cir.  2011). However, the Court need not ""accept as true  allegations that contradict matters properly subject to  judicial  notice""  or  ""allegations  that  are  merely  conclusory,  unwarranted  deductions  of  fact,  or  unreasonable inferences."" In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig.,  536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation  marks and citations omitted). While a complaint need  not contain detailed factual allegations, it ""must contain  sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a  claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'"" Ashcroft v.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d  868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.  544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). A  claim is facially plausible when it ""allows the court to  draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is  liable [*8]  for the misconduct alleged."" Id. On a motion  to dismiss, the Court's review is limited to the face of the  complaint and matters judicially noticeable. MGIC  Indem. Corp. v. Weisman, 803 F.2d 500, 504 (9th Cir.  1986); N. Star Int'l v. Ariz. Corp. Comm'n, 720 F.2d 578,  581 (9th Cir. 1983). In deciding whether to grant leave to amend, the Court  must consider the factors set forth by the Supreme  Court in Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9  L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962), and discussed at length by the  Ninth Circuit in Eminence Capital, LLC v. Aspeon, Inc.,  316 F.3d 1048 (9th Cir. 2009). A district court ordinarily  must grant leave to amend unless one or more of the  Foman factors is present: (1) undue delay, (2) bad faith  or dilatory motive, (3) repeated failure to cure  deficiencies by amendment, (4) undue prejudice to the  opposing party, or (5) futility of amendment. Eminence  Capital, 316 F.3d at 1052. ""[I]t is the consideration of  prejudice to the opposing party that carries the greatest  weight."" Id. However, a strong showing with respect to  one of the other factors may warrant denial of leave to  amend. Id. 2. TVPRA B.M. brings this action under Trafficking Victims  Protection Reauthorization Act (""TVPRA""). The TVPRA  has two provisions relevant to this case providing (1)  criminal penalties and (2) civil liability. The TVPRA provides for criminal penalties as set forth  in 18 U.S.C. § 1591: (a) Whoever knowingly— (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, ...  recruits, entices, harbors, transports, [*9]  provides,  obtains,  advertises,  maintains,  patronizes,  or  solicits by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting  the violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in  reckless disregard of the fact, that means of  force,  threats  of  force,  fraud,  coercion  described  in  subsection  (e)(2),  or  any  combination of such means will be used to  cause the person to engage in a commercial  sex act, or that the person has not attained the  age of 18 years and will be caused to engage  in a commercial sex act, shall be punished as  provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Section 1591 defines ""participation  in a venture"" as ""knowingly assisting, supporting, or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1),"" § 1591(e)(4),  and defines ""venture"" as ""any group of two or more  individuals associated in fact, whether or not a legal  entity,"" § 1591(e)(6). In Afyare, the Sixth Circuit agreed  with a district court that a defendant must ""actually  participate and commit some 'overt act' that furthers"" the  criminal ""aspect of the venture"" and that the TVPRA ""did  not criminalize"" any lesser conduct. U.S. v. Afyare, 632  Fed. App'x 272, 286 (6th Cir. 2016). Thus, Afyare court  required the prosecution ""to prove that [*10]  the  defendant actually participated in a sex-trafficking  venture."" Id. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *7 Page 4 of 11 TVPRA's civil liabilities are set forth under U.S.C. §  1595: An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). B.M. sues under 18 U.S.C § 1595. As a threshold matter, the Court addresses the parties'  dispute as to whether the ""participation in a venture""  definition from the criminal liability section of the  TVPRA, section 1591(e)(4), applies to the civil liability  section 1595 and concludes that it does not. The Court  agrees with the statutory construction analysis in M.A. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959,  969 (S.D. Ohio 2019), adopted by Judge Orrick in J.C.  v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., No. 20-CV-00155-WHO,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99252, 2020 WL 3035794, at *1,  n. 1 (N.D. Cal. June 5, 2020) that applying the  ""participation in a venture"" definition from the criminal  liability section of the TVPRA to the civil liability section  of the TVPRA, ""would void the 'should have known'  language in the civil remedy"" and ""[t]his violates the  'cardinal [*11]  principle of statutory construction that a  statute ought, upon the whole, to be construed so that, if  it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall  be superfluous, void, or insignificant."" J.C. v. Choice  Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99252, 2020 WL  3035794, at *1, n. 1 (quoting M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels &  Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 969). Accordingly,  B.M. is not required to allege an overt act in furtherance  of or actual knowledge of a sex trafficking venture in  order to sufficiently plead her section 1595 civil liability  claim. See A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., No. CV 19-5770,  455 F. Supp. 3d 171, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70644,  2020 WL 1939678, at *13 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 22, 2020)  (declining to apply the ""participation in a venture""  element from the criminal offense defined by Congress  in section 1591 to a claim or civil remedy). B. Discussion Wyndham and Choice argue that the Complaint's  allegations are insufficient for either direct or vicarious  liability. For the reasons discussed below, the Court  finds that the Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to  make a plausible claim for direct liability and grants  leave to amend for that theory. The Court is satisfied,  however, that Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts that when  taken as true, establish a plausible claim for an agency  theory of liability. 1. Plaintiff's Direct Liability Theory To state a claim under a section 1595(a) beneficiary  theory, B.M. must allege facts from which the Court can  reasonably [*12]  infer that Wyndham and Choice (1)  ""knowingly benefit[ted] financially or by receiving  anything of value""; (2) from participation in a venture; (3)  they ""knew or should have known has engaged in"" sex  trafficking. Wyndham and Choice argue that Plaintiff  fails to allege facts to support the three elements. The  Court recognizes that Wyndham and Choice are  unrelated companies and that Plaintiff must separately  allege facts against each defendant to support her  claims. Where the Court discusses the allegations  against both Defendants, it is based on the Court's  consideration of separate allegations similar in nature  and similar arguments proffered by each Defendant in  their motions. Combining the analysis of the issues is  solely for the purpose of brevity. There is no confusion  by the Court that Plaintiff must separately plead and  prove her case against Choice and Wyndham. a. Knowing financial benefit Wyndham and Choice challenge Plaintiff's allegations  that they knowingly benefited from her trafficking. See  Wyndham Motion at 6-7; Choice Motion at 10-12. They  argue that the ""'benefit' must derive directly from, and be  knowingly received in exchange for, participating in a  sex-trafficking venture."" [*13]  Wyndham Motion at 6.  According to Wyndham and Choice, receiving royalties  from independently owned and operated hotels is not  enough. Id. at 6-7. The Court disagrees. Wyndham and  Choice's  interpretation  of  the  statute  reads  a  requirement for ""actual knowledge"" of criminal sex  trafficking into the civil statute, reading out the ""should  have known"" language. The ""knowingly benefit"" element  of section 1595 ""merely requires that Defendant  knowingly receive a financial benefit"" and the rental of a  room (or Wyndham and Choice's receipt of royalties for  that rental) constitutes a financial benefit from a  relationship with the trafficker sufficient to meet this  element. H.H. v. G6 Hosp., LLC, No. 2:19-CV-755, 2019  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *2 (S.D.  Ohio Dec. 6, 2019). Here, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants received financial  benefits and other incidentals from continuously renting  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *10 Page 5 of 11 rooms to her traffickers. See Compl. ¶¶ 2, 10(h), 11(h),  82, 85. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants directly  benefited from the trafficking of Plaintiff on each  occasion they received payment for rooms that she was  being kept in at the Defendants' branded properties.  See id. ¶ 90. Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to meet  the ""knowingly benefitted"" element of a civil claim under  section 1595 of the [*14]  TVPRA at the motion to  dismiss stage. b. Participation in venture Having found that ""participation in venture"" under  section 1595 of the TVPRA does not require an ""overt  act"" of participation in the sex trafficking itself, the  Court must then examine whether Plaintiff has alleged  sufficient facts for a plausible claim that Wyndham and  Choice ""participated in a venture."" The Court finds that Plaintiff's direct liability theory  against Wyndham and Choice is insufficiently pled as to  the ""participation in venture"" element because the  Complaint fails to connect the dots between Plaintiff's  alleged sex trafficking and these Defendants. Plaintiff's  theory is that Defendants participated in a venture ""by  participating in, and facilitating, the harboring and  providing of B.M. for the purposes of commercial sex  induced by force, fraud, or coercion, by their acts,  omissions, and commissions."" Compl. ¶ 89. Plaintiff  argues that she alleges facts showing that Wyndham  and Choice ""participated in a venture"" because their  branded hotels (Super 8 and Clarion Inn) rented rooms  to people they knew or should have known were  engaged in sex trafficking. See Opp'n to Wyndham at  12 (citing Compl. ¶¶ 62-64), ECF 59. Plaintiff [*15]   further alleges — and the Court accepts as true at this  stage — that B.M. showed visible signs of being sex  trafficked (e.g., visible injuries and consistent foot  traffic from older men to her room) when she was at  one Super 8 and one Clarion Inn facility in San Jose,  California. Compl. ¶¶ 71-72, 74. In addition, Plaintiff  alleges that Clarion Inn employees threatened to eject  Plaintiff B.M. and her traffickers, but never took further  action. Id. ¶ 69. According to Plaintiff, Wyndham (the  ultimate parent company of the franchisor of the Super 8  hotel brand ) and Choice (the franchisor of the Clarion        Inn hotels ) were generally aware that acts of sex  trafficking take place in their franchisee hotels around  the United States. Id. ¶¶ 64, 65. While these allegation might be sufficient to state a  plausible claim against the specific hotels where Plaintiff  was trafficked (who Plaintiff has not sued), they do not  make a plausible claim that Wyndham and Choice  directly participated in a venture that trafficked B.M. at  the specific facilities she alleges her traffickers used. In  other words, the Complaint is devoid of any facts linking  these Defendants (Wyndham and [*16]  Choice) to  the sex trafficking of this Plaintiff (B.M.), and thus  fails to make a plausible claim for Wyndham's and  Choice's direct ""participation in venture"". c. Knew or should have known the venture was  engaged in trafficking While Defendants need not have actual knowledge of  the sex trafficking in order to have participated in the  sex trafficking venture for civil liability under the  TVPRA, Plaintiff must allege facts to support that  Wyndham and Choice, at the very least, rented rooms  to people they should have known were engaging in her  sex trafficking. And she has failed to do so here.  Plaintiff alleges the following facts, specific to her  trafficking: • ""For two years, Plaintiff's traffickers rented two  adjoining rooms at the Super 8 and Clarion Inn.  Plaintiff was one of several other girls that were  being simultaneously trafficked in these two  rooms. Each girl, including minor Plaintiff B.M.,  would be forced to perform commercial sex acts  with ten to fifteen men a day."" Compl. ¶ 68. • ""Clarion Inn employees threatened to eject                         2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *13 Page 6 of 11 Plaintiff B.M. and her traffickers, but never took  further action. Despite these threats, Plaintiff B.M.  and  several  other  victims  continued  to  be  trafficked [*17]  on the premises."" Compl. ¶ 69. • ""Day after day, a procession of adult men would  enter minor Plaintiff B.M.'s room, stay for 15  minutes to an hour on average, and then leave.""  Compl. ¶ 71. • ""The adult men arriving at the Plaintiff's room were  typically middle-aged men of a variety of races —  none of whom appeared to be age-appropriate  contemporaries of the minor Plaintiff. None of these  visitors acted in any manner as though they were a  guardian or relative of the minor Plaintiff."" Compl. ¶  72. Further, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants ""knew  or should have known that Plaintiff B.M. was being  trafficked for sex"" due to the following red flags: • large amounts of used condoms, empty lube  bottles, and other sex-related items in the hotel  room; • payments for the rooms in cash; • Plaintiff's physical appearance (malnourished,  bruised, beaten); • a continuous procession of older men entering  and leaving minor Plaintiff B.M.'s room; • excessive requests for sheets, cleaning supplies,  room service; and • the personal relationship between the front desk  employees and Plaintiff's traffickers. Compl. ¶ 74. But all these allegations support a theory  that  the  staff  at  the  franchisee  hotels  where  Plaintiff [*18]  was trafficked knew or should have  known about her trafficking. The Complaint fails to  allege facts as to how Wyndham (the ultimate parent  company of the franchisor) and Choice (the franchisor)  knew or should have known Plaintiff was being  trafficked. To support her direct liability theory, Plaintiff  must allege facts showing these Defendants knew or  should have known of her trafficking — and she fails to  do so in her Complaint. 2. Plaintiff's Agency Liability Theory Wyndham and Choice argue that Plaintiff's allegations  of vicarious liability are ""conclusory"" and should be  dismissed. Wyndham Motion at 9-10; see also Choice  Motion at 14- 17. The Court disagrees. Under California  law, ""a franchisee may be deemed to be the agent of  the franchisor."" Kuchta v. Allied Builders Corp., 21 Cal.  App. 3d 541, 547, 98 Cal. Rptr. 588 (Ct. App. 1971).  ""The general rule is that, if a franchise agreement gives  the franchisor the right of complete or substantial control  over the franchisee, an agency relationship exists.""  Walker v. Pac. Pride Servs., Inc., 341 F. App'x 350, 351  (9th Cir. 2009) (citing Kuchta, 21 Cal. App. 3d at 547). The Court is satisfied that Plaintiff has alleged sufficient  facts to establish a plausible claim for an agency  relationship between the franchisees and Wyndham and  Choice. For example, Plaintiff alleges that Wyndham  exercises ""ongoing and systemic right of control [*19]   over Super 8® hotels"" by a variety of actions including  ""setting  employee  wages,""  ""making  employee  decisions,"" and ""standardized training methods for  employees."" Compl. ¶ 64(k); id ¶ 65(g) (same  allegations as to Choice and Clarion Inn). While Plaintiff  might  ultimately  not  succeed  in  proving  these  allegations, they are enough to get her past the motion  to dismiss. Similarly, Plaintiff's allegations that Wyndham and  Choice are liable as joint employers of the franchisee  hotel employees survive the motion to dismiss. The joint  employer  doctrine  recognizes  that  ""even  where  business entities are separate, if they share control of  the terms or conditions of an individual's employment,  both companies can qualify as employers."" Johnson v.  Serenity Transp., Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8404,  2016 WL 270952, at *10 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 22, 2016). The  Ninth Circuit has adopted a four-part ""economic reality""  test  to  determine  when  the  employer-employee  relationship exists. See Bonnette v. California Health &  Welfare Agency, 704 F.2d 1465, 1470 (9th Cir. 1983).  These factors include whether the employer: ""(1) had  the power to hire and fire the employees, (2) supervised  and controlled employee work schedules or conditions  of employment, (3) determined the rate and method of  payment, and (4) maintained employment records."" Id.  Plaintiff alleges that Wyndham and Choice had control  over the hotels [*20]  where was trafficked by, for  example,  advertising  for  employment;  making  employment  decisions;  setting  employee  wages;  standardized  or  strict  rules  of  operation;  and  standardized training methods for employees. Compl. ¶  64(k); id ¶ 65(g). These alleged facts state a plausible  claim for joint employment. To be clear, the Court does not read section 1595 of  TVPRA  requiring  hotels  or  their  franchisors  to  affirmatively stop sex trafficking. See A.B. v. Marriott  Int'l, Inc., CV 19-5770, 455 F. Supp. 3d 171, 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 70644, 2020 WL 1939678, at *8 (E.D. Pa.  Apr. 22, 2020) (""We do not read the Act as requiring  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *16 Page 7 of 11 hotels (and other businesses or professions possibly  earning money from trafficking) to affirmatively stop the  trafficking.""). But the Court finds that Plaintiff has  alleged sufficient facts to support a plausible claim that  Wyndham and Choice received financial benefits from a  venture they vicariously participate in (through their  franchisees) that the franchisees should have known  was engaged in sex trafficking of B.M. in violation of  section 1595. Choice and Wyndham argue that ""[t]here is no case law  that supports the idea that a simple agency relationship  [...] is sufficient to create liability under the TVPRA.""  Choice Motion at 14; see also Wyndham Reply at 6, n.5,  ECF 62. The Court disagrees. [*21]  For example, in  A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., Judge Kearney held: We agree A.B. does not plead facts after two  attempts allowing us to reasonably infer Marriott  knew of sex trafficking victimizing her. But A.B.  sufficiently pleads specific facts from which we can  reasonably infer Marriott, under an actual agency  theory subject to discovery, knowingly benefitted  from participating in a venture which it should have  known engaged in her trafficking. This is all  Congress requires a victim to plead. A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70644,  2020 WL 1939678, at *1. Wyndham acknowledges this  holding but disagrees with it. See Wyndham Reply at 6  n. 2 (""The court in A.B. denied a motion to dismiss by a  hotel franchisor on the narrow grounds that the  complaint alleged an agency relationship between the  franchisor and independent third-party franchisees.  A.B., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70644, 2020 WL 1939678,  at *19. The TVPRA, however, does not provide for  secondary liability.""). Neither Wyndham nor Choice has  provided any authority to support the assertion or  explain why the well-established agency liability is  inapplicable to TVPRA claims. See M.A. v. Wyndham  Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 972 (denying  motion to dismiss allegations of vicarious liability under  agency theory for a TVPRA civil claim). 3. Shotgun Pleading Wyndham and Choice contend that the Complaint [*22]   is an impermissible ""shotgun"" pleading. Wyndham  Motion at 3-4; Choice Motion at 4-6. Shotgun pleadings  are pleadings that overwhelm defendants with an  unclear mass of allegations and make it difficult or  impossible for defendants to make informed responses  to the plaintiff's allegations."" Sollberger v. Wachovia  Sec., LLC, No. SACV 09-0766AGANX, 2010 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 66233, 2010 WL 2674456, at *4 (C.D. Cal. June  30, 2010). The Court is not persuaded that the  Complaint in this case is a shotgun pleading. Although the Complaint contains many allegations that  seem to relate to the hospitality industry in general, it  also includes numerous factual allegations specific to  each Defendant. See e.g., Complaint ¶¶ 64 (allegations  specific to Wyndham); 65 (allegations specific to  Choice). Plaintiff identifies the specific hotel locations  where she was allegedly trafficked and ties those  locations to each Defendant. See Compl. ¶¶ 10; 11.  While Plaintiff's allegations regarding her experience at  each hotel is not a model for specificity, she does allege  facts as to each Defendant. See e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 68  (""For two years, Plaintiff's traffickers rented two  adjoining rooms at the Super 8 and Clarion Inn. Plaintiff  was one of several other girls that were being  simultaneously [*23]  trafficked in these two rooms."");  69 (""Clarion Inn employees threatened to eject Plaintiff  B.M. and her traffickers, but never took further action."").  Thus, the Complaint cannot be fairly categorized as an  ""everyone did everything"" pleading. Destfino v. Reiswig,  630 F.3d 952, 958 (9th Cir. 2011). Choice argues that  ""Plaintiff incorporates every prior allegation into her  claim."" But ""a complaint does not employ impermissible  shotgun pleading just because it re-alleges by reference  all of the factual paragraphs preceding the claims for  relief."" Espinosa v. Bluemercury, Inc., No. 16-CV-07202- JST, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41885, 2017 WL 1079553,  at *5 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 22, 2017). As noted at the Hearing, the Court is concerned that  B.M.'s allegations against the three Defendants are  factually independent because the Defendants (all  independent public companies) are not alleged to have  any connection with each other — other than the fact  that B.M was allegedly trafficked in three separate  franchisee hotels related to each Defendant. The Court  also recognizes the practical issues raised by Choice.  For example, Plaintiff fails to allege when she visited  each location at issue, how frequently she visited, and  for what period of time. See Choice Motion at 6. But the  Court is not persuaded that these concerns warrant a  dismissal of [*24]  the entire Complaint as ""shotgun  pleading"", but instead can be resolved through case  management conferences and discovery motions. That  said, because the Court is granting Plaintiff leave to  amend her Complaint, she is instructed to add as many  details as possible about her stays at each location. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *20 Page 8 of 11 III. CHOICE'S MOTION TO STRIKE Choice moves to strike paragraphs 20 to 61 in the  Complaint  because  they  contain  ""salacious  and  impertinent details[.]"" Choice Motion at 6. Choice  contends that the allegations are not related to the facts  in controversy and will only serve to prejudice Choice  and confuse the issues. Id. B.M. responds that the  challenged paragraphs contain contextual and factual  allegations and provide support as to Choice's  constructive notice of the sex trafficking issues on its  properties. Opp'n to Choice at 20-21, ECF 58. B.M. also  contends that Choice fails to prove that it is prejudiced  by the factual allegations. Id. The Court finds that the  challenged paragraphs provide relevant background  information for B.M.'s claims against Defendants, as  uncomfortable as that may be for Choice, and thus,  DENIES Choice's Motion to Strike. A. Legal Standard Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12(f) permits a  court to ""strike [*25]  from a pleading an insufficient  defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or  scandalous matter."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). A matter is  impertinent if it consists of statements that do not  pertain to and are not necessary to the issues in  question. Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty, 984 F.2d 1524, 1527  (9th Cir.1993), rev'd on other grounds, 510 U.S. 517,  114 S. Ct. 1023, 127 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1994).  ""Scandalous"" under Rule 12(f) ""generally refers to any  allegation that unnecessarily reflects on the moral  character of an individual or states anything in repulsive  language that detracts from the dignity of the court.""  Gallegos v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of San  Francisco, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74207, 2016 WL  3162203, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Jun. 7, 2016) (citations  omitted). ""Scandalous"" has also been defined as  allegations that cast a ""cruelly derogatory light"" on  someone. Holmes v. Elec. Document Processing, Inc.,  966 F. Supp. 2d 925, 938 (N.D. Cal. 2013) (citations  omitted). Motions to strike are generally disfavored and ""should  not be granted unless the matter to be stricken clearly  could have no possible bearing on the subject of the  litigation."" Platte Anchor Bolt, Inc. v. IHI, Inc., 352  F.Supp.2d  1048,  1057  (N.D.Cal.2004)  (citations  omitted). A court should not strike allegations supplying  background or historical material unless it is unduly  prejudicial to the opponent. See LeDuc v. Ky. Cent. Life  Ins. Co., 814 F.Supp. 820, 830 (N.D.Cal.1992). Indeed,  if there is any doubt whether the challenged matter  might bear on an issue in the litigation, the motion to  strike should be denied, and assessment of the  sufficiency of the allegations left for adjudication on the  merits. Rees v. PNC Bank, N.A., 308 F.R.D. 266, 271  (N.D. Cal. 2015). A court should [*26]  view the pleading  in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Id.  Whether to grant a motion to strike lies within the sound  discretion of the district court. Id. B. Discussion While many of the challenged paragraphs are not  directly relevant to B.M.'s claims against Defendants,  they nonetheless supply information regarding the  general issue of sex trafficking and the role of the  hospitality industry. See Compl. ¶¶ 20-61. Viewing the  pleading in the light most favorable to B.M., some of the  paragraphs Choice seeks to strike provide background  information as to Choice's general policy in dealing with  sex trade and its constructive knowledge about such  issues. See e.g., id. ¶¶ 52-53. The background  information is therefore related to the claims against  Choice and helps with a fuller understanding of the  Complaint as a whole. See Sec. & Exch. Comm. v.  Strong Inv. Mgmt., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 232678, 2018  WL 8731559, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 9, 2018) (denying  motion to strike because the challenged allegations  provide some historical background and context to the  claims at issue and they give a full understanding when  read with the complaint as a whole). Moreover, the  challenged paragraphs are not unduly prejudicial to  Choice. Even though the background information may  portray Choice in an unfavorable [*27]  way, Choice will  have opportunities to challenge the allegations by  evidence at a later stage in the proceedings. See Kaiser  Found. Hosp. v. Cal. Nurses Ass'n, 2012 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 16563, 2012 WL 440634, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Feb.  10, 2012) (denying motion to strike even though the  background information portrayed the defendant in an  unfavorable light because defendants would have  opportunities to challenge the allegations as the case  proceeds). Choice also claims that paragraphs 20 to 61 should be  stricken because they are impertinent and scandalous.  Choice Motion at 6. The Court disagrees. As discussed  above, the challenged paragraphs are not impertinent  because they provide relevant background information.  Moreover,  the  challenged  allegations  are  not  scandalous because they do not go into ""salacious"" or  ""needless details."" See Compl. ¶¶ 20-61; Gallegos,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *24 Page 9 of 11 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74207, 2016 WL 3162203, at *3  (holding that the challenged allegations regarding  defendant's long history of sexually harassing conducts  were not scandalous within the meaning of Rule 12(f)  because they did not go into ""salacious"" or ""needless  details"" even though the topic is naturally sensitive and  unseemly). Although the allegations in paragraphs 20- 61 of the Complaint might portray Defendants in an  unfavorable way, they do not rise to the level of being  ""cruelly derogatory."" See Holmes, 966 F. Supp. 2d at  938 (holding that [*28]  the allegations were not  scandalous because they did not rise to the level of  casing the defendant in a ""cruelly derogatory light"").  Therefore, Choice's Motion to Strike is DENIED. IV. B.M.'S USE OF PSEUDONYM In her Complaint, B.M. requests that the Court grant a  protective order and permit her to proceed under a  pseudonym. Compl. ¶ 9(b). B.M. agrees to reveal her  identity to Defendants for the limited purposes of  investigating her claims once the parties have entered  into a protective order. Id. ¶ 9(f). B.M. seeks redactions  of her personal identifying information from the public  docket and assurances that Defendants will not use or  publish her identity in a manner that will compromise her  personal life or future employment prospects. Id. In its motion, Choice argues that B.M. is not entitled to  proceed anonymously in court proceedings because  she has not demonstrated sufficient grounds for her  request and has not filed a motion for a protective order  and leave to proceed anonymously in this Court. Choice  Motion at 18-19. Nevertheless, Defendants do not  oppose B.M. proceeding by pseudonym for purposes of  pre-trial public filings only. Joint Case Management  Statement at 9; ECF 71. In [*29]  her opposition, B.M.  contends that pseudonym status is warranted due to the  sensitive nature of the issues and the risk of harm to her  as a victim of sex trafficking. Opp'n to Choice at 22. In  addition, prejudice to Choice can be reduced as B.M.  will agree to reveal her identity to Choice, and the public  interest will not be threatened because the bulk of the  case will still be on public record. Id. at 22-23. The Court  permits B.M.'s use of pseudonym in this case because  her need for anonymity outweighs the risk of prejudice  to Choice at the current stage and the public interest in  knowing her identity. A. Legal Standard Rule 10(a) commands that the title of every complaint  ""include the names of all the parties."" Fed. R. Civ. P.  10(a). However, the Ninth Circuit allows parties to use  pseudonyms  under  special  circumstances  where  nondisclosure of the party's identity is necessary to  protect a person from harassment, injury, ridicule or  personal embarrassment. Does I through XXIII v.  Advanced Textile, 214 F.3d 1058, 1067-68 (9th Cir.  2000) (citations omitted). A court must balance the need  for anonymity against the risk of prejudice to the  opposing party and the public's interest in knowing the  party's identity. Jane Roes 1-2 v. SFBSC Mgmt., LLC,  77 F. Supp. 3d 990, 993 (N.D. Cal. 2015); Does I  through XXIII, 214 F.3d at 1068. Applying the balancing  test, courts have permitted [*30]  plaintiffs to use  pseudonyms in three situations: (1) when identification  creates a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm; (2)  when anonymity is necessary to preserve privacy in a  matter of sensitive and highly personal nature; and (3)  when the anonymous party is compelled to admit his or  her intention to engage in illegal conduct. Jane Roes 1- 2, 77 F. Supp. 3d at 993 (citing Does I through XXIII,  214 F.3d at 1068). And the Court must determine the precise prejudice at  each stage of the proceedings to the opposing party,  and whether proceedings may be structured so as to  mitigate that prejudice. Does I through XXIII, 214 F.3d at  1068. Finally, the Court must decide whether the  public's interest in the case would be best served by  requiring that the litigants reveal their identities. Id. at  1069. In cases where plaintiff has demonstrated a need  for anonymity, the district court should use its powers to  manage pretrial proceedings under Rule 16(b) and to  issue protective orders limiting disclosure of the party's  name under Rule 26(c) ""to preserve the party's  anonymity to the greatest extent possible without  prejudicing the opposing party's ability to litigate the  case."" Id.; Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b); Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c). B. Discussion The Court permits B.M. to use a pseudonym because  B.M.'s need for anonymity outweighs [*31]  the risk of  prejudice to Defendants at the current stage of this case  and the public interest in knowing the B.M.'s identity.  First, B.M.'s need for anonymity weighs heavily in favor  of granting such permission. B.M. is a victim of sex  trafficking, she was trafficked when she was a minor,  and this case involves the disclosure of sensitive and  highly personal information. See Compl. ¶ 9(d); Opp'n to  Choice at 22. The Court finds it necessary to protect  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *27 Page 10 of 11 B.M.'s privacy in this case. See Doe v. Penzato, No.  CV10-5154 MEJ, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51681, 2011  WL 1833007, at *5 (N.D. Cal. May 13, 2011) (granting  the plaintiff's petition to proceed anonymously where  she alleged she was a victim of human trafficking,  forced labor, and sexual battery); Doe v. Kuo Huei Lee,  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20686, 2014 WL 630936, at * 2  (N.D. Cal. Feb. 18, 2014) (""[B]ecause being taken  advantage of in a sexual manner as a minor is of a  highly sensitive and personal nature, cases of involving  such an issue have often been found to allow for the  use of a fictitious name.""). On the other hand, there is a low risk of prejudice to  Defendants at the current stage, and the public interest  is better served if B.M. is allowed to proceed  anonymously. Prejudice to Defendants is minimal  because B.M. will agree to reveal her identity for  purposes [*32]  of investigating her claims. See Opp'n to  Choice at 24; Compl. ¶ 9(f). In addition, the public  interest in knowing the parties' identities is not  threatened where, as here, there is nothing about the  Plaintiff's identity which makes it ""critical to the working  of justice"" and the basic facts of the case will be on  public record. See Jane Roes 1-2, 77 F. Supp. 3d at  997 (holding that the public interest is not threatened  because there was nothing important about the plaintiff's  identity alone and the facts of the case would be on  public record). Indeed, allowing victims of sexual assault  to proceed anonymously serves strong public interest  because other victims will not be deterred from reporting  such crimes. See Heineke v. Santa Clara Univ., No. 17- CV-05285-LHK, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201163, 2017  WL 6026248, at *23 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 5, 2017) (holding  that the public interest is served in allowing an alleged  victim of sexual harassment to be sued under  pseudonym to avoid deterring other victims from coming  forward). Therefore, B.M. is permitted to proceed  anonymously  because  her  need  for  anonymity  outweighs the risk of prejudice to Defendants and the  public interest in knowing her identity. Choice also argues that B.M. has not filed a motion for  protective  order  and  leave  to  proceed  anonymously [*33]  in this Court. However, the Ninth  Circuit does not require a plaintiff to obtain leave to  proceed anonymously before filing an anonymous  pleading. Doe v. Penzato, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51681,  2011 WL 1833007, at *4 (""Although some Circuits  require plaintiffs to obtain leave of the court before filing  an anonymous pleading, the Ninth Circuit does not."");  see also Doe v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of Am., 164 F.  Supp. 3d 1140, 1144 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (holding that a  plaintiff is not required to obtain leave to proceed  anonymously before filing an anonymous pleading  because any attempt to proceed anonymously would be  pointless if a plaintiff had to use his or her real name  first).

"Bacon v. Marshall, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 32309.pdf","[*1] ORDER AND JUDGMENT* _________________________________ Before BACHARACH, KELLY, and MORITZ, Circuit  Judges. _________________________________ Michael Bacon, proceeding pro se, appeals the district  court's order dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim under Bivens v.  Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), or  42 U.S.C. § 1983.1 Because Bacon waived appellate review by failing to challenge  much of the district court's *After examining the briefs and appellate record, this  panel has determined unanimously that oral argument  would not materially assist in the determination of this  appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R.  34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted  without oral argument. This order and judgment is not  binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of  the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. But it  may be cited for its persuasive value. See Fed. R. App.  P. 32.1(a); 10th Cir. R. 32.1(A). 1 We liberally construe Bacon's pro se filings, but we will  not act as his advocate. See Garrett v. Selby Connor  Maddux & Janer, 425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005). Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 2 order  and  because  the  district  court  correctly  determined that Bacon's allegations constitute a new Bivens context with at least one special  factor counseling against extending that remedy, we affirm. Background [*2]  Bacon alleges that various John Does, Derrik Marshall  (his federal probation officer), and Judicial Supervision Services (JSS, a  private contractor that collects urine samples for probation services) violated his rights  under the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United  States Constitution. In particular, Bacon alleges that Marshall held a grudge against him  because of his involvement in a prior lawsuit that made it more difficult for the  government to protect the identity of its cooperators.2 According to Bacon, Marshall said  Page 2 of 4 that he would make sure Bacon had a ""difficult time"" and ""would not be fair with  [Bacon]."" R. 51 (capitalization standardized). Bacon further alleges that  Marshall caused him to become homeless and then had him arrested because  he was homeless. He also alleges that Marshall fabricated probation violations as  pretext for Bacon's arrest and lied to a magistrate judge about Bacon's conduct so that  Bacon would remain 2This allegation is presumably related to proceedings in  which Bacon sought to unseal the supplement to his  plea agreement because it stated that he had not  cooperated with the government. See United States v.  Bacon, 950 F.3d 1286, 1290 (10th Cir. 2020). The  district court refused to unseal the supplement, citing a  local rule requiring all plea supplements be [*3]  sealed  to create ""uniformity,"" ostensibly to protect the identity of  cooperators. Id. (quoting R. vol. 1, 45). On appeal, we  vacated and remanded the district court's decision after  concluding that it plainly erred by ignoring the common- law presumption of access to judicial records and failing  to make case-specific findings to support sealing. Id. at  1293, 1297. 2 Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 3 incarcerated. In addition, Bacon alleges that JSS, with  Marshall's approval, committed ""a form of sexual assault  and a form of rape"" when it forced him to remove his  clothing before providing a urine sample. Id. at 53  (capitalization standardized). A magistrate judge screened Bacon's in forma pauperis  (IFP) complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B) and  recommended dismissing it sua sponte for failure to  state a claim. The magistrate judge determined that  because Bacon alleged defendants acted under color of  federal law, not state law, his claims were properly  brought under Bivens, not § 1983. And the magistrate  judge further recommended dismissing those Bivens  claims because (1) Bacon's allegations that Marshall  committed perjury to revoke Bacon's supervised release  constituted a new Bivens context [*4]  not previously  recognized by the Supreme Court and (2) Bacon's  ability to bring suit against Marshall under the Federal  Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. § 2674, and the  ""potential interference with the important work of  supervising officers"" counseled against extending the  Bivens remedy. R. 128. The magistrate judge also  concluded that Bacon's Bivens claims against JSS-a  private entity acting under color of federal law-was  precluded by Supreme Court precedent declining to  extend the Bivens remedy to actions against private  federal contractors. See Corr. Servs. Corp. v.Malesko,  534 U.S. 61, 66 (2001). The district court adopted the magistrate judge's report  and recommendation in its entirety over Bacon's  objections. And it later denied Bacon's reconsideration  motion, reiterating that Bacon could not rely on § 1983  to sue JSS or any individual 3 Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 4 defendants because he alleged no facts to support the  proposition that defendants had acted under color of  state law. The district court also noted Bacon failed to  state a claim under the FTCA because he had not  presented his claims to the appropriate federal agency  first. Bacon appeals. Analysis ""We review de novo the district court's decision to  dismiss an IFP complaint under [*5]  28 U.S.C. §  1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim."" Kay v.  Bemis, 500 F.3d 1214, 1217 (10th Cir. 2007). ""In  determining whether a dismissal is proper, we must  accept the allegations of the complaint as true and  construe  those  allegations,  and  any  reasonable  inferences that might be drawn from them, in the light  most favorable to the plaintiff."" Gaines v. Stenseng, 292  F.3d 1222, 1224 (10th Cir. 2002). ""Dismissal of a pro se  complaint for failure to state a claim is proper only  where it is obvious that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the  facts he has alleged and it would be futile to give him an  opportunity to amend."" Curley v. Perry, 246 F.3d 1278,  1281 (10th Cir. 2001) (quoting Perkins v. Kan. Dep't of  Corrs., 165 F.3d 803, 806 (10th Cir. 1999)). On appeal, Bacon asserts simply that he should be able  to sue Marshall and JSS, but he does nothing to  develop that position. At best, he seeks to incorporate  Page 3 of 4 by reference the arguments he raised below, which we  do not permit. See Fed. R. App. P. 28.3(B) (stating that  ""[i]ncorporating by reference portions of lower court or  agency briefs or pleadings is disapproved and does not  satisfy"" our briefing 4 Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 5 requirements). Bacon has therefore waived any  challenge to most of the district court's rulings, including  that his § 1983 claims fail for lack of state action and  that his Bivens claim against JSS is barred by binding  Supreme Court precedent. [*6]  SeeUnited States v.  Fisher, 805 F.3d 982, 990-91 (10th Cir. 2015) (finding  argumentswaived  through  inadequate  appellate  briefing). The only argument even passingly developed  in Bacon's brief is his position that the district court erred  in holding that the FTCA provided an alternative remedy  counseling against extending Bivens to his claims  against Marshall, so this is the only argument we will  consider here. In Bivens, the Supreme Court recognized a cause of  action against federal officials for alleged Fourth  Amendment violations. See Egbert v. Boule, 596 U.S.  482, 490 (2022). And ""[o]ver the following decade, the  Court twice again fashioned new causes of action under  the Constitution-first, for a former congressional staffer's  Fifth Amendment sex-discrimination claim; and second,  for a federal prisoner's inadequate-care claim under the  Eighth Amendment."" Id. at 490-91 (citations omitted).  However, ""[s]ince these cases, the Court has not  implied  additional  causes  of  action  under  the  Constitution."" Id. at 491. The Supreme Court has instructed that when faced with  Bivens claims, lower courts should engage in a two-step  inquiry, as the district court did here. The first question  is whether the case presents a new context in that it is  ""'meaningful[ly]' different from the three cases in which  the Court has implied a damages action."" Id. at 492  (alteration in original) [*7]  (quoting Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582  U.S. 120, 139 (2017)). ""Second, if a claim arises in a  new context, a Bivens remedy is unavailable if there 5 Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 6 are 'special factors' indicating that the [j]udiciary is at  least arguably less equipped than Congress to 'weigh  the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to  proceed.'"" Id. (quoting Ziglar, 582 U.S. at 136).  Moreover, the Supreme Court has explained ""those  [two] steps often resolve to a single question: whether  there is any reason to think that Congress might be  better equipped to create a damages remedy."" Id. Here, the district court concluded that Bacon's  allegations that Marshall committed perjury to revoke  Bacon's supervised release were ""different in a  meaningful way from previous Bivens cases"" because  he did not allege unreasonable search and seizure, sex  discrimination, or deliberate indifference to medical  needs. R. 128; see also Ziglar, 582 U.S. at 139. Bacon  does not purport to challenge the conclusion that this is  a new Bivens context, and other circuits have held as  much in similar circumstances. See Xi v. Haugen, 68  F.4th 824, 834 (3d Cir. 2023) (finding new context  where plaintiff ""allege[d] that federal agents made false  statements and material omissions of exculpatory  evidence [*8]  that led the [g]overnment to investigate,  arrest, and prosecute him""); Cantú v. Moody, 933 F.3d  414, 423 (5th Cir. 2019) (finding new context where  plaintiff alleged that officers ""falsified affidavits""). Given  Bacon's waiver of this issue and this persuasive circuit  authority, we agree with the district court that this is a  new Bivens context. As to special factors counseling hesitation before  expanding Bivens to this new context, we recently  observed that ""expanding Bivens is not just 'a  disfavored judicial activity,' it is an action that is  impermissible in virtually all circumstances."" 6 Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 7 Silva v. United States, 45 F.4th 1134, 1140 (10th Cir.  2022) (quotingZiglar, 582 U.S. at 135). A court will not  expand Bivens if ""Congress is better positioned to  create remedies in the"" new context at hand or if ""the  [g]overnment already has provided alternative remedies  that protect plaintiffs."" Id. at 1141. Here, the district court  found that both special factors applied, reasoning that  Congress was better equipped to create remedies in  this context because of the ""potential interference with  the important work of supervising officers"" and that the  FTCA provided an alternative remedy. Page 4 of 4 On appeal, Bacon purports to challenge only the latter  ruling. But even if we were [*9]  to agree with him that  the FTCA is not an alternative remedy counseling  against extending Bivens, that would not be reason  enough to reverse. The district court's concern about  Congress being better suited to create a remedy to  avoid interfering with the work of probation officers is  sufficient, standing alone, to counsel against expanding  Bivens. See Silva, 45 F.4th at 1141; Carvajal v. United  States, No. 20-CV-567, 2021 WL 2814883, at *4-5 (N.D.  Tex. May 11, 2021) (unpublished) (""Supervision-based  Bivens claims like this . . . could possibly interfere with  the difficult responsibilities of probation officers.""), report  and recommendationadopted, 2021 WL 2808966 (N.D.  Tex. July 6, 2021) (unpublished). And Bacon waived  any argument to the contrary by not making one in his  brief. So we conclude that this case, like ""virtually all""  new Bivens contexts, is not appropriate for extending  the Bivens remedy. Silva, 45 F.4th at 1140. We  accordingly affirm the district court's dismissal order. 7 Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 8 As a final matter, we grant Bacon's motion to proceed  IFP on appeal and deny his motion asking for an order  directing his prison to provide him with certain legal  documents."

The trial court  imposed [*2]  an aggregate sentence of 114 to 228 months' incarceration. On  appeal, Appellant claims there  was  insufficient  evidence  supporting  his  convictions for sexual assault and indecent assault, the verdict was against the weight  of the evidence, and the trial court abused its discretion by imposing  consecutive sentences.

This Court consolidated these appeals sua sponte on  July 10, 2023. See Order, 7/10/23. 2 The record contains various spellings of Appellant's  first name as ""Richardo,"" ""Richard,"" and ""Ricardo."" The  last spelling was used in the trial transcripts and criminal  dockets; therefore, [*3]  we will utilize it in our  memorandum. 3 18 Pa.C.S. 3124.1, 2701(a)(1), 3126 (a)(1), and  2701(a)(1), respectively. on the evening of August 17, 2020. The trial court  summarized the circumstances concerning Appellant's assault of his first  victim, J.G., as follows: At trial, [J.G.] testified that on August 17, 2020,  Appellant came to pick her up and the two drove around  in Appellant's car. The two had an intimate relationship a year previous to  the two meeting up again. After driving around and  stopping to get an alcoholic beverage, the two got a  hotel room [at the Red Roof Inn. J.G.] believed the two  were going to eat pizza and watch a movie, and  Appellant specifically told her that 'he wasn't gonna try  anything.' Once in the room for a few hours, Appellant  asked [J.G.] several times to get into the shower with him. At  one point, . . . Appellant followed [J.G.] into the bathroom and  began to kiss her neck. She continued to deny his  advances and Appellant became annoyed and angry.  Appellant told [J.G.] that if she was not going to get  comfortable, he was going to leave. It was then that she  took her pants off and laid on the bed. Appellant asked if he could put his mouth on [J.G.'s]  vagina, to which she said no. However, Appellant  pushed her [*4]  panties down and put his mouth on her  vagina. [J.G.] tried to push Appellant's head away and he eventually stopped.  However, Appellant then took his penis out and beg[a]n trying to  force it into her vagina. [J.G.] testified that after  Appellant tried to force his penis into her vagina, and it  hurt, he then pushed his penis into her [anus]. Appellant  was on top of [J.G.] and his body weight held her down,  while she tossed and turned to avoid . . . contact, he forced his penis into her 'anal part.' [J.G.]  testified that the penetration lasted between [two] to  [three] minutes and on a scale of pain from [one] to 10,  was a 10. After Appellant removed his penis from  [J.G.'s] 'anal part' he attempted to put his penis in her  mouth; however, she pushed Appellant off of her sat up  and put her pants on. Trial Ct. Op. 5-6 (record citations omitted). At that point, J.G., attempted to leave and called her  cousin to pick her Page 3 of 11 up from the Red Roof Inn, but Appellant grabbed the  phone away from her. See Trial Ct. Op. at 6. Appellant then drove J.G. home.  Id. Later that night, J.G. was experiencing so much pain she went to the  hospital to be examined.4 Id.  There, she was interviewed by Detective Lee  Tarasi [*5]  of the Susquehanna Township Police Department. Id. J.G. stated that she  never consented to oral, vaginal, or anal sex with Appellant. Id. Shortly after the assault of J.G., Appellant asked his  second victim, C.L., to meet him at the Red Roof Inn in the same room he  had spent the earlier hours of the evening with J.G. Appellant and C.L.  shared an ""on again off again intimate relationship."" Trial Ct. Op. at 6. The trial  court described Appellant's assault of C.L. as follows: Appellant [asked C.L.] to meet up with him, which she  did. . . . When Appellant let [C.L.] into the room, she sat on the  edge of the bed and the two started talking. Appellant  became angry and he approached [C.L.] and ripped  shirt and bra off. Appellant also ripped a necklace off from [C.L.'s] neck  and began calling her names. Appellant told [C.L.] to  take her shorts off, which she did, and then pushed her  panties to the side and put his penis inside of her  vagina. [ ] Appellant then threw wooden hangers at  [C.L.] and punched her in the nose. She took pictures of  the injuries she sustained as the result of the hangers  hitting her and Appellant punching her in the nose. She  had injuries to her nose, eye, arms, hands and leg. [*6]   While [C.L.] was at the sink trying to address her  bleeding nose, Appellant walked up behind her and  inserted his penis into her again; however, when she  told him to stop, he did. [C.L.] testified that when she  met Appellant at the hotel that evening, it was not her  intent to have sex with him. 4 Jessica Martin, a forensic nurse examiner, performed  an examination of J.G. on August 18, 2020. See Trial  Ct. Op. at 7. Nurse Martain indicated that ""[w]hile [J.G.'s] physical examination did not reveal any  acute injuries to the vagina or anus, . . . that was not  uncommon in sexual assault cases."" Id. at 8 (record  citation omitted). [C.L.] left the hotel room in the morning and the two  exchanged conversations back and forth over the  following two weeks, including threats from Appellant.  She eventually received a text from Appellant accusing  her of going to the police regarding a sexual assault.  She explained that she had not contacted the police, but  about a week later, she reported the incident at the  hotel. Id. at 6-7 (record citations omitted). Detective Kevin Scott of the Susquehanna Township  Police Department testified and confirmed C.L. contacted the police  department on August 29, 2020. See [*7]  Trial Ct. Op. at 8. Given the amount of  time that had passed since the assault, Detective Scott did not recommend that  C.L. undergo an examination. Id. at 8-9. Procedural History On September 22, 2020, a criminal complaint at CP-22- CR-0003351- 2020 (Docket No. 3351) was filed charging Appellant  with two counts of sexual assault, one count of terroristic threats, two counts of  indecent assault, and one count of simple assault relating to the assault of  C.L. On that same day, a  criminal  complaint  at  CP-22-CR-0003352-2020  (Docket No. 3352) was filed charging Appellant with three counts of sexual assault  and one count of indecent assault, and one count of simple assault  relating to the assault of Page 4 of 11 J.G. The matter proceeded to a two-day jury trial, which  began on December 6, 2021. The jury heard testimony from both victims,  J.G. and C.L., Detectives Tarasi and Scott, and Nurse Martin. The jury convicted  Appellant of all charges the following day. On March 2, 2022, the trial court sentenced Appellant  as follows. At Docket No. 3351, the court imposed two  terms of 60 to 120 months' incarceration for both sexual  assault convictions, and four terms of three to 24 months' incarceration for the terrorist threats, [*8]   indecent assault, and simple assault convictions. All  Docket No. 3351-2020 sentences were imposed to run  concurrently with each other. At Docket No. 3352-2020,  the court imposed three terms of 54 to 108 months'  imprisonment for all three sexual assault convictions,  and a term of three to 24 months' imprisonment for the  indecent assault conviction. All Docket No. 3352-2020  sentences were imposed to run concurrently. The court  then ordered that both dockets be served consecutively,  which amounted to an aggregate term of 114 to 228  months' incarceration.5 On March 14, 2022, Appellant filed a post-sentence  motion at both dockets, which the trial court denied 16  days later. Appellant originally filed a timely notice of  appeal at Docket No. 3351, but it was withdrawn and  discontinued at the request of Appellant's counsel.6 5 Appellant was determined not to be a sexually violent  predator. 6 See Notice of Discontinuance of Action, 6/6/22.  On September 7, 2022, and October 20, 2022,  Appellant filed separate pro se petitions under the Post- Conviction Relief Act (PCRA)7 at each docket, and  counsel was appointed by court order. On October 10,  2022, Appellant filed an amended PCRA petition at  Docket [*9]  No. 3351, raising one issue regarding the  reinstatement of his post-sentence and direct appeal  rights due to a purported miscommunication with his trial  counsel. On January 19, 2023, the PCRA court entered  an amended order, appointing counsel also at Docket  No. 3352, noting the matters were consolidated, and  providing that ""[m]oving forward, the caption regarding  [Appellant]'s PCRA filings shall include both docket  numbers."" Amended Order, 1/19/23. An evidentiary  hearing was scheduled for March 7, 2023. However, on  February 28, 2023, the Commonwealth filed a  stipulation, indicating it would not object to the  reinstatement of Appellant's post-sentencing and direct  appeal rights. On March 2, 2023, the PCRA court  cancelled the evidentiary hearing and reinstated  Appellant's requested rights. 7 42 Pa.C.S. 9541-9546. On March 11, 2023, Appellant filed post-sentence  motions nunc protunc,8 which the trial court denied April  27, 2023. These timely notices of appeal followed.9, Issues Appellant presents the following issues for our review:  Whether the [t]rial [c]ourt erred as a matter of law  and/or abused its discretion in denying Appellant's  challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence presented at  trial to sustain [*10]  a conviction for sexual assault and  indecent assault? Whether the [t]rial [c]ourt erred as a  matter of law and/or abused its discretion in denying  Appellant's challenge to the weight of the evidence  regarding Appellant's conviction for sexual assault and  indecent assault? Whether the [t]rial [c]ourt erred as a  matter of law and/or abused its discretion in denying  Appellant's  request  for  reconsideration  and/or  modification of sentence to have the two dockets run  concurrent rather than consecutive, as set forth in  Appellant's [m]otion for [p]ost[-s]entence [r]elief? Appellant's Brief at 5.10 Analysis 8 In the motions, Appellant raised sufficiency, weight,  discretionary aspects of sentencing challenges. 9 The trial court directed Appellant to comply with  Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b). Appellant timely filed his concise  statement of errors complained of on appeal on June  12, 2023. The trial court issued its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a)  opinion on July 14, 2023. 10Based on the nature of Appellant's claims, we have  reordered them for ease of disposition. In his first issue on appeal, Appellant challenges the  Page 5 of 11 sufficiency of the evidence supporting both his sexual assault and  indecent assault convictions. See  Appellant's Brief at 15. Regarding his sexual [*11]   assault convictions, Appellant applies the same argument to both victims,  simply contending he did not engage in non-consensual intercourse. See id.  at 16-17. We review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence  by the following standard: As a general matter, our standard of review [for a  sufficiency claim] requires that we evaluate the record in  the light most favorable to the verdict winner giving the  prosecution the benefit of all reasonable inferences to  be drawn from the evidence. Evidence will be deemed  sufficient to support the verdict when it establishes each  material element of the crime charged and the  commission  thereof  by  the  accused  beyond  a  reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth  need not establish guilt to a mathematical certainty. Any  doubt about the defendant's guilt is to be resolved by  the fact finder unless the evidence is so weak and  inconclusive that, as a matter of law, no probability of  fact can be drawn from the combined circumstances. The Commonwealth may sustain its burden by means of  wholly circumstantial evidence. Accordingly, [t]he fact  that  the  evidence  establishing  a  defendant's  participating in a crime is circumstantial does not  preclude a conviction [*12]  where the evidence coupled  with the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom  overcomes the presumption of innocence. Significantly,  we may not substitute out judgment for that of the fact  finder; thus, so long as the evidence adduced, accepted  in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth,  demonstrates the respective elements of a defendant's  crimes beyond a reasonable doubt, the . . . convictions will be upheld. Commonwealth v. Windslowe, 158 A.3d 698, 708-09  (Pa. Super. 2017) (citation omitted). Pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. 3124.1, a defendant commits  the crime of sexual assault, a felony of the second  degree,  ""when  that  person  engages  in  sexual  intercourse or deviate sexual intercourse with a  complainant without the complainant's consent."" Sexual  intercourse is defined as follows: ""In addition to its  ordinary meaning, includes intercourse per os or per  anus, with some penetration however slight; emission is  not required."" 18 Pa.C.S.  3101. Deviate sexual intercourse is defined as: ""Sexual  intercourse per os or per anus between human beings. .  . . The term also includes penetration, however slight, of  the genitals or anus of another person with a foreign  object for any purpose other than good faith medical,  hygienic or law enforcement procedures."" Id. Consent [*13]  as a defense is defined, in relevant part,  under the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, as follows: ""The  consent of the victim to conduct charged to constitute an  offense or to the result thereof is a defense if such  consent negatives an element of the offense or  precludes the infliction of the harm or evil sought to be  prevented by the law defining the offense."" 18 Pa.C.S.  311. Moreover, ""[i]t is well established that resistance to  sexual assault is not required to sustain a conviction.""  Commonwealth v. Cramer, 195 A.3d 594, 602 (Pa.  Super. 2018) (citation & internal citation omitted). See  also 18 Pa.C.S. 3107 (resistance not required). Under  Pennsylvania law, even ""the uncorroborated testimony  of a sexual assault victim, if believed by the trier of fact,  is  sufficient  to  convict  a  defendant.""  Commonwealth v. Trippett, 932 A.2d 188, 201 (Pa.  Super. 2007) (citations omitted). As for the first victim, J.G., the trial testimony reveals the  following. J.G. testified that Appellant invited the victim  to the hotel room where J.G. believed the two were  going to ""chill"" and eat pizza. N.T., 12/6/21, at 109.  Appellant told her he was not going to try anything. Id.  Over the course of the evening, Appellant repeatedly  asked J.G. to get into the shower with him. Id. at 114. He followed J.G. into the bathroom [*14]  and  began to kiss her neck and try to pull her pants down.  Id. at 115. J.G. denied his advances and locked the  bathroom door behind her. Id. Once J.G. left the  bathroom, she took her pants off and laid them on the  bed. Id. at 116. Appellant asked if he could perform oral  sex on the victim, to which she said no, but despite her  refusals he pushed her panties down and put his mouth  on her vagina. Id. at 117-18. J.G. tried to push him away  and he eventually stopped. Id. Page 6 of 11 Appellant then tried to force his penis into J.G.'s vagina  and ultimately pushed his penis into her anus. Id. at  120. Appellant was on top of J.G. holding her down with  his bodyweight as he penetrated her for two to three  minutes while J.G. ""tossed and turned"" in excruciating pain trying to  avoid contact. Id. Lastly, Appellant attempted to put his penis in [J.G.'s]  mouth. Id. J.G. testified that she never consented to any kind of  sex with Appellant. N.T., 12/6/21, at 127-28. The  Commonwealth introduced text message exchanges  between Appellant and J.G. at trial, which corroborated  J.G.'s testimonial evidence. For example, after J.G. accused  Appellant of rape, Appellant responded ""Bitch bye you're weird."" N.T.  12/7/21, at 264-65. [*15]  He continued, ""Bitch I didn't fuck you. I gave you head you  was tryna put it in but you stop so I stop tf bitch you acting like I hold you  down what the fuck. Rape tho get that from my name you weird bitch. You  are ugly as fuck. How I rape you when I been already fuck smh you weird g  shit."" Id. at 265 (grammatical and spelling errors in original). Jessica Martin, the forensic nurse examiner who  performed the examination of J.G., testified that the fact that J.G.'s  physical examination did not reveal acute injuries was not uncommon in sexual  assault cases. N.T., 12/6/21, at 192-95. Detective Tarasi's testimony regarding her investigation  of the alleged assault also corroborated the events. See N.T., 12/7/21,  at 250-52. Her investigation included watching hotel surveillance video  of Appellant and J.G. entering their room and going through text exchanges  between the two discussing the incident. Id. at 254, 260-66. In finding there was sufficient evidence to support the  convictions, the trial court explained its rationale as follows: [J.G.] testified that in the hotel room on the evening of  August 17th Appellant performed oral sex on her and  penetrated her vagina and anus with his penis, without  her consent. [*16]  While she tried to avoid his  movements, Appellant's body weight on top of [J.G.] immobilized her. The text message exchange  between she and Appellant following the incident  corroborated the events of that evening. Trial Ct. Op. at 9. We  conclude  the  evidence  presented  by  the  Commonwealth was more than sufficient to support the  jury's guilty verdict on the charges of sexual assault in  connection with J.G. J.G's testimony, as well as the  corroborating evidence, established that even though  she repeatedly rejected his sexual advances, Appellant  forcibly engaged in sexual intercourse per os and anus  without J.G.'s consent. SeeTrippett, 932 A.2d at 201.  Accordingly, Appellant's convictions for sexual assault of J.G. are  supported by the evidence and all the elements of the  crime are met. SeeWindslowe, 158 A.3d at 708-09. As for the second victim, C.L., evidence adduced at trial  also demonstrated she also did not consent to sexual  intercourse. C.L. testified that she met Appellant at the  Red Roof Inn. N.T., 12/6/21, at 144. The two were  sitting and talking on the edge of the bed when  Appellant became angry because C.L. wanted to leave,  and he ripped her shirt and bra off. Id. at 146. Appellant  then ripped a necklace off from C.L.'s [*17]  neck and  called her names. Id. 147-48. Appellant told C.L. to remove her shorts and  pushed her panties to the side as he pushed his penis  inside of her vagina. Id. at 148-149. She testified she  did not remember exactly what she said to him, but that  she ""was just hesitant."" Id. at 148. Appellant punched  her in the nose and threw wooden hangers at her. Id. at  149-50. When C.L. was cleaning up her bloody nose at  Page 7 of 11 the bathroom sink, Appellant came up behind and  inserted his penis inside her again. Id. at 155. Although C.L. did not  immediately report the attack, she took pictures of the injuries she sustained  that night. Id. at 151. The pictures were admitted at trial and showed that she  had sustained injuries to her nose, eye, arms, hands, and leg. Id. at 152. C.L.  left the hotel room that morning and the two continued to be in contact for  the following two weeks. Id. at 158-59. Appellant threatened Appellant  viatext message, accusing her of going to the police to report on the  sexual assault. Id. at 163. C.L. reported the assault about a week later. Id. Detective Scott testified that the scene he processed on  August 18, 2020, corroborated the alleged assault C.L. reported on  August 30, 2020: Detective [*18]  Scott photographed the room and  described [it] as being in disarray, with broken hangers  in the room and sheets and towels thrown about. He  also described a pillow and other bed linens with what  appeared to be blood clusters on them. As Detective  Scott went through the contents of the trash can from  the room, he found broken hangers, a torn woman's  shirt and a torn gray bra. There was also a white  undershirt found in the trash can with blood on it, and a  towel that also has blood on it. There was also a white,  long-sleeve shirt, size extra-small, found in the trash  can. Trial Op. at 8. As mentioned above, it was not  recommended that C.L. undergo a physical examination given how much time  had passed since the assault. See N.T., 12/6/21, at 227. These circumstances sub judice are akin to those in  Cramer, supra. There, the victim went to the defendant's apartment  after meeting him in a bar. Cramer, 195 A.3d at 599. She was in the bathroom  when the defendant followed her in. Id. As the victim was washing her  hands, the defendant ""started penetrating her from behind."" Id. Appellant did not stop until the Victim ""turned around  and told him that she didn't want to do this again and  that I wasn't on the pill."" Appellant [*19]  then started  kissing her again. Appellant wanted to have oral sex  and the Victim ""went along with it . . . ."" She stopped  giving him oral sex and told him ""you don't want this. I  don't want this. This is going to end badly for both of  us."" She then left the bathroom. Id. (record citations omitted). The defendant was  convicted of sexual assault pursuant to Section 3124.1. Id. at 601. On appeal, the  defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, claiming that the incident  was consensual because the victim did not consent by physical  resistance. Id. A panel of this Court rejected that argument, concluding there was  sufficient evidence to support the conviction based on the trial court's findings,  which included that ""the jury obviously believed [the v]ictim's testimony that  she did not consent to the sexual contact when she characterized the  incident as rape."" Id. at 602 (citation omitted). See alsoCommonwealth v.  Andrulewicz, 911 A.2d 162, 166 (Pa. Super. 2006) (""the court[, sitting as fact- finder] was free to accept [the victim]'s characterization of what transpired  with [defendant], particularly her representation that [defendant] ""raped""  her, which connotes Page 8 of 11 a  lack  of  consent  to  the  act  committed."").  Similarly, [*20]  here, the jury clearly believed the evidence that even though C.L. did not  explicitly resist, she did not consent to sexual contact with Appellant based on  the fact that she characterized the incident as an assault when reporting  to police. N.T., 6/7/22, at 224. Moreover, the jury heard the contents of  certain text messages between the victim and Appellant,  in which she stated, ""You fuckin' and rapin' multiple  bitches then forcing your shit in me. . . . Regardless of  how our past is, this is fucked what you did to me."" Id. at  229 (grammatical and spelling errors in original). Based  on the totality of the circumstances, we conclude C.L.'s  testimony and evidence from the investigation, including Appellant's use of force, support Appellant's convictions  for sexual assault - Appellant penetrated C.L. per os  and anus and she did not consent to engaging in sexual  intercourse with Appellant. See Trippett, 932 A.2d at  201; Windslowe, 158 A.3d at 708-09. For the same reasons discussed above, Appellant  convictions for indecent assault are supported by the  evidence. Appellant argues that the evidence was not  sufficient to meet the elements of indecent assault  because Appellant ""did not cause"" either of his victims  ""to come into contact [*21]  with seminal fluid, urine, or  feces for the purpose of"" sexual arousal. See Appellant's Brief at 17-18. Pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. 3126(a)(1), a person is guilty of  indecent assault, in relevant part, if the person has indecent contact with the complainant,  causes the complainant to have indecent contact with  the person or intentionally causes the complainant to  come into contact with seminal fluid, urine or feces for  the purpose of arousing sexual desire in the person or  the complainant and: (1) the person does so without the complainant's  consent[.] Id. Indecent contact is defined as ""[a]ny touching of the  sexual or other intimate parts of the person for the  purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire, in any  person."" 18 Pa.C.S. 3101. Based on the testimony reviewed by the jury and  discussed above, we agree with the trial court that the  evidence supported the indecent assault convictions.  Contrary to his argument, the testimony established  Appellant engaged in indecent contact with both victims  for the purposes of arousing his own sexual desire and  he did so without their consent. Accordingly, Appellant's sufficiency arguments fail. In his next argument, Appellant contends the verdict  was against the weight of the evidence [*22]  presented  at trial.11 See Appellant's Brief at 19. Appellant asserts the testimony supports the notion that  the ""encounter[s]"" were ""consensual, and thus, not  sexual assault and indecent assault as convicted."" Id. at  19. Moreover, Appellant argues the fact that he and C.L.  had a previous relationship and continued to be involved  after the event belies his convictions. Id. at 19-20. The standard by which we review challenges to the  weight of the evidence is well-settled: The weight of the evidence is a matter exclusively for  the finder of fact, who is free to believe all, part, or none  of the evidence and to determine the credibility of the  witnesses. A new trial is 11 On March 11, 2023, Appellant properly preserved his  weight claim in his post-sentence motion nunc pro tunc  pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 607. not warranted because of a mere conflict in the  testimony and must have a stronger foundation than a  reassessment of the credibility of witnesses. Rather, the  role  of  the  trial  judge  is  to  determine  that  notwithstanding all the fact, certain facts are so clearly  of greater weight that to ignore them or to give them  equal weight with all the facts is to deny justice. On  appeal, our purview is extremely limited [*23]  and is  confined to whether the trial court abused its discretion  in finding that the jury verdict did not shock its  conscience. Thus, appellate review of a weight claim  consists of a review of the trial court's exercise of  discretion, not a review of the underlying question of  whether the verdict is against the weight of the  evidence. Commonwealth v. Williams, 255 A.3d 565, 580 (Pa.  Super. 2021) (citation Page 9 of 11 omitted). Here, the trial court found the verdict was not against  the weight of the evidence because the victims' ""credible testimony""  supporting their accounts of the attacks was sufficient to support the challenged  convictions. Trial Ct. Op. at 10. Upon our review, we find no abuse of discretion of the  trial court's ruling denying Appellant's weight of the evidence challenge.  Appellant fails to explain how the court abused its discretion in denying  his weight of the evidence claim. Rather, he asks us to reweigh certain  evidence concerning C.L. in his favor, which we are not permitted to do. See  Williams, 255 A.3d at 580. Thus, Appellant's weight claim fails. In his final challenge, Appellant argues his consecutive  sentences are excessive ""in light of the conduct at issue."" Appellant's  Brief at 14 (citation omitted). Specifically, Appellant asserts [*24]  the two  assaults should constitute one event given the proximity of time in which they  occurred, stating ""[t]he consecutive terms are based on events so close  together in time and so intertwined by the facts of each case, that they  constitute one event, rather than separate events."" Id. 14. Additionally, Appellant  notes his lack of criminal history prior to the time of trial as mitigating  circumstances. Id. For these reasons, Appellant claims a substantial question  was raised. Id. We disagree. Appellant's argument qualifies as a challenge to the  discretionary aspects of his sentence. See Commonwealth v.  Gonzalez-Dejusus, 994 A.2d 595 (Pa. Super. 2010) (claim involving the  imposition of consecutive sentences was excessive constituted discretionary  aspects of sentencing claim). It is well established that such a challenge does  not entitle an appellant to ""review as of right."" Commonwealth v.  Caldwell, 117 A.3d 763, 768 (Pa. Super. 2015) (en banc) (citation omitted). Rather, [b]efore this Court can address such a discretionary  challenge, an appellant must comply with the following  requirements: An appellant challenging the discretionary  aspects of his sentence must invoke this Court's  jurisdiction by [*25]  satisfying a four-part test: (1) whether appellant has filed a timely notice of appeal,  see Pa.R.A.P. 902 and 903; (2) whether the issue was  properly preserved at sentencing or in a motion to  reconsider and modify sentence, see Pa.R.Crim.P.  [720]; (3) whether appellant's brief has a fatal defect,  Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f); and (4) whether there is a substantial  question that the sentence appealed from is not  appropriate under the Sentencing Code. Id. Appellant properly preserved his claim in a timely filed  post-sentence motion nunc pro tunc before the trial court, and a timely  notice of appeal before this Court. Additionally, his brief includes the  requisite Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f) statement of reasons for allowance of appeal.  See Appellant's Brief at 14.12 We now must determine whether Appellant's  claim presents a Page 10 of 11 substantial question justifying our review. An appellant ""presents a substantial question when he  sets forth a plausible argument that the sentence violates a  provision of the sentencing code or is contrary to the fundamental norms of the  sentencing process."" Commonwealth v. Conte, 198 A.3d 1169, 1174 (Pa.  Super. 2018) (citation omitted). A court's exercise of discretion in imposing a sentence  concurrently or consecutively does not ordinarily raise a  substantial  question.  Rather,  the  imposition  of  consecutive [*26]  rather than concurrent sentences will  present a substantial question in only the most extreme  circumstances, such as where the aggregate sentence  is unduly harsh, considering the nature of the crimes  and the length of imprisonment. To make it clear, a defendant may raise a substantial  question where he receives consecutive sentences  within the guideline ranges if the case involves  circumstances where the application of the guidelines  would be clearly unreasonable, resulting in an excessive  sentence; however, 12 Appellant sets forth a Rule 2119(f) statement,but  does not include a separate section labeled such.  Nonetheless, ""we will not find that Appellant has not  waived his discretionary sentencing claim based upon  his lack of compliance with Rule 2119(f) as the  Commonwealth did not object to Appellant's failure to adhere to the appellate rules.""  Commonwealth v.Kurtz, 294 A.3d 509, 535 (Pa.  Super. 2023). a bald claim of excessiveness due to the consecutive  nature of a sentence will not raise a substantial  question. Commonwealth v. Caldwell, 117 A.3d 763, 769 (Pa.  Super. 2015) (citations & quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original). Generally,  ""[a]  challenge  to  the  imposition  of  consecutive rather than concurrent sentences does not present a substantial  question regarding the discretionary [*27]   aspects  of  sentence.""  Commonwealth v. Lloyd, 878 A.2d 867 (Pa. Super 2005). ""Thus, . . . the key to resolving the  preliminary substantial question inquiry is whether the decision to sentence  consecutively raises the aggregate sentence to, what appears upon its face to  be, an excessive level in light of the criminal conduct at issue in the case.""  Gonzalez-Dejusus, 994 A.2d at 598-99 (Pa. Super. 2010). Here, the trial court found the following: [I]n sentencing Appellant, [the trial court] noted that  while . . . Appellant had no prior record, nor was he deemed to be  a sexually violent predator, the violent nature of the  attacks on both women was a significant factor. [The  trial court] also cited the trauma to [J.G. that she]  continue[d] to experience . . . as a result of her assault.  Here, because it was within the [trial court]'s discretion  to run Appellant's sentences consecutive, and no  substantial question regarding the discretionary aspects  of the sentence have been raised, Appellant's argument  lacks merits. Trial Ct. Op. at 4. We are in agreement with the trial court that Appellant  did not raise a substantial question in light of his criminal conduct.  While the crimes may have happened in one night, Appellant [*28]  sexually  and violently assaulted two separate victims. He left one victim with significant  physical injuries following the attack while the other victim continued to suffer  emotionally months after the attack. Accordingly, we do  not find Appellant has raised a substantial question for  our review. SeeGonzalez-Dejusus, 994 A.2d 595 at  599 (concluding no substantial question raised by  imposition of consecutive sentences in light of criminal  Page 11 of 11 conduct, including ""a 'crime spree' [involving] an armed  robbery . . . a kidnapping . . . [and] a car theft."") (citation  omitted). Furthermore, to extent Appellant argues that the court  failed to consider his individual circumstances, having  neither a prior criminal record nor a history as a sexually  violent predator, these allegations also do not amount to  a substantial question. ""An appellant's contention that  the trial court did not adequately consider a mitigating  circumstance when imposing sentence does not raise a  substantial question sufficient to justify appellate review  of the merits of such claim."" Commonwealth v.  Ladamus, 896 A.2d 592, 595 (Pa. Super. 2006)  (citation omitted). See also Commonwealth v. Disalvo,  70 A.3d 900, 903 (Pa. Super 2013) (""[T]his Court has  held  on  numerous  occasions  that  a  claim  of  inadequate [*29]  consideration of mitigating factors  does not raise a substantial question for our review."").  Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Appellant has  failed to raise a substantial question that his sentence  was excessive. Consequently, we need not address his  final claim further.

After a careful review, we affirm. The relevant facts and procedural history are as follows:  Appellant, who Page 2 of 12 was fifty-one years [*2]  old, was arrested and charged  in connection with the sexual abuse of his eleven-year-old granddaughter (""the  victim""). Appellant proceeded to an arraignment on November 5, 2021, at  which time bail was set at 10% of $75,000.00. Appellant did not post bail  and remained incarcerated; however, he filed a motion seeking a bail  reduction. In response, the Commonwealth filed a motion to  increase Appellant's bail. Therein, the Commonwealth relevantly indicated: A review of [Appellant's] criminal history reveals that he  was charged and convicted between the years of 2001  and 2003 via the United States Military Criminal Justice  System of Indecent [Acts or] Liberties with a Child[.]  [Appellant's] criminal history also shows that he served  a term of confinement, was dishonorably discharged,  and required to register as a sex offender after release  as a result of these convictions. As a result of his  previous convictions and pursuant to 40 Pa.C.S.A.  9718.2, if [Appellant] is convicted of any one of the  counts charged in the present criminal Information, he  faces a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty-five  (25) years of total confinement. Commonwealth's Motion to Modify Bail, filed 1/20/22, at  2-3. 1 18 Pa.C.S.A. 3123(b), 3126(a)(7), and 6301(a)(1)(ii),  respectively. [*3]  2 18 Pa.C.S.A. 3126(a)(7). Thereafter, at the conclusion of Appellant's preliminary  hearing on January 12, 2022, the magisterial district justice held a  hearing on the issue of bail. During the hearing,  Appellant admitted he was charged with a crime while  he was in the military. N.T., 1/12/22, at 38. He  specifically testified he ""took a guilty plea to a sex offense regarding a minor  family member[.]""3 Id. at 39. On March 1, 2022, at lower court docket number 49- 2022, the Commonwealth filed an Information charging  Appellant with 319 crimes related to the sexual abuse of  the victim over a four-year period. On that same date, at  lower court docket number 50-2022, the Commonwealth  filed an Information charging Appellant with three crimes  related to the sexual abuse of the same victim at  Appellant's place of employment. The Commonwealth  provided notice of compulsory joinder of the two cases  pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure  582(B)(1). On May 24, 2022, the Commonwealth filed a motion for  a protective order to secure Appellant's prior criminal  military records. Therein, the Commonwealth noted that,  when Appellant was in the United States Army, he was  previously convicted of, inter alia, indecent acts or  liberties with a child by the United States [*4]  Military  criminal justice system. The Commonwealth 3 Although not pertinent to this appeal, we note the  magisterial district justice denied Appellant's request to  reduce bail, as well as denied the Commonwealth's  request to increase bail. noted it requested the official records related to  Appellant's prior criminal military court-martial; however,  the United States Army responded that it required a  protective order limiting disclosure by a signed judge  prior to releasing the certified criminal records. In its  motion, the Commonwealth specifically averred the  ""records will have bearing on the sentence imposed by  the trial court in the [instant] cases."" Commonwealth's  Motion For Protective Order, filed 5/24/22. On May 24,  2022, the trial court signed the protective order so that  the United States Army would release Appellant's  certified criminal military court-martial records to the  Commonwealth. On May 26, 2022, Appellant, who was represented by  counsel, proceeded to a hearing where he entered a  negotiated open guilty plea to the six charges set forth  supra. In exchange, the Commonwealth agreed to  nolpros all remaining charges.4 Relevantly, at the on- the-record  guilty  plea  hearing,  Appellant [*5]   acknowledged his plea agreement contained no  agreement as to his sentence.5N.T., 5/26/22, at 2. He  acknowledged his right to have a bench trial or a right to  a jury trial, and he confirmed his understanding that Page 3 of 12 4 Specifically, the Commonwealth agreed to nol pros all  remaining charges thirty-one days after sentencing  unless post-sentence motions or an appeal was filed in  which case the charges would be nol prossed thirty-one  days after the resolution of the matter. 5 Appellant agreed as part of the plea agreement that  he would complete a SORNA assessment with the  Sexual Offenders Assessment Board, and he would be  subject to SORNA's registration requirements. he was ""giving up"" that right by entering a guilty plea. Id.  at 3. Appellant indicated his attorney had been available to consult with  him and answered his questions. Id. He specifically acknowledged he was  satisfied with his attorney's representation. Id. Appellant confirmed he  was entering his guilty plea voluntarily and of his own free will, and no one  made any threats or promises beyond those in the written plea agreement.6  Id. On June 23, 2022, the Commonwealth filed notice of its  intent to seek the mandatory minimum sentence of 25 [*6]  years at  each of the six counts to which  Appellant  pled  guilty.  Specifically,  the  Commonwealth asserted it had received Appellant's certified military records, which  confirmed that Appellant has a prior conviction for indecent acts or liberties with a  child, dated June 5, 2003, from a United States Army General Court Martial.  The acts underlying 6 We note the oral guilty plea colloquy in this case was  brief. During the oral colloquy, the trial court noted  Appellant completed a written ""pleaders memorandum""  with the assistance of his counsel. N.T., 5/26/22, at 2. In  the ""pleaders memorandum,"" the charges to which  Appellant pled guilty are set forth. The ""pleaders  memorandum"" contains either ""n/a"" or a handwritten line  next to the area for ""mandatory minimum"" for each  crime. The written plea agreement, which is signed by the  Commonwealth, lists the charges to which Appellant  pled guilty, notes Appellant will be subject to SORNA,  notes the condition precedent for the Commonwealth to  nol pros the remaining charges, and indicates ""except  as expressly provided otherwise herein, there is no  other agreement as to sentence or any other matter."" Written Plea Agreement, filed 5/27/23. Appellant's military [*7]  conviction included Appellant  fondling an eleven-year-old victim's vaginal area and placing her hand on his  penis.7 On July 22, 2022, at both lower court docket numbers,  Appellant filed a counseled pre-sentence motion seeking to withdraw his  guilty pleas. Therein, Appellant relevantly averred that, on June 23, 2022, the  Commonwealth advised that it was seeking a mandatory 25-year  sentence on each of the six individual offenses to which Appellant pled guilty, and  Appellant was unaware of the mandatory minimums that would be associated  with his offenses when he pled guilty. Appellant averred the Commonwealth  would not be prejudiced if his pleas were withdrawn. On August 1, 2022, the Commonwealth filed a brief in  opposition to Appellant's pre-sentence motion to withdraw his guilty  pleas. Therein, the Commonwealth relevantly averred: Appellant cannot credibly claim that he was unaware of  applicable mandatory minimums. The Commonwealth  has repeatedly represented to [Appellant] through  counsel that a conviction for any Megan's Law offense  in the instant case would invoke a mandatory minimum  sentence of 25 years, which the Commonwealth  Page 4 of 12 intended to seek. Pursuant to applicable rules of  criminal procedure, [*8]  the Commonwealth gave  written notice of this intention after conviction/plea and  before sentencing. Finally, the Commonwealth asserts that it would be  prejudiced if [Appellant] is permitted to withdraw his  pleas. Withdrawal of said pleas will allow [Appellant] to  further prolong trial resulting in the memories and  recollection of the minor victim 7 The certified military records confirmed that Appellant  entered a guilty plea during the military court-martial,  and he was sentenced to twenty-one months in  confinement, as well as dishonorably discharged from  the military. and other witnesses fading. The Commonwealth would  be further prejudiced by said withdrawal as co- defendant, [Appellant's] son, Michael Shaulis, has pled  and has been sentenced pursuant to a closed  plea.[8]Michael Shaulis had previously indicated a  willingness to cooperate against [Appellant]. However,  Michael Shaulis was sentenced on June 6, 2022, with  the understanding that his cooperation would not be  necessary against [Appellant] since [Appellant] had pled  guilty days earlier. Having pled and been sentenced,  Michael Shaulis's credibility may be called into question  at the trial of his father, and Michael Shaulis may [*9]   lose willingness to cooperate since his case has been  disposed of and his sentence rendered. Had [Appellant]  not pled guilty, the Commonwealth would not have  pursued the sentencing of Michael Shaulis prior to the  trial of [Appellant]. Commonwealth's Brief, filed 8/1/22, at 2-3 (footnote  added). On August 22, 2022, the trial court held a hearing on  Appellant's pre- sentence motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. At the  hearing, defense counsel acknowledged that, prior to Appellant entering his guilty  pleas, he and the Assistant District Attorney had ""conversations with  regard to sentences."" N.T., 8/22/22, at 3. He confirmed the Assistant District  Attorney indicated ""there could possibly be mandatories as a result of a  conviction that [Appellant] had back in the Army many years prior."" Id.  However, defense counsel averred Appellant ""was not aware [when he  pled guilty] that he was receiving a mandatory."" Id. at 5. Defense counsel  indicated Appellant entered his guilty plea ""on the assumption that there  was no agreement…with regard to any mandatories that the Commonwealth was  seeking."" Id. 8  The  record  reveals  that,  with  Appellant's  encouragement, Michael Shaulis also sexually abused  the victim. As the [*10]  trial court noted, Appellant was  the ""orchestrator…the scheduler"" of the abuse. N.T.,  10/25/22, at 17. Defense counsel further indicated that, when he  informed Appellant of the Commonwealth's June 23, 2022, notice, Appellant  indicated ""it was not acceptable,"" so defense counsel filed a pre-sentence  motion to withdraw the guilty pleas. Id. at 4. Defense counsel informed the trial  court that ""quite frankly, [Appellant] does not want to withdraw his plea.  He would rather have the plea stand and have you sentence him without the  mandatories that he was advised of after."" Id. The Commonwealth, in response, noted Appellant's  argument at the hearing ""centered mostly on the fact that he doesn't  want the court to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years."" Id. at 6-7.  The Commonwealth Page 5 of 12 noted that, before Appellant entered his plea, the  Commonwealth informed Appellant that it was obtaining Appellant's criminal  military record to determine the applicability of the mandatory minimum  sentencing scheme in the case sub judice. Id. at 7. The Commonwealth  indicated: There were no representations prior to plea that the  Commonwealth would not seek the mandatory. And as  [defense counsel] told you, there was discussion [*11]   that the Commonwealth believed that the mandatory  may be applicable here. The [written] plea agreement, which is part of the record  in this case, indicates that there is no further agreement  as to sentence. There was no agreement that the  Commonwealth would or would not seek mandatories in  this case. Id. Additionally, the Commonwealth advised the trial court  that it would be substantially prejudiced if Appellant was permitted to  withdraw his guilty pleas. Specifically, the Commonwealth indicated: [Appellant] has to prove that the Commonwealth would  not be prejudiced by withdrawal of [his pleas in] this  case. The Commonwealth maintains the opposite. We  would, in fact, be prejudiced if the court were to allow  withdrawal here. The co-defendant, Michael Shaulis,  [who is Appellant's] son and the uncle of the victim here,  had indicated his willingness to cooperate against  [Appellant] to testify against him. [Michael Shaulis] pled  guilty, and we were waiting his sentencing pending  [Appellant's] decision to plead guilty. [Michael Shaulis] was sentenced on June 6, 2022[.]  [This was] [a]fter [Appellant] had entered a plea and with  the understanding that [Michael Shaulis's] cooperation  would not be [*12]  necessary against [Appellant]  because he had entered a plea. [The appellate courts] have indicated that the [trial] court  properly denied [a] defendant's motion to withdraw a  plea where a cooperating co-defendant had been pled  and sentenced prior to the [motion to] withdraw and  would therefore lack motivation to cooperate against the  defendant  at  issue.  For  that  reason,  [the  Commonwealth] believes that [the Commonwealth]  would also be severely prejudiced should the [trial] court  grant [Appellant's] motion to withdraw [in the instant  case]. Id. at 7-8. The trial court denied Appellant's pre-sentence motion  orally on the record.9 In so doing, the trial court noted that, when  Appellant pled guilty, he was aware the Commonwealth was seeking his military  records for the purposes of sentencing with the possibility that the  mandatory minimum 9 The trial court also filed a written order denying  Appellant's pre-sentence motion to withdraw on August  22, 2022. sentence would be applicable. Id. at 9. The trial court  noted that the written plea agreement indicated there  was no agreement as to the imposition of any sentence.  Id. Thus, the trial court concluded Appellant entered his  plea knowingly, intelligently, [*13]  and voluntarily. Id. Moreover, the trial court concluded that, if Appellant was  permitted  to  withdraw  his  guilty  pleas,  ""the  Commonwealth would be significantly prejudiced since  they had already completed their agreement with the co- defendant."" Id. at 9-10. Further, the trial court noted the  emotional trauma the child victim would likely suffer  given that she was told she would not have to testify at  trial against her grandfather. Id. at 10. On October 25, 2022, Appellant proceeded to a  sentencing  hearing,  at  which  the  trial  court  acknowledged it had a pre-sentence investigation  report. The trial court also acknowledged it had the  official records from the United States Army regarding  Appellant's prior military criminal conviction. Appellant  objected to the introduction of the United States Army's  records on the basis the records were hearsay. N.T.,  10/25/22, at 6. Appellant contended the Commonwealth  was ""required to bring someone in from the Department  of Army"" to testify about the records. Id. Moreover, during the sentencing hearing, defense  Page 6 of 12 counsel requested the trial court reconsider permitting  Appellant to withdraw his guilty pleas. Defense counsel  asserted  Appellant  was  unaware [*14]   that  the  Commonwealth was pursuing the imposition of a  mandatory minimum sentence and, had Appellant known, he would not have entered guilty pleas. Id. at 7.  Alternatively, defense counsel noted Appellant ""is willing  to stand by the guilty pleas that he previously entered in  this court on May 26, 2022, and asks the court not to  impose  the  mandatory  sentences  that  the  Commonwealth is requesting."" Id. at 8. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, argued the  mandatory minimum sentence is applicable based on  Appellant' prior military convictions, as confirmed by the  official United States Army records. Further, the  Commonwealth argued the trial court should impose the  sentences consecutively since, not only did Appellant  commit the sex acts against the young victim, but he  encouraged his son, the victim's uncle, to sexually  abuse the victim, as well. Id. at 13. Appellant informed the trial court that he was ""pushed  and forced"" into ""taking the deal"" while he was in the  military. Id. at 14. He noted his current victim's mother is  an ""unfit mother."" Id. He indicated he had remorse for  what happened to the victim. Id. The  trial  court  concluded  the  Commonwealth  established the existence of Appellant's [*15]  prior  military conviction by a preponderance of the evidence.  The trial court further concluded the military conviction  qualified as a previous conviction for purposes of  applying the mandatory minimum under 42 Pa.C.S.A.  9718.2. The trial court then sentenced Appellant to an  aggregate of 75 years to 150 years in prison.10 The trial court  gave Appellant credit for time served. Appellant filed a timely, counseled post-sentence motion  averring the trial court illegally imposed a mandatory minimum  sentence under 42 Pa.C.S.A. 9718 and 9799. Also, Appellant contended  the trial court erred in denying his pre-sentence motion to withdraw his  guilty pleas on the basis that, when Appellant pled guilty, he was unaware the  Commonwealth would be asking for a mandatory minimum sentence. By order entered on February 27, 2023, the trial court  denied Appellant's post-sentence motion. This timely, counseled appeal  followed,11 and all Pa.R.A.P. 1925 requirements have been met. On appeal, Appellant sets forth the following issues in  his ""Statement of the Questions Involved"" (verbatim): 1. Did the court err by not permitting your Appellant to  withdraw his plea after he was notified that the  Commonwealth would be seeking the imposition of a  mandatory sentence based upon [*16]  the prior military  history? 10 Specifically, imposing the mandatory minimum  sentence, the trial court sentenced Appellant to 25 years  to 50 years in prison for each charge to which Appellant  pled guilty. The trial court directed that the sentence for  each count of indecent assault at lower court docket  number 49-2022 would run consecutively to the  sentence for the sole count of involuntary deviate sexual  intercourse at lower court docket number 49-2022. The  sentences for the remaining convictions at both docket  numbers were imposed concurrently. 11 Appellant filed separate notices of appeal at each  lower court docket number, and this Court sua sponte  consolidated the appeals. 2. Did the court err by allowing hearsay evidence to  establish a prior military conviction such that a  mandatory sentence became applicable? Appellant's Brief at 6 (suggested answers omitted). Initially, we address Appellant's second issue. Appellant  contends the trial court unlawfully sentenced him at each count to a  mandatory minimum of 25 years of incarceration under 42 Pa.C.S.A.  9718.2(a)(1), where the Page 7 of 12 Commonwealth failed to prove Appellant had a prior  qualifying conviction. ""When reviewing the legality of a sentence, our standard  of review [*17]  is de novo  and  our  scope  of  review  is  plenary.""  Commonwealth v. Summers, 245 A.3d 686, 697 (Pa.Super. 2021) (citation omitted). Section 9718.2 provides, in relevant part: Any person who is convicted…of an offense set forth in  section 9799.14 (relating to sexual offenses and tier  system) shall, if at the time of the commission of the  current offense the person had previously been  convicted of an offense set forth in section 9799.14…or  an equivalent crime in another jurisdiction, be  sentenced to a minimum sentence of at least 25 years  of total confinement[.] 42 Pa.C.S.A. 9718.2(a)(1) (bold added). The Statute further provides the following: (c) Proof of sentencing.--The provisions of this section  shall notbe an element of the crime, and notice thereof  to the defendant shall not be required prior to conviction,  but reasonable notice of the Commonwealth's intention  to proceed under this section shall be provided after  conviction and before sentencing. The applicability of  this section shall be determined at sentencing. The  sentencing court, prior to imposing sentence on an  offender under subsection (a), shall have a complete  record of the previous convictions of the offender,  copies of which shall be furnished to the offender. If the offender or the attorney for the  Commonwealth [*18]  contests the accuracy of the  record, the court shall schedule a hearing and direct the  offender and the attorney for the Commonwealth to  submit evidence regarding the previous convictions of  the offender. The court shall then determine, by a  preponderance  of  the  evidence,  the  previous  convictions of the offender and, if this section is  applicable, shall impose sentence in accordance with  this section. Should a previous conviction be vacated  and an acquittal or final discharge entered subsequent  to imposition of sentence under this section, the  offender shall have the right to petition the sentencing  court for reconsideration of sentence if this section  would not have been applicable except for the  conviction which was vacated. 42 Pa.C.S.A. 9718.2(c) (bold in original). Here, Appellant does not dispute that, if established, a  prior military conviction for the offense of indecent acts or liberties  with a child, as set forth in the United States Courts-Martial 2000 Manual, is a  qualifying trigger for the application of the mandatory minimum sentence under  Section 9718(a)(1). See Commonwealth v. Smith, 528 Pa. 380, 598 A.2d  268 (1991) (holding military court-martial convictions may qualify as a prior  conviction for purposes of applying mandatory minimum sentencing  provisions).12 [*19]  12 As the trial court explained, under military law, the  elements of the offense of indecent acts or liberties with  a child are: (1) physical contact-the accused  committed a certain act upon or with the body of a  certain person; the person was under 16 years of age  and not the spouse of the accused; the act of the  accused was indecent; the accused committed the act  with intent to arouse, appeal to, or gratify the lust,  passions, or sexual desires of the accused, the victim or  both; and under the circumstances, the conduct of the  accused was to the prejudice of good order and  discipline in the armed forces or was a nature to bring  discredit upon the armed forces. (2) No physical  contact-the accused committed a certain act; the act  amounted to the taking of indecent liberties with a  certain person; the accused committed the act within (Footnote Continued Next Page) However, Appellant contends the Commonwealth did  not present sufficient evidence for the trial court to conclude, by a  preponderance of the evidence, that he had a prior military conviction, so as to  trigger the applicability of Section 9718.2(a)(1). In this vein,  Appellant argues the Page 8 of 12 Commonwealth improperly relied solely upon ""a military  document,"" [*20]  which the presence of this person; this person was under the  age of 16 years old and not the spouse of the accused;  the accused committed the act with intent to arouse,  appeal to, or gratify the lust, passions, or sexual desires  of the accused, the victim or both; and under the  circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the  prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed  forces or was a nature to bring discredit upon the armed  forces. See Trial Court Opinion, filed 2/27/23, at 11  (citing Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, Part IV,  pp. IV-110-11 (2000 ed.)). The military law defines  ""indecent"" as ""that form of immorality relating to sexual impurity, which  is not only grossly vulgar, obscene, and repugnant to  common propriety, but tends to excite lust and deprave  the morals with respect to sexual relations."" Id. at IV- 110-112 ¶¶ 88(3), 90(c). The trial court concluded the military conviction for  indecent acts or liberties with a child-physical contact, to  which Appellant pled guilty, is equivalent to indecent  assault under 18 Pa.C.S.A. 3126, which provides a  person is guilty of indecent assault ""if the person has  indecent contact with the complainant…and the person  does so without the complainant's [*21]  consent; the  person does so by forcible compulsion; the complainant  is less than 13 years of age; or the complainant is less  than 16 years of age and the person is four or more  years older…and…not married to each other."" 18  Pa.C.S.A.  3126. Further, the trial court concluded the military  conviction for indecent acts or liberties with a child-no  physical contact, to which Appellant pled guilty, is  equivalent to Pennsylvania's crime of corruption of  minors under 18 Pa.C.S.A. 6301(a)(ii), which provides a defendant being  18 years or more, ""by any course of conduct in violation of Chapter 31  (relating to sexual offenses) corrupts or tends to corrupt  the moral of any minor…or who aids, abets, entices or  encourages any such minor in the commission of an  offense under Chapter 31 commits a felony of the third  degree."" 18 Pa.C.S.A.  6301(a)(ii). Appellant raises no claim of error regarding  the trial court's analysis in this regard. . was hearsay, to prove the existence of his prior military  conviction. Appellant avers the trial court should have  required the Commonwealth to introduce a qualified  United States Army official to testify to the contents of  the document. Initially, we note ""a preponderance of the evidence is  the lowest burden of proof in the [*22]  administration of  justice, and it is defined as the greater weight of the  evidence, i.e., to tip a scale slightly in one's favor.""  Commonwealthv. A.R., 990 A.2d 1, n. 4 (Pa.Super.  2010) (quotation marks, quotation, and brackets  omitted). Stated differently, preponderance of the  evidence is tantamount to a ""more likely than not""  standard. Commonwealth v. Heater, 899 A.2d 1126,  1133 (Pa.Super. 2006). Moreover, we observe that the admission of evidence  presented at a sentencing hearing is vested within the  sound discretion of the trial court applying the rules of  evidence. Commonwealth v. Hairston, 624 Pa. 143, 84 A.3d 657, 674 (2014). As such, our standard of  review of a trial court's evidentiary rulings is abuse of  discretion. Commonwealth v. Walter, 625 Pa. 522, 93  A.3d 442, 449 (2014). Thus, we will not disturb an  evidentiary ruling unless ""the law is overridden or  misapplied, or the judgment exercised is manifestly  unreasonable, or the result of partiality, prejudice, bias,  or  ill-will,  as  shown  by  evidence  of  record.""  Commonwealth v. Cooper, 596 Pa. 119, 941 A.2d  655, 667 (2007) (citation omitted). This includes rulings  on the admission of hearsay. Id. Hearsay is a statement that the declarant does not  make while testifying at a trial or hearing that is offered into evidence to prove  the truth of the matter asserted in the statement. Pa.R.E. 801(c)(1)-(2).  Statements that meet this definition [*23]  are not admissible unless a  hearsay exception applies or is permitted by other rules prescribed by the  Pennsylvania Supreme Court or by statute. Pa.R.E. 802. ""The rule against admitting  hearsay evidence stems Page 9 of 12 from its presumed unreliability, because the declarant  cannot be challenged regarding  the  accuracy  of  the  statement.""  Commonwealth v. Chmiel, 585 Pa. 547, 889 A.2d 501, 532 (2005) (citation omitted). Still, for the purposes of sentencing a defendant, a trial  court may admit evidence as to any matter that it deems relevant and  admissible on the question of the sentence to be imposed, and the  evidence shall include matters relating to any of the aggravating or mitigating  circumstances. Commonwealth v. Young, 536 Pa. 57, 637 A.2d 1313,  1321-22 (1993). Notably, ""a proceeding held to determine [a] sentence is  not a trial, and the court is not bound by the restrictive rules of evidence  properly applicable to trials."" Commonwealth v. Medley, 725 A.2d 1225,  1229 (Pa.Super. 1999). Hearsay testimony is precisely the type of evidence  which is the right of a court in sentencing to consider  even though such information is obtained outside the  courtroom from persons whom the defendant has not  been  permitted  to  confront  or  cross-examine.  Significantly, the admission of hearsay in sentencing  proceedings, especially those which do [*24]  not  involve a capital crime, is a common occurrence. In fact,  sentencing courts as a matter of course, consider  hearsay in nearly every sentencing case since pre- sentence investigations are routinely ordered and  considered by the court and a pre-sentence report is the  very definition of hearsay, i.e., the report is a report by a probation officer  reciting other person's out-of-court statements offered  for their truth. Medley, 725 A.2d at 1230. Notably, the Victim's Bill of  Rights, the Sentencing Code, and the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal  Procedure all permit a trial court to consider a pre-sentence investigation report and  victim impact statement prior to imposing a sentence, which include statements  of hearsay. See 18 P.S. 11.201(5); 42 Pa.C.S.A. 9721(b) and 9731:  Pa.R.Crim.P. 702(A). However, the consideration of hearsay, even at a  sentencing hearing, is not unfettered. See Pa.R.E. 101 cmt. Instead, a  sentencing court may rely on hearsay evidence in the limited circumstance where  the hearsay originated from a dependable source under reliable circumstances.  Medley, 725 A.2d at 1225. For example, in Medley, the Commonwealth  established the defendant's prior record based on a  detective's testimony that he had contacted out of state  authorities to verify a prior conviction. Also, the  defendant admitted he had [*25]  a prior conviction.  Although the detective's testimony constituted hearsay, it had sufficient indicia of  reliability under the circumstances to be relied upon by the sentencing  court. Id. at 1230. In the case sub judice, the trial court relevantly  explained as follows: [Appellant] argues that the [trial] court erred in relying on  the records of his court-martial at the time of sentencing  [in the instant case] as those records were hearsay. The  Commonwealth argues that the records were certified  copies  of  the  [military  court-martial]  record  as  evidence[d] by the Motion for Protective Order. The  Commonwealth argues that even if the records  constituted hearsay, the [trial] court could rely on them  in determining if [Appellant] had a prior qualifying  offense as required by Section 9718.2(a) as courts  routinely rely on hearsay during sentencing. *** Here, the Commonwealth offered into evidence the  records related to [Appellant's] 2003 court-martial in  which he entered guilty pleas to one specification each  of indecent liberties with a female under the age of  16….and two specifications of an indecent act with a  Page 10 of 12 female under the age of 16. As evidenced by the May  24, 2022, Motion for Protective Order, these records  were [*26]  provided by the United States Army Crime  Records Center (""Crime Records Center""). [Appellant]  has not offered any evidence to suggest records from  the Crime Records Center were not obtained from a  dependable source under reliable circumstances such  that they should not be considered, whether hearsay or  not, at sentencing. Trial Court Opinion, filed 2/27/23, at 7-9. We find no abuse of discretion. As the trial court noted,  in response to the  trial  court  signing  a  protective  order,  the  Commonwealth received a certified copy of Appellant's military court-martial  records from the Crime Records Center. Trial courts routinely rely upon certified  court records, which contain hearsay, in determining whether a defendant  has a prior conviction because the hearsay originates from a dependable  source under reliable circumstances. Medley, 725 A.2d at 1225. See  Commonwealth v. Norris, 819 A.2d 568, 576 (Pa.Super. 2003) (indicating a trial  court considers a defendant's written court records in determining whether  the defendant has qualifying prior convictions for purposes of applying  mandatory minimum sentences). We agree with the trial court this reasoning  applies to official military court-martial records, as well. Further, we note Appellant admitted during the [*27]   January 12, 2022, bail hearing,  which  occurred  immediately  after  his  preliminary hearing, that he pled guilty before a military tribunal to sex offenses  involving a minor victim in the early 2000s. Accordingly,  the trial court did not err in finding, beyond a  preponderance of the evidence, that Appellant had a  prior military conviction, which triggered the applicability  of Section 9718.2(a)(1). Accordingly, we find no merit to Appellant's claim the  trial court unlawfully sentenced him to the 25-year  mandatory minimum under Section 9718.2(a)(1) since  the Commonwealth proved a prior qualifying offense  meeting the requirements of the statute. Next, we turn to Appellant's claim the trial court erred in  denying his pre-sentence motion to withdraw his guilty  pleas. Appellant contends that, when he pled guilty, he  was unaware that he would be subject to the mandatory  minimum sentences under Section 9718.2(a)(1). Thus,  he contends he set forth a ""fair and just reason"" for  withdrawing his guilty pleas prior to sentencing. We review the trial court's denial of Appellant's pre- sentence motion to withdraw his guilty pleas for an  abuse of discretion. Commonwealth v. Baez, 169 A.3d  35, 39 (Pa.Super. 2017); Commonwealth v. Islas, 156  A.3d 1185, 1187 (Pa.Super. 2017). ""An abuse of  discretion is not a mere error in judgment but,  rather, [*28]  involves bias, ill will, partiality, prejudice,  manifest unreasonableness and/or misapplication of  law. By contrast, a proper exercise of discretion  conforms to the law is based on the facts of record."" Commonwealth  v.  Gordy,  73  A.3d  620,  624  (Pa.Super. 2013) (citation omitted). We presume ""a defendant who entered a guilty plea  was aware of what he was doing, and the defendant bears the burden of  proving otherwise."" Commonwealth v. Hart, 174 A.3d 660, 665 (Pa.Super.  2017) (citation omitted). This Court has recently held: Where a defendant requests to withdraw his guilty plea  before he is sentenced, the trial court has discretion to  grant the withdrawal and that discretion is to be liberally  exercised to permit withdrawal of the plea if two  conditions are present: 1) the defendant demonstrates a  fair and just reason for withdrawing the plea and 2) it is  not shown that withdrawal of the plea would cause  substantial  prejudice  to  the  Commonwealth.  Commonwealth v.Carrasquillo, 631 Pa. 692, 115 A.3d  1284, 1291-92 (2015); Baez, 169 A.3d at 39;Islas, 156  Page 11 of 12 A.3d at 1188; see also Pa.R.Crim.P. 591(A) (""At any  time before the imposition of sentence, the court may, in  its  discretion,  permit,  upon  motion  of  the  defendant,…the withdrawal of a plea of guilty or  nolocontendere and the substitution of a plea of not  guilty"")[.] Commonwealth v. Jamison, 284 A.3d 501, 505  (Pa.Super. 2022) (emphasis added). In the [*29]  case sub judice, assuming, arguendo,  Appellant presented a ""fair and just reason"" for withdrawing his plea based on his  alleged unawareness the Commonwealth would be seeking the mandatory  minimum sentence under Section 9718.2(a)(1),13 we find the trial court did  not abuse its 13 To the extent the Commonwealth suggests, and the  trial court concludes, that, as applied to the instant case,  Section 9718(c) requires notice of mandatory minimums  after conviction and before sentencing, we note the (Footnote Continued Next Page) discretion in denying Appellant's pre-sentence motion  since it was ""shown that withdrawal of the plea would cause substantial prejudice  to the Commonwealth."" Jamison, 284 A.3d at 505 (citations  omitted). In the context of a pre-sentence request for plea  withdrawal, the term ""prejudice"" means that, due to  events occurring after the entry of the plea, the  Commonwealth's prosecution of its case is in a worse  position than it would have been had the trial taken  place as originally scheduled. Thus, prejudice is about  the Commonwealth's ability to try its case, not about the  personal inconvenience to complainants unless that  inconvenience somehow impairs the Commonwealth's  prosecution. Gordy, 73 A.3d at 624 (citations omitted). Here, in explaining [*30]  the reasons it would be  substantially prejudiced if Appellant was permitted to withdraw his guilty pleas, the  Commonwealth averred as follows during the pre-sentence motion  hearing: [Appellant] has to prove that the Commonwealth would  not be prejudiced by withdrawal of [his pleas in] this  case. The Commonwealth maintains the opposite. We  would, in fact, be prejudiced if the court were to allow  withdrawal here. The co-defendant, Michael Shaulis,  [who is Appellant's] son and the uncle of the victim here,  had indicated his willingness to cooperate against  [Appellant] to testify against him. [Michael Shaulis] pled  guilty, and we were waiting his sentencing pending  [Appellant's] decision to plead guilty. [Michael Shaulis] was sentenced on June 6, 2022[.]  [This was] [a]fter [Appellant] had entered a plea and with  the appellate courts have construed the statute differently  for defendants who enter guilty pleas. For a defendant  who pleads guilty, notice that the Commonwealth  intends to seek application of a mandatory minimum  sentence is required prior to the defendant's entry of a  guilty plea. SeeCommonwealth v. Broaden, 980 A.2d  124 (Pa.Super. 2009). understanding that [Michael Shaulis's] cooperation  would not be necessary against [*31]  [Appellant]  because he had entered a plea. [The appellate courts] have indicated that the [trial] court  properly denied [a] defendant's motion to withdraw a  plea where a cooperating co-defendant had been pled  and sentenced prior to the [motion to] withdraw and  would therefore lack motivation to cooperate against the  defendant  at  issue.  For  that  reason,  [the  Commonwealth] believes that [the Commonwealth]  would also be severely prejudiced should the [trial] court  grant [Appellant's] motion to withdraw [in the instant  case]. N.T., 8/22/22, at 7-8. The  trial  court  found  the  Commonwealth's  representation to be credible, and, in denying Appellant's pre-sentence motion,  specifically found ""the Page 12 of 12 Commonwealth would be significantly prejudiced since  they had already completed their agreement with the co-defendant."" Id. at  9-10. Further, the trial court noted the emotional trauma the child victim  would likely suffer given that she was told she would not have to testify at trial  against her grandfather. Id. at 10. Upon review, we find no abuse of discretion. This Court  has held that substantial prejudice exists if a defendant makes a  withdrawal request only after the Commonwealth enters into agreements  with [*32]  the defendant's co- defendants. Commonwealth v. Davis, 191 A.3d 883  (Pa.Super. 2018). In such cases, the co-defendant's ""lack of motivation to  cooperate with the prosecution  would  severely  prejudice  the  Commonwealth if it sought to try [the] appellant."" Id. at 891 (citing Commonwealth v.  Ross, 498 Pa. 512, 447 A.2d 943 (1982) (finding that the ""request to  withdraw the plea, which had been made after the dismissal of numerous key  Commonwealth witnesses in reliance on the plea, was properly denied"")). Moreover, this Court has noted that, although a child  victim may still ""be available in a technical sense,"" the emotional  trauma and diminished memory of a child victim are also appropriate  considerations in determining whether the Commonwealth has been substantially  prejudiced by a defendant seeking to withdraw his guilty pleas. Commonwealth v.  Carr, 543 A.2d 1232, 1234 (Pa.Super. 1988). Accordingly, we conclude  the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the prosecution would  be substantially prejudiced if Appellant were allowed to withdraw his  guilty pleas. Consequently, the trial court properly denied Appellant's  pre-sentence motion to withdraw his guilty pleas.14 For all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm. 14We note that: [A] request to withdraw a guilty [*33]  plea after  sentencing is subject to higher scrutiny [than a pre- sentence request] since courts strive to discourage [the]  entry of guilty pleas as sentence-testing devices.  Therefore, in order to withdraw a guilty plea after the  imposition of sentence, a defendant must make a  showing of prejudice which resulted in a manifest  injustice. A defendant meets this burden only if he can  demonstrate  that  his  guilty  plea  was  entered  involuntarily, unknowingly, or unintelligently. Commonwealth v. Culsoir, 209 A.3d 433, 437  (Pa.Super. 2019) (citations and quotation marks  omitted). Here, given that we have found no relief is due  regarding the denial of Appellant's pre-sentence motion  to withdraw his guilty pleas, we also find that, to the  extent Appellant contends the trial court erred in  denying his post-sentence motion to withdraw on the  same grounds, he is not entitled to relief.

"D.H. v. Tucker Inn Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181264.pdf","ORDER This matter is before the Court on Tucker Inn Incorporated's (""Defendant"") Motion to Dismiss [Doc. 10]. This Court  finds as follows: BACKGROUND D.H. (""Plaintiff"") alleges that in September 2015, she was sex trafficked at the Super 8 (the ""Hotel"") when she was  fifteen years old. [Doc. 1, p. 3]. Plaintiff claims that her trafficker kept two rooms rented at the Hotel where she was  made to have sex with as many as twenty older men each day. Id. at 10-11. [*2]  According to Plaintiff, at all times  relevant to her trafficking, Defendant owned, controlled, operated, supervised and managed the Hotel where  Plaintiff was trafficked. Id. at 3, 7. Plaintiff contends that prior to and during her trafficking, prostitution and child sex trafficking was open, obvious and  rampant at the Hotel. Id. at 17-18. Plaintiff witnessed more than ten other sex traffickers operating openly at the  Page 2 of 6 Hotel and Plaintiff estimates that there were 100 or more buyers there each day. Id. at 9. Plaintiff also witnessed at  least twenty other victims being trafficked for sex at the Hotel. Id. Plaintiff describes seeing women and children  wearing lingerie or very little clothing throughout the Hotel. Id. Plaintiff also observed a constant stream of men  visiting the rooms of these women and children for short periods of time, one after another. Id. During her trafficking at the Hotel, Plaintiff alleges that she exhibited numerous well-known and visible signs  common to minor sex trafficking victims, including her age and inappropriate appearance, fatigue, sleep deprivation,  injuries, failure to make eye contact with others, loitering and solicitation of male patrons. Id. at 11. [*3]  Plaintiff  contends that her rooms also evidenced numerous well-known signs of sex trafficking such as many daily, older  male visitors, an excessive number of used condoms and towels and other sex-related paraphernalia. Id. at 11, 13.  Plaintiff's trafficker also paid cash received from Plaintiff's trafficking for an additional day every day at the Hotel,  which Plaintiff avers was an additional sign of sex trafficking. Id. at 12. Plaintiff contends that Defendant's employees had knowledge of and allowed, condoned, facilitated and/or ignored  the widespread prostitution and sex trafficking occurring at the Hotel. Id. at 18. As to Plaintiff specifically, Plaintiff  claims that she regularly interacted with the Hotel's employees and in one instance, an employee confronted  Plaintiff and asked if she was okay. Id. at 12-13. However, when Plaintiff told Defendant's employee that she was  not okay, the employee did nothing. Id. at 13. Moreover, Plaintiff contends that Defendant's employees knew or should have known generally about the sex  crimes being committed at the Hotel based on an extensive history of police reports regarding incidents relating to  sex crimes at the Hotel and public complaints [*4]  from the Hotel's patrons. Id. at 19-22, 24-27. Plaintiff points to  twenty incidents in the four years leading up to Plaintiff's trafficking where the police investigated and/or made  arrests for sex crimes at the Hotel. Id. at 19-22. Plaintiff also points to nine online reviews by patrons of the Hotel  which cited safety concerns and sex crimes that they observed taking place during their stay. Id. at 24-26.  Ultimately, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant provided a market and beds for traffickers to sell women and children for  sex which caused her trafficker to bring her to the Hotel to be sold for sex. Id. at 18. On August 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed this suit against Defendant alleging the following causes of action: (1) violation of  18 U.S.C. § 1595(a), known as the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (""TVPRA""); and (2) nuisance.  See id. In her Complaint, Plaintiff seeks damages including attorney's fees, costs and punitive damages under the  TVPRA and O.C.G.A. §§ 13-6-11, 9-11-68 and 9-15-14. Id. Defendant filed the instant Motion seeking dismissal of  all of Plaintiff's claims on September 21, 2022. [Doc. 10]. The Motion is now ripe for review. LEGAL STANDARD In evaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the court ""accept[s] the [*5]   allegations in the complaint as true and constru[es] them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff."" Traylor v. P'ship  Title Co., 491 F. App'x 988, 989 (11th Cir. 2012). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) provides that a pleading  must contain ""a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Although  detailed factual allegations are not necessarily required, the pleading must contain more than ""labels and  conclusions"" or a ""formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678,  129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). A complaint is insufficient if it only tenders naked assertions devoid of  further factual enhancement. Id. Importantly, ""a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true,  to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'"" Id. (citation omitted). At bottom, the complaint must contain  more than ""an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation,"" id., and must ""plead[] factual content  that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.""  Traylor, 491 F. App'x at 990 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). While all well-pleaded facts must be accepted as true  and construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, Powell v. Thomas, 643 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir. 2011), a  court need not accept as true the plaintiff's legal conclusions, including those couched as factual [*6]  allegations,  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181264, *2 Page 3 of 6 Accordingly, evaluation of a motion to dismiss requires two steps: (1) a court must eliminate any allegations in the  pleading that are merely legal conclusions, and (2) where there are remaining well-pleaded factual allegations, a  court must ""assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.""  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. ANALYSIS In its motion, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's TVPRA and nuisance claims should be dismissed. Defendant also  argues that Plaintiff's claims for attorney's fees, costs and punitive damages should be dismissed. The Court will  address each claim in turn. 1. TVPRA The TVPRA offers a civil remedy to victims of certain types of human trafficking. The civil remedy portion of the  TVPRA provides that a trafficking victim may bring a civil suit against a sex-trafficking perpetrator or ""whoever  knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a venture which that person  knew or should have known has engaged in an act in violation of [the TVPRA]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). In this case,  Plaintiff is not suing the perpetrator, but rather Defendant, who she claims knowingly benefited from the sex  trafficking. To state [*7]  a claim for beneficiary liability under the TVPRA, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that the  defendant: (1) knowingly benefited, (2) from taking part in a common undertaking or enterprise involving risk and potential  profit, (3) that undertaking or enterprise violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff, and (4) the defendant had  constructive or actual knowledge that the undertaking or enterprise violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff. Doe #1 v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 726 (11th Cir. 2021). As to the first element, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant ""knew it was receiving some value from  participating in the alleged venture."" Id. at 724. In this case, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant rented two rooms to  Plaintiff's trafficker and received cash from the room rental. This Court finds that the revenue from the room rental  constitutes a financial benefit sufficient to meet the ""knowingly benefited"" standard. See S.Y. v. Best W. Int'l, Inc.,  No. 2:20-cv-616, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106139, 2021 WL 2315073, at *5 (M.D. Fla. June 7, 2021); see also A.B. v.  H.K. Grp. of Co., No. 1:21-cv-1344, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29214, 2022 WL 467786, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 9, 2022)  (holding that the money received from room rentals constitutes a benefit, knowingly received). The second element requires a plaintiff to allege that a defendant participated in a venture. As to this element, the  Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has made clear that the definition of ""participation in a venture"" is not the same  as [*8]  that found in the criminal provisions of § 1591(e)(4). Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. Instead, in the civil  context, ""participation in a venture"" merely requires that a plaintiff allege that the defendant ""took part in a common  undertaking or enterprise involving risk and potential profit."" Id. at 725. In this case, Plaintiff has made the ""kinds of allegations [that] would establish a hotel operator's participation in a  venture with a sex trafficker."" Id. at 726. Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient because she alleges that Defendant            2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181264, *6 Page 4 of 6 had rented rooms to her trafficker and that Defendant knew or should have known that the trafficker was presently  engaged in sex trafficking with Plaintiff. Plaintiff's Complaint adequately sets forth the reasons why Defendant  should have been on notice of the sex trafficking and how it failed to prevent it. Plaintiff alleges that she regularly  interacted with Defendant's employees and exhibited well-known signs consistent with a trafficking victim.  Moreover, Plaintiff contends that one of Defendant's employees asked Plaintiff if she was okay then did nothing  when Plaintiff responded that she was not okay. At bottom, the allegations are sufficient to allege participation in a  venture. See Best W. Int'l, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106139, 2021 WL 2315073, at *4 (holding that it was [*9]   sufficient for a plaintiff to plead that the defendants participated in a venture by renting rooms to people it knew or  should have known were engaged in sex trafficking). As to the third element, a plaintiff must allege ""that the venture . . . violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff."" Red Roof  Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. The TVPRA criminalizes various acts of human trafficking. In this case, Plaintiff specifically  alleges that she was trafficked in violation of § 1591(a), which makes it a crime to cause a person who has not yet  attained the age of eighteen years to engage in a commercial sex act. Consequently, as to this element, Plaintiff  must therefore plead sufficient facts to plausibly allege that the venture in which Defendant participated committed a  crime against her. Defendant argues that this element is not satisfied because Plaintiff did not allege that Defendant knew or acted in  reckless disregard in furtherance of the alleged child sex trafficking venture. Defendant misstates the standard. In  fact, the Eleventh Circuit has determined that, to establish a violation of § 1591(a), it is sufficient that the plaintiff  allege that she was a minor when she was forced to engage in commercial sex acts and that the Defendant had a  reasonable [*10]  opportunity to observe her on the premises. See United States v. Whyte, 928 F.3d 1317, 1328  (11th Cir. 2019). Here, Plaintiff alleges that she was a minor when she was made to engage in commercial sex acts  with as many as twenty men each day. She further alleges that Defendant had ample opportunity to observe her in  common areas of the Hotel and through her frequent interactions with Defendant's employees, including the time  that Plaintiff told a front desk employee that she was not okay. This Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations are more  than sufficient to show that the venture violated the TVPRA as to Plaintiff. Finally, as to the last element, the allegations must show that a defendant had actual or constructive knowledge that  the venture violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff. Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Knowledge is defined as ""an  awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance."" Id. Conversely, constructive knowledge ""is that knowledge  which 'one using reasonable care or diligence should have.'"" Id. The Court finds that Plaintiff has adequately alleged that Defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of  Plaintiff's sex trafficking at the Hotel. In Plaintiff's Complaint, she alleges that Defendant knew or should have  known about the sex trafficking venture [*11]  based on the following: Plaintiff's age and inappropriate appearance,  her fatigue and sleep deprivation, her injuries, her failure to make eye contact with others, her loitering, her  solicitation of male patrons and the number of men visiting her room. Courts considering similar allegations have  found the allegations sufficient to infer that a defendant knew or should have known of the sex trafficking venture,  and the Court finds these allegations sufficient as well. S.Y. v. Naples Hotel Co., 476 F. Supp. 3d 1251, 1257 (M.D.  Fla. 2020) (collecting cases). As explained in the preceding paragraphs, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to support each element of her  TVPRA claim. As such, to the extent Defendant seeks dismissal of the TVPRA claim, Defendant's motion is  DENIED. 2. Nuisance The Court next evaluates whether Plaintiff adequately alleges a claim for nuisance. Under Georgia law, a nuisance  is defined as ""anything that causes hurt, inconvenience, or damage to another . . . ."" O.C.G.A § 41-1-1. To establish  a nuisance claim, a plaintiff must allege ""the existence of the nuisance complained of, that he or she has suffered  injury, and that the injury complained of was caused by the alleged nuisance."" Bord v. Hillman, 335 Ga. App. 18,  780 S.E.2d 725, 728 (Ga. Ct. App. 2015). Defendant argues that Plaintiff's nuisance claim should be [*12]   2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181264, *8 Page 5 of 6 dismissed because Plaintiff failed to assert that Defendant had control over the alleged harm suffered by Plaintiff. In  other words, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not alleged that Defendant, itself, caused Plaintiff to be sex  trafficked. Because Defendant only challenges Plaintiff's ability to establish the causation element of her nuisance  claim, this Court will focus its analysis on that element. Causation is an essential element of nuisance claims. Alexander v. Hulsey Env't Servs., Inc., 306 Ga. App. 459,  702 S.E.2d 435, 439 (Ga. Ct. App. 2010). To establish proximate cause for a nuisance claim, ""a plaintiff must show  a legally attributable causal connection between the defendant's conduct and the alleged injury."" Id. A successful  nuisance claim cannot be based on mere speculation, conjecture or a possibility of causation. Id. Rather, the  causation standard is that ""it is more likely than not that the conduct of the defendant was a cause in fact of the  result."" Id. Contrary to Defendant's contention, this Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded facts that allow the Court  to draw a reasonable inference that Defendant's conduct caused Plaintiff to be sex trafficked at the Hotel. First,  Plaintiff alleges, and Defendant does not dispute, that Defendant owned and [*13]  operated the Hotel where  Plaintiff was trafficked. Further, as this Court previously concluded, Plaintiff's Complaint adequately sets forth the  reasons why Defendant should have been on notice of the rampant sex trafficking occurring at the Hotel and how it  failed to prevent it. As such, Plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to demonstrate that Defendant's management of  the Hotel in a way which allowed for the widespread commission of sex crimes created a market and beds for sex  traffickers to operate. This sufficiently demonstrates a legally attributable causal connection between Defendant's  conduct and Plaintiff's trafficking. Thus, Defendant's argument for dismissing Plaintiff's nuisance claim fails and  dismissal on that basis is DENIED. 3. Attorney's Fees, Costs and Punitive Damages Finally, this Court examines Plaintiff's claims for attorney's fees, costs and punitive damages. Defendant argues  that Plaintiff did not sufficiently plead her claims for attorney's fees and costs. However, Defendant provides little  context as to why it contends Plaintiff's claims are deficiently pled. Absent any substantive arguments  demonstrating why these claims fail, dismissal of Plaintiff's claims [*14]  for attorney's fees and costs is DENIED. Likewise, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently plead her claim for punitive damages. More  specifically, Defendant contends that Plaintiff has failed to allege factual details of Defendant's actions that  exhibited ""willful misconduct, malice, fraud, wantonness, oppression, or . . . entire want of care which would raise  the presumption of conscious indifference to consequences"" as required to recover punitive damages under  Georgia law. See O.C.G.A. § 51-12-5.1. This Court disagrees. As analyzed above, this Court has concluded that  Plaintiff's Complaint adequately sets forth allegations showing that Defendant knew or should have known about  the rampant sex crimes occurring at the Hotel and yet failed to prevent it. The Court finds that such allegations also  demonstrate the type of misconduct that would support an award of punitive damages. Accordingly, dismissal of  Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages is DENIED."

"Doe v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714.pdf","[*718]  BRASHER, Circuit Judge: 21 F.4th 714, *714; 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 38060, **1 Page 6 of 14 Four sex trafficking victims, proceeding as Jane Does,  filed complaints against numerous  [*719]  defendants  within the hotel industry for violations of the Trafficking  Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, specifically 18  U.S.C. § 1595(a), and Georgia state law. HN1[ ] Under  the TVPRA, a trafficking victim may sue a sex-trafficking  perpetrator and ""whoever knowingly benefits, financially  or by receiving anything of value from participation in a  venture which that person knew or should have known  has engaged in an act in violation of [the Trafficking  Victims Protection Act]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). The Does  alleged that they were trafficked in Atlanta-area hotels  and sued the hotel operators, employees, owners,  franchisees, and franchisors of those hotels. The district court held that the Does failed to plausibly  allege claims against three hotel franchisors: [**4]   Choice Hotels International, Inc., Wyndham Hotels &  Resorts, Inc., and Microtel Inn & Suites Franchising, Inc.  It dismissed their amended complaints as to those  franchisors. And the Does appealed. To resolve this appeal, we must answer two questions.  First, we must decide a question of first impression  about the elements of a TVPRA beneficiary claim. HN2[ ] We hold that Section 1595(a) should be applied  according to its plain meaning: that is, to state a claim  for beneficiary liability under the TVPRA, a plaintiff must  plausibly allege that the defendant (1) knowingly  benefited (2) from taking part in a common undertaking  or enterprise involving risk and potential profit, (3) that  the undertaking or enterprise violated the TVPRA as to  the plaintiff, and (4) that the defendant had constructive  or actual knowledge that the undertaking or enterprise  violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff. Second, we must  determine whether the Does have plausibly alleged  facts that satisfy those elements against each of the  franchisors. Here, we conclude that the Does have  failed to meet that burden as to the three franchisors at  issue on appeal. We likewise conclude that, as to these  three defendants, the Does did not state [**5]  a  plausible claim under Georgia state law. Accordingly,  we affirm. I. BACKGROUND A. Factual Background Four Jane Does filed nearly identical amended  complaints against individuals and businesses involved  in the hotel industry, including individual hotels, owners,  management, and franchisors. The Does alleged that  they were ""victims of the conspicuous and open sex  trafficking that occurred at Defendants' hotels."" They  pleaded facts about hotel sex trafficking generally and  sex trafficking in the Atlanta area, specifically. Among the defendants are the three franchisors  relevant to this appeal: Choice Hotels International, Inc.,  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., and Microtel Inn &  Suites Franchising, Inc. Choice is a franchisor that  licenses its brand to the Suburban Extended Stay in  Chamblee, Georgia. Wyndham is the parent company of  MISF and the franchisor that licenses its brand to the  Microtel Inn & Suites in Atlanta, Georgia. MISF enters  into franchise agreements with Microtel Inn & Suites  franchisees on Wyndham's behalf. The Does alleged  that these franchisors violated the TVPRA, 18 U.S.C. §  1595(a); the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt  Organizations Act, O.C.G.A. §§ 16-14-4(a), (c); and  acted negligently. The Does alleged [**6]  that these two hotels—the  Suburban Extended Stay in Chamblee and the Microtel  Inn & Suites in At-lanta—""accommodate[d], facilitate[d],  and participate[d] in the sex trafficking of women, men,  and children in Atlanta""—including their own sex  trafficking. The  [*720]  Does alleged that they were  ""forced to engage in commercial sex acts at [these]  hotels by various sex traffickers."" And the money that  their traffickers made from those ventures was ""used to  pay . . . for their hotel rooms and other services in  furtherance of the sex trafficking ventures occurring at  [these] hotels."" Some of the hotels' employees worked  with the traffickers by, for example, acting ""as lookouts,  notifying traffickers if police were present."" Traffickers  paid these employees in cash or drugs. Does 1, 2, and 4 alleged that there was a ""well- established sex trafficking venture"" at the Suburban  Extended Stay licensed by Choice Hotels in Chamblee,  Georgia. That alleged venture was comprised of  ""traffickers,  the  hotel's  employees,  management,  owners, and franchisor, as well as others involved in the  sex trafficking of victims at that hotel."" Many of the local  hotel's employees assisted and facilitated the Does'  trafficking [**7]  and were paid by the traffickers to work  as lookouts. While being trafficked at the Suburban  Extended  Stay,  the  Does  ""exhibited  numerous  wellknown and visible signs of a sex trafficking victim.""  And the state of the hotel rooms used for the trafficking  and the constant flow of men in and out of rooms  suggested that sex trafficking was occurring at the hotel. Three Does alleged that Choice ""controlled the policies  and standards applicable to and enforced (or not  enforced) at the Suburban Extended Stay (Chamblee),  21 F.4th 714, *718; 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 38060, **3 Page 7 of 14 as well as the training of its managers and employees.""  Choice also ""sent inspectors to examine this hotel, at  times anonymously, and the ongoing sex trafficking  activity would have been apparent to those inspectors.""  Further, the Does alleged upon information and belief  that Choice monitored online reviews of the hotel, which  ""reported widespread prostitution and crime occurring at  the hotel."" The Does also alleged that customers  complained to Choice about prostitution, commercial  sex trafficking, and other criminal activity at the hotel.  The police responded to prostitution calls at the hotel on  numerous occasions, and nonprofit and religious groups  regularly visited ""to provide [**8]  food and rescue  information  to  the  sex  trafficking  victims  they  encounter[ed] at the hotel."" As for Wyndham and MISF, all four Does alleged that  there was also a ""well-established sex trafficking  venture at the Microtel"" in Atlanta that was licensed by  Wyndham and MISF. The Does allege that the local  hotel's  employees  participated  in,  assisted,  and  facilitated the Does' trafficking at the Microtel by working  as lookouts for traffickers and allowing them to use the  lobby computer to advertise for sex with Does 1 and 2.  And during the years that Doe 4 was trafficked at the  Microtel, ""a single sex trafficker completely controlled  the third floor of the hotel."" That trafficker also used the  banquet room to take photographs of victims to use for  online advertisements. Wyndham and MISF ""controlled  the policies and standards applicable to and enforced  (or not enforced) at the Microtel (Atlanta), as well as the  training of its managers and employees."" ""Wyndham  and [MISF]--the hotel's franchisor[s]-- sent inspectors to  examine this hotel, at times anonymously, and the  ongoing sex trafficking activity would have been  apparent to those inspectors."" The  Does  alleged  that  the  three  franchisors  profited [**9]  from this activity. In exchange for allowing  the Microtel to use its brand, Wyndham received ""royalty  and other fees based on a percentage of their gross  room revenue."" The other franchisors also earned a  percentage of the revenue generated from the daily  rental of hotel rooms, including the rental of rooms   [*721]  used to ""harbor, exploit, and sell"" each of the  Does. And the franchisors ""intentionally turn[ed] a blind  eye to safety and security issues at their hotels . . . even  when [they] knew or should have known part of [their]  profits were derived from sex trafficking ventures."" They  ""should have known"" about those sex trafficking  ventures, according to the Does, because sex trafficking  occurred openly at the hotels, and the franchisors  routinely ""investigate individual hotel locations and take  remedial action"" when revenue is down. B. Procedural Background The Does asserted a ""standalone"" civil beneficiary  TVPRA claim against the franchisors and alleged that  they knowingly benefitted from participation in a sex  trafficking venture that they ""knew or should have  known"" violated the TVPRA. They also asserted  Georgia RICO claims predicated on violations of Section  1591 and Georgia state law. Finally, [**10]  they alleged  negligence based on the franchisors' ""supervisory  control and authority over employees, contractors and  others"" at the hotels, their failure to keep the hotels safe,  and their failure to ""adequately and properly protect their  invitees, including [the Does], in breach of their duty of  care."" Soon after filing the amended complaint, Doe 3  voluntarily dismissed all claims against Choice without  prejudice. Choice, Wyndham, and MISF moved to dismiss each of  the Does' amended complaints against them for failure  to state a claim. Choice alternatively moved to strike  certain allegations from Does 1, 2, and 4's amended  complaints as ""impertinent and salacious."" The district  court granted the motions to dismiss as to all claims  against Choice, Wyndham, and MISF without prejudice  in nearly identical orders in each case. In those orders,  the district court also granted Choice's motion to strike  the disputed language from Does 1, 2, and 4's amended  complaints and sua sponte struck the same material  from Doe 3's amended complaint. The Does then moved for entry of judgment in favor of  Choice (in all cases except for the third Doe's case),  Wyndham, and MISF under Federal Rule of Civil  Procedure 54(b) and for interlocutory [**11]  review  under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). They argued that the district  court's order dismissing Wyndham, MISF, and Choice  was a final judgment under Rule 54(b) and there was no  just reason for delay because (1) the immediate  resolution of an appeal would resolve issues in all four  interrelated Doe actions, streamlining the litigation; (2)  there would be a risk of duplicative discovery and trials  without an immediate appeal, and an immediate appeal  could serve to limit the scope of discovery; (3) the cases  were still in the early stages of discovery, so duplicative  discovery could best be avoided now; and (4) COVID- 19's impact on the defendants' operations could  diminish the Does' ability to recover later on. The Does  also argued that the question presented by the  dismissal order, how to interpret 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a)'s  knowledge requirement, satisfied the Section 1292(b)  factors for interlocutory review. No defendant opposed  21 F.4th 714, *720; 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 38060, **7 Page 8 of 14 the motion. The district court granted the franchisors' motions for  Rule 54(b) certification and interlocutory review under  Section 1292(b) and stayed discovery pending the  anticipated appeals. The court later amended the entry  of final judgment to dismiss Choice, Wyndham, and  MISF with prejudice at the Does' request and after they  waived the right to later [**12]  add the defendants if  unsuccessful on appeal. Each Doe timely appealed the district court's amended  Rule 54(b) judgment and, in the alternative, filed a  petition for permission to appeal under Section 1292(b).  [*722]  II. JURISDICTION We must first satisfy ourselves that we have jurisdiction  over this appeal. See Boyd v. Homes of Legend, Inc.,  188 F.3d 1294, 1297 (11th Cir. 1999). The Does argue  that we have jurisdiction under both 28 U.S.C. § 1291  and 28 U.S.C. § 1292. We conclude that jurisdiction is  proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 because the district  court properly directed entry of final judgment as to the  franchisor defendants under Rule 54(b). We therefore  do not reach the question of whether jurisdiction is  proper under Section 1292(b). HN3[ ] ""A district court must follow a two-step analysis  in determining whether a partial final judgment may  properly be certified under Rule 54(b)."" Lloyd Noland  Found., Inc. v. Tenet Health Care Corp., 483 F.3d 773,  777 (11th Cir. 2007). The court must determine (1)  whether ""its final judgment is, in fact, both 'final' and a  'judgment'""; and (2) whether there is ""just reason for  delay"" in certifying the order as immediately appealable.  Id. An order is ""final"" if it ""disposes entirely of a  separable claim or dismisses a party entirely."" In re Se.  Banking Corp., 69 F.3d 1539, 1547 (11th Cir. 1995). It is  a ""judgment"" if ""it is a decision upon a cognizable claim  for relief."" Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Gen. Elec. Co., 446  U.S. 1, 7, 100 S. Ct. 1460, 64 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1980). When  determining whether there is no just reason for delay,  the district court should consider ""judicial [**13]   administrative interests--including the historic federal  policy against piecemeal appeals--and the equities  involved."" Lloyd Noland Found., 483 F.3d at 778  (cleaned up). This Court reviews the first step of the  district court's analysis-- whether the order constitutes a  final judgment--de novo. Id. at 778 & n.5. We review  whether there was no ""just reason for delay"" only for  abuse of discretion. Id. at 778 n.5. First, the district court's orders granting the motions to  dismiss filed by Choice, Wyndham, and MISF were  ""final judgments"" for purposes of Rule 54(b). Those  orders dismissed Choice, Wyndham, and MISF from the  cases entirely. See In re Se. Banking Corp., 69 F.3d at  1547. The court initially dismissed the franchisors  without prejudice and reserved the Does' rights to add  them back later if newly discovered evidence warranted  their inclusion. Even with this reservation of right, that  order was still an ""ultimate disposition"" of the claims  against those parties. See Lloyd Noland Found., 483  F.3d at 777. The district court later amended its  dismissal of the franchisors to be with prejudice after the  Does stipulated that they would rest on their original  allegations against the franchisors and waived their right  to add them to the case later should their appeals fail.  Accordingly, the district court did not err in concluding  that [**14]  its dismissals of the franchisors were ""final  judgments"" for purposes of Rule 54(b). Second, the district court did not abuse its discretion in  determining that there was no just reason to delay this  appeal. HN4[ ] This Court has stated that ""limitation of  piecemeal appeals [is] an essential purpose served by  postponing final disposition"" of claims that a party  wishes to appeal. Ebrahimi v. City of Huntsville Bd. of  Educ., 114 F.3d 162, 168 (11th Cir. 1997). We have  also cautioned that ""[a]bsent special circumstances . . .  the district court's preference for pretrial appellate  review of its dismissal decisions constitutes an improper  basis for issuance of a partial final judgment"" under Rule  54(b). Id. at 168. The district court did not abuse its discretion in  concluding that there was no just reason for delay due  to the unique circumstances of these cases. The Does'  cases closely parallel one another, and the district  court's dismissal order is the same  [*723]  in each.  Addressing this consolidated appeal now significantly  enhances the efficiency of the litigation. The relatedness  of these four cases, their early stage in litigation, the  number of defendants involved, and the substantial  discovery to be had are the kind of ""special  circumstances"" that warrant appellate review. See  Ebrahimi,  114  F.3d  at  168.  Accordingly,  the  district [**15]  court did not abuse its discretion in finding  no just reason to delay the appeal. Consequently, this  Court has jurisdiction over the appeal under 28 U.S.C. §  1291 and we need not reach the question of whether  the district court properly certified its rulings as  immediately appealable under Section 1292(b). III. STANDARD OF REVIEW 21 F.4th 714, *721; 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 38060, **11 Page 9 of 14 HN5[ ] This Court ""review[s] an order granting a  motion to dismiss with prejudice de novo, applying the  same standards the district court used."" Young  Apartments, Inc. v. Town of Jupiter, 529 F.3d 1027,  1037 (11th Cir. 2008). As such, we must accept all  factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe  them ""in the light most favorable to the plaintiff."" Id.  ""Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of  action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do  not suffice."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.  Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). Instead, a plaintiff  must allege sufficient facts that, ""accepted as true, []  'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'"" Id.  (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570,  127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). IV. DISCUSSION A. Defining a Beneficiary Claim At its core, this is a case about statutory interpretation.  HN6[ ] We begin that task, as always, with the  common and ordinary meaning of the words used in a  statute. See Consol. Bank, N.A. v. U.S. Dep't of  Treasury, 118 F.3d 1461, 1464 (11th Cir. 1997) (""In the  absence of a statutory definition of a term, we look to  the common usage of words for their meaning.""); see  also CBS Inc. v. PrimeTime 24 Joint Venture, 245 F.3d  1217, 1222 (11th Cir. 2001) (stating that, [**16]  when  the statutory text is unambiguous, this Court should  begin and end its analysis with the text's plain meaning). HN7[ ]  The  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1591, prohibits the sex  trafficking of children or adults by force, fraud, or  coercion. In addition to that criminal prohibition, the Act  provides sex-trafficking victims with a civil cause of  action against ""the perpetrator (or whoever knowingly  benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value  from participation in a venture which that person knew  or should have known has engaged in an act in violation  of this chapter)."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). For purposes of  this appeal, we assume that the Does are sex-trafficking  victims under the TVPRA. The only question for this  Court, therefore, is whether the Does have plausibly  alleged that the franchisors are liable. The Does allege  that the franchisors are liable because they knowingly  benefited from participation in a venture that they should  have known violated Section 1591(a). That allegation  can be broken down into four component parts: that the  franchisors (1) knowingly benefited (2) from participating  in a venture; (3) that venture violated the TVPRA as to  the Does; and (4) the franchisors knew or [**17]  should  have known that the venture violated the TVPRA as to  the Does. We address each part in turn. The parties do not meaningfully dispute the first  element, and we likewise have little difficulty in deciding  what ""knowingly benefits"" means. HN8[ ] ""Knowledge""   [*724]  is ""[a]n awareness or understanding of a fact or  circumstance; a state of mind in which a person has no  substantial doubt about the existence of a fact.""  Knowledge, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). And  Section 1595(a) explains that a defendant may benefit  ""financially  or  by  receiving  anything  of  value.""  Accordingly, a plaintiff like the Does must allege that the  defendant knew it was receiving some value from  participating in the alleged venture. Most of the parties' dispute concerns the second  element—to knowingly benefit from participating in a  venture. The franchisors argue, and the district court  held, that we should incorporate the definition of  ""participation in a venture"" from the criminal provisions  in  Section  1591.  Section  1591(e)(4)  defines  ""participation in a venture"" as ""knowingly assisting,  supporting, or facilitating a violation of subsection  (a)(1),"" which criminalizes ""commercial sex act[s]"" of  minors or obtained through threat or force. For the  following reasons, we disagree [**18]  with transposing  the statutory definition from this criminal section to the  civil cause of action. First, although we usually presume that Congress  intends phrases in the same statute to mean the same  thing, see, e.g., Law v. Siegel, 571 U.S. 415, 422, 134  S. Ct. 1188, 188 L. Ed. 2d 146 (2014), the text of this  statute overcomes that presumption. HN9[ ] Section  1591 clearly states that its definition of ""participation in a  venture"" applies only ""[i]n this section."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(e). That is, by its plain terms, the definition applies  only to the phrase as used in Section 1591 of the  statute. That limited application makes sense; Section  1591 carries criminal penalties, whereas Section 1595  does not. Presumably because it imposes criminal  liability, Section 1591(a) includes a scienter requirement  that does not appear in Section 1595(a)--a defendant  must know ""that means of force, threats of force, fraud,  coercion . . . , or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a commercial  sex act."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Second, the civil provisions of Section 1595(a) make no  sense with Section 1591's definition of ""participation in a  venture"" read in. A plaintiff can sue a perpetrator of sex  trafficking—i.e., someone who has violated the criminal  statute—without resort to the beneficiary cause of  21 F.4th 714, *723; 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 38060, **15 Page 10 of 14 action. To state a beneficiary claim, however, a plaintiff  must allege that the defendant [**19]  ""knowingly  benefit[ted], financially or by receiving anything of value  from participation in a venture which that person knew  or should have known has engaged in an act in violation  of this chapter."" See 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). If we replace  ""participation in a venture"" with Section 1591(e)(4)'s  ""knowingly assisting, supporting, or facilitating a  violation of subsection (a)(1),"" we get a nonsense  sentence:  benefited  ""from  [knowingly  assisting,  supporting, or facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)]  which that person knew or should have known has  engaged in an act in violation of this chapter."" In other  words, the franchisors' formulation requires a plaintiff to  prove that the defendant knowingly facilitated a  violation, making the ""should have known"" language  superfluous. HN10[ ] Instead of incorporating Section 1591(e)(4)'s  idiosyncratic definition of ""participation in a venture,"" we  interpret that phrase in Section 1595(a) according to its  plain meaning. The ordinary meaning of ""venture"" is an  undertaking or enterprise involving risk and potential  profit. See Venture, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed.  2019) (""[a]n undertaking that involves risk; esp., a  speculative commercial enterprise""); Venture, Oxford  English Dictionary 520 (2d ed. 1989) (""[a]n enterprise of  a business nature in which [**20]  there is considerable   [*725]  risk of loss as well as chance of gain; a  commercial speculation""). The ordinary meaning of  participate or participation is to take part in or share with  others  in  common  or  in  an  association.  See  Participation, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019)  (""[t]he act of taking part in something""); Participate,  Oxford English Dictionary 268 (2d ed. 1989) (""[a] taking  part, association, or sharing (with others) in some action  or matter""). Accordingly, we conclude that the phrase  ""participation in a venture"" requires that the Does allege  that the franchisors took part in a common undertaking  or enterprise involving risk and potential profit. The third element of the Does' claim is that the venture  in which the defendant participated and from which it  knowingly benefited must have violated the TVPRA as  to the plaintiff. The TVPRA criminalizes various acts, but  the Does specifically premise their Section 1595(a)  beneficiary claims on violations of Section 1591(a).  HN11[ ] Section 1591(a) makes it a crime to  ""knowingly"" harbor or solicit a person for commercial  sex while ""knowing . . . that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion . . . , or any combination of such  means will be used to cause the person to engage  in [**21]  a commercial sex act."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a).  Section 1591(a) also prohibits anyone from knowingly  ""benefit[ting], financially or by receiving anything of  value""  from  ""knowingly  assisting,  supporting,  or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)."" Id. at  1591(a)(2) & (e)(4). Consequently, the Does must plead  sufficient facts to plausibly allege that the venture in  which the franchisors participated committed one of  these crimes against them. HN12[ ] Fourth, the defendant must have either actual  or constructive knowledge that the venture—in which it  voluntarily participated and from which it knowingly  benefited—violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff.  Section 1595(a) requires that the defendant ""knew or  should have known [that the venture] has engaged in an  act in violation of this chapter."" Knowledge requires ""[a]n  awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance.""  Knowledge, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019).  Constructive knowledge, on the other hand, is that  knowledge which ""one using reasonable care or  diligence  should  have.""  Constructive  Knowledge,  Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). Thus, the fran- chisors may be liable under the TVPRA if they have  either actual or constructive knowledge that the venture  in which they participated and from which they  benefited [**22]  violated the TVPRA as to the Does. In defining these elements according to their plain  meaning, we depart from some courts and agree with  others. The district courts are all over the map on the  meaning of these terms. See, e.g., A.B. v. Hilton  Worldwide Holdings Inc., 484 F.Supp.3d 921, 937 (D.  Or. 2020) (collecting cases). But most district courts, like  us, have rejected the idea that a court can transpose the  definition of ""participation in a venture"" from the criminal  section to the civil cause of action. See, e.g., A.B. v.  Marriott Int'l, Inc., 455 F.Supp.3d 171, 183 (E.D. Pa.  2020). As for our sister circuits, only the First Circuit has  addressed a Section 1595(a) beneficiary claim. See  Ricchio v. McLean, 853 F.3d 553, 556-58 (1st Cir.  2017). And we think our reasoning is consistent with the  disposition there. In Ricchio, the plaintiff sued the owner  and live-in operators of a hotel where she was held  hostage and sexually abused. Id. at 556. The First  Circuit held that the plaintiff had plausibly alleged that  the operators' association with the plaintiff's sex  trafficker was a ""venture"" because her abuser ""had prior  commercial dealings with the [operators], which the  parties wished to reinstate for profit."" Id. at 555.  Considering  [*726]  these dealings, the plaintiff also  plausibly alleged that, by renting a room to the abuser,  the operators were ""associating with him in an effort to  force [the plaintiff] to serve their [**23]  business  21 F.4th 714, *724; 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 38060, **18 Page 11 of 14 objective."" Id. We agree that these kinds of allegations  would establish a hotel operator's participation in a  venture with a sex trafficker. HN13[ ] In short, we hold that, to state a beneficiary  claim under Section 1595(a), a plaintiff must plausibly  allege that the defendant (1) knowingly benefited, (2)  from taking part in a common undertaking or enterprise  involving risk and potential profit, (3) that undertaking or  enterprise violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff, and (4)  the defendant had constructive or actual knowledge that  the undertaking or enterprise violated the TVPRA as to  the plaintiff. B. The Does' Beneficiary Claims Against the  Franchisors Having defined the elements of a beneficiary claim, we  now consider whether the Does have stated such a  claim against these three hotel franchisors for the  operation of these two hotels. We conclude that they  have not. Specifically, the Does have not plausibly  alleged that these three hotel franchisors participated in  a venture that violated the TVPRA. We begin with the venture the Does say that the  franchisors participated in. Throughout their complaints,  the Does alleged that the franchisors participated in ""sex  trafficking ventures."" On the first [**24]  page of the  complaints, they referred to ""sex trafficking ventures""  that the ""Defendants were essential to the success of.""  On the next page they alleged that ""[e]ach of  Defendants' hotels hosted one or more hotel sex  trafficking  ventures.""  They  stated  that  ""several  Defendants' agents and employees actively participated  in sex trafficking ventures and were rewarded for doing  so."" They subtitled the allegations against each  franchisor as ""The Suburban Extended Stay (Chamblee)  Sex Trafficking Venture"" and ""The Microtel (Atlanta) Sex  Trafficking Venture."" Over and over, they repeated this  phrase: sex trafficking venture. In fact, every single  reference to a ""venture"" in the complaints refers to a  ""sex trafficking venture."" Then, the Does alleged that the  franchisors profited from this ""sex trafficking venture""               through room fees and should have known that this  venture victimized them in violation of the TVPRA. So we must determine whether the Does plausibly  alleged that the franchisors took part in the common  undertaking of sex trafficking with hotel employees,  management, owners, and sex traffickers. On this  complaint, they did not. The Does alleged that  Wyndham ""licenses its hotel brands, [**25]  including  Microtel . . . to franchisees who pay Wyndham royalty  and other fees based on a percentage of their gross  room revenue."" They alleged that Choice ""received a  percentage of the revenue generated by the operation  of the Suburban Extended Stay (Chamblee), including a  percentage of the revenue generated for the rate  charged on the rooms in which"" each Doe was  trafficked. They also alleged that each of the franchisors  ""owned, managed, supervised, operated, oversaw,  controlled the operation of, and/or were inextricably  connected to the renting of rooms"" at the hotels. These  allegations may suggest  [*727]  that the franchisors  financially benefitted from renting hotel rooms to the  Does' sex traffickers. But they do nothing to show that  the franchisors participated in a common undertaking  involving risk or profit that violated the TVPRA—i.e., the  alleged sex trafficking ventures. The Does also alleged that the franchisors investigated  the individual hotels, took remedial action when revenue  was down, read online reviews mentioning prostitution  and crime occurring generally at the hotels, and  controlled the training of managers and employees who  were allegedly involved in facilitating sex [**26]   trafficking at the hotels. Again, these allegations are  insufficient to state a claim. None of these allegations  suggest that the franchisors participated in an alleged  common undertaking or enterprise with the Does' sex  traffickers or others at the hotel who violated the statute. Perhaps recognizing their tenuous legal position, the  Does allege something different on appeal: that the  franchisors participated in commercial ventures to  operate hotels and that those hotel ventures violated the  statute. There are two problems with that new theory.  First, it is incompatible with the allegations in the Does'  complaints. Again, every time the complaints refer to  ventures, they refer to ""sex trafficking ventures."" And  those ventures were alleged to include the sex  traffickers themselves as participants. On the other  hand, there are no nonconclusory allegations in the  complaint about the franchisors' business relationship  with anyone else involved in operating these hotels.  Second, the Does failed to present this theory to the  21 F.4th 714, *726; 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 38060, **23 Page 12 of 14 district court when given the opportunity. This was no  oversight. The district court granted the Does leave to  amend their complaints, yet they still alleged ""sex  trafficking [**27]  ventures."" The district court then  dismissed the franchisors without prejudice, specifically  so that the Does could later amend their complaints to  add them back. The Does chose instead to request that  dismissal be entered with prejudice. We will not  consider this theory for the first time on appeal after the  Does were given ample opportunity to present it in the  district court. Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., 385  F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir. 2004). HN14[ ] In short, to participate in a venture under  Section 1595(a), a defendant must take part in a  common undertaking involving risk or profit. The Does  chose to frame the ventures at issue as sex trafficking  ventures in their amended complaints. Yet they have  provided no plausible allegations that the franchisors  took part in the common undertaking of sex trafficking.  Their only allegations as to the franchisors' knowledge  or participation in those sex trafficking ventures are that  the franchisors sent inspectors to the hotels who would  have seen signs of sex trafficking and that they received  reviews mentioning sex work occurring at the hotels. But  observing something is not the same as participating in  it. Accordingly, the Does' Section 1595(a) beneficiary  claims against the franchisors fail. C. State Law Claims We also affirm the district [**28]  court's dismissal of the  Does' Georgia RICO Act and negligence claims against  the franchisors. The Does argue that the district court erred by failing to  accept their allegations when dismissing their RICO  claims. And they argue that they plausibly alleged the  predicate acts of prostitution and sexual servitude.  Finally, they argue that the district court applied an  incorrect standard in determining that they had failed to  plausibly allege a criminal agreement. As part of that  argument, the Does explain that to  [*728]  establish an  agreement for purposes of a RICO conspiracy, they  need only allege ""a mere tacit understanding between  two or more people that they will pursue a particular  criminal objective."" And they continue that they plausibly  alleged such ""a tacit understanding between the  Franchisors and their franchisees to turn a blind eye to  allow and profit from the sex trafficking at the Microtel  and SES."" We disagree. Accepting all allegations in the amended complaints, the  Does have failed to plausibly allege a Georgia RICO  claim. First, the Does alleged that the franchisors  violated O.C.G.A. §§ 16-14-4(a) and (c). Section 16-14- 4(a) makes it illegal ""for any person, through a pattern of  racketeering  activity  or  proceeds  derived [**29]   therefrom, to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly,  any interest in or control of any enterprise, real property,  or personal property of any nature, including money."" A  ""pattern of racketeering activity"" means ""[e]ngaging in at  least two acts of racketeering activity in furtherance of  one or more incidents, schemes, or transactions that  have the same or similar intents, results, accomplices,  victims, or methods of commission or otherwise are  interrelated by distinguishing characteristics."" O.C.G.A.  § 16-14-3(4)(A). A ""racketeering activity"" is the  commission,  attempted  commission,  solicitation,  coercion, or intimidation of another ""to commit any crime  which is chargeable by indictment under"" Georgia law.  Id. at § 16-14-3(5)(A). And ""[a]ny person who is injured  by reason of any violation of Code Section 16-4-4 shall  have a cause of action"" against the violator. Id. at § 16- 14-6(c). The Does alleged that the franchisors ""as parties to the  crime, and as co-conspirators"" subjected them to sexual  servitude in violation of O.C.G.A. § 16-5-46(c)(1) ""when  they were coerced into performing or conducting  sexually explicit conduct for which something of value,  directly or indirectly, was given, promised to, or received  by someone."" That ""threadbare recital[]"" of the elements  of [**30]  ""sexual servitude"" is insufficient to plausibly  allege a violation of Section 16-5-46(c)(1). See Iqbal,  556 U.S. at 663. The Does also alleged that the franchisors committed  false imprisonment, keeping a place of prostitution,  pimping, and pandering, in violation of Georgia law.  Each allegation contained no more than a threadbare  recital of the elements of the crimes supported by  conclusory allegations. Accordingly, the Does failed to  plausibly allege the predicate acts necessary to support  their RICO claims. The district court did not err in  dismissing the Does' substantive RICO claims against  the franchisors. HN15[ ] Section 16-14-4(c) makes it illegal ""for any  person to conspire or endeavor to violate"" Section 16- 14-4(a). To violate Section 16-14-4(c), one must either  commit an overt act to ""effect the object of"" the  endeavor or conspiracy or a co-conspirator must commit  such an overt act. See O.C.G.A. § 16-14-4(c)(1)-(2).  The Does alleged that the franchisors conspired ""to  acquire money through a pattern of racketeering  21 F.4th 714, *727; 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 38060, **26 Page 13 of 14 activity."" But the pattern of racketeering activity on which  they predicate their conspiracy counts relies on the  same threadbare allegations as the substantive RICO  claims. Because those allegations are insufficient to  plausibly allege any RICO violation, the district court  also correctly dismissed [**31]  the Does' conspiracy  counts. Finally, the district court dismissed the Does' negligence  claims after concluding that the amended complaints  merely alleged ordinary franchise relationships ""which  do not give rise to vicarious liability against franchisors.""  HN16[ ] A franchisor that ""maintain[s] no control over  the operation of the [franchise]"" and ""simply provide[s]   [*729]   supplies  and  consultation  services""  to  franchisee employees does not owe a duty to patrons of  the franchise. Cobb v. Popeye's, Inc., 188 Ga. App. 443,  373 S.E.2d 233, 235 (Ga. Ct. App. 1988). Such a duty  only arises if the franchisor retains a right to control the  day-to-day  operations  of  the  franchise.  See  Schlotzsky's, Inc. v. Hyde, 245 Ga. App. 888, 538  S.E.2d 561, 562 (Ga. Ct. App. 2000). The Does allege that the franchisors ""owned and/or  managed and/or operated and/or oversaw and/or  controlled the operation"" of their hotels and that they  ""had supervisory control over"" the hotels. Those  allegations are mere recitations of the requirements for  franchisor liability, and the Does do not allege any facts  to support them. Accordingly, they have failed to  plausibly allege that the franchisors owed the Does a  duty. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663. The Does' argument that the franchisors ratified the acts  of the franchisees also fails. HN17[ ] Under O.C.G.A. §  10-6-1, a principal-agent relationship arises when one  party ""subsequently ratifies the acts [**32]  of another in  his behalf."" A party ratifies the acts of another by  accepting and retaining the benefits of the other party's  alleged unauthorized act. DaimlerChrysler Motors Co. v.  Clemente, 294 Ga. App. 38, 668 S.E.2d 737, 746 (Ga.  Ct. App. 2008). But the principal must also have ""full  knowledge of all the material facts"" for that acceptance  and retention to constitute ratification. Hyer v. Citizens &  S. Nat'l Bank in Macon, 188 Ga. App. 452, 373 S.E.2d  391, 393 (Ga. Ct. App. 1988). The Does did not plausibly allege that the franchisors  had ""full knowledge of all the material facts"" regarding  the franchise employees' actions in assisting and  facilitating sex trafficking. The Does argue otherwise  based on their allegations that the franchisors sent  inspectors to the hotels ""while hotel employees either  assisted or at the very least, turned a blind eye"" to the  trafficking occurring there. But that allegation alone does  not rise to the level of plausibly alleging the franchisors'  full knowledge of all material facts. Accordingly, the  Does did not plausibly allege that the franchisors ratified  the franchise employees' actions, and the district court  did not err in dismissing the negligence claims."
Doe v. Twitter.pdf,
"Does v. Reddit, Inc., 51 F.4th 1137.pdf","[*1139]  M. SMITH, Circuit Judge: Users of the social media platform Reddit posted and  circulated sexually explicit images and videos of minors  online. In response, the victims, or their parents, sued  Reddit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1595. The district court     51 F.4th 1137, *1137; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 29510, **1 Page 6 of 11 dismissed the claim, holding that section 230 of the  Communications Decency Act (CDA), 47 U.S.C. §  230(c)(1), shielded Reddit from liability. Because  Reddit  is  an  ""interactive  computer  services"" [**4]  provider, it generally enjoys immunity  from liability for user-posted content under § 230(c)(1),  or ""section 230 immunity."" HN1[ ] However, pursuant  to the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex  Trafficking Act of 2018 (FOSTA), section 230 immunity  does not apply to child sex trafficking claims—if the  ""conduct underlying the claim"" also violates 18 U.S.C. §  1591, the criminal child sex trafficking statute. 47 U.S.C.  § 230(e)(5)(A). The dispute in this case is whether the  availability of FOSTA's immunity exception is contingent  upon a plaintiff proving that a defendantwebsite's own  conduct—rather than its users' conduct—resulted in a  violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. We hold that it does, and  we affirm. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND Reddit is a social media platform that allows users to  publicly post content. It is organized by small,  searchable forums devoted to specific topics, called  subreddits. Reddit users create and moderate each  subreddit, dictating the type of content users can post.  In turn, Reddit employees can remove moderators,  content, or entire subreddits that do not conform to  Reddit policies. The plaintiffs in this case are the parents of minors, and  one former minor, who have had sexually explicit  images and videos of them posted to Reddit. Each  plaintiff [**5]  tells a similar story: after discovering  explicit images or videos of their children (or  themselves) posted to one or more subreddits, they  immediately reported the content to the subreddit  moderators and to Reddit employees. In response,  Reddit sometimes—though not always—removed the  content, only for it to be reposted shortly afterward. This  cycle repeated again and again across different  subreddits. Collectively, the plaintiffs contacted Reddit  hundreds of times to report the explicit posts. The plaintiffs allege that the presence of child  pornography on Reddit is blatant, but Reddit has done  little to remove the unlawful content or prevent it from  being posted, because it drives user traffic and revenue.  As of April 2021, when this suit was filed, Reddit hosted  many subreddits that openly and explicitly marketed  themselves as fora for child pornography, with names  like  /r/BestofYoungNSFW,  r/teensdirtie,  /r/TeenBeauties, and /r/YoungGirlsGoneWild. Users  publicly ""trade"" and solicit child pornography on these  pages, and advocacy groups and the press have  repeatedly reported this activity to Reddit. Plaintiffs allege that Reddit earns substantial advertising  revenue from subreddits [**6]  that feature child  pornography because they generate controversy and   [*1140]  attract viewers. Indeed, third-party advertising  tools have listed several subreddits dedicated to child  pornography as some of the most popular pages on the  platform, which encourages advertisers to buy ad space  on those pages. As such, the plaintiffs contend that  Reddit financially benefits from openly hosting child  pornography. The plaintiffs further contend that, because it enjoys the  revenue generated by child pornography, Reddit has  taken little action to block it from the platform. The  plaintiffs allege that Reddit does not adequately train its  moderators to screen and remove unlawful content and  that  some  moderators  post  child  pornography  themselves. Moreover, Reddit has not implemented  basic security measures, such as age verification or IP- address tracking to ban repeat offenders, and it delayed  adoption of automated image-recognition technologies  like ""PhotoDNA,"" which can detect child pornography  and prevent it from being posted. Based on the foregoing, the plaintiffs filed a class-action  lawsuit against Reddit pursuant to the federal civil sex  trafficking statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1595, claiming that  Reddit is liable as a beneficiary [**7]  of child sex  trafficking, among other causes of action. Reddit filed a  motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, which the  district court granted. The district court held that, to  avoid section 230 immunity under FOSTA, the plaintiffs  were required to plead that Reddit's own conduct  violated the criminal sex trafficking statute, 18 U.S.C. §  1591, and they failed to do so. Plaintiffs now appeal. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW HN2[ ] We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §  1291. We review a decision on a motion to dismiss for  failure to state a claim de novo. Gonzalez v. Google  LLC, 2 F.4th 871, 885 (9th Cir. 2021). We take the  allegations in the complaint as true and view them in the  light most favorable to the plaintiffs. Id. ANALYSIS 51 F.4th 1137, *1139; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 29510, **3 Page 7 of 11 I At issue in this appeal is the scope of FOSTA's  exception to section 230 immunity for civil child sex  trafficking claims. The answer to the question involves  several interrelated statutory provisions. To begin, HN3[ ] pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1), ""[n]o provider or  user of an interactive computer service shall be treated  as the publisher or speaker of any information provided  by another information content provider."" In general, this  provision ""immunizes providers of interactive computer  services against liability arising from content created by  third parties."" Fair Hous. Council of San Fernando  Valley v. Roommates.Com, LLC, 521 F.3d 1157, 1162  (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc) (cleaned [**8]  up). In other  words, it ""protects websites from liability for material  posted on the website by someone else."" Doe v.  Internet Brands, Inc., 824 F.3d 846, 850 (9th Cir. 2016).  This  protection  is  ""robust.""  Carafano  v.  Metrosplash.com, Inc., 339 F.3d 1119, 1123 (9th Cir.  2003). HN4[ ] In 2018, Congress amended section 230 by  passing FOSTA. Pub. L. No. 115-164, 132 Stat. 1253.  Among other things, FOSTA provides that section 230  immunity does not apply to certain sex trafficking claims.  Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)(A), ""[n]othing in  [section 230] . . . shall be construed to impair or limit . . .  any claim in a civil action brought under section 1595 of  title 18, if the conduct underlying the claim constitutes a  violation of section 1591 of that title."" In turn, this  provision of FOSTA incorporates two sections of the  Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act  (TVPRA), 18 U.S.C. § 1589 et seq.  [*1141]  First,  section 1595 of the TVPRA provides a civil cause of  action for violations of the federal trafficking laws. 18  U.S.C. § 1595(a). It permits trafficking victims to sue the  perpetrators of their trafficking as well as anyone who  ""knowingly benefits . . . from participation in a venture  which that person knew or should have known"" was  engaged in sex trafficking. Id. HN5[ ] Section 1591, on the other hand, is the federal  criminal child sex trafficking statute. Like section 1595,  section 1591 covers both perpetrators and beneficiaries  of trafficking. Id. § 1591(a). However, the standard for  beneficiary liability pursuant to section 1591 is higher: to  be held criminally liable as a beneficiary, a defendant  must have actual knowledge [**9]  of the trafficking and  must ""assist[], support[], or facilitat[e]"" the trafficking  venture. Id. § 1591(e)(4). HN6[ ] In sum: websites are generally immune from  liability for user-posted content, but that immunity does  not cover civil child sex trafficking claims if the ""conduct  underlying the claim"" violates 18 U.S.C. §1591. II Both parties agree that section 230 immunity applies to  the claims against Reddit. Reddit is an ""interactive  computer service"" provider as defined in § 230(f)(2) and  the plaintiffs' claims treat Reddit ""as the publisher or  speaker"" of ""information provided by another information  content provider."" 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1). Accordingly,  the parties focus their arguments on whether plaintiffs'  claims benefit from FOSTA's exception. The parties dispute whose conduct must have violated  18 U.S.C. §1591 for a website to be held liable in a civil  trafficking suit. Reddit argues that a website may only  be liable for its own criminal conduct. Plaintiffs argue  that a website may be liable as a beneficiary when  someone's conduct (likely a user's conduct) violated the  criminal statute and the claim against the website  derives from that violation. District courts in our circuit  are split on the issue. Compare J. B. v. G6 Hosp., LLC,  No. 19-CV-07848-HSG, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170338,  2021 WL 4079207, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 8, 2021)  (holding defendant's own conduct must violate criminal  statute), [**10]  M. L. v. Craigslist Inc.1, No. C19-6153  BHS-TLF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166334, 2020 WL  5494903, at *4 (W.D. Wash. Sept. 11, 2020), and A.M.  v. Omegle.com, LLC, No. 3:21-CV-01674-MO, 2022  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123695, 2022 WL 2713721, at *7 (D.  Or. July 13, 2022), with Doe v. Twitter, Inc., 555 F.  Supp. 3d 889, 921 (N.D. Cal. 2021) (holding that the  remedial purpose of FOSTA supports a liberal  construction of the immunity exception), and Doe v.  Mindgeek USA Inc., 574 F. Supp. 3d 760, 773-74 (C.D.  Cal. 2021). We have not had the opportunity to address  the issue until now. HN7[ ] We hold that for a plaintiff  to invoke FOSTA's immunity exception, she must  plausibly allege that the website's own conduct violated  section 1591. A Both parties to the appeal claim that the text of FOSTA  is unambiguous. HN8[ ] Thus, we must first ""determine  whether the language is clear and unambiguous, and if  so, apply it as written."" Thrifty Oil Co. v. Bank of Am.  Nat. Tr. & Sav. Ass'n, 322 F.3d 1039, 1057 (9th Cir.  51 F.4th 1137, *1140; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 29510, **7 Page 8 of 11 2003). Accordingly, we commence our analysis by  considering the plain text of the statute. Ross v. Blake,  578 U.S. 632, 638, 136 S. Ct. 1850, 195 L. Ed. 2d 117  (2016). Doing so, we conclude that the plain text of  FOSTA and precedent interpreting a similar immunity  exception establishes that a website can only be held  liable if its own conduct—not a third party's—violates 18  U.S.C. §1591.  [*1142]  HN9[ ] Section 230(e)(5)(A) reads as follows:  ""[n]othing in [section 230] shall be construed to impair or  limit [ ] any claim in a civil action brought under section  1595 of Title 18, if the conduct underlying the claim  constitutes a violation of section 1591 of that title. . . .""  47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)(A) (emphasis added). The  Supreme Court interpreted analogous language in a  similar context in OBB Personenverkehr AG v. Sachs,  577 U.S. 27, 136 S. Ct. 390, 193 L. Ed. 2d 269 (2015).  There, the Court considered the commercial [**11]   activity exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities  Act, which removes foreign states' sovereign immunity  in any action ""based upon a commercial activity carried  on in the United States."" Id. at 29 (quoting 28 U.S.C. §  1605(a)(2)) (emphasis added). Sachs held that, to  ascertain the conduct that a claim is ""based upon,""  courts should identify ""those elements [of a claim] that, if  proven, would entitle a plaintiff to relief"" and ""the  gravamen of the complaint."" Id. at 33 (quoting Saudi  Arabia v. Nelson, 507 U.S. 349, 357, 113 S. Ct. 1471,  123 L. Ed. 2d 47 (1993)). In that case, the plaintiff sued  an Austrian railway after she was injured in an accident  that occurred in Austria, but she purchased her rail  ticket in Massachusetts. Id. at 29-30. Because the  gravamen of her claim—the accident and her injuries— occurred abroad, her claim was not ""based upon""  domestic activity, and the exception did not apply. Id. at  35. We agree with Reddit that ""underlying"" and ""based  upon"" are analogous, so Sachs' interpretation is  instructive.  See  Underlying,  Merriam-Webster's  Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed. 2020) (""underlying""  means  ""basic""  or  ""foundational"").  Granted,  the  ""gravamen"" inquiry in Sachs was fact-bound: the Court  considered the totality of plaintiff's allegations and         identified those most central to her lawsuit. Id. at 35-36.  In [**12]  contrast, this appeal requires us to make a  binary determination as a matter of law. But the basic  thrust of Sachs—that a claim is ""based upon"" its most  important components, or in other words, the facts  ""underlying"" a claim are those most important to proving  the claim—is commonsense, and has logical import  here. HN10[ ] In a sex trafficking beneficiary suit against a  defendant-website, the most important component is the  defendant-website's own conduct—its ""participation in  the venture."" See 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) (authorizing  lawsuits against those who ""benefit[] . . . from  participation in a [trafficking] venture""). A complaint  against a website that merely alleges trafficking by the  website's users—without the participation of the  website—would not survive. Proof that a user committed  criminal trafficking may ""entitle a plaintiff to relief"" in a  case against the user, but not against the website.  Sachs, 577 U.S. at 33. The structure of the plaintiffs' complaint confirms how  central Reddit's conduct is to their case. Although the  plaintiffs take the position that the conduct ""underlying""  their claim is the conduct of the Reddit users who  posted the offending images and videos, very little of  their complaint describes the trafficking conduct [**13]   itself. Rather, the complaint focuses on the facts critical  to Reddit's liability—the ways that Reddit makes money  from permitting child  [*1143]  pornography on its  platform and Reddit's responses to reports of that  pornography. HN11[ ] Because we conclude that the  ""gravamen"" of a section 1595 beneficiary claim is the  defendant's participation in and benefit from the  trafficking scheme, we hold that a defendant-website's  own conduct must ""underl[ie]"" the claim for purposes of  47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)(A). As such, a website's own  conduct must violate 18 U.S.C. § 1591 for the immunity  exception to apply. B To the extent doubt remains about the meaning of  section 230(e)(5)(A), FOSTA's wider statutory context  confirms our reading. See Niz-Chavez, 141 S. Ct. at  1482 (taking a ""wider look at [the] statutory structure"" to  confirm statutory meaning). HN12[ ] Alongside section 230(e)(5)(A), FOSTA added  two other trafficking-related immunity exceptions to the  CDA: sections 230(e)(5)(B) and (C). Those provisions  permit states to prosecute websites if ""the conduct  51 F.4th 1137, *1141; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 29510, **10 Page 9 of 11 underlying the charge"" would violate 18 U.S.C. § 1591  or 18 U.S.C. § 2421A, which criminalize the facilitation  of child sex trafficking and prostitution, respectively. 47  U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)(B)-(C). Because ""identical words and  phrases within the same statute should normally be  given the same meaning,"" we assume that ""the conduct  underlying"" has the same meaning across [**14]  the  three provisions. Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy  Servs., Inc., 551 U.S. 224, 232, 127 S. Ct. 2411, 168 L.  Ed. 2d 112 (2007). This is ""doubly appropriate"" here, id.,  because the provisions are adjacent and were enacted  simultaneously, see Lomax v. Ortiz-Marquez, 140 S. Ct.  1721, 1725, 207 L. Ed. 2d 132 (2020). HN13[ ] Because subsections (B) and (C) authorize  criminal prosecutions, there is good reason to think that  ""the conduct underlying the charge"" as used in (B) and  (C) refers only to the defendant's own conduct. Reading  criminal statutes, we ""presume[] that Congress did not  intend to 'dispense with a conventional mens rea  element, which would require that the defendant know  the facts that make his conduct illegal.'"" United States v.  Collazo, 984 F.3d 1308, 1324 (9th Cir. 2021) (quoting  Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 605, 114 S. Ct.  1793, 128 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1994)). Applying this principle  here, we presume subsection (B) permits states to  prosecute websites for trafficking only if the defendant  ""knowingly"" facilitated trafficking, in violation of 18  U.S.C. § 1591. See § 1591(e)(4). And we presume  subsection (C) permits states to prosecute websites for  promoting or facilitating prostitution only if the website  ""inten[ded]"" to do so, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §  2421A(a). In short, we presume these provisions  authorize criminal prosecutions only for a defendant's  own crimes. Because section 230(e)(5)(A) uses the  same language, we read it to include the same  limitation. See Powerex, 551 U.S. at 232. The statutory  context  reinforces  our  conclusion  that  section  230(e)(5)(A) removes section 230 immunity only when a  website violates 18 U.S.C. §1591. C Although we conclude that the language [**15]  and  structure of the statute resolves its meaning, FOSTA's  original legislative proponents' understanding about how  FOSTA would be interpreted and applied once several  amendments had been made to their original legislation  decidedly supports Reddit's interpretation. In 1996, Congress passed section 230 to promote  development of the internet's ""vibrant and competitive  free market"" and ""diversity of political discourse, unique  opportunities for cultural development, and myriad  avenues for intellectual activity."" Telecommunications  Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, § 509, 110 Stat. 56,  138  [*1144]  (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 230(a)(3)). But by  the 2010s, there was the growing sense that websites  like Backpage.com were taking advantage of the  immunity afforded by section 230 to facilitate online sex  trafficking and promote illegal pornography. 164 Cong.  Rec. S1854 (daily ed. Mar. 21, 2018) (statement of Sen.  McCaskill).  A  congressional  investigation  of  Backpage.com revealed that minors were being  advertised for sex work on the platform and that  Backpage.com  participated  in  the  scheme  by  ""affirmatively edit[ing] ads that it kn[ew] [we]re selling  children for sex"" to avoid having to remove the ads from  the platform. Id. at S1851 (statement of Sen.  Blumenthal). Although section 230 as originally enacted did not  immunize websites [**16]  like Backpage.com from  federal criminal sex trafficking laws, see 47 U.S.C. §  230(e)(1), it was unclear whether states could bring  analogous prosecutions. Courts were also reluctant to  hold websites liable in any civil trafficking suits  stemming from user-posts, even if the website  participated in the scheme. See, e.g., Doe No. 1 v.  Backpage.com, LLC, 817 F.3d 12, 23 (1st Cir. 2016). Congress passed FOSTA in 2018 to address these  issues. The purpose of the bill was ""to give survivors  their day in court . . . [and] open avenues of prosecution  to  law  enforcement  where  they  are  currently  roadblocked."" 164 Cong. Rec. S1851 (daily ed. March  21, 2018) (statement of Sen. Blumenthal); see 164  Cong. Rec. H1291 (daily ed. Feb. 27, 2018) (statement  of Rep. Jackson Lee) (noting that the bill would allow  victims to hold accountable ""online ad services and  websites that facilitate or allow sex trafficking""). As first  introduced in the House, FOSTA simply stated that  section 230 did not ""impair the enforcement of, or limit  availability of victim restitution or civil remedies under . .  . civil laws relating to sexual exploitation of children or  sex trafficking."" H.R. 1865, 115th Cong. § 3 (Apr. 3,  2017). S. 1693, 115th Cong. § 3 (Aug. 1, 2017). This  version  of  FOSTA  would  have  created  an  immunity [**17]  exception for all section 1595 claims  against websites. Opponents of the bill, however, were concerned that it  would ""bring a deluge of frivolous litigation targeting  legitimate, law-abiding intermediaries"" because it was  ""unbounded by any actual knowledge"" requirement. The  51 F.4th 1137, *1143; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 29510, **13 Page 10 of 11 Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act of 2017: Hearing on  S. 1693 Before the S. Comm. on Com., Sci. & Transp.,  115th Cong. 35 (2017) (statement of Abigail Slater,  General  Counsel,  Internet  Association).  These  opponents suggested amendments to require ""a clear  sense of knowing,"" as to ""not damage those who are  truly trying to grow and innovate based on that  protection they get from lawsuits."" Id. at 53 (statement of  Xavier Becerra, Attorney General of Cal.). In response, the Senate altered the bill to its current  form to ""eliminate section 230 as a defense for websites  that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking."" S. Rep. No.  115-199,  at  2  (2018)  (emphasis  added).  As  reintroduced, the bill's ""knowing standard"" was intended  to create a ""high bar"" for liability. The Stop Enabling Sex  Traffickers Act of 2017, Hearing on S. 1693 Before the  Comm. on Commerce, Sci., and Transp., 115 Cong. 9  (2017). Indeed, Representative Ann Wagner, the House  bill's [**18]  original sponsor, complained that the new  version so dramatically ""narrowed"" the immunity  exception and that ""the 'knowingly' mens rea standard . .  . w[ould] not provide operational recourse to justice for  victims across the country and thus may not actually  prevent future victimization."" The Latest Developments  in Combating Online Sex Trafficking: Hearing Before the  Subcomm. on Commc'ns & Tech. of the H.  [*1145]   Comm. on Energy & Com., 115th Cong. 4 n.7 (2018). HN14[ ] On this record, it is clear that FOSTA requires  that a defendant-website violate the criminal statute by  directly sex trafficking or, with actual knowledge,  ""assisting, supporting, or facilitating"" trafficking, for the  immunity  exception  to  apply.  We  agree  with  Representative Wagner that, as enacted, 47 U.S.C. §  230(e)(5)(A)  retains  only  a  limited  capacity  to  accomplish its original goal of allowing trafficking victims  to hold websites accountable. However, this is a flaw, or  perhaps a feature, that Congress wrote into the statute,  and is not one we can rewrite by judicial fiat. III Having concluded that 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)(A) requires  that a defendantwebsite's own conduct violate 18 U.S.C.  § 1591, we must decide whether the plaintiffs have  alleged that Reddit did so in this case. HN15[ ] Section  1591 punishes anyone [**19]  who ""knowingly . . .  benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value,  from participation in a venture which has engaged in [a  sex trafficking act], knowing . . . that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act . . ."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a)(2). ""Participation in a venture,"" in turn, is  defined  as  ""knowingly  assisting,  supporting,  or  facilitating"" sex trafficking activities. Id. § 1591(e)(4).  Accordingly, establishing criminal liability requires that a  defendant  knowingly  benefit  from  knowingly  participating in child sex trafficking. HN16[ ] We agree with the reasoning of other courts to  address the issue that, to hold a defendant criminally  liable as a beneficiary of sex trafficking, the defendant  must have actually ""engaged in some aspect of the sex  trafficking."" See United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App'x  272, 286 (6th Cir. 2016); Noble v. Weinstein, 335 F.  Supp. 3d 504, 524 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (a plaintiff must  allege some ""specific conduct [by the defendant] that  furthered the sex trafficking venture . . . undertaken with  knowledge"" of the venture). To run afoul of § 1591, a  defendant must knowingly benefit from and knowingly  assist, support, or facilitate sex trafficking activities.  Mere association with sex traffickers is insufficient  absent some knowing ""participation"" in the form of  assistance, [**20]  support, or facilitation. See 18 U.S.C.  § 1591(e)(4). The statute does not target those that  merely ""turn a blind eye to the source of their [revenue].""  Afyare, 632 F. App'x at 286. And knowingly benefitting  from participation in such a venture requires actual  knowledge  and""a  causal  relationship  between  affirmative conduct furthering the sex-trafficking venture  and receipt of a benefit."" Geiss v. Weinstein Co.  Holdings LLC, 383 F. Supp. 3d 156, 169 (S.D.N.Y.  2019). In this case, the plaintiffs have not alleged that Reddit  knowingly participated in or benefitted from a sex  trafficking venture. They allege that Reddit provides a  platform where it is easy to share child pornography,  highlights subreddits that feature child pornography to  sell advertising on those pages, allows users who share  child pornography to serve as subreddit moderators,  and fails to remove child pornography even when users  report it, as the plaintiffs did in this case. Together, they  say, this amounts to knowing participation in a sex  trafficking venture. Taken as true, these allegations suggest only that  Reddit ""turned a blind eye"" to the unlawful content  posted on its platform, not that it actively participated in  sex trafficking. See Afyare, 632 F. App'x at 286.  Moreover, the plaintiffs have not alleged a connection  between the child pornography posted on Reddit [**21]   and the revenue Reddit generates, other than the fact  that Reddit makes money from advertising  [*1146]  on  51 F.4th 1137, *1144; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 29510, **17 Page 11 of 11 all popular subreddits. See Noble, 335 F. Supp. 3d at  524 (finding insufficient connection between general  benefits defendant received from working for individual  who perpetrated sex trafficking and the perpetrator's  conduct toward the victim). Plaintiffs who have  successfully  alleged  beneficiary  liability  for  sex  trafficking have charged defendants with far more active  forms of participation than the plaintiffs allege here. See,  e.g., Canosa v. Ziff, No. 18 CIV. 4115 (PAE), 2019 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 13263, 2019 WL 498865, at *23-24  (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 28, 2019) (denying motion to dismiss  beneficiary liability claims where plaintiffs alleged  affiliates of Harvey Weinstein lured victims ""through the  promise of production deals,"" provided Weinstein  ""medications he required to perform sexual acts,"" and  ""cleaned up after his sexual assaults""). As such, the  plaintiffs have failed to state a claim that Reddit violated  18 U.S.C. § 1591."
G.G. v. Salesforce.pdf,
"Gaines v. Jefferson Cnty. Sch. Dist., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217813.pdf","[*1] MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER Before the Court is a Motion for Judgment on the  Pleadings Based on Qualified Immunity [ECF No. 30]  (the ""Motion for Judgment""), which defendants Adrian  Hammitte (""Hammitte"") and Shameka Woods (""Woods"";  collectively with Hammitte, the ""Individual Defendants"")  filed against plaintiff Nathaniel Gaines (""Plaintiff""). The  Individual Defendants also filed a Memorandum of  Authorities in Support thereof. [ECF No. 31]. Discovery  is stayed pending a decision on the Motion for  Judgment. See text-only order issued 9/25/2023.  Plaintiff opposed the Motion for Judgment, [ECF Nos.  32 & 33], and the Individual Defendants filed their reply.  [ECF No. 34]. This is the second motion for judgment that the  Individual Defendants have filed. [ECF Nos. 12 & 13].  The Court denied the initial motion without prejudice and  gave Plaintiff the 1 opportunity to file a Rule 7(a)(7) Schultea reply. [ECF  No. 25]. Plaintiff took advantage of that opportunity,  [ECF No. 26], and the Individual Defendants responded  in opposition. [ECF No. 29]. Having provided the parties with multiple opportunities  to present their positions and having carefully reviewed  the pleadings, all submissions of the parties, and the  applicable [*2]  law, the Court finds as follows: BACKGROUND 1 Following his termination as a Jefferson County  Elementary School employee, Plaintiff brought this  action under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for sex  discrimination and retaliation (Counts I & II), First  Amendment retaliation (Count III), and breach of  contract (Count IV). Plaintiff sued the Individual  Defendants solely for First Amendment retaliation in  Count III. Hammitte is sued in both his individual and  official capacities; Woods is sued only in her individual  capacity. [ECF No. 1] ¶¶ 6 & 8. Prior to his termination, Plaintiff worked as a non- certified interventionist at Jefferson County Elementary  School. Plaintiff attained his teaching certification during  his 1 The Court presented in detail the background of this  case in its prior opinion, which was issued on June 20,  2023. [ECF No. 25]. 2 employment at Jefferson County Elementary and  Page 2 of 9 applied for over a dozen certified teaching positions. He was not hired for  any of those positions. [ECF No. 1] ¶¶ 20-23; 34-35. The  school's athletic director offered Plaintiff a coaching position,  which Plaintiff did not accept. After having been turned down for multiple certified teaching  positions,  Plaintiff  posted  the  following  comment on Facebook: I'm [*3]  going to say what's on alot of people I know  minds. We tired of being underpaid & unappreciated.  This some pure [f******] on so many levels. Ion care who  don't like my hometown full of [excrement emoji]. Then  act dumb to the fact like they don't know the bull[****]  they doing to some hardworking people I swear we  deserve better than this. [ECF No. 1-3] (redacted; see Exhibit 2 to Complaint for unredacted  version).  His  post  generated  three  responses on Facebook from a person who commented on the school administrators' misallocation of COVID relief funds and  air purifiers that did not make it to the classrooms. [ECF  No. 19- 1,-2,-3]. Four days after Plaintiff posted on Facebook,  Woods recommended to Hammitte that Plaintiff should be fired.  [ECF No. 1] ¶ 54; [ECF No. 1-4]. Two days later, Hammitte  notified Plaintiff by letter that he was terminated. [ECF No. 1] ¶  56; [ECF No. 1-5]. According to the Complaint, Plaintiff called Hammitte regarding his termination, and the superintendent told  Plaintiff 3 he was fired for not executing a coaching contract that  had been offered to him, for violating the school's cell  phone policy, and for his Facebook post. [ECF No. 1] ¶¶  60-68. Plaintiff subsequently filed [*4]  a charge with the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. [ECF No.  1] ¶ 14. In its Position Statement in response to  Plaintiff's EEOC charge, the Jefferson County School  District (the ""District"") denied having discriminated  against Plaintiff based on sex or retaliation and stated:  ""Mr. Gaines went on social talking negatively about the  school district, which caused a distraction and disruption  to the district's learning environment."" [ECF No. 19-4].  The EEOC issued a Right to Sue letter [ECF No. 1-2],  and Plaintiff affirms that he filed this lawsuit within ninety  (90) days of his receipt of the EEOC letter. [ECF No. 1]  ¶ 17. In his Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that his Facebook post  ""expressed his belief that Jefferson County was treating  its employees poorly"" and that he ""was speaking as a  private citizen on a matter of public concern."" [ECF No.  1] ¶¶ 51-52. The Individual Defendants counter that:  ""Since the Plaintiff's post conveys no information  beyond the Plaintiff's displeasure with his pay and the  lack of appreciation shown to him, the Plaintiff's post  amounts only to an airing of his personal opinions,  nothing more."" [ECF No. 34] at 10. 4 STANDARD OF REVIEW Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  governs a motion for [*5]  judgment on the pleadings.  The standard for addressing a Rule 12(c) motion is the  same as that for addressing a motion to dismiss under  Rule 12(b)(6). In re GreatLakes Dredge & Co., 624 F.3d  201, 209-10 (5th Cir. 2010); Doe v.MySpace, Inc., 528  F.3d 413, 418 (5th Cir. 2008). To avoid dismissal, ""a  complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,  accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is  plausible on its face.'"" Great Lakes Dredge, 624 F.3d at  210 (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570  (2007)). ""A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff  pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the  reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the  misconduct alleged."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,  Page 3 of 9 678 (2009). The factual allegations in a complaint must  be enough to raise the right to relief above the  speculative level. E.g., Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555; Great  Lakes Dredge, 624 F.3d at 210. The Court must ""accept  all well-pleaded facts as true and construe the complaint  in the light most favorable to the plaintiff."" GreatLakes  Dredge, 624 F.3d at 210. 5 ANALYSIS Qualified Immunity At issue in this Rule 12(c) motion is whether the  Individual Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity  and to have the claims against them in their individual  capacities in Count III dismissed. The Individual  Defendants generally would be shielded from suit when  performing discretionary functions, unless Plaintiff  shows by specific allegations that they violated ""clearly  established statutory or constitutional rights of which a  reasonable [*6]  person would have known."" Harlow  v.Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). ""Qualified  immunity gives government officials breathing room to  make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open  legal questions."" Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 743  (2011). It is Plaintiff's burden to show through  nonconclusory factual averments that the qualified  immunity defense does not apply. Williams v. City of  Jackson,  No.  3:20-CV-785-DPJ-FKB,  2021  WL  4485865, at *4 (S.D. Miss. Sept. 29, 2021) (relying on  Khan v. Normand, 683 F.3d 192, 194 (5th Cir. 2012)). A two-pronged test determines whether defendants are  entitled to qualified immunity: 6 (1) Did the plaintiff allege the violation of a constitutional  right? (2) Was the conduct objectively reasonable in light of  clearly established law at the time the challenged  conduct occurred? Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001), overruled in  part by Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009). ""If no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established, there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity."" Saucier, 533  U.S. at 201. In  Pearson  v.  Callahan,  the  Supreme  Court  reconsidered Saucier's mandated sequence of applying the two  prongs in the qualified immunity analysis and held that district courts  and the courts of appeals may exercise their sound  discretion in deciding which of the two prongs should be addressed  first. Pearson, 555 U.S. at 236. The Court explained: On reconsidering the procedure required in Saucier, we  conclude that, while the sequence set forth there is  often appropriate, it should no longer [*7]  be regarded  as mandatory. The judges of the district courts and the  courts of appeals should be permitted to exercise their  sound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of  the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed  first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at  hand. Id. Based on a review of the facts alleged in this case, and further based on the status of controlling case law at the  time 7 that the challenged conduct occurred, the Court will  render its ruling on this motion under the second prong of the  Saucier test. See Morgan v. Swanson, 659 F.3d 359, 384-85  (5th Cir.2011) (discussing the Supreme Court's ongoing  retreat from Saucier's mandatory order of battle and active  discouragement of district courts from ""unnecessarily deciding the merits of  a Page 4 of 9 constitutional issue""). So as to render a thorough  decision, the Court will initially discuss below the factual  allegations as applied to clearly established First Amendment  retaliation law at the time that Plaintiff's employment was  terminated. A. First Amendment Retaliation Plaintiff claims that the constitutional right at issue is his First Amendment right to speak ""as a private citizen  on a matter of public concern."" [ECF No. 1] ¶ 84. It is well- established that a cognizable employee free speech  retaliation claim [*8]  must satisfy four elements: (1) the employee suffered an adverse employment  action; (2) the speech involved a matter of public concern; 2 (3) the interest in commenting on matters of public  concern outweigh the employer's interest in promoting  efficiency; and 2As explained in Dixon v. Alcorn Cnty., Mississippi, No.  1:19-CV-167-SA-DAS, 2020 WL 5765202, at *5 (N.D.  Miss. Sept. 28, 2020), the second element has been  modified by courts to include the requirement that the  speech was delivered by a private citizen on a matter of  public concern. 8 (4) the speech motivated the employer's adverse  employment action. E.g., Salge v. Edna Indep. Sch. Dist., 411 F.3d 178, 184  (5th Cir. 2005). 1. Adverse Employment Action. In this case, there is no dispute that the first element is  satisfied. Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment  action when he was terminated. [ECF No. 1] ¶ 56; [ECF  No. 1-5]. 2. Private Citizen and Public Concern. The second element is more complex. Plaintiff states in  his Complaint that ""… Mr. Gaines was speaking as a  private citizen on a matter of public concern."" Id. ¶ 52.  But such conclusory statements are not sufficient to  meet his burden. An initial question is whether Plaintiff was speaking as a  private citizen or whether he was speaking in his role as  a school employee and made his Facebook statements  pursuant to his official duties. E.g. [*9] , Garcetti v.  Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 421 (2006) (""We hold that when  public employees make statements pursuant to their  official duties, the employees are not speaking as  citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the  Constitution does not insulate their communications  from employer discipline.""); Williams v. Dallas Indep.  Sch. Dist., 9 480 F.3d 689, 694 (5th Cir. 2007) (athletic director's  memoranda to the office manager and principal were  written in the course of performing his job and therefore  not protected by the First Amendment); Teague v. City  of Flower Mound, Tex., 179 F.3d 377, 382 (5th Cir.  1999)(""citizen  versus  employee""  test  must  be  considered in conjunction with the more lengthy three- factor balancing test of content, context, and form). In  his Schultea reply, [ECF No. 26] ¶¶ 1-3, Plaintiff  informed the Court that his speech was posted directly  to the public on his own time and device and was made  ""outside the chain of command."" The Court is satisfied  under existing law that Plaintiff did not make his  Facebook post as part of his official duties. The inquiry is not over because Plaintiff also must  demonstrate that he was speaking on a matter of public  concern. Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 147 (1983)  (when a public employee speaks upon matters only of  personal  interest,  absent  the  most  unusual  circumstances, a federal court is not the appropriate  forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel  decision taken by a public agency); [*10]  Dixon v.  Alcorn Cnty.,Mississippi, No. 1:19-CV-167-SA-DAS,  2020 WL 5765202, at *5 (N.D. Miss. Sept. 28, 2020) (to  defeat a qualified immunity defense, the plaintiff must  plead sufficient facts to show that, in addition to  speaking as a private citizen, the plaintiff also 10 Page 5 of 9 was speaking on a matter of public concern). The  United States Supreme Court has offered this guidance: Speech involves matters of public concern ""when it can  'be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political,  social, or other concern to the community,' or when it 'is  a subject of legitimate news interest; that is, a subject of  general interest and of value and concern to the public.'""  Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S. ----, ----, 131 S.Ct. 1207,  1216, 179 L.Ed.2d 172 (2011) (citation omitted). Lane v. Franks, 573 U.S. 228, 241 (2014). ""The  arguably 'inappropriate or controversial character of a statement  is irrelevant to the question whether it deals with a matter  of public concern.'"" Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S. 443, 453,  (2011) (quoting Rankin v. McPherson, 483 U.S. 378, 387  (1987)); accord United States v. Cook, 472 F. Supp. 3d 326, 335 (N.D.  Miss. 2020). The Individual Defendants claim to have viewed  Plaintiff's Facebook post as ""merely a private concern reflecting  personal interest, aired publicly,"" [ECF No. 31] at 4, which  conveyed ""no information beyond the Plaintiff's displeasure with his  pay and the lack of appreciation shown to him ... ."" Id. at 6; see  also [ECF No. 34] at 10. The gist of their defense is that Plaintiff's post reflects a personal employer-employee  dispute and is not a matter [*11]  of public concern that merits  First Amendment protection. Salge v. Edna Indep. Sch. Dist.,  411 F.3d 178, 187 (5th Cir. 2005). 11 Plaintiff claims that his Facebook post ""expressed his  belief that the employees of Jefferson County were  being 'under paid & unappreciated'"" and that ""Jefferson  County was treating its employees poorly."" [ECF No. 1]  ¶¶ 50-51. Plaintiff argues that he was voicing a  ""collective grievance"" about budget and education  policy, dishonesty, mismanagement of funds, improper  Board policies, and underpayment of teachers - all  topics of protected speech under Supreme Court and  Fifth Circuit precedent. [ECF No. 33] at 12-14; see, e.g.,  Pickering v. Bd.of Ed. of Tp. High Sch. Dist. 205, Will  Cnty., Illinois, 391 U.S. 563, 571-73 (1968). The true  nature of Plaintiff's speech no doubt lies somewhere in  between the parties' diametrically opposed positions. Our controlling precedent contains many examples of  ""mixed speech"" cases in which ""[a]n employee's speech  may contain an element of personal interest and yet still  qualify as speech on a matter of public concern."" Harris  v. Victoria Ind. Sch.Dist., 168 F.3d 216, 222 (5th Cir.  1999). In mixed speech cases, ""Whether an employee's  speech addresses a matter of public concern must be  determined by the content, form, and context of a given  statement, as revealed by the whole record."" Connick v.  Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 147-48 (1983); Teague v. City  ofFlower Mound, Tex., 179 F.3d 377, 382 (5th Cir.  1999) (""In cases [*12]  involving mixed speech, we are  bound to consider the Connick 12 factors of content, context, and form, and determine  whether the speech is public or private based on these  factors.""). Under Fifth Circuit precedent, none of these  three factors is dispositive, Bell v. Itawamba Cty. Sch.  Bd., 799 F.3d 379, 407 (5th Cir. 2015), but context and  form are to be weighed more heavily than content.  Gibson v. Kilpatrick, 838 F.3d 476, 487 (5th Cir. 2016)  (""Within this balancing, we weigh context and form  'more heavily.'""); Teague, 179 F.3d at 383. i. Content. Applying these principles to Plaintiff's Facebook post,  the Court finds itself at a disadvantage when it comes to  construing the content of Plaintiff's speech. This is so  because the writing is unclear, as Plaintiff admits in part.  [ECF No. 33] at 13. What is clear from the post is that  Page 6 of 9 Plaintiff wishes to speak for a group of people (e.g., ""I'm  going to say what's on alot of people I know minds"") and  not just for himself. His post makes no reference to his  personal employment dispute with the Jefferson County  School District. Fifth Circuit precedent instructs that '""if  releasing the speech to the public would inform the  populace of more than the fact of an employee's  employment grievance, the content of the speech may  be public in nature.""' Salge, 411 F.3d at 187 (5th Cir.  2005) (quoting Kennedy v. Tangipahoa Par. Library Bd.  of Control, 224 F.3d 359, 13 372 (5th Cir.2000), abrogated [*13]  on other grounds  as explained inCuvillier v. Taylor, 503 F.3d 397, 401 n.4  (5th Cir. 2007). While Plaintiff's Facebook post - as written - might not  appear particularly informative to the populace, it does  seem to have sparked informative comments on topics  of public concern from some members of the  community. In his Schultea reply, Plaintiff alleges that  ""[t]en members of the local community - members of the  public - reacted to the post to express their interest in it  and their support of Gaines' views."" [ECF No. 26] ¶ 22.  One of these community members, who was not  employed by the Jefferson County School District,  shared Plaintiff's post ""as part of her allegations that  JCPS was poorly allocating public ESSER [Elementary  and Secondary School Emergency Relief] funds  provided in Biden's American Rescue Plan, including  the specific allegation that JCPS administrators paid  themselves bonuses from funds earmarked to combat  the COVID-19 pandemic, and that they should have  spent more on air purifiers for the classrooms and  bonuses for the teachers."" Id. ¶¶ 30, 35. Relying on two United States Supreme Court cases and  a Fifth Circuit decision, 3 Plaintiff argues that ""what  matters is 3 Heffernan v. City of Paterson, N.J., 578 U.S. 266, 270  (2016); Waters v. Churchill, 511 U.S. 661, 677-78  (1994); Salge, 411 F.3d at 185. 14 not what Plaintiff said, but how he was understood by  his [*14]  audience … ."" [ECF No. 33] at 10 (emphasis  added and in the original). The Court finds this  interpretation of our precedent to be overly broad. As  explained by the Fifth Circuit in Salge, the Churchill  decision held that ""when a plaintiff-employee's First  Amendment retaliation claim rests on a disputed version  of his speech, a court applying the Supreme Court's  Connick v.Myers test to determine whether the speech  was on a matter of public concern must examine the  speech as the defendant-employer reasonably believed  it to be."" Salge, 411 F.3d at 185. Likewise, in Heffernan,  the Supreme Court considered the consequences of an  employer's mistaken belief that an employee had  engaged in protected speech and concluded that the  government employer's reason for demoting the plaintiff  is what counted. Heffernan, 578 U.S. at 272-73. The  Court does not find these cases to be helpful to  Plaintiff's position. If the Court were to determine  whether Plaintiff's speech was a matter of public  concern by examining it as the defendant-employer  reasonably believed it to be, then the Court would most  likely find Plaintiff's speech to reflect a personal  employer-employee dispute, which, under our caselaw,  would not be deemed a matter of public concern  protected by the First Amendment. In any event,  the [*15]  Court finds the cited cases to be factually  distinguishable from Plaintiff's case and none holds that  a non- 15 employer's response to, or interpretation of, an  employee's ambiguous speech determines the public  nature of such speech for the purposes of the Connick  test. No party has cited such a case to the Court in its  briefing, and the Court's research has not uncovered  such precedent. The Court views the evaluation of the  content of Plaintiff's ambiguous speech under Connick  to be an open question that remains subject to debate. ii. Form. The second factor - the form of Plaintiff's speech - is  less problematic and weighs in favor of a finding that  Plaintiff spoke on a matter of public concern, as the  Individual Defendants concede in their briefs. [ECF No.  29] at 6; [ECF No. 31] at 6. Plaintiff asserts that his post  was made to the public and was available to anyone  with an internet connection. [ECF No. 26] ¶¶ 8, 10. The  Fifth Circuit has found that a Facebook page was a form  of speech accessible by the community, served as a  community bulletin board, and weighed in favor of  finding that the plaintiff spoke on a matter of public  concern. Graziosi v. City of Greenville Miss., 775 F.3d  731, 739 (5th Cir. 2015). While the form of speech is not  a dispositive [*16]  factor in the Court's analysis, it is  weighed more heavily than the content of the speech.  E.g., Gibson, 838 F.3d at 487. Page 7 of 9 16 iii. Context. The final factor, which is the context of Plaintiff's  speech, likely weighs at least narrowly in favor of a  finding that Plaintiff spoke on a matter of public concern.  The Individual Defendants are of a different view and  argue that Plaintiff has failed to allege any widespread  public debate regarding District employee pay or the  District's hiring decisions. [ECF No. 31] at 7. In  opposition, Plaintiff presented in his Schultea reply new  factual allegations regarding the persons in the  community who responded to or shared Plaintiff's post  with others. [ECF No. 26] ¶¶ 22-26, 30-35. Plaintiff also  cites three specific news articles regarding ESSER  funding and American Rescue Plan spending. Id. ¶¶ 38- 40. ""'[S]peech made against the backdrop of ongoing  commentary and debate in the press involves the public  concern.'"" Wetherbe v.Texas Tech Univ. Sys., 699 F.  App'x 297, 301 (5th Cir. 2017), quoting Kennedy, 224  F.3d at 373 (5th Cir. 2000). The  Individual  Defendants  take  issue  with  the  publication dates of the cited articles because two  postdate Plaintiff's Facebook post and one predates the  post by five months. [ECF No. 31] at 8. The Individual  Defendants further criticize the content of [*17]  the  earliest written article because it relays 17 general information that they claim does not create ""a  backdrop of ongoing debate."" Recognizing that both sides have made perceptive  points, the Court believes that Plaintiff has alleged  enough supporting facts at this early stage of the  litigation to tip the balance in his favor on the issue of  context. Considering that the factors of form and context  seem to favor Plaintiff, and provided that those two  factors are afforded the greatest weight in the legal  analysis, e.g., Gibson, 838 F.3d at 487, then there is an  argument, subject to the Court's reservations explained  above, that Plaintiff's factual allegations are sufficient to  satisfy the second element of a First Amendment  retaliation claim. 3. Balancing. The Individual Defendants argue that, even if Plaintiff  satisfies the first two elements of a First Amendment  retaliation claim, he fails to satisfy the Pickering  balancing test in the third element. [ECF No. 13] at 13- 14; seePickering, 391 U.S. at 568. In Pickering, the  United States Supreme Court described a need to strike  ""a balance between the interests of the teacher, as a  citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern  and the interest of the State, as an employer, in  promoting the efficiency of the public services it [*18]   performs through its employees."" Id.; see also Connick,  461 18 U.S. at 138. The Individual Defendants urge the Court to  find that the District's interest in promoting efficiency  outweighs Plaintiff's interest in commenting on matters  of public concern. The Court, however, must decline to  do so. The Fifth Circuit has held that the balancing  analysis, while appropriate on summary judgment, is not  appropriate at this stage of the litigation. Cox v. Kaelin,  577 F. App'x 306, 313 (5th Cir. 2014), relying on  Kennedy, 224 F.3d at 366 n. 9. The balancing element  must remain unresolved for now. 4. Causation. The parties present antithetical positions regarding the  final element of the First Amendment retaliation claim --  whether Plaintiff's speech was a substantial or  motivating factor in the adverse employment action. As  evidence that he was fired because of his Facebook  post, Plaintiff emphasizes the timing of his firing, which  was within days of his posting of the Facebook  comment. [ECF No. 33] at 3. Plaintiff further alleges that  Hammitte told him that he was fired for, among other  things, his Facebook post. [ECF No. 1] ¶¶ 60-68.  Finally, Plaintiff points to the District's Position  Statement in the EEOC proceedings in which the  District stated: ""Mr. Gaines went on social talking  negatively about the [*19]  school district, which caused  a distraction and disruption to the district's learning 19 environment."" [ECF No. 19-4]. Viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, these factual allegations are  sufficient to satisfy the First Amendment retaliation causation  element on a Rule 12(c) motion to dismiss. 4 B. Objectively Reasonable Conduct Returning to the second prong of the qualified immunity Page 8 of 9 test, the Court must decide whether the Individual  Defendants' conduct was objectively reasonable in light of clearly established law at the time that Plaintiff's employment  was terminated. Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201. A constitutional  right 4The Individual Defendants further argue under the  Mount Healthy decision that Plaintiff would have been  fired whether or not his Facebook post was protected  speech.

The Court [*21]  finds that there is an absence of case  law which addresses Plaintiff's theory of protected public  speech. As the Court appreciates it, Plaintiff's theory is  that his own words - no matter how vague - do not  determine whether his speech is a matter of public  concern protected by the First Amendment; rather, it is  how non-employer ""audience"" members understood his  speech that determines First Amendment protection.

The  Individual Defendants could not have been expected to  conclude  that  Plaintiff's  Facebook  post  was  constitutionally protected public speech. The Court finds  that the Individual Defendants' conduct was objectively  reasonable given clearly established law at the relevant  time and that the Individual Defendants are entitled to  qualified immunity with respect to the Count III First  Amendment retaliation claims against them in their  individual capacities.

"Greene v. State, 2023 Ind. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1393.pdf","[*1] Appeal from the Vigo Superior Court The Honorable Matthew A. Sheehan, Judge Trial Court Cause Nos. 84D05-1803-F5-890 84D05- 2112-F5-4228 Memorandum Decision by Judge Kenworthy Judges Bailey and Tavitas concur. Kenworthy, Judge. Case Summary [1] Michael P. Greene appeals his six-year aggregate  sentence, raising one issue for our review: Does his  sentence warrant revision under Indiana Appellate Rule  7(B)?  Concluding  Greene's  sentence  is  not  inappropriate in light of the nature of his offense and his  character, we affirm. Facts and Procedural History [2] In 2007, Greene was convicted of Class C felony  child molesting. Based on this conviction, Greene was  required to register as a sex offender. In 2018, Greene  was convicted of Level 5 felony failure to register as a  sex offender and placed on probation. A couple of years  later, the State petitioned to revoke Greene's probation  and charged Greene in this case with two counts of  failure to register as a sex offender-one as a Level 5  felony and one as a Level 6 felony. The State also  alleged Greene was a habitual offender. In late  February 2023, Greene and the State entered into a  plea agreement. Under the terms of the agreement,  Greene pleaded guilty to Level 5 felony failure [*2]  to  register as a sex offender, 1 admitted he was a habitual  offender, 2 admitted to a probation violation, and agreed  to a six-year cap on his sentence. The trial court  accepted the plea agreement, dismissed Greene's Level  6 felony charge, and terminated his probation as  unsatisfactorily completed. 1 Ind. Code § 11-8-8-17(b) (2020). 2 I.C. § 35-50-2-8(i)(2) (2017). [3] Prior to sentencing, Greene was evaluated by a  licensed clinical social worker. The social worker  reported Greene suffered from childhood trauma  because he ""saw his mother shot and killed when he  was like three (3) years old."" Tr. Vol. 2 at 43. Further,  Greene  was  diagnosed  with  schizophrenia,  ""schizoaffective disorder,"" PTSD, and ADHD. Id. at 44.  Greene also has a history of abusing illegal substances  like  methamphetamine,  marijuana,  mushrooms,  oxycontin, and LSD. Due to his condition, Greene was  treated at the Hamilton Center and Options Behavioral  Health Center on several occasions. Overall, Greene  failed to adhere to recommendations and did not  engage in treatment. [4] The trial court sentenced Greene to an aggregate  sentence of six years executed in the Department of  Correction-three years for Level 5 felony failure to  Page 2 of 3 register as a sex offender with a three-year [*3]  habitual  offender enhancement. When sentencing Greene, the  trial court acknowledged Greene's ""significant mental  health issues"" as a ""significant mitigating factor."" Id. at  58. Yet the trial court determined Greene's criminal  history-including five prior felony convictions for failure  to register as a sex offender-and several probation  violations warranted the imposed sentence. Greene's Sentence Does Not Warrant 7(B) Revision [5] Greene asks us to review and revise his sentence.  The Indiana Constitution authorizes this Court to review  and revise a trial court's sentencing decision as  provided by rule. Ind. Const. art. 7, § 6. Indiana  Appellate Rule 7(B) provides we may revise a sentence  authorized by statute if, ""after due consideration of the trial court's decision, the Court finds that the  sentence is inappropriate in light of the nature of the offense and the character of the  offender."" The principal role of appellate review is to  leaven the outliers, not to achieve a perceived correct  sentence in each case. Conley v. State, 183 N.E.3d  276, 288 (Ind. 2022). Thus, ""we reserve our 7(B)  authority for exceptional cases."" Faith v. State, 131 N.E.3d 158, 160 (Ind. 2019) (per curiam).  [6] ""[S]entencing is principally a discretionary function in  which the trial court's judgment should receive  considerable deference."" Cardwell v. State, 895 N.E.2d  1219, 1222 (Ind. 2008). ""Such [*4]  deference should  prevail unless overcome by compelling evidence  portraying in a positive light the nature of the offense  (such as accompanied by restraint, regard, and lack of  brutality) and the defendant's character (such as  substantial virtuous traits or persistent examples of good  character)."" Stephenson v. State, 29 N.E.3d 111, 122  (Ind. 2015). The question ""is not whether another  sentence is more appropriate; rather, the question is  whether the sentence imposed is inappropriate."" Helsley  v. State, 43 N.E.3d 225, 228 (Ind. 2015) (quoting King v.  State, 894 N.E.2d 265, 268 (Ind. Ct. App. 2008))  (emphasis omitted). Whether we regard a sentence as  inappropriate ""turns on our sense of the culpability of the  defendant, the severity of the crime, the damage done  to others, and myriad other factors that come to light in  a given case."" Cardwell, 895 N.E.2d at 1224. [7] The defendant bears the burden of persuading us a  revised sentence is warranted. Harris v. State, 165  N.E.3d 91, 99 (Ind. 2021). And because our legislature  has selected the advisory sentence as the ""starting  point"" for ""an appropriate sentence for the crime  committed,"" the defendant bears a ""particularly heavy burden"" when the trial court imposes  the advisory sentence. Fernbach v. State, 954 N.E.2d 1080, 1089 (Ind. Ct. App.  2011), trans. denied. [8] Here, the trial court sentenced Greene to three years  for Level 5 felony failure to register as a sex offender,  enhanced by three years for being a habitual  offender. [*5]  See I.C. § 35-50-2-6(b) (2014) (providing  for a sentence of one to six years for a Level 5 felony,  with a three-year advisory sentence); see also I.C. § 35- 50-2-8(i)(2) (2017) (providing for an additional sentence  of two to six years for a habitual offender convicted of a  Level 5 felony). Thus, Greene received the advisory  term for his Level 5 felony offense. And Greene's  habitual offender enhancement was toward the bottom  of the applicable range. Therefore, Greene bears a  ""particularly heavy burden"" to show his sentence  warrants 7(B) revision. See Fernbach, 954 N.E.2d at  1089. [9] Beginning with the nature of Greene's offense, we  note this is Greene's sixth conviction for failing to  register as a sex offender. See Appellant's App. Vol. 2  at 49-52. Thus, Greene has demonstrated a continuous  disregard for his legal obligation to register. As such, the  nature of Greene's offense weighs against revision. 3 3 Greene argues he was homeless at the time of his  conduct underlying this offense, and thus unable to  register a home address. See Appellant's Br. at 13. But  the record reveals otherwise. See Appellant's App. Vol.  2 at 38-39 (indicating the charges underlying this case  were based upon Greene failing to register his change  of address while living on Maple [*6]  Avenue in Terre  Haute, Indiana for a period of about three weeks).  Nonetheless, Indiana Code Section 11-8-8-12 requires  a sex offender who resides in a temporary residence or  who does not have a principal or temporary residence to  register or report with the local law enforcement  authority. [10] As to Greene's character, his criminal history is  significant. See Smoots v. State, 172 N.E.3d 1279, 1290  (Ind. Ct. App. 2021) (explaining a defendant's criminal  history is one relevant factor in analyzing character). In  addition to his previous five felony convictions for failure  to register as a sex offender, Greene has convictions for  Class C child molesting, misdemeanor reckless driving,  Page 3 of 3 and misdemeanor disorderly conduct. And Greene has  violated the terms of his probation on at least six  separate occasions. Although Greene's guilty plea  saved the State the expense of trial, it also benefited  Greene in the form of a dismissal of his Level 6 felony  failure to register charge and a sentence capped at six  years. And to the extent Greene contends his mental  health issues favor revision, the trial court considered  his struggles a ""significant mitigating factor."" Tr. Vol. 2 at  58. But the trial court determined the aggravating factors  outweighed the mitigating factors and warranted [*7]   the imposed sentence. As the trial court explained:  ""Greene's continuous inability to follow the law and to  follow the requirements of probation, give this court no  assurance or faith that Mr. Greene can be successful in  any sentence that would not be executed fully in the  Department of Corrections."" Id. at 58-59. Put simply,  Greene's repeated inability to abide by the laws and  rules placed upon him reflect poorly on his character  and weigh against 7(B) revision. Conclusion [11] Greene's six-year aggregate sentence is not  inappropriate in light of the nature of his offense and his  character. His sentence therefore does not warrant 7(B)  revision. Accordingly, we affirm. [12] Affirmed. Bailey, J., and Tavitas, J., concur."

"In re A.F., 2023-Ohio-4423.pdf","[*1] JUDGMENT: AFFIRMED RELEASED AND JOURNALIZED: December 7, 2023 Civil Appeal from the Cuyahoga County Court of  Common Pleas Juvenile Division Case  Nos.  AD20905510,  AD20905511,  and  AD20905512 Appearances: David S. Bartos, for appellant. Michael C. O'Malley, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and Zachary J. LaFleur, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee CCDCFS. EILEEN T. GALLAGHER, J.:  Appellant, A.A. (""Mother""), appeals a juvenile court  judgment granting permanent custody of her children, A.F., A.M., and R.F.  (collectively ""the children"") to the Cuyahoga County Division of Children and Family  Services (""CCDCFS"" or ""the agency""). She claims the following errors: 1. The court erred in holding CCDFS used ""reasonable  efforts"" when granting permanent custody to CCDCFS. 2. It is against the manifest weight of the evidence that  the trial court held it was in the best interest of the  children to be placed in the permanent custody of  CCDCFS. 3. The court erred in allowing the foster parent to  provide testimony without being under oath or cross- examined. 4. The trial court abused its discretion by failing to  consider the children as separate children when  determining the best interest.  For the reasons [*2]  that follow, we affirm. I. Facts and Procedural History  In June 2020, CCDCFS filed a complaint alleging the  children were abused and neglected and requesting an  order granting temporary custody of the children to  CCDCFS. CCDCFS simultaneously filed a motion for  emergency predispositional custody of the children, and  the emergency motion was granted that same day. In  October 2020, the court adjudicated the children abused  and neglected and placed them in the temporary  custody of CCDCFS. In its judgment entries dated  Page 2 of 11 October 8, 2020, filed in each child's case, the juvenile  court found that the agency had made reasonable  efforts to prevent removal of the children. By entries  journalized October 20, 2021, the juvenile court again  found that the agency made reasonable efforts to  finalize the permanency plan of reunification. In  November 2021, the agency filed a motion to modify  temporary custody of the children to permanent custody.  Mother also filed a motion for legal custody of the  children.  The court held a permanent custody hearing in May  2023. Becky Sawyers (""Sawyers""), an extended case  worker with CCDCFS, testified that at the time of trial,  A.F. was nine years old; A.M. was eight [*3]  years old;  and R.F was seven years old. Mother has a fourth child,  who was five-years old at the time of trial and lives with  her in Michigan. That child is not a party to this case.  The three older children had been in agency custody  since June 2020, a period of almost three years at the  time of trial. However, A.F. had also previously been in  the custody of Michigan Child Protective Services  (""CPS"") from the time she was four and one-half months  old until she was two and one-half years old as a result  of domestic violence between Mother and the children's  father (""Father""). Sometime after A.F. was returned to  Mother and the two younger children were born, Father  took the children without permission or court order and  moved with them to Ohio. Mother contacted the local  police and CPS to report the alleged kidnapping, but  there was nothing they could do because the alleged  kidnapper was the children's father and her complaint  involved a civil dispute.  Mother did not know Father's Ohio address and,  therefore, was unable to reunite with the children until  CCDCFS removed the children from Father's custody  approximately two years later.1 CCDCFS contacted  Mother and informed her that the [*4]  agency had her  children in custody. The agency developed a case plan  for Mother with the goal of reunifying her with the  children. The case plan included 1 Since 2021, the children's father has not engaged in  any services, has not visited the children, and his  whereabouts were unknown. (Tr. 13.) He is not a party  to this appeal. parenting services, and Mother completed a series of  nine supervised visits with a parenting coach through  Michigan Health and Human Services. At that time, the  children were in the custody of their maternal  grandmother and step-grandfather, who lived near  Mother in Michigan. On her own initiative, Mother also  engaged in mental-health services through Team  Wellness in Michigan in anticipation of the need for  family counseling when the children were returned to  her. (Tr. 15, 199.) Mother completed parenting services  in Michigan in November 2021 and received positive  reports from her parenting class provider. (Tr. 40.)  Since CCDCFS obtained emergency custody of the  children in June 2020, A.F. has been placed in seven  foster care homes. The children were together in a  foster home in Ohio before being placed with their  maternal  grandmother.  The  children  were  subsequently [*5]  removed from their grandmother's  home because A.F. alleged that her step-grandfather  physically abused her. (Tr. 72.) Although the children  were initially placed together in foster homes, A.F. was  removed because she exhibited sexualized behaviors  toward her younger siblings. She also displayed  parentified behaviors, meaning she assumed the role of  caregiver to her younger siblings by caring for and  disciplining them. (Tr. 92, 95.) A.F. alleged that Father  and others sexually abused her. And because she  exhibited sexualized and parentified behaviors, A.F. was  engaged in psychotherapy with several therapists and  has been on medication during the years she has been  in agency custody.  Mother consistently visited the children in Ohio even  though she continued to reside in Michigan. Although  Mother has never had a valid driver's license, she drove herself to visits in Sandusky, Ohio  until she was charged with driving without a license. (Tr.  195-196.) Thereafter, Sandra Tedford (""Tedford""), who  fostered A.F. when she was a baby drove Mother to her  visits. In late 2022, Mother began overnight visits with  the children in her Michigan home. There were three  weekend visits in November 2022, and [*6]  one week- long visit from December 27, 2022, to January 2, 2023.  (Tr. 28.)  Following the week-long visit, A.F. reported that  Mother's boyfriend, later identified as Chris Davis  (""Davis""), sexually assaulted her while she was sleeping  in Mother's home. Shannon Hanrahan (""Hanrahan""), a  sex-abuse intake worker with CCDCFS, investigated the  allegation and determined it was ""indicated,"" meaning  the agency had cause to believe that the abuse likely  occurred.  (Tr.  126-127.)  Hanrahan  conducted  a  videorecorded forensic interview of A.F., which was  admitted into evidence. During the interview, A.F.  provided a detailed description of Davis's conduct.  Page 3 of 11 When  Hanrahan  questioned  Mother  about  the  allegation, Mother denied it could be true, claiming  ""Chris was never in the home during the children's visit.""  (Tr. 129.)  Mother indicated that Davis was a neighbor who only  comes to her house to do his laundry. (Tr. 129.)  However, Hanrahan interviewed each of the children  separately, and each of the children independently  confirmed that Davis slept over in Mother's house while  they were there. (Tr. 129.) They also separately and  independently told her that they knew Davis because he  was often in Mother's [*7]  home. (Tr. 130.) Indeed, they  separately and independently identified him in a photograph and indicated that he was Mother's  ""boyfriend."" (Tr. 130.) A.F. also states in the recorded  interview that Davis was at Mother's home ""all the time."" (Exhibit No. 4.)  Hanrahan also questioned Davis regarding the sex- abuse allegation. Davis denied ever being in Mother's home and denied  ever being around the children. However, Hanrahan  reported the allegation to local police and provided the  police with a copy of the recorded interview. As a result  of this information, a warrant was issued for Davis's  arrest.  Hanrahan confronted Mother about the inconsistencies  between her claim that Davis was just a neighbor who  occasionally does laundry at her house, the children's  claim that Davis sleeps over at her house, and Davis's  claim that he never goes to Mother's house and that he  has never been around her children. According to  Hanrahan, Mother ""still maintained [Davis] was not  there"" and did not provide any explanation for the  differing claims. (Tr. 135.) As a result, Hanrahan did not  think Mother took the sex-abuse allegation seriously,  particularly because she would not allow authorities to  interview [*8]  her youngest daughter as part of the  investigation. (Tr. 136.)  Tedford testified on behalf of Mother and stated that  she babysat the children during the week-long visit while  Mother was at work. (Tr. 156.) She also indicated she  did not know whether Davis was present in Mother's  home while the children were there. (Tr. 180-181.)  Tedford lives 20 miles from Mother's home. (Tr. 175.)  Tiffaney Mahoney (""Mahoney""), an extended-case  supervisor with CCDCFS, testified that the sexual-abuse  allegation against Davis was a serious concern.  However, she also stated that the agency would have  requested permanent custody even if the allegation had  never been made because it had other concerns  regarding Mother's parenting. (Tr. 91, 111.) According to  Mahoney, there was no significant bond between  Mother and the children. The lack of bond and  attachment was due in part to the fact that Father  absconded with the children and Mother had no contact  with them for two years. But the lack of meaningful  attachment was also due to Mother's inability to meet  the children's ongoing behavioral- and mental-health  needs. (Tr. 87-88.) Mahoney explained that every time  the children returned from extended, unsupervised [*9]   visits with Mother, they regressed in their behaviors. (Tr.  88.) Mother also failed to properly ensure the children  take their prescribed medications. (Tr. 92.)  The agency was also concerned about Mother's  decision-making. The agency instructed Mother to have  A.F. sleep in a separate bedroom away from her  siblings because she exhibited sexualized behaviors  toward them. Yet Mother allowed A.F. to sleep in the  same bedroom with her younger sister A.M. A.F. also  reported to the agency that she cooked for her younger  siblings when they were at Mother's home and that Mother left them home alone.  (Tr. 33.) The children reported that their step- grandfather had been present in the home with them  even though he was not permitted to be there due to  prior physical-abuse allegations against him. When the agency confronted Mother about  him being present with the children, she claimed she did not know he was not  allowed to be there. (Tr. 35-36.)  Mahoney  further  stated  that  despite  having  unsupervised visits and parent coaching, Mother had not learned to manage the  children on her own. (Tr. 100.) Mahoney explained: [Mother]'s been made aware of her children's behavioral  needs, she's aware that they have [*10]  prescribed  medication, she's aware of the sexualized behaviors  that [A.F.] has demonstrated towards her siblings, we  have suggested to prevent further issues when they're  having overnight weekend visits and extended visits that  Page 4 of 11 mom implement a plan, and creating a plan for example  meant not allowing [A.F.] to sleep with her siblings on  their own. You know, a plan would be in place, and so [A.F.] was  to sleep in her mother's room. Mother did not follow that plan. Again, with the children  acting out, mom failed to be able to demonstrate being  able to meet their behavioral needs on their own  regularly and consistently, again relying on [A.F.] to do  so or having to reach out to the foster parents for  assistance in how to meet her children's needs. (Tr. 115.) Mahoney was also concerned that Mother  minimized the seriousness of the children's behavioral needs. Thus, despite the fact  that Mother has an appropriate home and has demonstrated the ability to  provide basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter, the agency believed  permanent custody was in the children's best interests.  The guardian ad litem (""GAL"") also recommended that  the court grant permanent custody of the children to CCDCFS  due [*11]  to Mother's inability to adequately parent them. (Tr. 241, GAL report and  recommendation at 3.) The GAL shared the agency's concern that ""Mother has shown  both poor judgment and parental decision making.""  (GAL report and recommendation at 4.)  Based on the evidence presented, the juvenile court  denied Mother's motion for legal custody and granted  permanent custody of the children to CCDCFS. Mother now appeals the juvenile court's judgment. II. Law and Analysis  In the first assignment of error, Mother argues the  juvenile court abused its discretion when it found that  CCDCFS used ""reasonable efforts"" to reunite Mother  with her children before it granted permanent custody of  the children to the agency. She contends the agency  should have done more, including either placing the  children in a foster home closer to Mother's Michigan  home or paying her travel expenses for visiting the  children in Ohio.

The juvenile court found that the agency made  reasonable efforts to prevent the continued removal of the children from  Mother's home and to make it possible for them to safely return to Mother's home in its  judgment entry granting the agency temporary custody of the children in October  2020, and again in its October 20 2021 judgment entry, when it found that the  agency made reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan of reunification.  The juvenile court was, therefore, not required to make a reasonable-efforts  determination at the permanent-custody hearing.  Although not required to do so, the juvenile court again  found that the agency had made reasonable efforts to return the  children to Mother's custody in the judgment entry granting the agency permanent  custody of the children. Pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(E)(1), the court found: Following the placement of the child outside the child's  home and notwithstanding reasonable case planning  and diligent efforts by the agency to assist the parents  to remedy the problems that initially caused the child to  be placed outside the home, the parent has failed  continuously and repeatedly [*14]  to substantially  remedy the conditions causing the children to be placed  outside the child's home. (June 5, 2023 journal entry granting permanent custody  at 2.) Still, Mother asserts the record does not support the court's reasonable- efforts findings because the record shows that CCDCFS obstructed rather than  assisted Mother's efforts at reunification.  R.C. 2151.419(A) does not specify the evidentiary  standard of proof required for a public children's  services agency to satisfy the reasonable-efforts  requirement. However, the standard of proof applied to  judgments awarding permanent custody is that of clear  and convincing evidence. R.C. 2151.414(B)(1). And this  court has previously applied the clear and convincing  evidence standard of proof to the juvenile court's  reasonable-efforts determination. See, e.g., In re L.G.,  8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 110789, 2022-Ohio-529, at ¶  55. We, therefore, apply the clear-and-convincing- evidence standard of proof to this issue.  ""'Clear and convincing evidence' is evidence that 'will  produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or  conviction as  to  the allegations sought to be  established.'"" In re T.B., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99931,  2014-Ohio-2051, ¶ 28, quoting Cross v. Ledford, 161  Ohio St. 469, 477, 120 N.E.2d 118 (1954). The clear- and-convincing-evidence standard is an intermediate  standard, ""being more than a mere preponderance, but  not to the extent of such [*15]  certainty as is required  beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal cases. It does  not mean clear and unequivocal."" (Emphasis deleted.)  Cross at 477.  ""'Reasonable efforts means that a children's services  agency must act diligently and provide services  appropriate to the family's need to prevent the child's  removal or as a predicate to reunification.'"" In re H.M.K.,  3d Dist. Wyandot Nos. 16-12-15 and 16-12-16, 2013- Ohio-4317, ¶ 95, quoting In re D.A., 6th Dist. Lucas No.  L-11-1197, 2012-Ohio-1104, ¶ 30. ""In other words, the  agency must use reasonable efforts to help remove the  obstacles preventing family reunification."" In re L.G. at ¶ 60, citing In re C.B.C., 4th Dist. Lawrence Nos.  15CA18 and 15CA19, 2016-Ohio- 916, ¶ 76, citing Bean, Reasonable Efforts: What State  Courts Think, 36 U.Tol.L.Rev. 321, 366 (2005). When  considering  whether  the  agency  made  reasonable efforts to prevent the continued removal, the  issue is not whether the agency could have done more,  but whether it did enough to satisfy the reasonableness  standard under the statute. In re Davidson-Rush, 5th  Dist. Stark No. 2006 CA 00121, 2006-Ohio-4873, ¶ 50.  ""'Reasonable efforts' does not mean all available  efforts."" In re Lewis, 4th Dist. Athens No. 03CA12, 2003- Page 6 of 11 Ohio-5262, ¶ 16. ""In determining whether reasonable  efforts were made, the child's health and safety shall be  paramount."" R.C. 2151.419(A)(1). In re J.B., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 109039, 2020-Ohio- 3675, ¶ 21.  Mother's poor judgment and parenting skills were the  primary obstacles preventing Mother's reunification with the  children. The agency provided Mother with [*16]  a case plan that included parenting.  Pursuant to the plan and the agency's referral, Mother completed a series of  supervised visits with a parenting coach. The agency also allowed Mother to have  extended, unsupervised visits with the children to develop her skills. Despite the completion  of services and visiting opportunities, the concerns regarding Mother's decision  making persisted. The agency specifically required that Mother keep A.F. in a  separate bedroom from her siblings because A.F. tended to exhibit sexualized  behaviors toward them. Mother ignored this concern and placed A.F. and her sister in  the same room. Mother was aware that the children have behavioral issues and that  they require prescription medications, yet she failed to properly address the  behaviors and failed to administer the medications.  Mother was also told not to allow the children's step- grandfather into the house when the children are there  because A.F. had previously accused him of physically  abusing  her.  Although  the  accusation  was  unsubstantiated, Mother disregarded the instruction and  allowed the step-grandfather into the home with the  children. Moreover, all three children separately and  independently reported [*17]  that Davis slept in Mother's home while they were there, and  A.F. reported that he sexually assaulted her.  Mother nevertheless argues the agency failed to do  enough to help her reunite with her children because  they failed to place the children in a foster home closer  to her Michigan residence. However, the agency placed  the children with their maternal grandmother in  Michigan, but they had to be removed when A.F alleged  that her step-grandfather physically abused her. Thus,  the record clearly and convincingly shows the agency  made great efforts to reunite the children with Mother,  but Mother failed to do her part to remedy the obstacles  to reunification.  The first assignment of error is overruled. A. Best Interest of the Child  In the second assignment of error, Mother asserts that  the juvenile court's finding that permanent custody was  in the children's best interests is against the manifest  weight of the evidence.  R.C. 2151.414 provides a two-prong analysis to be  applied by a juvenile court in adjudicating a motion for  permanent custody. In re S.C., 2018-Ohio-2523, 115  N.E.3d 813, ¶ 20 (8th Dist.), citing R.C. 2151.414(B).  The first prong authorizes the juvenile court to grant permanent custody of a child  to the public agency if, after a hearing, the court  determines, by [*18]  clear and convincing evidence,  that any of the following factors apply: (a) the child is not  abandoned or orphaned, but the child cannot be placed  with either parent within a reasonable time or should not  be placed with the child's parents; (b) the child is  abandoned; (c) the child is orphaned, and there are no  relatives of the child who are able to take permanent  custody; (d) the child has been in the temporary custody  of one or more public children services agencies or  private child placing agencies for 12 or more months of  a consecutive 22-month period; or (e) the child or  another child in the custody of the parent or parents  from whose custody the child has been removed has  been adjudicated an abused, neglected, or dependent  child on three separate occasions by any court in this  state or another state. R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a)-(e).  Only one of the factors listed in R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a)- (e) must be established to satisfy the first prong of the  two-part analysis for granting permanent custody of a  child to an agency. In re D.H., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.  110505, 2021-Ohio-3821, ¶ 27, citing In re L.W., 8th  Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104881, 2017-Ohio-657. If any one  of the factors listed in R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a)-(e) is  established, the court may move to the second prong of  Page 7 of 11 the analysis, which requires the juvenile court to  determine, by clear and convincing evidence, whether it  is in [*19]  the best interest of the child to grant  permanent custody to the agency pursuant to R.C.  2151.414(D).  A juvenile court's decision to grant permanent custody  will not be reversed as being against the manifest  weight of the evidence ""'if the record contains some competent, credible evidence from which the  court could have found that the essential statutory  elements for permanent custody had been established  by clear and convincing evidence.'"" In re G.W., 8th Dist.  Cuyahoga No. 107512, 2019-Ohio-1533, ¶ 62, quoting  In re A.P., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104130, 2016-Ohio- 5849, ¶ 16.  With respect to the first prong of the permanent-custody  analysis, it is undisputed that, at the time of trial, the  children had been in the temporary custody of a public  children services agency or private child placing agency  for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-month  period. Indeed, the children had been in agency custody  for nearly three years. Therefore, the first prong of the  two-part analysis is satisfied and we now turn to the  second prong of the analysis, which requires us to  determine, by clear and convincing evidence, whether  granting permanent custody of the children was in the  children's best interests.  We recognize that, given the nature of the proceeding  and the impact the court's decision will have on the lives  of the parties concerned, [*20]  the juvenile court enjoys  broad discretion in determining whether an order of  permanent custody is in the child's best interest. In re  Awkal, 95 Ohio App.3d 309, 316, 642 N.E.2d 424 (8th  Dist.1994). We, therefore, review a juvenile court's  determination of a child's best interests under R.C.  2151.414(D) for an abuse of discretion. In re D.A., 8th  Dist. Cuyahoga No. 95188, 2010-Ohio-5618, ¶ 47.  An abuse of discretion occurs when a court exercises  its judgment in an unwarranted way regarding a matter  over which it has discretionary authority. Johnson v. Abdullah, 166 Ohio St.3d 427, 2021-Ohio- 3304, 187 N.E.3d 463, ¶ 35. A court also abuses its discretion ""when a legal rule  entrusts a decision to a judge's discretion and the  judge's exercise of that discretion is outside of the  legally permissible range of choices."" State v. Hackett,  164 Ohio St.3d 74, 2020-Ohio-6699, 172 N.E.3d 75, ¶  19.  This court has held that an abuse of discretion may be  found where a trial court ""applies the wrong legal  standard, misapplies the correct legal standard, or relies  on clearly erroneous findings of fact."" Thomas v.  Cleveland, 176 Ohio App.3d 401, 2008-Ohio-1720, 892  N.E.2d 454, ¶ 15 (8th Dist.). When applying the abuse- of-discretion standard, a reviewing court may not  substitute its judgment for that of the trial court.  Vannucci v. Schneider, 2018-Ohio-1294, 110 N.E.3d  716, ¶ 22 (8th Dist.).  In determining the best interest of a child, a juvenile  court may apply one of two different tests set forth in  R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) and (D)(2). In re S.C., 10th Dist.  Franklin No. 21AP-203, 2022-Ohio-356, ¶ 38, quoting In  re J.P., 10th Dist. Franklin No. 18AP-834, 2019-Ohio- 1619, ¶ 39. In determining the best interest of the child  under R.C. 2151.414(D)(1), the juvenile court must  consider  all  relevant  factors,  including  but  not  limited [*21]  to: (1) the interaction and interrelationship  of the child with the child's parents, siblings, relatives,  foster parents, and out-of-home providers, and any  other person who may significantly affect the child; (2)  the wishes of the child as expressed directly by the child  or through the child's guardian ad litem; (3) the custodial  history of the child; (4) the child's need for a legally  secure placement and whether that type of placement  can be achieved without a grant of permanent custody to the agency; and (5) whether any  factors in R.C. 2151.414(E)(7) through (11) are  applicable. Although a trial court is required to consider each of the R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) factors in making its permanent  custody determination, ""there is not one element that is  given greater weight than the others pursuant to the  statute."" In re Schaefer, 111 Ohio St.3d 498, 2006-Ohio- 5513, 857 N.E.2d 532, ¶ 56. Moreover, only one factor  needs to be resolved in favor of permanent custody in  order to find that permanent custody is in the child's best  interest. In re S.C., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102350,  2015-Ohio-2410, ¶ 30.  Alternatively, the court may apply the test set forth in  R.C. 2151.414(D)(2), which provides as follows: If all of the following apply, permanent custody is in the  best interest of the child, and the court shall commit the  child to the permanent custody of a public children  services agency or private [*22]  child placing agency: Page 8 of 11 (a) The court determines by clear and convincing  evidence that one or more of the factors in division (E)  of this section exist and the child cannot be placed with  one of the child's parents within a reasonable time or  should not be placed with either parent. (b) The child has been in an agency's custody for two  years or longer, and no longer qualifies for temporary  custody pursuant to division (D) of section 2151.415 of  the Revised Code. (c) The child does not meet the requirements for a  planned permanent living arrangement pursuant to  division (A)(5) of section 2151.353 of the Revised Code. (d) Prior to the dispositional hearing, no relative or other  interested person has filed, or has been identified in, a  motion for legal custody of the child. (Emphasis added.) If all the factors enumerated under  R.C. 2151.414(D)(2) are applicable, permanent custody  is per se in the child's best interest, and the juvenile  court must commit the child to the permanent custody of  the agency. In re G.A., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 108932,  2020-Ohio-2949, ¶ 61, citing In re J.R., 10th Dist.  Franklin No. 17AP-698, 2018-Ohio-1474, ¶ 41.  The juvenile court made alternative findings under both R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) and (D)(2). However, it is not  necessary to determine if the court correctly applied the  R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) factors if the findings under R.C.  2151.414(D)(2) are supported by clear and convincing  evidence because ""[a] finding under section (D)(2) of  R.C. 2151.414 mandates that the trial court find it is in a  child's best interest [*23]  to be placed in the agency's  permanent custody."" In re A.S., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos.  110422 and 110472, 2021-Ohio-3829, ¶ 42, citing In re  G.A.  at ¶ 59. We, therefore, focus our review on the court's  findings under   R.C. 2151.414(D)(2).   The juvenile court found that all the factors enumerated  in  R.C. 2151.414(D)(2) were applicable. The court found,  in relevant part: With respect to the best interest of the child, the Court  finds that pursuant to O.R.C. 2151.414(D)(2) that all of  the following apply: (a) The Court determines by clear and convincing  evidence that one or more of the factors in division (E)  of this section exist and the child cannot be placed with  one of the child's parents within a reasonable time or  should not be placed with either parent. (b) The child has been in the agency's custody for two  years or longer and no longer qualifies for temporary  custody pursuant to division (D) of section 2151.415 of  the Ohio Revised Code. (c) The child does not meet the requirements for a  planned permanent living arrangement pursuant to  division (A)(5) of Section 2151.353 of the Ohio Revised  Code. (d) Prior to the dispositional hearing, no relative or other  interested person has filed, or has been identified in a  motion for legal Custody.  In determining whether R.C. 2151.414(D)(2)(a) applies,  we must look to R.C. 215 1.414(E) because determining ""that a child  cannot be placed with the parents within a reasonable time or should not be  placed with them, the court must find, by clear [*24]  and convincing evidence, that at  least one of the factors in R.C. 2151.414(E)(1)-(16) is present."" In re G.A., 8th  Dist. Cuyahoga No. 108932, 2020-Ohio-2949, at ¶ 62, citing In re S.C., 8th Dist.  Cuyahoga No. 108036, 2019- Ohio-3664, citing In re S.W., 11th Dist. Ashtabula No.  2017-A-0089, 2018-Ohio- 1672.  The juvenile court found that the children cannot be  placed with either of their parents within a reasonable time or should not  be placed with either parent pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(E)(1), (4), (10), (14), and  (16). The court's judgment entry states, in relevant part: The Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that  the child cannot be placed with one of the child's  Page 9 of 11 parents within a reasonable time or should not be  placed with either parent, pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(E): (1) Following the placement of the child outside the  child's home and notwithstanding reasonable case  planning and diligent efforts by the agency to assist the  parents to remedy the problems that initially caused the  child to be placed outside the home, the parent has  failed continuously and repeatedly to substantially  remedy the conditions causing the child to be placed  outside the child's home. (4) The parent has demonstrated a lack of commitment  toward the child by failing to regularly support, visit, or  communicate [*25]  with the child when able to do so, or by other actions showing an  unwillingness to provide an adequate permanent home. (10) The parent (alleged Father) has abandoned the  child. (14) The parent for any reason is unwilling to provide  food, clothing, shelter, and other basic necessities for  the child or to prevent the child from suffering physical,  emotional, or sexual abuse or physical, emotional, or  mental neglect. (16) Any other factor the Court finds relevant: Mother  was receiving overnight visits, but they were suspended  after allegations of sexual abuse occurred in her home,  which were indicated by CCDCFS.  The court found that Father abandoned the children,  but he is not a party to this case, and there is no evidence that Mother  abandoned the children. However, there is also clear and convincing evidence to  support the trial court's findings under R.C. 2151.414(E)(1), (14), and (16). As  previously determined in the first assignment of error, Mother failed to remedy the  conditions that prevented the children from being reunited with her despite the  agency's reasonable efforts to assist Mother in removing the barriers to reunification.  R.C. 2151.414(E)(1). There is also evidence that Mother was unwilling to take  appropriate action to prevent [*26]  sexual or physical abuse and neglect of the children.  R.C. 2151.414(E)(14). She admittedly allowed the children's step-grandfather to be  present in her home with the children even though they were removed from  custody in his home after A.F. alleged that he physically abused her and the agency  told Mother that the children's step-grandfather was not permitted to be around the  children.  There is also evidence that Mother allowed Davis to  spend nights in her home with the children and that he sexually  assaulted A.F. during one of those nights. Although the sex-abuse allegation was indicated  rather than substantiated, all three children separately and independently told  Hanrahan that Davis slept in the home and that he was Mother's ""boyfriend"" despite  Mother's claims to the contrary. When Hanrahan confronted Mother about the  allegation, she failed to take it seriously. The trial court found that this evidence  also supports the court's finding under R.C. 2151.414(E)(16), which allows the  court to find ""any other factor."" Thus, there is clear and convincing evidence to support  the court's finding under R.C. 2151.414(D)(2)(a).  R.C. 2151.414(D)(2)(b) requires the court to find that  the children have been in agency custody for over two years and no  longer qualified for temporary custody. [*27]   R.C.  2151.415(D)(4)  governs  the  permissible amount of time children may remain in temporary custody and states: No court shall grant an agency more than two  extensions of temporary custody pursuant to division (D)  Page 10 of 11 of this section and the court shall not order an existing  temporary custody order to continue beyond two years  after the date on which the complaint was filed or the  child was first placed into shelter care, whichever date is  earlier, regardless of whether any extensions have been  previously ordered pursuant to division (D) of this  section. It is undisputed that the children have been in agency  custody for almost three years and that they were no longer eligible for extension of  temporary custody. Therefore, there is clear and convincing evidence to support the  court's finding under R.C. 2151.415(D)(4)(b).  The factor listed in R.C. 2151.414(D)(2)(c) is satisfied if  the child ""does not meet the requirements for a planned permanent  living arrangement pursuant to division (A)(5) of Section 2151.353 of the Revised  Code."" To qualify for a planned permanent-living  arrangement under R.C. 2151.353, the child must,  among other things, be ""sixteen years of age or older[.]""  R.C. 2153.353(A)(5)(b). Because none of the children  are 16 years of age or older, the factor listed in R.C.  2151.414(D)(2)(c) is satisfied.  Finally, the factor in R.C. 2151.414(D)(2)(d) is  established if ""[p]rior [*28]  to the dispositional hearing,  no relative or other interested person has filed, or has  been identified in, a motion for legal custody."" A review  of the juvenile court record reveals that no such motion  was filed in this case. Therefore, all the factors outlined  in R.C. 2151.414(D)(2) were satisfied and the juvenile  court had no choice but to find that granting permanent  custody of the children to CCDCFS was in the children's  best interests.  Accordingly, the second assignment of error is  overruled. B. Foster Parent Testimony  In the third assignment of error, Mother argues the trial  court erred by allowing a foster parent to provide a  statement to the court even though the foster parent  was not under oath and was not subject to cross- examination. Mother contends the foster parent's  statement should not be deemed evidence and should  not have been considered in the permanent-custody  analysis.  At the permanent-custody hearing, before closing  arguments, the younger children's foster mother made a  brief statement regarding her home and the younger  children's education. Mother did not object to the  statement and, therefore, forfeited all but plain error. In re De.D., 8th  Dist. Cuyahoga No. 108760, 2020-Ohio-906, ¶ 13  (holding that failure to object to an issue in the  lower [*29]  court waives a party's right to challenge that  issue on appeal absent plain error). ""Plain error exists  only when it can be determined that the outcome of the  trial would have been different."" In re S.F., 8th Dist.  Cuyahoga No. 112327, 2023-Ohio-1900, ¶ 15, citing In  re Z.T., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 88009, 2007-Ohio-827,  ¶ 19, citing Statev. Moreland, 50 Ohio St.3d 58, 62, 552  N.E.2d 894 (1990).  Throughout our analysis and review of this case, we  have not once mentioned the foster parent's statement  because the juvenile court's decision would have been  no different had the foster parent remained silent.  Therefore, Mother cannot establish plain error as a  result of the statement, and the third assignment of error  is overruled. C. Separate Children  In the fourth assignment of error, Mother argues the  juvenile court abused its discretion by failing to consider  the children as separate children when making the best- interest determination. She contends that each child is  different, has different needs, and should be addressed  separately.  We agree that each child is unique. However, the  children in this case are close in age and share many of  the same special needs. The evidence shows that all  the  children  require  psychotherapy  to  address  behavioral issues resulting from abuse and neglect.  They are all under ten years of age and require  protection from the threat of physical, [*30]  sexual, and  emotional harm from adults. Thus, the juvenile court's findings that Mother failed to make appropriate  decisions to protect the health and safety of the children  applied equally to all the children. We, therefore, find no  error in the juvenile court's analysis of the children's  best interest.  The fourth assignment of error is overruled. Page 11 of 11  Judgment affirmed.

I understand that I am charged with count 1     , the  elements of which are    ; Count 2    , the elements of  which are    . [ ] Count(s)     was(were) committed  against a family or household member. [ ] Count(s)      was(were) committed against an intimate partner. I have been given a copy of the charge(s). 5. I UNDERSTAND I HAVE THE FOLLOWING  IMPORTANT RIGHTS, AND I GIVE THEM ALL UP BY  PLEADING GUILTY: a. I have the right to a speedy and public trial in the  county where the offense(s) allegedly occurred. b. I have the right to remain silent before and during  trial and I need not testify against myself. c. I have the right to hear and question witnesses  who might testify against me. d. I have the right to testify and to have witnesses  testify for me. These witnesses may be required to  appear at no cost to me. e. I am presumed innocent unless the charge is  proven beyond a reasonable doubt or I enter a plea  of guilty. f. I have the right to appeal a finding of guilty after  trial. 6. I have been informed that, in order to determine an  appropriate sentence regarding [*4]  the charges to  which I plead guilty in this matter, the judge will take into  consideration my criminal history, which is as follows: a.     b.     c.     d.     e.     f.     7. The Standard Sentencing Range, which was  calculated using my criminal history as referenced in  Paragraph 6 above, is as follows: [ ] LOCAL SANCTIONS: Go to table1 I understand that if community supervision is  imposed, I will be required to comply with various  rules which could include school attendance,  curfew,  law  abiding  behavior,  associational  restrictions,  counseling,  treatment,  urinalysis,  and/or other conditions deemed appropriate by the  judge. Failure to comply with the conditions of  supervision could result in a violation being found  and further confinement imposed for the violation,  up to 30 days. [  ]  COMMITMENT  TO  DEPARTMENT  OF  CHILDREN, YOUTH, AND FAMILIES JUVENILE  REHABILITATION (DCYFJR): Go to table2 I understand that if I am committed to a DCYFJR  rehabilitation facility following my release, I may be  required to comply with a program of parole for a  Page 3 of 9 number of months. I understand that if placed on  parole, I will be under the supervision of a parole  officer. The conditions of parole will restrict my  actions and may require me to participate in  activities and programs including, but not limited to,  evaluation,  treatment,  education,  employment,  community  service,  electronic  monitoring,  or  urinalysis, and, if I am adjudicated of certain  offenses, a program applicable to juvenile firearm  offenders. Failure to comply with the conditions of  parole may result in parole revocation and further  confinement. If the offense to which I am pleading  guilty is a sex offense, failure to comply with the  conditions  of  parole  may  result  in  further  confinement of up to 24 weeks. [*6]  I understand that if I am pleading guilty to 2 or more  offenses,  the  disposition  terms  shall  run  consecutively (1 term after the other) subject to the  limitations in RCW 13.40.180. I understand that if any additional criminal history is  discovered, both the standard sentence range and  the prosecuting attorney's recommendation may  increase. Even so, my plea of guilty to this charge  is binding. 8. RIGHT TO APPEAL SENTENCE: I understand that  the judge must impose a sentence within the standard  range unless the judge finds by clear and convincing  evidence that the standard range sentence would  amount to a manifest injustice. If the judge goes outside  the standard range, either the state or I can appeal that  sentence. If the sentence is within the standard range,  no one can appeal the sentence. 9. MAXIMUM PUNISHMENT: I have been informed and  fully understand that the maximum punishment I can  receive is commitment until I am [ ] 21 years old [ ] 25  years old, but that I may be incarcerated for no longer  than the adult maximum sentence for this offense. 10. COUNTS AS CRIMINAL HISTORY: I understand  that my plea of guilty and the judge's acceptance of my  plea will become part of my criminal history. [*7]  I  understand that if I am pleading guilty to 2 or more  offenses that arise out of the same course of conduct,  only the most serious offense will count as an offense in  my criminal history. I understand that my guilty plea will  remain part of my criminal history when I am an adult  and may affect my ability to remain in the Juvenile  Justice System should I re-offend. I understand that the  judge will consider my criminal history,  if I committed murder in the 1st or 2nd degree or a class  A sex offense, when sentencing me for any offense that  I commit in the future as an adult or juvenile, except  juvenile adjudications of guilt which are not murder in  the 1st or 2nd degree or a class A sex offense cannot  be included in my adult offender score later. 11. GROUNDS FOR DEPORTATION: If I am not a  citizen of the United States, a plea of guilty to an offense  punishable as a crime under state law may be grounds  for deportation, exclusion from admission to the United  States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of  the United States. 12.  NOTIFICATION  RELATING  TO  SPECIFIC  CRIMES:  IF  ANY  OF  THE  FOLLOWING  PARAGRAPHS DO NOT APPLY, THEY SHOULD BE  STRICKEN AND INITIALED BY THE DEFENDANT  AND THE [*8]  JUDGE.

[B] Offender Registration for Sex Offense or  Kidnapping Offense: One or more of the offenses  I am pleading guilty to involve a sex or kidnapping  offense and meets the requirements [*10]  of RCW  9A.44.130 for registration. The specific registration  requirements  are  located  in  the  ""Offender  Registration"" Attachment. Because I am a non-adult  and the offense involves one or more of the  following offense conditions as checked below, I will  be required to register unless I qualify for and am  granted a Special Sexual Offender Disposition  Alternative (SSODA) under RCW 13.40.162, and I  complete the SSODA without being revoked: [ ] Kidnapping Offense - I committed  Kidnapping in the First or Second Degree, or  Unlawful Imprisonment, as defined in RCW  Title 9A.40, where the victim is a minor and I  am not the minor's parent, or any criminal  attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy to commit  the same under RCW Title 9A.28 RCW  9A.44.130 (b)(vi).

REGISTRATION WARNING FOR MULTIPLE  SEX OFFENSE ADJUDICATIONS I understand that anytime I have been  adjudicated of multiple sex offenses, a court  could require me to register as a sex offender if  the court finds by clear, cogent, and convincing  evidence that: (i) I was 14 through 17 years of  age at the time I committed a sex offense; (ii) I  did not receive a Special Sexual Offender  Disposition  Alternative  (SSODA)  under  13.40.162 for the sex offense committed, or,  that SSODA is revoked; (iii) I have been  adjudicated of multiple sex offenses involving  two or more distinct victims and in separate  counts or causes; (iv) I present a serious threat  to public safety after my last date of release  from confinement, including full-time residential  treatment, if any, or entry of disposition; and (v)  registration will lessen the serious threat to  public safety.

This  paragraph does not apply if it is established that the  Washington State Patrol crime laboratory already  has a sample from me for a qualifying offense. Page 5 of 9 [D] SCHOOL NOTIFICATION: I understand that if 1  or more of the offenses for which I am pleading  guilty is a violent offense as defined in RCW  9.94A.030, a sex offense as defined in RCW  9.94A.030, an offense under RCW chapter 9.41  (firearms/weapons), or unlawful possession or  delivery, or both, of a controlled substance in  violation of RCW chapter 69.50, then following my  adjudication of guilt, the court will provide written  notification of the adjudication to any school in  which [*13]  I was enrolled prior to adjudication, or  in which I express an intent to enroll following  adjudication, unless: (1) I have already received a  high school diploma or its equivalent; or, (2) I am  over the age of 18 and my enrollment information  cannot be obtained or I assert no intention of  enrolling in any educational program. [E]  SCHOOL  ATTENDANCE  WITH  VICTIM  PROHIBITED: I understand that if I am pleading  guilty to a sex offense, I will not be allowed to  attend any school attended by the victim or victim's  siblings.

[H] FIREARMS POSSESSION OR COMMISSION  WHILE ARMED: [i] Minimum 10 Days for Possession under Age  18: I understand that since the offense I am  pleading guilty to includes possession of a  firearm in violation of RCW 9.41.040(2)(a)(v),  and pursuant to RCW 13.40.193, the judge will  impose a mandatory minimum disposition of 10  days of confinement which must be served in  total confinement, without possibility of release,  until a minimum of 10 days has been served.

A  consecutive sentence will also be imposed for  each firearm unlawfully possessed. [iii] Armed During Commission of Any Offense:  I understand that if the offense I am pleading  guilty to includes a finding that either I or my  accomplice was armed with a firearm during  the commission of the offense, that the  standard range disposition shall be determined  pursuant to RCW 13.40.160, unless the judge  finds a manifest injustice, in which case the  disposition shall be determined pursuant to  RCW 13.40.193(3). Such confinement will run  consecutive to any other sentence that may be  imposed. [iv] Armed During Commission of a Felony: I  further understand that the offense I am  pleading guilty to includes a finding that either  myself or my accomplice was armed with a  firearm during the commission of a felony  (other than possession of a machine gun,  possession of a stolen firearm, drive-by  shooting,  theft  of  a  firearm,  unlawful  possession of a firearm in the first or second  degree, or use of a machine gun in [*16]  a  felony) and, therefore, unless the felony is a  ""violent offense"" as defined in RCW 9.94A.030,  committed when I was 16 or 17 years old, the  following  mandatory  periods  of  total  confinement will be added to my sentence: For  a class A felony, six (6) months; for a class B  felony, four (4) months; and for a class C  felony, two (2) months. If the felony is a ""violent  offense"" as defined in RCW 9.94A.030,  Page 6 of 9 committed when I was 16 or 17 years old, then  a period of 12 months will be added to my  sentence.

Such confinement  will run consecutive to any other sentence that  may be imposed. [vi] Unlawful Possession of a Firearm in the 1st  or 2nd degree: I understand that if I am  pleading guilty to unlawful possession of a  firearm in the 1st or 2nd degree, I must  participate in a ""qualifying program,"" unless  there is no such program available or the court  makes a written finding based on the juvenile  court risk assessment that participation in the  program would not be appropriate. A qualifying  program means an aggression replacement  training program, a functional family therapy  program, or another cost-beneficial, evidence,  or  research-based  approved  program  applicable to the juvenile firearm offender  population. [I]  FELONY  FIREARM  OFFENDER  REGISTRATION: I am subject to court-ordered  felony firearm offender registration pursuant to  RCW  9.41.330.  The  specific  registration  requirements are located in the ""Felony Firearm  Offender Registration"" attachment. 13. I understand that the prosecuting attorney will make  the following recommendation to the judge:     14. I understand that the probation counselor will make  the following recommendation to the [*18]  judge:     15.

"Kocher v. Sec_y VA., 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 32355.pdf","[*1] On Appeal from the United States District Court for  the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (D.C. No. 2-21-cv-00921) District Judge: Honorable Timothy J. Savage ________________ Submitted Under Third Circuit L.A.R. 34.1(a) December 6, 2023 Before: SHWARTZ, CHUNG, and McKEE, Circuit  Judges (Opinion filed: December 7, 2023) ______________ OPINION* ______________ *This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and  pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding  precedent. McKEE, Circuit Judge. Florence Kocher has been employed by the Veterans  Affairs Medical Center in Philadelphia since 2013. She appeals the District  Court's grant of the Secretary of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs' motion for  summary judgment on her claims of sex and age  discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of  the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Age Discrimination  in Employment Act. For the reasons set forth below, we  will affirm.1 I. Kocher contends that the District Court erred in granting  summary judgment on her claims. While the District  improperly applied the private-sector antidiscrimination  and antiretaliation standards2 to Kocher, a federal  employee, we will affirm the District Court because  Kocher cannot establish her claims under either the  federal-sector provision of Title VII or the ADEA. 1 We [*2]  have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We  review a district court's grant of summary judgment de  novo. Cranbury Brick Yard, LLC v. United States, 943  F.3d 701, 708 (3d Cir. 2019). Summary judgment is only  appropriate ""if the movant shows that there is no  genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ.  P. 56(a). In making this determination, we ""view the  facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party  and make all reasonable inferences in that party's  Page 2 of 3 favor."" Scheidemantle v. Slippery Rock Univ. State Sys.  ofHigher Educ., 470 F.3d 535, 538 (3d Cir. 2006).  2 See Babb v. Wilkie, 140 S. Ct. 1168, 1172, 1176-77  (2020) (distinguishing between private-sector and  federal-sector provisions of the ADEA). 2 ""The ADEA federal-sector provision was patterned  'directly after' Title VII's federal-sector discrimination  ban.""3 These provisions are nearly identical.4 The  ADEA provides: ""All personnel actions affecting [federal]  employees . . . who are at least 40 years of age . . .  shall be made free from any discrimination based on  age.""5 Similarly, Title VII provides: ""All personnel  actions affecting [federal] employees . . . shall be made  free from any discrimination based on race, color,  religion, sex, or national origin.""6 In Babb v. Wilkie, the Supreme Court interpreted the  ADEA federal sector-provision to require that ""personnel  actions be untainted by any [*3]  consideration of  age.""7Because the federal-sector provisions of the  ADEA and Title VII are essentially identical, the Supreme Court's interpretation of the ADEA federal- sector provision controls our analysis of the Title VII  federal-sector provision.8 Thus, under both the federal- sector 3 Gomez-Perez v. Potter, 553 U.S. 474, 487 (2008)  (quoting Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U.S. 156, 167 n.15  (1981)). 4Both federal-sector provisions provide that ""[a]ll  personnel actions affecting [federal] employees . . . shall  be made free from any discrimination."" 29 U.S.C. §  633a(a); 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(a). 5 29 U.S.C. § 633a(a). 6 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(a). 7 140 S. Ct. at 1171. 8 See Babb v. Sec'y, Dep't of Veterans Affs., 992 F.3d  1193, 1198 (11th Cir. 2021)  (recognizing that ""[b]ecause the relevant [federal-sector]  provisions of the ADEA and Title VII are materially  identical, . . . the Supreme Court's analysis of the former  controls the latter as well""); Komis v. Sec'y of United  States Dep't of Lab., 918 F.3d 289, 295 (3d Cir. 2019)  (recognizing that because the ADEA and Title VII  federal-sector provisions are ""nearly identical,"" the  Supreme Court's holding that the ADEA's federal-sector  provision bars retaliation leads to the conclusion that  Title VII's federal-sector provision also bars retaliation);  Huff v. Buttigieg, 42 F.4th 638, 645 (7th Cir. 2022)  (recognizing that ""[t]he federal-sector provisions in the  ADEA and Title VII are identical, so . . . Babb's causation standard applies equally to [Title VII]""). 3 provision of the ADEA and Title VII, ""a personnel action  must be made 'untainted' by discrimination.""9 [*4]  Although  these  federal-sector  provisions  do  not  specifically reference retaliation, they provide federal  employees with the right to bring retaliation claims.10  This is because when an employee experiences  retaliation for complaining about age, race, color,  religion, sex, or national origin discrimination, the  employee experiences a form of ""discrimination based on"" age, race, color, religion, sex,  or national origin.11""[T]he phrase 'based on' indicates a  but-for causal relationship.""12 Thus, in order to succeed  on a retaliation claim, a federal employee must show  that a complaint about discrimination is ""the but-for cause of differential treatment.""13 Kocher argues that the VA discriminated and retaliated  against her by (1) giving her lower than desired ratings  on two annual evaluations, (2) providing her with  performance counseling, (3) denying her the opportunity  to submit her self-evaluation on an official VA form, (4)  including her medical diagnosis in an annual evaluation,  and (5) disclosing her personal information over  unencrypted email.14 9 Babb, 140 S. Ct. at 1173. 10 Gomez-Perez, 553 U.S. at 491; Komis, 918 F.3d at  294.  11 See Gomez-Perez, 553 U.S. at 488 (explaining that  ""retaliation for complaining about age discrimination is  'discrimination based on age'""). 12 Babb, 140 S. Ct. at 1173 (quoting Safeco Ins. Co. of  Am. v. Burr, 551 U.S. 47, 63,(2007)). 13 [*5] See id. at 1174 (emphasis omitted).  14The record reveals that Kocher received an overall  rating of ""low satisfactory"" on her evaluations, the VA  Page 3 of 3 allowed Kocher to submit her self-evaluation but did not  transfer it onto the official form, and the VA responded  to her request and removed all references to her  medical diagnosis in her evaluation. 4 On Kocher's discrimination claims, the District Court  concluded that there was no evidence that Kocher was  ""treated  any  differently""  than  similarly  situated  employees.15 Accordingly, the District Court held that Kocher could  not succeed on her discrimination claims because  Kocher  presented  ""no  evidence  of  disparate  treatment.""16 On appeal, Kocher does not identify any  instances of differential treatment. Rather, she generally  contends that the VA's actions towards her ""can only be  explained by discrimination, given their highly unusual  nature.""17 We will affirm the District Court's grant of  summary judgment on Kocher's discrimination claims  because Kocher fails to identify any evidence to  contradict the District Court's conclusion that the VA's  actions were untainted by discrimination. On Kocher's retaliation claims, the District Court  concluded that Kocher [*6]  had not identified any prior  complaints that she made about discrimination and  instead only vaguely mentioned that she engaged in  ""prior EEO activity.""18Accordingly, the District Court  held that Kocher could not succeed on her retaliation  claims because Kocher failed to establish a causal  connection between any prior EEO activity and the VA's  actions.

"Lewis v. Senior Lifestyle, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217659.pdf","[*1] MEMORANDUM OPINION THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendant Senior  Lifestyle's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 11). The Motion  is ripe for disposition, and no hearing is necessary. See  Local Rule 105.6 (D.Md. 2023). For the reasons set  forth below, the Court will grant the Motion in part and  deny it in part. I. BACKGROUND A. Factual Background1 Self-represented Plaintiff Takia Lewis, a self-identified  African American woman, began working for Senior Lifestyle in human resources  in the Atrium Village on November 15, 2020. (Compl. at  9, ECF No. 1). 2 She alleges that Senior Lifestyle  discriminated against her on the basis of race, and that  she was fired in retaliation for her complaints of  disparate treatment. (See id. at 7). 1 Unless otherwise noted, the Court takes the following  facts from the Complaint (ECF No. 1) and accepts them  as true. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). 2 Citations to page numbers refer to the pagination  assigned by the Court's Case Management/Electronic  Case Files (""CM/ECF"") system. On January 4, 2021, Todd Kalkstein, Senior Lifestyle's  Kitchen Director, had a ""rude[] outburst"" at Lewis for delays in the onboarding  process for new employees. (Id. at 9). He allegedly insulted Lewis by calling her slow. (Id.).  On January [*2]  13, 2021, Lewis became aware that Kalkstein and Molly Hall, the  Program Director, were ""spreading [r]umors about employees being covid positive"" and  identifying those employees. (Id.). Lewis wrote them up because their actions violated the  employee handbook and HIPPA. (Id.). After issuing the write up, Lewis was invited to a  zoom call with Kalkstein; Hall; Beth Ber, the Vice President of Senior Lifestyle; and  Denise Bucholz, 3 Lewis' supervisor. (Id.). Lewis was the only African American person on  the call. (Id.). Ber raised her voice and told Lewis she was disrespectful and she should not  have issued the write ups. (Id.). Bucholz later messaged Lewis to say that she agreed  Page 2 of 7 that Kalkstein and Hall were out of line but directed her to remove the write ups from  Kalkstein and Hall's files. (Id.). Kalkstein then allegedly told another employee to not trust Lewis.  (Id. at 10). On February 2, 2021, Stacy Buckley 4 told Lewis to call  employees to ask about their vaccination status, although Lewis had already done so  the previous day. (Id.). When Lewis 3 In her Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, Lewis  states that ""the [p]roper defendant to this action is  Senior Lifestyle, ('Denise Buchholz['])"". (Pl.'s [*3]  Mem.  Supp. Resp. Mot. Dismiss [""Opp'n""] at 1, ECF No. 19).  To the extent Lewis attempts to add Bucholz as a  defendant, she did not file a motion to amend her  Complaint, and she may not properly add a defendant in  a responsive briefing. Regardless, Lewis asserts Title  VII claims, and the only proper defendant in a Title VII  case is the employer, Senior Lifestyle, not its individual  employees. See Bradley v. Balt. Police Dep't , No. JKB- 11-1799, 2012 WL 4321738, at *2 (D.Md. Sept. 19,  2012) (""Supervisors sued in their individual capacities  may not be held liable under Title VII."") (citing Lissau v.  S. Food Serv., Inc., 159 F.3d 177, 181 (4th Cir. 1998)). 4 In the Complaint, Lewis refers to Buckley as ""Stacy""  and she only lists her full name in her Opposition. (See  Opp'n at 2). While the Complaint must ordinarily stand  alone, 2 informed her that she already made the calls, Buckley  loudly said ""do what I said now."" (Id.). In a different  meeting, Buckley ""got smart"" towards Lewis and said  that as the boss, she ran the meetings. (Id.). On February 3, 2021, Lewis and other employees  moved their offices to a different floor. (Id.). Kalkstein  helped white employees to set up their wifi and  equipment, but he did not help Lewis. (Id.). On February  8, 2021, Kalkstein pushed past Lewis after a meeting  without  acknowledging  her  or  excusing  himself.  (Id. [*4] ). Lewis informed Buckley, who said she would  handle it. (Id.). Lewis and other employees also  observed Kalkstein digging into food meant for residents  with his bare hands. (Id.). Lewis reported him to  Buckley, but nothing was done about it. (Id.). On February 13, 2021, Lewis received a complaint from  an African American employee about her white  supervisor. (Id. at 11). Buckley would not allow Lewis to  attend a meeting with the employee after the complaint,  and the situation was never addressed appropriately.  (Id.). On February 17, 2021, Lewis learned that Senior  Lifestyle held a management meeting but only invited  white managers. (Id.). On February 19, 2021, Kalkstein yelled at an African  American supervisor, Helen Lambert, for working from  home during a weather emergency. (Id.). Lewis reported  this to Buckley and asked why Senior Lifestyle had not  held Kalkstein accountable. (Id.). Buckley yelled at  Lewis to ""stay out of it."" (Id.). and the Court cannot permit Lewis to amend her  Complaint with facts contained in the Opposition, the  Court will refer to Buckley by her last name for  consistency. 3 On February 22, 2021, Lewis heard Kalkstein ""cussing  at an employee,"" who told Lewis that Kalkstein had  disrespected her and made her cry on previous  occasions. (Id.). This situation was never handled. (Id.).  On February 25, 2021, Lewis learned that an African  American employee [*5]  had quit because of Kalkstein  and his disrespectful behavior and that a white server  left her job because she did not want to take directions  from Lambert, who is an African American woman. (Id.  at 12). Lewis reported this information to Buckley, who  told her to ""stop supporting Black employees before  [you] end up in the hot seat."" (Id.). Lewis said that she  did not understand, and Buckley replied ""oh[,] you will.""  (Id.). Lewis told her that she needed to treat all  employees equally. (Id.). On March 2, 2021, Lambert told Lewis that Kalkstein  sent a text to a group chat of Senior Lifestyle employees  in which he blamed Lambert for a mistake that a white  employee had made. (Id.). Lewis submitted a statement  to Buckley, who told Lambert that she was Kalkstein's  boss and to ""stop putting energy in the situation."" (Id.).  That same day, Buckley told Lewis that her position was  being eliminated and that her last day of work would be  March 16, 2021. (Id.). On March 3 and 4, 2021, after Lewis had gone home,  Kalkstein and Buckley broke into her office and took her  office keys and several write ups, including the one she  wrote for Kalkstein and Hall. (Id. at 13). From March 5- 16, 2021, Lewis was [*6]  denied access to payroll, and  she was told to sit at her desk all day and not speak to  Page 3 of 7 employees. (Id.). B. Procedural History Lewis filed an administrative complaint on March 2,  2021, and she received a Right to Sue Letter on October 11, 2022. (See id. at 8). On  January 9, 2023, she filed her 4 Complaint, in which she claims racial discrimination and  retaliation under Title VII. (Id. at 7). Senior Lifestyle filed  the instant Motion to Dismiss on May 16, 2023. (ECF  No. 11). Lewis filed an Opposition on June 12, 2023,  (ECF No. 19), and Senior Lifestyle filed a Reply on June  26, 2023, (ECF No. 21). II. DISCUSSION A. Standard of Review The purpose of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is to ""test[] the  sufficiency of a complaint,"" not to ""resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits  of a claim, or the applicability of defenses."" King v.  Rubenstein, 825 F.3d 206, 214 (4th Cir. 2016) (quoting  Edwards v. Cityof Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 243 (4th  Cir. 1999)). A complaint fails to state a claim if it does  not contain ""a short and plain statement of the claim  showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,""  Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2), or does not ""state a claim to relief  that is plausible on its face,"" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.  662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v.Twombly, 550  U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). A claim is facially plausible  ""when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the  court to draw the reasonable inference that the  defendant [*7]  is liable for the misconduct alleged."" Id.  (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). ""Threadbare recitals  of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere  conclusory statements, do not suffice."" Id. (citing  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). Though the plaintiff is not  required to forecast evidence to prove the elements of  the claim, the complaint must allege sufficient facts to  establish each element. Goss v. Bank of Am., N.A., 917  F.Supp.2d 445, 449 (D.Md. 2013) (quoting Walters v.  McMahen, 684 F.3d 435, 439 (4th Cir. 2012)), aff'd, 546  F.App'x 165 (4th Cir. 2013). 5 In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court must  examine the complaint as a whole, consider the factual  allegations in the complaint as true, and construe the  factual allegations in the light most favorable to the  plaintiff. Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 268 (1994);  Lambeth v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 407 F.3d 266, 268 (4th Cir.  2005) (citing Scheuer v.Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236  (1974)). Complaints drafted by self-represented plaintiffs  are held to a less stringent standard than those drafted  by attorneys, and courts must liberally construe these  complaints. See Johnson v. Silver, 742 F.2d 823, 825  (4th Cir. 1984). But the court need not accept  unsupported or conclusory factual allegations devoid of  any reference to actual events, United Black Firefighters  v. Hirst, 604 F.2d 844, 847 (4th Cir. 1979), or legal  conclusions couched as factual allegations, Iqbal, 556  U.S. at 678. C. Analysis 1. Discrimination Senior Lifestyle argues Lewis has failed to state a  plausible claim for discrimination due to her race or  color. (Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss [""Mot.""] at 1,  ECF No. 11-2). Title VII prohibits an employer from  discriminating [*8]  against employees due to race,  color, religion, sex, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. §  2000e-2(a). A plaintiff may establish a Title VII claim  ""either 'through direct and indirect evidence of retaliatory  [or discriminatory] animus,' or through a burden-shifting  'pretext' framework."" Netter v. Barnes, 908 F.3d 932,  938 (4th Cir. 2018) (quoting Foster v. Univ. of Md.-E.  Shore, 787 F.3d 243, 249 (4th Cir. 2015)). The Complaint does not include allegations of direct  evidence of discrimination. See Cole v. Fam. Dollar  Stores of Md., Inc., 811 F.App'x 168, 175 (4th Cir. 2020)  (""Direct 6 evidence is 'evidence of conduct or statements that both  reflect directly the alleged discriminatory attitude and that bear directly on the  contested employment decision.'"" (quoting Taylor v. Va. Union Univ., 193 F.3d 219, 232  (4th Cir. 1999))). 5 Accordingly, the Court will evaluate Lewis' claim under the burden- shifting framework first articulated by Page 4 of 7 the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.  Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). To establish a discrimination or retaliation claim under  the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, Lewis must eventually put  forth a prima facie case by establishing that: (1) she belongs to a protected class; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; (3) at the time of the adverse action, she was  performing her job at a level that met her employer's  legitimate expectations . . . ; and (4)  she  was  rejected  [or  terminated]  under  circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful  discrimination. See Adams v. Trs. of the Univ. of N.C.-Wilmington, 640  F.3d 550, 558 (4th Cir. 2011). The precise formulation of [*9]  the required prima facie  showing will vary in ""differing factual situations,"" McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802 n.13,  and the elements were ""never intended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic,'""  Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U.S. 506, 512 (2002) (quoting Furnco Constr. Corp. v.  Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577 (1978)). If Lewis succeeds in establishing a prima facie case, the  burden shifts to the employer to 5 In her Complaint, Lewis alleges that Senior Lifestyle  discriminated against her directly by excluding her from  meetings and taking away job responsibilities. (Compl.  at 5). The Court finds that these actions could show  indirect discrimination in some circumstances, but alone  they do not evince a ""discriminatory attitude"" towards  Lewis based on her race. See Cole, 811 F.App'x at 175.  Thus, the Court finds that Lewis presents no evidence of  direct discrimination. 7 ""present a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its  employment action."" Mackey v.Shalala, 360 F.3d 463,  468 (4th Cir. 2004). If the employer does so, ""the burden  shifts back to the employee to show that the given  reason was just a pretext for discrimination."" Id. The Court is mindful that a Title VII plaintiff need not  satisfy all the elements set forth above to survive a  motion to dismiss. See Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 510  (""The prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas,  however, is an evidentiary standard, [*10]  not a  pleading requirement.""); accord Parker v. Child.'s Nat'l  Med. Ctr., Inc., No. ELH-20-3523, 2021 WL 5840949, at  *9 (D.Md. Dec. 9, 2021) (""At the motion to dismiss  stage, a plaintiff need not establish a prima facie case of  discrimination.""). Instead, at the motion to dismiss stage,  a plaintiff need only ""allege[] facts that plausibly state a  violation of Title VII 'above a speculative level.'"" Bing v.  Brivo Sys., LLC, 959 F.3d 605, 617 (4th Cir. 2020)  (quoting Coleman v. Md. Ct. of Appeals, 626 F.3d 187,  190 (4th Cir. 2010)), cert. denied, 141 S.Ct. 1376  (2021). Thus, the plaintiff must generally show that the  employer took adverse action against the plaintiff ""under  circumstances which give rise to an inference of  unlawful discrimination."" Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v.  Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981); Adams, 640 F.3d at  558. This requirement can be met by showing that  ""similarly-situated employees outside the protected  class received more favorable treatment."" White v.  BFIWaste Servs., LLC, 375 F.3d 288, 295 (4th Cir.  2004). The Court considers the ""totality of the circumstances""  in determining whether Lewis has adequately alleged  discrimination. See Strothers v. City of Laurel, 895 F.3d  317, 330-31 (4th Cir. 2018) (""[T]he connection between  animus and conduct may be inferred from the totality of  the circumstances.""); see also Woods v. City of  Greensboro, 855 F.3d 8 639, 649 (4th Cir. 2017) (concluding that a court ""may  infer discriminatory intent from evidence of a general  pattern of . . . discrimination in the practices of a  defendant""); Guirkin v. CMH Physician Servs., LLC, No.  3:20CV59, 2020 WL 6829769, at *7 n.13 (E.D.Va. Nov.  20, 2020) (""Although [plaintiff's] individual allegations do  not by themselves prove discriminatory [*11]  animus,  the totality of circumstances surrounding his termination  gives rise to the inference that [plaintiff] was fired, at  least in part, because of his [protected status].""). Senior Lifestyle argues that Lewis' allegations do not  support a reasonable inference that she was terminated  Page 5 of 7 due to unlawful discrimination. (See Mot. at 6). The  Court agrees. Lewis alleges that managers treated her  with hostility, excluded her from meetings, took away job  responsibilities, belittled her, and ignored her efforts to  resolve employee complaints. (See Compl. at 5-13).  Even taking these allegations as true and construing  them in the light most favorable to Lewis, the Court  cannot  infer  that  Senior  Lifestyle  acted  with  discriminatory animus due to Lewis' race or color. Lewis argues that she has stated a claim for  discrimination by showing Senior Lifestyle's disparate  treatment of employees outside her protected class.  (See Opp'n at 4). Specifically, Lewis alleges that  Kalkstein helped other white employees to set up their  offices and equipment, but that he did not help her.  (Compl. at 10). To the extent they intend to rely on comparator  evidence,  plaintiffs  in  the  Fourth  Circuit  must  demonstrate that [*12]  they are similarly situated with a  comparator ""by showing that they both (1) 'dealt with the  same supervisor,' and (2) were 'subject to the same  standards and . . . engaged in the same conduct without  such differentiating or mitigating 9 circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or  the employer's treatment of them for it.'"" Tinsley v. City  of Charlotte, 854 F.App'x 495, 500-01 (4th Cir. 2021)  (quoting Haynesv. Waste Connections, Inc., 922 F.3d  219, 223-24 (4th Cir. 2019)). This Court has previously  dismissed Title VII complaints in which the only  allegations  of  discriminatory  intent  come  from  insufficient comparator evidence. See Chatelle v.  Maryland, No. GLR-21-1734, 2022 WL 2953042, at *8  (D.Md. July 25, 2022) (dismissing complaint when  comparator evidence fails to establish discriminatory  intent or causation); Price v. HowardCnty. Pub. Sch.  Sys., No. GLR-22-541, 2023 WL 170425, at *10 (D.Md.  Jan. 11, 2023) (same). Here, Lewis has failed to show either of the two  elements set forth above, and thus she cannot state a  claim for discrimination based on comparator evidence.  Accordingly,  Lewis'  discrimination  claim  will  be  dismissed. 2. Retaliation Lewis alleges that Senior Lifestyle terminated her in  retaliation for her advocacy regarding African American  employees and discrimination in the workplace. (Compl.  at 11-13). Specifically, Lewis reported several different  employee complaints to Buckley between February 13,  2021 and March 2, 2021: • On February 13, 2021, Lewis reported a concern  from [*13]  an African American employee regarding  their white supervisor, (id. at 11); • On February 18 and 19, 2021, Lewis reported that  Kalkstein yelled at and demeaned Lambert, an African  American employee. Buckley told Lewis to ""stay out of  it,"" (id.); • On February 22, 2021, Lewis reported that Kalkstein  had cursed at an employee, (id.); 10 • On February 25, 2021, Lewis reported that a Black  employee had quit because Kalkstein and another  supervisor had demeaned her with ""slurs"" and asked  her if she could read. She also told Buckley that a  former white employee quit because she did not want to  take direction from an African American supervisor. In  response, Buckley told her ""stop supporting Black  employees before [you] end up in the hot seat."" Lewis  said that she did not understand, and Buckley replied  ""oh[,] you will."" Lewis informed her that ""you need to  treat all your employees the same,"" (id. at 12); • On March 1, 2021, Lewis reported that Kalkstein  assumed that Lambert, an African American supervisor,  made a mistake, and he reprimanded her on a group  text, even though a white supervisor made the mistake,  (id.). Also on March 2, 2021, Buckley informed Lewis that her  position was being eliminated, [*14]  and Lewis' last day  would be March 16, 2021. (Id.). On March 5, 2021,  management confined Lewis to her desk and would not  allow her to access payroll or to answer employee  questions. (Id. at 13). Senior Lifestyle argues the retaliation claim must be  dismissed because Lewis did not engage in protected  activity and even if she did, there is no causal  connection between the activity and her termination.  (Mot. at 7-8). At bottom, the Court finds Lewis has  alleged sufficient facts to plead a prima facie case of  retaliation. Title VII prohibits an employer from retaliating against  an employee who exercises her Title VII rights. Hart v.  Lew, 973 F.Supp.2d 561, 582 (D.Md. 2013). In order to  establish a prima facie claim of retaliation under Title  Page 6 of 7 VII, Lewis ""must show that she engaged in protected  activity, that her employer took adverse action against  her, and that a causal relationship existed between the  protected activity and the adverse employment activity.""  Id. (cleaned up). If she succeeds in establishing a prima  facie case, the McDonnellDouglas framework applies,  just as it does for a discrimination claim: ""If a plaintiff  puts 11 forth sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case  of  retaliation  and  a  defendant  offers  a  non- discriminatory [*15]  explanation for the adverse action,  the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that the  employer's proffered explanation is pretext."" Id. (cleaned  up). Regarding the first element, Title VII makes it unlawful  for ""an employer to discriminate against any of [its]  employees . . . because [s]he has opposed any practice  made an unlawful practice by this subchapter, or  because [s]he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or  participated in any manner in an investigation,  proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter."" 42  U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). Protected activity, ""therefore, can  take the form of either opposing a practice prohibited  under Title VII ([under] the opposition clause) or making  a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in an  investigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII  ([under] the participation clause)."" Pitter v. Cmty.  ImagingPartners, Inc., 735 F.Supp.2d 379, 395 (D.Md.  2010). ""The opposition clause has been held to  encompass  informal  protests,  such  as  voicing  complaints to employers or using an employer's  grievance procedures."" Id. at 396. Senior Lifestyle argues that Lewis' reports to Buckley do  not constitute protected activity because ""there are no  facts to suggest that Mr. Kalkstein's behavior was in any  way discriminatory or on the basis of a protected [*16]   characteristic."" (Reply Supp. Def.'s Mot. Dismiss  [""Reply""] at 4, ECF No. 21). The Court agrees that some  of Lewis' reports, such as the February 13, 2021 report  of a concern regarding a white director and an African  American employee, are too vague and do not indicate  any discriminatory animus. Nevertheless, the Court  must consider the totality of the circumstances and view  the facts in the light most favorable to Lewis. Albright,  510 U.S. at 268. In doing so, the Court finds 12 that Lewis reported a pattern of Kalkstein singling out  African American employees for discipline. The Court further finds that even if these reports were,  by themselves, insufficient to show protected activity,  Lewis' conversation with Buckley on February 25, 2021,  establishes the first element of her claim. In that  conversation, Buckley told Lewis to ""stop supporting  Black employees,"" indicating that Lewis' reports were  based upon a protected characteristic. (Compl. at 12).  Further, when Lewis told her that she did not  understand, Buckley said ""oh[,] you will,"" and Lewis  informed her that ""you need to treat all your employees  the same."" (Id.). Lewis' plea that Buckley ""treat all []  employees the same"" can be construed as a  request [*17]  for Senior Lifestyle to address alleged  discriminatory conduct. Because protected activity  ""encompass[es] informal protests, such as voicing  complaints to employers or using an employer's  grievance procedures,"" Pitter, 735 F.Supp.2d at 396, the  Court finds that Lewis participated in protected activity. Senior Lifestyle does not contest that it took an adverse  action against Lewis, and thus the Court moves to the  third element-whether a causal relationship existed  between the protected activity and the adverse  employment activity. To satisfy this element, a plaintiff  must show that ""the employer [took] the adverse  employment action because the plaintiff engaged in a  protected activity."" Dowe v. Total Action Against Poverty  inRoanoke Valley, 145 F.3d 653, 657 (4th Cir.1998)  (emphasis in original). The Fourth Circuit ""has held that  evidence that the alleged adverse action occurred  shortly after the employer became aware of the  protected activity is sufficient to 'satisf[y] the less  onerous burden of making a prima facie case of  causa[tion].'"" Id. (quoting Williams v. Cerberonics, 13 Inc., 871 F.2d 452, 457 (4th Cir.1989)) (emphasis and  alterations in Dowe). Conversely, ""the opposite [is]  equally true,"" so that ""[a] lengthy time lapse between the  employer becoming aware of the protected activity and  the alleged adverse employment action . . . [*18]  negates any inference that a causal connection exists  between the two."" Dowe, 145 F.3d at 657 (finding a  period of time exceeding three years too lengthy to give  rise to the inference of a causal connection); Clarke v.  DynCorp Int'l LLC, 962 F.Supp.2d 781, 790 (D.Md.  2013) (""[A] lapse of as little as two months between the  protected activity and an adverse employment action is  sufficiently long so as to weaken significantly the  inference of causation."") (citation omitted); Pascual v.  Page 7 of 7 Lowe's Home Centers, Inc., 193 F.App'x 229, 233 (4th  Cir. 2006) (two to four month period between protected  activity and termination was ""too long to establish a  causal connection by temporal proximity alone.""). Lewis is a self-represented litigant, and she does not  directly discuss causation in her Opposition or  Complaint. Regardless, plaintiffs are not required to  plead a formulaic recitation of the elements, see  E.E.O.C. v. Performance Food Grp., Inc., 16 F.Supp.3d  584, 588 (D.Md. 2014), and the Court finds that her  alleged timeline establishes causation by temporal  proximity. Lewis participated in protected activity on  February 25, 2021 when she made a report of racial  discrimination to Buckley and asked that Buckley ""treat  all [] employees the same."" (Compl. at 12). Buckley told  her to stop advocating for Black employees, and when  Lewis said she did not understand, Buckley said ""oh[,]  you will."" (Id.). Just five days later on March [*19]  2,  2021, Buckley told Lewis that her position was being  eliminated. (Id.). On March 5, 2021, Senior Lifestyle  took away key job responsibilities, and Lewis' last day  was March 16, 2021. (Id. at 13). Accordingly, Lewis has  established 14 causation because the adverse action occurred ""shortly""  after Senior Lifestyle became aware of the protected  activity. See Dowe, 145 F.3d at 657. Lewis has plead of prima facie case of retaliation  because she has established all three elements. See  Hart, 973 F.Supp.2d at 582. Under the McDonnell- Douglas framework, the burden then shifts to Senior  Lifestyle to offer a non-discriminatory explanation for the  adverse action. See id. Senior Lifestyle offers no  explanation for why it eliminated Lewis' position and  took away key job responsibilities, and thus its Motion  will be denied as to the retaliation claim."

LEXIS 217918.pdf","[*1] MEMORANDUM AND ORDER Before the Court is the motion of Plaintiff Kelly McSean,  f/k/a Larry Bemboom, for leave to proceed in forma  pauperis in this civil action. The Court has reviewed the  motion and the financial information provided in support,  and has determined to grant the motion and assess an  initial partial filing fee of $7.95. In additional, the Court  will partially dismiss the Complaint and direct the Clerk  to effect service of process as to the non-frivolous  portions, and will deny without prejudice Plaintiff's  motion to appoint counsel. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(b)(1) Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(b)(1), a prisoner bringing  a civil action in forma pauperis is required to pay the full  amount of the filing fee. District courts ""shall assess  and, when funds exist, collect, as a partial payment of  any court fees required by law, an initial partial filing fee  of 20 percent of the greater of"" the average monthly  deposits to the prisoner's account, or the average  monthly balance in the prisoner's account for the prior  six-month period. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(b)(1). After payment  of the initial partial filing fee, the prisoner is required to  make monthly payments of 20 percent of the preceding  month's income credited to his account. 28 U.S.C. §  1915(b)(2). The agency having custody of [*2]  the  prisoner will forward these monthly payments to the Clerk of Court each time the amount in  the account exceeds $10, until the filing fee is fully paid.  Id. In support of the instant motion, Plaintiff filed an inmate  account statement that shows an average monthly  deposit of $39.73, and an average monthly balance of  $29.39. Therefore, the Court assesses an initial partial  filing fee of $7.95, which is twenty percent of Plaintiff's  average monthly deposit. Legal Standard on Initial Review This Court is required to review a complaint filed in  forma  pauperis  to  determine  whether  summary  dismissal is appropriate. See 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e). This  Court must dismiss a complaint or any portion of it that  states a frivolous or malicious claim, that fails to state a  claim upon which relief may be granted, or that seeks  monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from  such relief. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2). An action is frivolous  if it ""lacks an arguable basis in either law or fact.""  Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 328 (1989). An action  fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted if  it does not plead ""enough facts to state a claim to relief  that is plausible on its face."" Bell Atlantic Corp. v.  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). A claim is facially plausible when the plaintiff ""pleads  factual content that allows the court [*3]  to draw the  reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the  misconduct alleged."" Page 2 of 5 Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Determining  whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief is  a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court  to draw upon judicial experience and common sense. Id.  at 679. The court must assume the veracity of well- pleaded facts, but need not accept as true ""[t]hreadbare  recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported  by mere conclusory statements."" Id. at 678 (citing  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). Seealso Barton v. Taber,  820 F.3d 958, 964 (8th Cir. 2016) (courts must ""accept  as true the facts 2 alleged, but not legal conclusions or threadbare recitals  of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere  conclusory statements.""). This Court liberally construes complaints filed by  laypeople. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976).  ""Liberal construction"" means that ""if the essence of an  allegation is discernible,"" the court should ""construe the  complaint in a way that permits the layperson's claim to  be considered within the proper legal framework.""  Solomon v. Petray, 795 F.3d 777, 787 (8th Cir. 2015)  (quoting Stone v. Harry, 364 F.3d 912, 914 (8th Cir.  2004)). However, even complaints filed by self- represented persons must allege facts that, if true, state  a claim for relief as a matter of law. Martin v. Aubuchon,  623 F.2d 1282, 1286 (8th Cir. 1980). Federal courts are  not required to assume facts that are not alleged, Stone,  364 F.3d at 914-15, and are not required to  interpret [*4]  procedural rules to excuse mistakes by  those who proceed without counsel. See McNeilv.  United States, 508 U.S. 106, 113 (1993). The Complaint Plaintiff is a pretrial detainee at the St. Francois County  Detention Center (also ""Detention Center""). Because  Plaintiff identifies herself as a transgender female, the  Court will refer to her using feminine pronouns. Plaintiff  filed the Complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983  against  Officers  Jessica  Lemons  and  Unknown  Bainbridge. Plaintiff identifies both defendants as St.  Francois County Sheriff's Department employees, and  sues them in their official and individual capacities. She  alleges as follows. ""After being informed that the ACLU and an attorney  had contacted the St. Francois County Detention Center  of the Constitutional rights of transgender persons,""  Plaintiff ""submitted an Inmate Request Form as to the  status of ability to purchase and have female 3 undergarments."" (ECF No. 1 at 5). 1 Plaintiff references  her June 10, 2023 Inmate Request Form (also ""Form""),  and states she plans to file a copy of it as an exhibit. Id.  at 5, 21. On the afternoon of June 21, 2023, Lemons, ""who has  not been involved in this matter, used her authority and  position to retaliate, discriminate, and sexually harass  Ms. McSean"" [*5]  when she entered the pod and  yelled, ""what cell is he in."" Id. at 5. Lemons then went to  Plaintiff's cell door with six other officers, and began  yelling at Plaintiff ""in front of other inmates, for  exercising her First Amendment right by filing a request  form."" Id. Lemons waved her arms, told Plaintiff she was  making the canteen officer uncomfortable, yelled and  ""sexually harassed"" Plaintiff in a loud aggressive voice,  and said she ""was about to lose it."" Id. at 6. Lemons asked Plaintiff how many times she had been  told ""no,"" and Plaintiff replied ""several."" Id. Lemons  asked ""how many times"" again in a louder voice, and  Plaintiff repeated ""several."" Id. In a ""demanding voice,""  Lemons told Plaintiff to stop, and to not ask for the  undergarments  again.  Id.  Bainbridge  then  twice  demanded that Plaintiff tell Lemons ""yes ma'am,"" while  keeping his hand on his can of mace. Id. at 6-7. Plaintiff  alleges she feared she would be maced or assaulted.  She states she ""did not file a grievance on this issue  due to being told not to ask again. I fear their actions of  doing so."" Id. at 21. Plaintiff claims the Defendants violated her rights under  the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. She can  be  understood  to  claim  that  the  Defendants  retaliated [*6]  against her ""for exercising her First  Amendment right by filing"" the Form. Id. at 5. Plaintiff  also states that the Defendants sexually harassed her,  sexually assaulted her, verbally abused her, and  discriminated against her on the basis of sex. She  identifies her injuries as increased anxiety, emotional  and 1Plaintiff handwrote the Statement of Claim in all  uppercase letters. When quoting the Complaint, the  Court will use lowercase letters. 4 mental distress, undue worry and stress, sleep  disturbance, and fear of authority figures. She seeks  monetary relief. Page 3 of 5 Discussion The Court will dismiss Plaintiff's official-capacity claims.  An official-capacity claim against an individual is actually  ""against the governmental entity itself."" White v.  Jackson, 865 F.3d 1064, 1075 (8th Cir. 2017). Thus, a  ""suit against a public employee in his or her official  capacity is merely a suit against the public employer.""  Johnson v. Outboard Marine Corp., 172 F.3d 531, 535  (8th Cir. 1999). See also Elder-Keep v. Aksamit, 460  F.3d 979, 986 (8th Cir. 2006) (stating that a ""suit against  a public official in his official capacity is actually a suit  against the entity for which the official is an agent"");  Brewington v. Keener, 902 F.3d 796, 800 (8th Cir. 2018)  (explaining that an official capacity suit against sheriff  and his deputy ""must be treated as a suit against the  County""). To prevail on an official capacity claim, a  plaintiff must establish the [*7]  governmental entity's  liability for the alleged conduct. Kelly v. City of Omaha,  Neb., 813 F.3d 1070, 1075 (8th Cir. 2016). Plaintiff identifies both defendants as St. Francois  County Sheriff's Department employees. The St.  Francois County Sheriff's Department is not an entity  that is subject to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See  Ketchum v. City of West Memphis, Ark., 974 F.2d 81, 82  (8th  Cir.  1992)  (stating  that  ""departments  or  subdivisions"" of local government are not ""juridical  entities suable as such""). St. Francois County is an  entity that can be sued directly under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs. of City of New York, 436  U.S. 658, 690 (1978). Liability may attach if a  constitutional violation resulted from an official policy, an  unofficial custom, or a deliberately indifferent failure to  train or supervise. Mick v. Raines, 883 F.3d 1075, 1079  (8th 5 Cir. 2018). In this case, the Complaint contains no such  assertions. Therefore, the Court will dismiss Plaintiff's  official-capacity claims. The Court now addresses Plaintiff's individual-capacity  claims. Plaintiff can be understood to assert a First  Amendment retaliation claim against both defendants  under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. To establish such a claim, a  plaintiff must show (1) she engaged in a protected  activity, (2) the government official took adverse action  against her that would chill a person of ordinary  firmness from continuing in the activity, and (3) the  adverse action was motivated at least in part by the  exercise [*8]  of the protected activity. Revels v.  Vincenz, 382 F.3d 870, 876 (8th Cir. 2004). The  ""ordinary firmness"" test is an objective one. Garcia v.  City of Trenton, 348 F.3d 726, 728 (8th Cir. 2003). The  relevant inquiry is not whether the plaintiff was deterred;  although the plaintiff's actions might be evidence of what  a reasonable person would have done. Id. The inquiry  ""is usually best left to the judgment of a jury."" Santiago  v. Blair, 707 F.3d 984, 992 (8th Cir. 2013). In this case, the activity for which Plaintiff claims she  suffered retaliation was the filing of the June 10, 2023  Form. Therefore, the Court considers whether that  qualifies as activity that is protected under the First  Amendment. Prisoners have a First Amendment right to  ""petition for redress of grievances under a prison's  grievance procedure."" Nelson v. Shuffman, 603 F.3d  439, 449 (8th Cir. 2010). ""The filing of a prison  grievance, like the filing of an inmate lawsuit, is  protected First Amendment activity."" Lewis v. Jacks, 486  F.3d 1025, 1029 (8th Cir. 2007). Plaintiff identifies the June 10, 2023 filing as an ""Inmate  Request Form,"" and she initially states she filed it ""as to  the status of ability to purchase and have female  undergarments."" (ECF No. 1 at 5). Considered in  isolation, that does not characterize the Form as a  petition for redress of a grievance that would be  protected by the First Amendment. Based upon  Plaintiff's other 6 statements in the Complaint, however, it is clear that  Plaintiff previously requested the undergarments [*9]   ""several"" times, and had been told ""no."" Id. at 6. Also,  Plaintiff can be understood to explain that she filed the  Form after she learned new information that she thought  might allow her to challenge those past denials and  seek redress. Id. at 5. Therefore, liberally construing the  Complaint, the Court cannot conclude for purposes of  initial review that Plaintiff's filing of the Form did not  qualify as protected First Amendment activity. The right to be free from retaliation for availing oneself  of the grievance process is clearly established in the  Eighth Circuit. Santiago, 707 F.3d at 991. See also  Nelson, 603 F.3d at 450 (stating ""that actions taken in  retaliation for an inmate's filing of a grievance are  actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983""). Here, Plaintiff  alleges that Lemons and Bainbridge took adverse action  to retaliate against her for filing the Form, and to prevent  her from trying to obtain the undergarments. Plaintiff's  allegations are sufficient to establish, for purposes of  initial review, that the adverse action would chill a  person of ordinary firmness from continuing in that  Page 4 of 5 activity. See Santiago, 707 F.3d at 992 (stating that the question  of ordinary firmness ""is usually best left to the judgment  of a jury.""). To the extent Plaintiff can be understood to claim that  the [*10]  defendants violated her federally protected  rights by subjecting her to sexual harassment or sexual  assault, however, such claims fail. The only encounter  Plaintiff identifies is the June 21, 2023 incident. Plaintiff  does not allege that either Defendant made any  statement or gesture that could be construed as sexual  in nature, nor does she allege that either Defendant  made physical contact with her. While Plaintiff  characterizes the Defendants' actions as sexual  harassment or sexual assault, this Court need not  accept Plaintiff's speculation as true. See Twombly, 550  U.S. at 555 (citation omitted). In addition, the Eighth  Circuit has recognized that even verbal sexual  harassment without contact 7 or touching does not amount to a constitutional violation.  Howard v. Everett, 208 F.3d 218 (8th Cir. 2000)  (unpublished table decision); see also Burton v.  Livingston, 791 F.2d 97, 99 (8th Cir. 1986) (""mere  words, without more, do not invade a federally protected  right.""). Plaintiff also states that the Defendants subjected her to  sex discrimination. However, there are no allegations as  to either Defendant that can be construed as amounting  to discrimination on the basis of sex, and the Court is  not required to accept Plaintiff's speculation as true. See  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citation omitted). Plaintiff also claims that the Defendants [*11]  verbally  abused her. While retaliating against Plaintiff for  exercising her First Amendment rights is actionable  under § 1983, verbal abuse or verbal harassment alone  is not. See King v. Olmsted Cnty., 117 F.3d 1065, 1067  (8th Cir. 1997) (fear or emotional injury resulting ""solely  from verbal harassment or idle threats is generally not  sufficient to constitute an invasion of an identified liberty  interest""); McDowell v. Jones, 990 F.2d 433, 434 (8th  Cir. 1993) (""Verbal threats and name calling usually are  not actionable under § 1983""); Hopson v. Fredericksen, 961 F.2d 1374, 1378  (8th Cir. 1992) (""Generally, mere verbal threats made by  a state-actor do not constitute a § 1983 claim.""). A  ""threat is redressable under § 1983 if it caused severe injuries, was grossly  disproportionate to the need for action under the  circumstances and was inspired by malice rather than  merely careless or unwise excess of zeal so that it  amounted to an abuse of official power that shocks the  conscience."" Turner v. Mull, 784 F.3d 485, 492 (8th Cir.  2015). Here, Plaintiff's allegations fail to establish that  the Defendants' conduct rose to the level of actionable  verbal abuse, and the Court need not accept Plaintiff's  speculation as true. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555  (citation omitted). 8 In the Complaint, Plaintiff states that this Court has  supplemental jurisdiction over her state law claims.  However, she does not identify any particular state law  claim, and this Court cannot construct [*12]  a legal  theory on her behalf. See Stone, 364 F.3d at 914-15. For the foregoing reasons, the Court will direct the Clerk  to issue process upon the Defendants in their individual  capacities as to Plaintiff's First Amendment retaliation  claims. The Court will dismiss Plaintiff's official capacity  claims against the Defendants, and will dismiss the  claims of sexual harassment, sexual assault, sex  discrimination, and verbal abuse that Plaintiff purports to  bring pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiff has also filed a motion to appoint counsel. An  indigent litigant has ""neither a constitutional nor a  statutory right to appointed counsel in civil cases.""  Patterson v. Kelley, 902 F.3d 845, 850 (8th Cir. 2018)  (citing Phillips v. Jasper Cnty. Jail, 437 F.3d 791, 794  (8th Cir. 2006)). A district court may appoint counsel in a  civil case if it is ""convinced that an indigent plaintiff has  stated a non-frivolous claim . . . and where the nature of  the litigation is such that plaintiff as well as the court will  benefit from the assistance of counsel."" Id. (citing  Johnson v.Williams, 788 F.2d 1319, 1322 (8th Cir.  1986)). When determining whether to appoint counsel  for an indigent litigant, a court considers relevant factors  such as the factual complexity of the issues, the  litigant's ability to investigate the facts and present his or  her claims, the existence of conflicting testimony, and  the complexity of the legal arguments. [*13]  Id. (citing  Phillips, 437 F.3d at 794). In this case, there is no indication Plaintiff is incapable  of representing herself, and nothing in the instant motion  or in the record before the Court indicates that the  factual or legal issues are sufficiently complex to justify  the appointment of counsel. Moreover, the defendants  have yet to be served with process and discovery has  Page 5 of 5 not begun, so there is no conflicting 9 testimony. However, recognizing that circumstances  may change, the Court will deny the motion for  appointment of counsel without prejudice, and will  consider future such motions, if appropriate, as the case  progresses. Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff's motion  seeking leave to commence this action without  prepaying fees or costs (ECF No. 2) is GRANTED. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, by January 8, 2024,  plaintiff must pay an initial filing fee of $7.95. Plaintiff is  instructed to make her remittance payable to ""Clerk,  United States District Court,"" and to include upon it: (1)  her name; (2) her prison registration number; (3) this  case number; and (4) the statement that the remittance  is for an original proceeding. Plaintiff'sfailure to timely  pay the initial partial filing fee as ordered may [*14]   result in the dismissal of this case without prejudice and  without further notice. IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff's official  capacity claims against the Defendants, and Plaintiff's  claims of sexual harassment, sexual assault, sex  discrimination, and verbal abuse brought pursuant to 42  U.S.C. § 1983, are DISMISSED without prejudice. A  separate order of partial dismissal will be filed herewith. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiff's motion to  appoint counsel (ECF No. 4) is DENIED without prejudice. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of Court shall  issue process or cause process to issue upon the  Complaint as to Defendants Jessica Lemons and Officer  Unknown Bainbridge in their individual capacities.  Defendants shall be served by issuance of summons  and service by the U.S. Marshal's Service and  personally served at the address identified by 10 Plaintiff, which is the St. Francois County Sheriff's  Department, 1550 Doubet Road, Farmington, Missouri  63640. IT IS HEREBY CERTIFIED that an appeal from this  partial dismissal would not be taken in good faith. ____________________________________ RONNIE L.

"Muniz v. United States, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217781.pdf","[*1] OPINION  ______________________________:  APPEARANCES: Gregory James Irwin, Esq. Harwood Lloyd LLC 130 Main Street Hackensack, NJ 07601 Attorneys for Plaintiff Philip R. Sellinger, United States Attorney John T. Stinson, Jr., Assistant United States Attorney  Peter Vizcarrondo, Assistant United States Attorney  Office of the United States Attorney District of New Jersey 401 Market Street, Fourth Floor Camden, NJ 08101 Attorneys for Defendants HILLMAN, District Judge Plaintiff Ronaldo Muniz filed a complaint against the United States pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act  (""FTCA""), 28 U.S.C. § 2671 et seq., and Dr. Abigail Lopez de  Lasalle pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of  Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). ECF No. 1 (""Compl."").  The complaint alleged that Defendants violated the  Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual  punishment and were negligent in treating Plaintiff's  diabetes, resulting in a diabetic ulcer that led to the  amputation of one of his toes. Id. Defendants now move for dismissal of the complaint  under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and  12(b)(6). ECF No. 22. Plaintiff opposes the motion. ECF No. 29. For the reasons herein, the Court will grant the motion. The Eighth Amendment claims will be dismissed with  prejudice, and the FTCA claim will be dismissed without prejudice. I. BACKGROUND [*2]  Plaintiff has been in BOP custody since August 23,  Page 2 of 7 2011. Compl. at 11. He was diagnosed with diabetes around  that time. Id. ¶ 1. In 2014, Plaintiff ""was fully diabetic  and was on medication."" Id. He received Metformin  doses between 500 and 1000 mgs as necessary to  keep his A1C level under control. Id. ¶ 2. He received  ""soft shoe"" and ""bottom bunk"" passes from medical staff  at FCI Mariana due to the ulcers on his feet. Id. ¶¶ 3-4. Plaintiff was placed into FCI Mariana's special housing  unit (""SHU"") in September 2018. Id. ¶ 6. He was  transferred to FCI Yazoo's SHU a few months later. Id.  Plaintiff states he 2 remained in the SHU for about 10 months and was  ""practically starved."" Id. ¶ 7. As a result, his A1C level  dropped and his doctor reduced Plaintiff's Metformin  dosage to 500 mgs per day. Id. Plaintiff was transferred  to FCI Fairton, New Jersey, in July 2019. Id. ¶ 8. Defendant Lopez de Lasalle, Plaintiff's doctor at Fairton,  did not conduct a new blood test upon Plaintiff's arrival  at Fairton. Id. ¶¶ 9-10. Instead, she relied on Plaintiff's  A1C levels reported in his medical records and stopped  Plaintiff's Metformin ""as in her opinion Plaintiff was not  Diabetic."" Id. ¶ 10. Plaintiff tried [*3]  to explain the A1C  levels were low because he had not been eating in the  SHU prior to his transfer and asked to remain on  Metformin until a new blood test could be taken. Id. ¶  11. Defendant Lopez de Lasalle ""said that there was no  point for BOP to spend money for something Plaintiff did  not need."" Id. She also discontinued Plaintiff's soft shoe  and bottom bunk passes without examining Plaintiff's  feet, again stating that ""she will not let 'BOP pay for  something Plaintiff did not need.'"" Id. ¶ 14. By November 2019, ""Plaintiff's diabetes skyrocketed  and his diabetic blisters on [his] feet were full of puss  and were painful."" Id. ¶ 16. Plaintiff submitted verbal and  written complaints to medical staff. Id. ¶ 17. He was  examined on November 7, 2019 by medical staff who  took a culture and 3 prescribed daily wound care. Id. ¶ 18. ""However, on at  least 6 out of 10 days, medical staff refused the wound  care citing staff shortages and Plaintiff was sent back to  the Unit. As a result Plaintiff's wound got worse;  suppurating 24 hours a day where Plaintiff was in  extreme pain."" Id. Plaintiff requested medical attention for his wounds on  November 16 and 17, 2019 but was denied care. Id. ¶¶  19-20.  [*4] ""[O]n both of these days it was the medical who  denied Plaintiff['s] . . . requests for wound care, but the [sic]  medical falsely stated that Plaintiff had denied his  scheduled wound care."" Id. ¶ 20. On November 18, Plaintiff was examined by Dr. Magan,  who determined that Plaintiff needed to be taken to the  emergency room. Id. ¶ 21. Plaintiff was taken to Inspira  County  Hospital,  where  the  treating  physicians  immediately put Plaintiff on antibiotics after Plaintiff told  them he was diabetic. Id. ¶ 22. An MRI ""revealed that  Plaintiff's diabetic ulcers and infection had spread to the  bone and that his toe had to be [amputated]."" Id. ¶ 23.  Plaintiff's second toe on his left foot was removed on  November 21, 2019 and he was taken back to Fairton  on November 22. ECF No. 29 at 8-10. Defendant Lopez  de Lasalle restarted Plaintiff on Metformin on December  2, 2019. Compl. ¶ 25. 4 Plaintiff sent an administrative tort claim to the BOP's  Central Office in Washington, DC on October 12, 2021.  Declaration of Jonathan Kerr, ECF No. 22-2 (""Kerr  Dec."") ¶ 3. The Central Office forward the claim,  designated Administrative Tort Claim Number TRTNER- 2022-01040, to the BOP Northeast Regional Office  (""Regional [*5]  Office""). Id. The Regional Office rejected  the claim on November 22, 2021 because Plaintiff had  not signed the tort claim. ECF No. 22-2 at 11. Plaintiff  sent an amended tort claim on December 28, 2021. Id.  at 13. On January 14, 2022, the Regional Office  acknowledged receipt of the claim as of December 28,  2021 and informed Plaintiff that it had ""six months from  the date of receipt to review, consider, and adjudicate  [his] claim."" Id. at 18 (emphasis in original). Plaintiff submitted his complaint on February 15, 2022.  Compl. He also filed a motion for the appointment of pro  bono counsel. ECF No. 2. The Court permitted Plaintiff's  Bivens claim against Defendant Lopez de Lasalle and  John and Jane Does to proceed. ECF No. 4. The Court  also permitted the FTCA claim 5 against the United States to proceed. Id.1The Court also  granted Plaintiff's motion for counsel. Id.2ECF No. 4. Page 3 of 7 Defendants now move to dismiss the complaint under  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  ECF No. 22. Plaintiff opposes the motion. ECF No. 29. II. STANDARD OF REVIEW A. Standard for Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(1) A challenge to this Court's subject matter jurisdiction is  determined pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  12(b)(1). Gould Elecs., Inc. v. United States, 220 F.3d  169, 178 (3d Cir. 2000). A motion to dismiss pursuant to  Rule 12(b)(1) may attack subject-matter [*6]  jurisdiction  facially or factually. Davis v.Wells Fargo, 824 F.3d 333,  346 (3d Cir. 2016). A facial attack does not dispute the  facts as alleged in the complaint, id., and therefore  essentially applies the same standard as Rule 12(b)(6),  see Severa v. Solvay Specialty Polymers USA, LLC,  524 F. Supp. 3d 381, 389 (D.N.J. Mar. 10, 2021) (citing  In re 1 The Court dismissed Plaintiff's Bivens claim against  the United States and BOP; the FTCA claims against  the BOP, Defendant Lopez de Lasalle, and Defendants  Does; and the Rehabilitation Act claim. ECF No. 4 at 8  (citing 28 U.S.C. §§ 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)-(iii)). 2 The Court acknowledges and appreciates the  advocacy of Gregory James Irwin, Esq. of Harwood  Lloyd LLC, who accepted appointment as pro bono  counsel pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1) and this  Court's Plan for Appointment of Attorneys in Pro Se Civil  Actions, see App. H of the Local Civil Rules of the  District of New Jersey. 6 Schering Plough Corp. Intron/Temodar Consumer Class  Action, 678 F.3d 235, 243 (3d Cir. 2012)). A factual  attack, on the other hand, challenges the allegations by  which jurisdiction is asserted, permitting the Court to  weigh evidence outside the pleadings and placing a  burden of proof on Plaintiff to demonstrate that  jurisdiction indeed exists. See Davis, 824 F.3d at 346. Here, Defendants have asserted a direct factual attack,  arguing that Plaintiff failed to meet the jurisdictional  requirements for bringing tort claims against the United  States prior to filing this lawsuit. Accordingly, the Court  may consider [*7]  evidence presented by Defendants  that is outside the pleadings to determine whether it has  jurisdiction to hear Plaintiff's claims against the United  States. B. Standard for Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(6)  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6),  when deciding a motion to dismiss, a court accepts all well- pled facts as true, construes the complaint in the  plaintiff's favor, and determines ""whether, under any  reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be  entitled to relief."" Phillipsv. Cnty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d  224, 233 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks  omitted). ""Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2),  a complaint must contain a 'short and plain statement of  the claim showing that the pleader is 7 entitled to relief.'"" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 677- 78 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550  U.S. 544, 555 (2007)). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) challenge, the plaintiff's  claims must be facially plausible, meaning that the well- pled facts ""allow[] the court to draw the reasonable  inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct  alleged."" Id. at 678. The allegations must be ""more than labels and  conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of  action will not do."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. Finally,  ""[i]n deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court must  consider only the complaint, exhibits attached to the  complaint, matters of public record, as well as  undisputedly  authentic  documents  if  the  complainant's [*8]  claims are based upon these  documents."" Mayer v.Belichick, 605 F.3d 223, 230 (3d  Cir. 2010). III. DISCUSSION A. Eighth Amendment Claim Defendant Lopez de Lasalle moves for the dismissal of  the Eighth Amendment claim against her that alleges  she was deliberately indifferent to Plaintiff's serious  medical need. ECF No. 22. She argues that the Bivens  remedy does not extend to Plaintiff's allegations  because it is a ""new context."" ECF No. 22-1 at 19.  Alternatively, Defendant Lopez de Lasalle argues she is  entitled to qualified immunity and that the 8 statute of limitations for Plaintiff's claim has expired. Id.  at 30-35. Page 4 of 7 ""In Bivens, the Court held that it had authority to create 'a cause of action under the Fourth Amendment' against  federal agents who allegedly manacled the plaintiff and  threatened his family while arresting him for narcotics  violations.""

""Over the following decade, the Court twice  again fashioned new causes of action under the  Constitution - first, for a former congressional staffer's  Fifth Amendment sex-discrimination claim; and second,  for a federal prisoner's inadequate-care claim under the  Eighth Amendment."" Id. at 490-91 (citing Davis v.  Passman, 442 U.S. 228 (1979); Carlson v.Green, 446  U.S. 14 (1980)). ""In the fifty-two years since Bivens was  decided, however, the Supreme Court has pulled back  the reins to what appears to be a full stop and no  farther."" Xiv. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, 832 (3d Cir. 2023). In [*9]  2017, the Supreme Court concluded ""that  expanding the Bivensremedy is now a 'disfavored' judicial activity.""  Ziglarv. Abbasi, 582 U.S. 120, 135 (2017). See also  Hernández v.Mesa, 140 S. Ct. 735, 742 (2020) (""In both  statutory and constitutional cases, our watchword is  caution.""). ""These three cases - Bivens, Davis, and  Carlson - represent the only 9 instances in which the Court has approved of an implied  damages remedy under the Constitution itself."" Abbasi,  582 U.S. at 131. ""Indeed, in light of the changes to the Court's general  approach to recognizing implied damages remedies, it is  possible that the analysis in the Court's three Bivens  cases might have been different if they were decided  today."" Id. at 134. Abbasi""created a funnel through which plaintiffs alleging  constitutional violations by federal officials must pass.""  Alexander v. Ortiz, No. 15-6981, 2018 WL 1399302, at  *4 (D.N.J. Mar. 20, 2018). ""First, we ask whether the  case presents 'a new Bivens context' - i.e., is it  'meaningful[ly]' different from the three cases in which  the Court has implied a damages action."" Egbert, 596  U.S. at 492 (quoting Abbasi, 582 U.S. at 139-40). ""If a  case does not present a new Bivens context, the inquiry  ends there, and a Bivens remedy is available."" Shorterv.  United States, 12 F.4th 366, 372 (3d Cir. 2021). ""[I]f it is  a new context, we ask, second, whether there are  special factors' indicating that the Judiciary is at least  arguably less equipped than Congress to weigh the  costs and benefits [*10]  of allowing a damages action  to proceed."" Xi, 68 F.4th at 833 (internal quotation  marks omitted). The Supreme Court has ""observed that these steps 'often resolve to a single  question: whether there is any reason to think that  Congress might be better equipped to create a  damages remedy'; if so, [the court] 10 may not expand Bivens to cover the claim."" Id. (quoting  Abbasi, 582 U.S. at 136). 1. Plaintiff's Claim Presents a New Context Defendant Lopez de Lasalle argues Plaintiff's claims are  meaningfully different from Carlson, the most applicable  of the three Bivens remedy cases. ""Although Carlson  involved an Eighth Amendment claim, its allegations,  which centered on an alleged deliberate indifference to  plaintiff's acute asthma attack which resulted in the  inmate's death, do not resemble the claims in this case.""  ECF No. 22-1 at 21. ""In contrast to Carlson, Plaintiff  here alleges that Dr. Lopez de Lasalle discontinued his  diabetes medication, soft shoes, and low bunk pass,  and, approximately four months later, he developed a  diabetic ulcer that led to the amputation of his toe."" Id. at  22. Defendant Lopez de Lasalle argues that Plaintiff's  claims present a new context because they ""focus on a  long term and ongoing course of medical treatment  of [*11]  Plaintiff's chronic condition"" and not ""allegations  of extreme deliberate indifference to an acute medical  emergency . . . ."" Id. Plaintiff argues his claims do not present a new context  under Bivens because ""[t]he facts herein present the  very same context that Carlson did: a federal inmate  alleging that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated  by a prison doctor who failed to render proper medical  care for a chronic medical 11 condition."" ECF No. 29 at 16. He further argues that  Defendant Lopez de Lasalle has not presented any  ""reason why Carlson should be limited to acute medical  emergencies"" and that ""no court has ever suggested  that a Bivens claim is available only to an inmate who  dies because of an official's deliberate refusal to provide  life's necessities, and not to an inmate who survives  Page 5 of 7 mistreatment by the same officials, yet suffers only  serious, irreparable harm."" Id. (emphasis in original). Plaintiff's allegations are very similar to Carlson. There,  the Supreme Court recognized a Bivens cause of action  where federal prison officials failed to treat Joseph  Jones, Jr.'s chronic asthma which culminated in a fatal  attack. Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14 (1980). See also  Green v.Carlson, 581 F.2d 669, 670-71 (7th Cir. 1978)  (describing facts alleged in the complaint). Plaintiff  alleges [*12]  federal prison officials failed to provide  adequate medical care for his chronic diabetic condition.  Compl., passim. The plaintiff in Carlson alleged prison  officials did not give Jones proper medication or other  treatments that had been prescribed to him by a  physician. Green, 581 F.2d at 671. Plaintiff alleges  Defendant Lopez de Lasalle discontinued his Metformin  and other treatments, causing the ulcer on his toe and  subsequent amputation. Compl. ¶¶ 9-14. Both asthma and diabetes  are chronic medical conditions that may be fatal if left  untreated. 12 However, these similarities are not enough post-Egbert.  Egbert, 596 U.S. at 501 (""[A] plaintiff cannot justify a Bivens  extension based on 'parallel circumstances' with . . .  Carlson unless he also satisfies the 'analytic framework'  prescribed by the last four decades of intervening case  law.""). ""[T]he Supreme Court ha[s] made clear that the  category of 'new contexts' is 'broad,' and this threshold test is 'easily  satisfied.'"" Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, 833 (3d Cir.  2023) (quoting Hernández v. Mesa, 140 S. Ct. 735, 743  (2020); Abbasi, 582 U.S. at 139). ""A context may be regarded as new if  it is different in any 'meaningful way' from the three  contexts where the Court has recognized a Bivens  remedy, and even 'a modest extension is still an  extension.'"" Id. (quoting Abbasi, 582 U.S. at 139, 142).  ""[T]he Carlson Court extended [*13]  an implied cause  of action for money damages pursuant to Bivens where  the alleged deliberate indifference of prison officials was  most serious; it resulted in a fatality of a prisoner.""  Peguero  v.Quay,  No.  1:22-CV-00057,  2023  WL  2410882, at *10 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 8, 2023) (declining to  extend Bivens remedy to claim of chronic low back  pain). See also Washington v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons,  No. CV 5:16-3913-BHH, 2022 WL 3701577, at *5  (D.S.C. Aug. 26, 2022) (""Plaintiff's Bivens claims do not  involve a medical emergency, as did Carlson, but rather  focus on a long term and ongoing course of medical  treatment of Plaintiff's chronic, non- 13 fatal condition.""). Although Plaintiff ""may have been  injured, the severity of his injuries have not proven to be  fatal."" Hurst v. Dayton, No. 22-CV-00171-DKW-RT, 2023 WL  2526460, at *5 (D. Haw. Mar. 15, 2023) (declining to  extend Bivens remedy to medical conditions brought on  by prison riot), appeal filed, No. 23-15523 (9th Cir. Apr.  5, 2023). While the Court does not minimize Plaintiff's injuries,  they are meaningfully different from the medical  emergency faced by the inmate in Carlson that  ultimately resulted in Jones' death. See Dongarra v.  Smith, 27 F.4th 174, 180-81 (3d Cir. 2022) (""Carlson  extended Bivens to remedy prison officers' failure to  give medical assistance. But there, the prisoner died  because of the officers' neglect. Put differently, the risk  that the prison officer ignored (death from not treating  the prisoner's chronic asthma) in fact resulted.""). ""This  difference [*14]  is significant for multiple reasons,  including that administrative and injunctive relief would  have a completely different application to Plaintiff's  claims than to the claims in Carlson . . . ."" Washington,  2022 WL 3701577, at *5. Therefore, Plaintiff's claim  presents a new Bivens context, and the Court must  proceed to the second step of review. 2. Special Factors Counsel Against Extending Bivens Step two requires the Court to consider ""whether special factors counsel hesitation in extending a Bivens  remedy."" Xi, 14 68 F.4th at 836 (cleaned up). ""The Bivens inquiry does  not invite federal courts to independently assess the  costs and benefits of implying a cause of action. A court  faces only one question: whether there is any rational  reason (even one) to think that Congress is better suited  to 'weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages  action to proceed.'"" Egbert, 596 U.S. at 496 (quoting  Abbasi, 582 U.S. at 136). ""If there is even a single  'reason to pause before applying Bivens in a new  Page 6 of 7 context,' a court may not recognize a Bivens remedy.""  Id. at 492 (quoting Hernández, 140 S. Ct. at 743). See  also Graber v.Doe II, 59 F.4th 603, 609 (3d Cir. 2023). The Supreme Court has held that ""a court may not  fashion a Bivens remedy if Congress already has provided, or has  authorized the Executive to provide, 'an alternative  remedial structure.'"" Egbert, 596 U.S. at 495 (quoting  Abbasi, 582 U.S. at 137). The [*15]  Supreme Court has  held that the BOP's administrative remedy program  satisfies this requirement. Id. at 497 (citing Corr. Servs.  Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 74 (2001)).3See also  Bulger v. Hurwitz, 62 F.4th 127, 140-41 (4th Cir. 2023)  (finding that BOP's administrative remedy is a sufficient  ""alternative remedial structure"" in special factors 3Plaintiff used the administrative remedy program, and  the BOP denied his requests for an investigation into his  medical care. ECF No. 1-2 at 82. 15 analysis); Silva v. United States, 45 F.4th 1134, 1141  (10th Cir. 2022) (same). It is irrelevant that monetary  damages are not available through the BOP's program.  ""So long as Congress or the Executive has created a  remedial process that it finds sufficient to secure an  adequate level of deterrence, the courts cannot second- guess that calibration by superimposing a Bivens  remedy."" Egbert, 596 U.S. at 498. The Court  ""recognize[s] this remedial scheme might prove to be  cold comfort to [Plaintiff], who seeks an adversarial  process and monetary damages, but the Supreme Court  has declared that the government's procedures need  not be as effective as an individual damages remedy to  foreclose Bivens relief."" Barry v. Anderson, et al., No.  22-3098, 2023 WL 8449246, at *4 (3d Cir. Dec. 6,  2023). Accordingly,  the  Court  must  dismiss  Plaintiff's  constitutional claims against Defendant Lopez de  Lasalle as Bivens does not afford him a remedy absent  Congressional  action.  Because  Plaintiff's  Eighth  Amendment claims [*16]  may not proceed under  Bivens, the Court will dismiss the claims against the  John and Jane Doe defendants, who have not been  identified or served, as well.4 4 The Court need not address Defendant Lopez de  Lasalle's qualified immunity or statute of limitations  arguments since it is dismissing the Eighth Amendment  claims for lack of a Bivens remedy. 16 B. Federal Tort Claims Act Defendant United States argues the Court lacks  jurisdiction over Plaintiff's FTCA claims as Plaintiff did  not exhaust his administrative remedies before filing  suit. ECF No. 22-1 at 35. Plaintiff responds that ""[t]he purpose of the FTCA claim  requirement was fulfilled"" when the BOP's Regional  Office received the unsigned notice of Plaintiff's claim.  ECF No. 29 at 35. ""If the agency intended to negotiate a  settlement with Plaintiff Muniz, it had both its allegations and monetary  demand at that point."" Id. ""The FTCA waives sovereign immunity and grants  district courts jurisdiction over tort claims against the  United States 'under circumstances where the United States, if a  private person, would be liable to the claimant in  accordance with the law of the place where the act or  omission occurred.'"" GouldElecs. Inc. v. United States,  220 F.3d 169, 179 (3d Cir. 2000) (quoting 28 U.S.C. §  1346(b)(1)) (emphasis omitted), modified [*17]  onother  grounds by Simon v. United States, 341 F.3d 193 (3d  Cir. 2003). This waiver of sovereign immunity is limited,  however. ""Because the Federal Tort Claims Act constitutes a  waiver of sovereign immunity, the Act's established  procedures have been strictly construed."" Livera v. First  Nat'l State Bank of N.J., 879 F.2d 1186, 1194 (3d Cir.  1989). 17 The FTCA ""provides that an 'action shall not be  instituted upon a claim against the United States for  money damages' unless the claimant  has first  exhausted his administrative remedies."" McNeil v. United States, 508 U.S. 106, 107 (1993)  (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a)). To exhaust his  administrative remedies, a plaintiff suing under the  FTCA must present the offending agency with notice of  the claim, including a ""sum certain"" demand for  monetary damages. White-Squire v. U.S. Postal Serv.,  592 F.3d 453, 457 (3d Cir. 2010). Exhaustion occurs  when either the agency denies the claim or six months  have passed without a written denial of the claim. 28  U.S.C. § 2675(a). ""This requirement is jurisdictional and  Page 7 of 7 cannot be waived."" Shelton v.Bledsoe, 775 F.3d 554,  569 (3d Cir. 2015). The exhaustion requirement applies  to all FTCA plaintiffs regardless of their pro se or  incarcerated status. Id.; Wadhwa v. Nicholson, 367 F.  App'x 322, 325 n.5 (3d Cir. 2010). The BOP Regional Office received Administrative Tort  Claim Number TRTNER-2022-01040 on December 28,  2021. ECF No. 22-2 at 18. The claim receipt sent to Plaintiff informed him that  the Regional Office had ""six months from the date of receipt  to review, consider, and adjudicate [his] claim."" [*18]  Id.  (emphasis in original). This review period would have  ended June 28, 2022; however, Plaintiff filed this  complaint on February 15, 2022. Compl., passim.  Plaintiff did not complete the exhaustion 18 process before filing the complaint, so the Court lacks  jurisdiction over Plaintiff's FTCA claim. The fact that the six-month period expired and the  exhaustion process was completed during the pendency  of this lawsuit does not cure the jurisdictional  error.5""McNeil clarified that administrative exhaustion  must be complete before instituting suit, and that this  procedural rule is a requirement to which all litigants  must adhere."" Wadhwa, 367 F. App'x at 325 n.5  (emphasis in original). ""[A]dministrative exhaustion must  be complete before a party may institute a civil action in District Court under the FTCA."" Id. at 325 (emphasis in  original). ""[T]he subsequent filing and denial of a claim  after suit has been commenced does not overcome the  failure  to  exhaust  administrative  remedies  and  premature filing of the complaint."" Priovolos v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 686 F. App'x  150, 152 (3d Cir. 2017). See also McNeil, 508 U.S. at  111-12 (holding that a court is without jurisdiction to rule  on a prematurely filed action even if an agency denies  the related administrative claim soon after the federal  lawsuit is filed); Accolla v. U.S.Gov't, 369 F. App'x 408,  410 (3d Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (holding [*19]  that ""because [plaintiff] filed his FTCA  action in federal court before"" he filed an amendment  with the agency ""and 5As of June 6, 2023, ""Plaintiff Muniz has not received a  final decision on his claim."" ECF No. 29 at 35. 19 before the expiration of the appropriate six month  period, the District Court was without jurisdiction to rule  on the FTCA claim""). The Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiff's FTCA claims  because Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit before the FTCA  exhaustion process was complete. The Court will  dismiss the FTCA claim without prejudice because the  Supreme Court has held that the filing dates under the  FTCA are not jurisdictional, unlike the exhaustion  requirement, and are subject to equitable tolling.

Affirmed  with directions to correct the sentencing minute orders  and abstracts of judgment. Patricia L. Brisbois, under appointment by the Court of  Appeal, for Defendant and Appellant. Rob Bonta, Attorney General, Lance E. Winters, Chief  Assistant Attorney General, Charles C. Ragland,  Assistant Attorney General, and Christopher P. Beesley  and Britton B. Lacy, Deputy Attorneys General, for  Plaintiff and Respondent. INTRODUCTION Jose De Jesus Hernandez was convicted of sexually  abusing his stepdaughter and two nieces over a period  of years and was initially sentenced to serve a prison  term of 30 years to life, consecutive to 8 years and 8  months. In his first appeal, Hernandez successfully  argued, and the People conceded, that the trial court  imposed an unauthorized sentence of 15-years-to-life  for his conviction on count 4 (continuous sexual abuse  of a child in violation of Penal Code1section 288.5,  subd. (a)) because Hernandez committed that offense  from September 1996 through September 2001, before  the Legislature amended section 667.61, subdivision (c)  to add section 288.5 as a One Strike offense. The  matter was remanded for resentencing on count 4 without application of the [*2]  One Strike Law (  667.61) and for correction of clerical errors in the  sentencing minute order and abstracts of judgment.  (See People v. Hernandez (Sept. 20, 2022, D080015)  [nonpub. opn.] (Hernandez).) In this second appeal, Hernandez claims the sentence  on count 4 (mid-term of 12 years, consecutive) must  again be reversed and also seeks the correction of trial  court records as directed in Hernandez as well as  subsequent court records. After initially claiming the  resentencing violated ex post facto prohibitions based  on an incomplete and inaccurate legislative history of  section 667.6, Hernandez now concedes the trial court  had discretion and the authority to impose the sentence  on count 4 pursuant to the applicable version of section  667.6, but he raises two additional arguments in his  supplemental letter brief: (1) the record does not clearly  show the trial court understood the applicable version of  section 667.6 did not mandate a full term consecutive  sentence, and (2) the trial court failed to  1 All further statutory references are to the Penal Code.   2  provide a statement of reasons for its election to  sentence Hernandez under section 667.6 in lieu of  section 1170.1. Page 2 of 5 We reject Hernandez's challenges to the sentence and  affirm the trial court's judgment with directions [*3]  for  the correction of the trial court record. RELEVANT BACKGROUND After a jury convicted Hernandez on all four counts of  child sexual abuse in 2021, the trial court sentenced him  to the upper term of 8 years on count 3, a consecutive  term of 8 months on count 2 (one-third of the midterm),  and consecutive sentences of 15 years to life on counts  1 and 4, for a total indeterminate term of 30 years to life.  Following remand in Hernandez, the trial court  scheduled a resentencing hearing for February 1, 2023,  where the trial court imposed an indeterminate prison  term of 15 years to life and a determinate term of 18  years and 8 months to be followed by a lifetime period  of parole with a total credit of 2,010 days. On count 4,  Hernandez was sentenced to the midterm of 12 years,  consecutive, for his continuous sexual abuse of Jane  Doe 3 in violation of section 288.5, subdivision (a) from  September 1996 through September 2001. Hernandez  timely appealed. In this second appeal, Hernandez initially argued that  the sentence on count 4 violated ex post facto  prohibitions based on the erroneous assumption that  section 288.5 had not been added to section 667.6 as  an offense for which a full-term consecutive sentence  was permitted until 2006. The People conceded [*4]   error despite this faulty premise, and both parties  agreed the matter should be remanded for the  correction of the February 1, 2023 resentencing minute  order and the February 6, 2023 abstracts of judgment in  addition to corrections to previous court records as  directed in Hernandez. On October 23, 2023, we issued an order requesting  supplemental briefing to address Assembly Bill 2212  (Stats. 1989, ch. 1402, 4, 7) 3 whereby  the  Legislature  enacted  section  288.5  (continuous sexual abuse) and amended Penal Code  section 667.6, subdivision (c), to include Penal Code  section 288.5 as an offense that could trigger an  increased prison term. Both parties acknowledged in  their respective supplemental letter briefs that the  Legislature had amended section 667.6 to include  continuous sexual abuse of a child in violation of section  288.5 prior to the commission of the count 4 offense,  and that the trial court had discretion to impose a full- term consecutive sentence. However, Hernandez  maintains reversal is still warranted. As discussed below, we conclude (1) the trial court  properly exercised its discretion to impose a lawful  sentence, and (2) Hernandez forfeited his claim that the  trial court failed to provide a statement of reasons for  sentencing him pursuant to section 667.6 in lieu of  section 1170.1. We therefore affirm the judgment and  direct the [*5]  trial court to correct the relevant trial  court records. DISCUSSION A. The Applicable Version of Penal Code Section 667.6.  Section 667.6 was enacted by the Legislature in 1979 to  provide longer prison terms for certain sex offenders  than otherwise permitted under section 1170.1. (Stats.  1979, ch. 944, 10, p. 3258.) In 1989, the Legislature  enacted section 288.5 (continuous sexual abuse) and  amended Penal Code section 667.6, subdivision (c), to  include Penal Code section 288.5 as an offense that  could trigger an increased prison term. (Stats. 1989, ch.  1402,  7.) Subdivision (c) of the applicable version of section  667.6, which was in effect from 1996 through 2001  when Hernandez committed the count 4 offense, states  in part: ""In lieu of the term provided in Section 1170.1, a  full, 4 separate, and consecutive term may be imposed for  each violation of . . . Section 288.5 . . . . If the term is imposed  consecutively pursuant to this subdivision, it shall be  served consecutively to any other term of imprisonment,  and shall commence from the time the person would  otherwise have been released from imprisonment. The  term shall not be included in any determination pursuant  to Section 1170.1. Any other term imposed subsequent  to that term shall not be merged therein but shall  commence at the time the person otherwise would have  been released from prison."" In 2006, the Legislature made substantive and  organizational amendments to section 667.6. (Stats.  2006, ch. 337, 32.) In the current version of the  statute, [*6]  ""[c]ontinuous sexual abuse of a child, in  violation of Section 288.5"" is listed in subdivision (e)(6)  as one of the offenses for which the trial court ""shall""  Page 3 of 5 impose ""[a] full, separate, and consecutive term"" for  each violation of section 288.5. ( 667.6, subd. (e)(6).) B. The Trial Court Was Fully Aware of the Scope of its  Discretion. Although it is now undisputed that the trial  court had discretion to impose a full, separate, and consecutive term for count  4 pursuant to subdivision (c) of the operative version of  section 667.6, Hernandez argues in his supplemental  letter brief that the sentence is still subject to reversal  because it is unclear from the record whether the trial  court mistakenly relied on the current version of section  667.6, which mandates a full term consecutive sentence  for violations of section 288.5, and posits the trial court  did not realize it had discretion to not impose a full term  consecutive sentence. ""The general rule is that a trial court is presumed to  have been aware of and followed the applicable law.""  (People v. Mosley (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 489, 496.) Yet,  when a sentencing court was unaware of the full scope  of its 5 discretionary powers at the time the defendant was  sentenced, ""the appropriate remedy is to remand for  resentencing unless the record 'clearly indicate[s]' that  the trial court would have reached the [*7]  same  conclusion 'even if it had been aware that it had such  discretion.' "" (People v. Gutierrez (2014) 58 Cal.4th  1354, 1391.) Our review of the record reveals the trial court was fully  aware of its discretionary power to impose either a  concurrent or consecutive sentence despite references  to subdivision (e)(6) of the current version of the statute  during the resentencing hearing. Before pronouncing  the sentence, the trial court unequivocally stated: ""The  Court acknowledges that it has discretion to sentence  concurrent. But it's choosing to sentence consecutive in  this  case.""  (Italics  added.)  This  express  acknowledgment by the trial court of its authority to  sentence  Hernandez  either  concurrently  or  consecutively makes clear the trial court exercised  informed discretion when it resentenced Hernandez. Furthermore, the record shows the trial court would  have sentenced Hernandez consecutively in any event.  In addition to informing the parties that it intended to  impose the maximum sentence possible at the initial  sentencing hearing (see Hernandez, supra, D080015),  the trial court informed the parties of its intention to  sentence Hernandez consecutively in chambers prior to  the resentencing hearing and repeated its intention  twice prior to its pronouncement [*8]  of the sentence.  On this record, we conclude the trial court properly  exercised its discretion when it imposed a consecutive  sentence on count 4 in accordance with the applicable  version of section 667.6. Nor was there any violation of state or federal ex post  facto clauses. (See People v. Simmons (2012) 210  Cal.App.4th 778, 796-797.) The initial ex post facto  argument raised in Hernandez's opening brief was  based on the 6 erroneous  premise  that  ""a  full-term  consecutive  sentence for the violation of section 288.5, subdivision  (a) in count 4 was not available before 2006"" and  therefore fatally flawed. Hernandez attempted to  resurrect the ex post facto argument in his supplemental  letter brief by claiming ""the trial court expressly relied on  a later version of 667.6"" that was not in effect at the time  the offense in count 4 was committed. Not only is this  argument belied by the record as previously discussed,  but Respondent aptly argues that no ex post facto  violation occurred ""because section 667.6 did, in fact,  provide an increased penalty for continuous sexual  abuse at the time appellant committed his continuing  offense[.]"" C. Hernandez Forfeited any Error Based on a Deficient  Statement ofReasons for Sentencing Pursuant to  Section 667.6. Prior to its pronouncement of the sentence, the trial  court offered the following statement of [*9]  reasons for  imposing consecutive terms in this case: ""I find that the  crimes  and  their  objectives  were  predominantly  independent of each other. The crimes involved  separate acts of violence, or threats of violence, and the  crimes were committed at different times with separate places rather than being committed so closely in time  and place as to indicate a single period of aberrant  behavior. Certainly from the testimony at trial, this is not  a case of aberrant behavior. I do find that any one of  these factors by itself justifies the imposition of  consecutive sentences or consecutive terms in this  case."" The trial court informed the parties of the sentence it  intended to impose at a chambers conference prior to  the  resentencing  hearing  and  provided  counsel  Page 4 of 5 adequate opportunity to object at the hearing both  before and after it stated its reasons and pronounced  the sentence. Defense counsel did not raise any  objection or seek a separate statement of reasons  regarding 7 the trial court's election to sentence Hernandez pursuant  to section 667.6 in lieu of section 1170.1. Relying on People v. Belmontes (1983) 34 Cal.3d 335,  347-348, Hernandez argues for the first time in his  supplemental brief that the trial court failed to include a  statement of reasons for electing [*10]  to sentence him  under section 667.6 instead of section 1170.1. By failing  to object on this ground in the trial court, Hernandez  forfeited the issue on appeal. (See People v. Scott  (2015) 61 Cal.4th 363, 406.) D. Clerical Errors Must be Corrected. Hernandez provided the following directions for the  correction of various clerical errors in the sentencing  minute order and abstracts of judgment: At sentencing, the trial court imposed three separate  victim restitution orders under section 1202.4 in the  amounts of $2,654.95, $375, and $225, for a total of  $3,254.95 in victim restitution. However, the sentencing  minute order and indeterminate abstract of judgment  state that Hernandez is to pay victim restitution in four  specific amounts: $3,254.95, $2,654.95, $375, and  $225. Both parties agree the first enumerated amount of  $3,254.95, which is the total of the other three amounts  of victim restitution when combined, is erroneous.  Accordingly,  the  sentencing  minute  order  and  indeterminate abstract of judgment shall be corrected to  comport with the oral pronouncement of judgment.  [Citation.] Additionally,  the  indeterminate  and  determinate  abstracts of judgment incorrectly state 2010 as the year  Hernandez committed all of his crimes. Based on the  charges in the information, evidence [*11]  at trial, jury  instructions, and verdicts, the parties agree count 1  occurred between 2010 to 2016; count 2 occurred  between 2016 to 2017, count 3 occurred between 1994  to 1995, and count 4 occurred between 8 1996 to 2001. The abstracts of judgment shall be  corrected accordingly. [Citation.] At the outset of the resentencing hearing following  remand, the trial court referred to the remittitur issued in  Hernandez, acknowledged that the corrections would be  made as directed, and requested ""the clerk's office""  make the corrections. However, it appears the trial court  clerk has yet to make the corrections as previously  directed, and the parties also correctly observed that the  February 1, 2023 minute order and the February 6,  2023 abstracts of judgment also require correction. On February 1, 2023, the trial court made the following  restitution order: ""The Court orders restitution - orders  the defendant to pay restitution under 1202.4 to be  collected by the Department of Corrections and  Rehabilitation  as  follows:  $2,654.95  to  Victim  Compensation Board, case number A17[-]6655906;  $375 to Victim Compensation Board, case number  A17[-]6667869; and $225 to Victim Compensation  Board, case number A17[-] [*12]  6667919. The Court  will continue to reserve on victim restitution."" The  February 1, 2023 minute order again separately lists the  ""$3,254.95"" total to be collected in addition to the  separate amounts comprising the total. The February 6,  2023 indeterminate and determinate abstracts of  judgment similarly reflect the restitution error as well as  the errors identified in Hernandez. The trial court must ensure the prompt correction of  these records. DISPOSITION The February 1, 2023 sentence is affirmed. The trial  court is directed to correct the trial court records as  stated in this opinion, including the ""**Corrected** [¶] Minute Order"" dated September 20,  2021, page 2, and the minute order dated February 1,  2023, page 2, to remove ""$3,254.95."" The 9 trial court is instructed to issue amended abstracts of  judgment reflecting the sentence entered on February 1,  2023, correcting the years the count 4 crimes were  committed (1996-2001), and removing ""$3,254.95"" from  the restitution amounts listed. The trial court shall  forward the amended abstracts of judgment to the  California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. CASTILLO, J. WE CONCUR: DO, Acting P. J. Page 5 of 5 BUCHANAN, J. 10"
"People v. Harms, 2023 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 7288.pdf","[*1] A jury convicted defendant Gregory Allen Harms of  sexual penetration with force or violence, unlawful  assault with intent to commit rape, and unlawful sexual  penetration after administration of an anesthetic, based  on his sexual assault of two women, C. and Y., on  different occasions while he was assigned to care for  them as a nurse. The trial court sentenced him to state  prison for a determinate term of 14 years and an  indeterminate term of 15 years to life. Defendant now contends (1) the trial court should have  instructed the jury on sexual battery as a lesser included  offense, and (2) the jury and not the trial court should  have determined whether the crimes alleged in counts 1  and 2 occurred on separate occasions for the purposes  of sentencing. Finding no merit in the contentions, we  will affirm the judgment. 1 BACKGROUND A As the result of a car accident, C. was hospitalized with  serious injuries. She had a breathing tube and a  traumatic brain injury. In January 2019, defendant was  assigned to care for her as her nurse. On one occasion  he told her she was ""not being a good girl,"" closed the  curtain around her bed, flipped her on her stomach, and  inserted his finger into her vagina at [*2]  least 10 times.  He repeatedly called her a ""bad girl"" and rubbed his  crotch area against her buttocks and back. He flipped C.  over so she was lying on her back and continued to  insert his finger into her vagina. He tried to insert his  penis into her vagina but he was unsuccessful. During  the assault defendant bound C.'s wrist to the bed with  an elastic therapy band. After five minutes, he stopped  and rearranged C. in her bed. Soon after, another health care provider entered C.'s  room and C. informed the provider about the assault.  Later that day, a physician performed a sexual assault  examination on C. During the exam, C. complained of  anal pain, and the examining physician noticed an  actively bleeding laceration on C.'s anus. C.'s genitals  appeared normal, but the physician testified this is not  unusual even when a sexual assault has occurred. A  swab of C.'s pubic area found DNA that was likely  defendant's. B In March 2011, Y. had surgery at a local surgery center  and defendant was one of the nurses assigned to care  for her. She awoke after the surgery when she felt a  finger in her vagina. She fell back asleep but awoke  again feeling a mouth on her lips. She tried to push the  person [*3]  away, whom she thought was defendant,  and fell back asleep. When she woke up fully, her  hospital gown was pulled up to her midsection and her  underwear was rolled up and misaligned. Defendant  Page 2 of 4 escorted her to the bathroom so she could get dressed.  He stood outside and offered help, but she refused. 2 When Y. left the recovery area, she went to the front  office and told the receptionists what happened. She  reported the incident to the police and identified  defendant to a detective. C The jury found defendant guilty of penetration of C. with  force or violence (Pen. Code, § 289, subd. (a)(1)1 -- count 1), unlawful  assault of C. with intent to commit rape (§ 220, subd. (a)  -- count 2), and unlawful penetration of Y.'s genitals  after Y. was  administered  an  intoxicating  substance  or  anesthetic or controlled substance (§ 289, subd. (e) -- count 6).2 As to count 1, the jury  found true that defendant engaged in the tying or  binding of C. during the offense. (§ 667.61, subd.  (e)(5).) As to each count, the jury found true that the  offense involved great bodily harm or other acts  disclosing a high degree of cruelty, viciousness, or  callousness (§ 1170; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.421(a)(1)),3 that the offense involved a  particularly vulnerable victim (§ 1170; rule 4.421(a)(3)), that the crime was carried out  with planning, sophistication, [*4]  or professionalism (§  1170; rule 4.421(a)(8)), and that defendant took  advantage of a position of trust or confidence (§ 1170;  rule 4.421(a)(11)). The jury further found true that the  crimes involved multiple victims on separate occasions  (§ 667.6, subd. (d); rule 4.426(a)(1), (a)(2), (b)) and were committed at  different times and separate places (rule 4.425(a)(1)- (a)(3)). The trial court sentenced defendant as follows: 15 years  to life in prison on the count 1 conviction of penetration  by force or violence (§§ 289, subd. (a), 667.61, 1  Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal  Code. 2  The jury could not reach a verdict on three counts  involving a third alleged victim and the trial court  dismissed the counts, which are not at issue here. 3  Undesignated rule references are to the California  Rules of Court. 3 subd. (e)(5)), a consecutive upper term of eight years on  the count 6 conviction of unlawful penetration after  administration of an anesthetic (§ 289, subd. (e)), and a  consecutive six years on the count 2 conviction of  unlawful assault with intent to commit rape (§§ 220,  667.6, subd. (d)). The trial court said it was not limited  by section 654 with respect to count 2 because that  offense was a separate crime and a separate time.  (Rule 4.425(a)(1)-(a)(3).) DISCUSSION I Defendant contends the trial court erred in failing to  instruct the jury sua sponte on sexual battery, which he  contends is [*5]  a lesser included offense of forcible  sexual penetration. In support of his argument,  defendant relies on the expanded accusatory pleading  test announced in People v. Ortega (2015) 240  Cal.App.4th 956 (Ortega). In the alternative, defendant argues his constitutional  rights were violated by the failure to give the instruction,  and his counsel was ineffective in failing to request such  an instruction. A trial court ""has a sua sponte duty to instruct on all  elements of an offense and on the general principles of  law governing a case."" (People v. Singh (2019) 42  Cal.App.5th 175, 183.) This duty includes "" 'instruct[ing]  on a lesser offense necessarily included in the charged  offense if there is substantial evidence the defendant is  guilty only of the lesser.' "" (People v. Alvarez (2019) 32  Cal.App.5th 781, 786 (Alvarez).) ""There are two tests for determining whether an  uncharged crime is a lesser included offense. 'Under the  elements test, a court determines whether, as a matter  of law, the statutory definition of the greater offense  necessarily includes the lesser offense.' [Citation.] This test is satisfied if ' ""all legal elements of  the lesser offense are also elements of the greater."" '  [Citation.] 'Under the accusatory pleading test, a court  Page 3 of 4 reviews the accusatory pleading to determine whether  the facts actually alleged include 4 all of the [*6]  elements of the uncharged lesser offense;  if it does, then the latter is necessarily included in the  former.' "" (Alvarez, supra, 32 Cal.App.5th at p. 786.) Sexual battery is not a lesser included offense of  forcible sexual penetration under the elements test  because the forcible penetration statute and the sexual  battery statute encompass different types of contact.  While the forcible penetration statute encompasses  contact by ""any foreign object,"" the sexual battery  statute only encompasses touching by the offender's  body. (§§ 289, subd. (k)(1), 243.4; see also Ortega,  supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at p. 967.) As for the accusatory pleading test, here the pleading  tracked the statutory language of section 289,  subdivision (a)(1) and alleged that defendant ""did  unlawfully cause the penetration of the genital opening  of [C.], for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification,  and abuse by a foreign object, substance, instrument  and device, and by an unknown object, accomplished  by force, violence, duress, menace and fear of  immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim.""4  When ""the accusatory pleading incorporates the  statutory definition of the charged offense without  referring to the particular facts, a reviewing court must  rely on the statutory elements to determine if there is a  lesser included offense."" (People v. Robinson (2016) 63  Cal.4th 200, 207.) Defendant [*7]  nevertheless relies on Ortega and urges  us to look beyond the accusatory pleading. Like here,  the defendant in Ortega was charged with forcible  sexual penetration based on evidence of digital  penetration. (Ortega, supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at pp. 960- 961.) On appeal, he argued the trial court should have  instructed jurors that sexual battery was a lesser  included  offense  of  forcible  sexual  penetration.  According to 4 Section 289, subdivision (a)(1)(A) provides: ""Any  person who commits an act of sexual penetration when  the act is accomplished against the victim's will by  means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of  immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or  another person shall be punished by imprisonment in  the state prison for three, six, or eight years."" 5 the defendant, although it was not a lesser included  offense under the elements test, it was such under an  ""expanded accusatory pleading test."" (Id. at p. 967.) The  appellate court agreed that the ""accusatory pleading  cannot be examined in isolation"" and found that it also  must consider the evidence adduced during the  preliminary hearing, which would have indicated that  defendant was only being charged with forcible sexual  penetration based on his unlawful touching of the victim  with his finger. (Id. at pp. 968-969.) According to [*8]   the appellate court, this expanded analysis comported  with a defendant's due process rights because he  ""cannot be prosecuted for an offense not shown at the  preliminary hearing to have been committed."" (Id. at p.  969.) We decline to apply an expanded accusatory pleading  test. As the court explained in Alvarez, the California  Supreme Court made clear in People v. Montoya (2004) 33 Cal.4th 1031, 1036, that we consider only the  pleading for the greater offense when analyzing the  accusatory  pleading  test.  (Alvarez,  supra,  32  Cal.App.5th at p. 787; see also People v. Smith (2013) 57 Cal.4th 232, 244  [further noting the test ""does not require or depend on  an examination of the evidence adduced at trial""].) Other  appellate courts have agreed with Alvarez and  disagreed with Ortega. (People v. Macias (2018) 26  Cal.App.5th 957, 964 [rejecting Ortega as contrary to  Montoya]; People v. Munoz (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 143, 156-158 [accord].) Defendant's contentions, including that his counsel was  ineffective in this regard, are without merit. (See People  v. Price (1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 387 [no ineffective  assistance where a reasonably competent attorney  might well have determined that an objection would  have been futile in light of existing precedent].) II Defendant also contends the jury and not the trial court  should have determined whether the crimes alleged in  counts 1 and 2 occurred on separate occasions for the  purposes of sentencing. Specifically, he claims [*9]  the  trial court violated his Sixth Amendment rights and  engaged in improper judicial factfinding under Aprendi v.  New 6 Page 4 of 4 Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435] (Aprendi)  when it found that defendant's crimes were committed  on separate occasions within the meaning of section  667.6, subdivision (d) and proceeded to impose a  consecutive sentence on count 2. After defendant filed his opening brief, the California  Supreme Court explained that ""the rule of Aprendi and  [Alleyne v. United States (2013) 570 U.S. 99 [186  L.Ed.2d 314]] does not apply to section 667.6[,  subdivision ](d)."" (People v. Catarino (2023) 14 Cal.5th  748, 750.) In other words, section 667.6, subdivision (d)  does not violate the Sixth Amendment in requiring that a  sentencing court impose full, separate, and consecutive  terms for certain sex crimes if it finds certain facts.  (Catarino, at p. 750.) Defendant's arguments lack merit. DISPOSITION The judgment is affirmed. /S/  MAURO, Acting P. J.

People v. L.G..pdf,"[*429]  [**419]   Toko Serita, J. Defendant moves to vacate her plea of guilty to  disorderly conduct (Penal Law § 240.20) under docket  number 2000QN056893 and the judgment of conviction  and sentence rendered on November 14, 2000, and her  plea of guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the  fourth degree (Penal Law § 265.01) under docket  number 2003QN050066 and the judgment of conviction  and sentence rendered on November 7, 2003, pursuant  to Criminal Procedure Law § 440.10 (1) (h) and (i). The Parties' Contentions Defendant asserts that her prior convictions are directly  related to her arrests for prostitution offenses, and that  because she is a victim of human trafficking, those  convictions must be vacated and the cases dismissed.  Defendant  also  argues  that  she  was  denied  effective [****2]  assistance of counsel when she  pleaded guilty in each case. The People do not contest the factual allegations  presented by defendant. Rather, they argue that her  second conviction  [***2] for criminal possession of a  weapon should not be vacated because it is not a  prostitution-related charge, and as a matter of public  policy, CPL 440.10 should not grant greater protection  to human trafficking victims in weapons cases. They  also assert that defendant failed to seek relief under  CPL 440.10 with due diligence [*430]  because she filed  her motion three years after she ceased to fear her  trafficker in 2008, and a year after CPL 440.10 was  amended in 2010 to allow relief for human trafficking  victims (see CPL 440.10 [1] [i]). Procedural History Defendant L.G. was arraigned on November 14, 2000      under docket number 2000QN056893 under an alias  and charged with prostitution (Penal Law § 230.00).  Defendant pleaded guilty on that date to disorderly  conduct (Penal Law § 240.20) and was sentenced to a  conditional discharge. Subsequently, on November 7, 2003 defendant was  arraigned  under  docket  number  2003QN050066,   [***3] again, under an alias and charged with loitering  for the purpose of engaging in a prostitution offense  (Penal Law § 240.37 [3]), criminal possession of a  weapon in the fourth degree (Penal Law § 265.01 [1])  and  disorderly  conduct  (Penal  Law  §  240.20  [5]). [**420]  On November 7, 2003 defendant pleaded  guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth  degree and was sentenced to three years of probation.  Thereafter, on May 5, 2004, defendant was declared  delinquent for violating the conditions of her probation.  On November 28, 2006 defendant was convicted of  violation of probation and sentenced to 10 days'  imprisonment. I. Factual Background The People do not contest defendant's factual  averments. Accordingly, the court accepts as true the  following facts set out in defendant's moving papers: Defendant, ""L.G.,"" was forced into prostitution when she  was only 12 years old. She was born in 1986 in  Brooklyn, New York, and lived with her grandmother  until she was eight years old. While living with her  grandmother, L.G. was sexually abused by an uncle, but  she never received any medical attention even though  the Administration for Children's Services was involved  and  informed  about  the  abuse.  Following  her  grandmother's death, L.G. was placed into foster care  and  [***4] over the next few years, she was bounced  around different foster homes until she was 12 years  old, when something happened that changed her life.  [*431]   There was a strip club across the street from  where she lived with a foster family in Brownsville,  Brooklyn. One day she was approached by a man in  this thirties, ""A."" He took her to a house where six other  underage girls were living. Each of [****3]  these girls  had a bed in a different room, and ""A,"" who was very       41 Misc. 3d 428, *428; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **418; 2013 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3605, ***1; 2013 NY Slip Op 23276, ****1 Page 5 of 11 nice to her at first, told her that if she stayed with him,  she would not have to go back to her foster family. He  kept her there and would not permit her to return to her  foster home. He explained the rules of the ""game"" to  her, and although she didn't understand it at the time,  ""A"" was preparing her to become a prostitute. After several weeks, ""A"" sent her out  [***5] to a ""track""  on Pennsylvania Avenue in Brooklyn, accompanied by  the other girls, who were there to make sure she did not  get snatched by other pimps. Thereafter, he took her to  that track repeatedly so that she could earn money for  him through prostitution. L.G. was scared to leave ""A""  because he severely beat the other girls just for  speaking with other men. He also beat them with  hangers because he thought they were a bad influence  on defendant. Later, at the encouragement of some girls  she met on the track, defendant started working for  another pimp, named ""B,"" in Crown Heights, because  she felt safer with him. Although he was also nice to her  on the first day they were together, the next day he  forced her to go out and make money for him through  commercial sex. ""B"" also intimidated her with physical  violence and was very strict with his girls, whom he  forced to work daily from 7:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. When  [***6] L.G. was about 13 years old, she started  working for ""C."" She was required to give him the money  she made in exchange for her own room. She did  not [**421]  enjoy her life being prostituted: ""It wasn't  like I wanted to be out there, but being in foster care,  going from home to home, I felt like nobody cared about  me. It made me feel so miserable.""  [*432]   After about six months, L.G. met another pimp  called ""D"" who took her to Atlantic City, New Jersey. In  2000, ""D"" sent her by bus to Washington, D.C., and  then to Miami, Florida. In Florida, defendant, who was  14 years old at the time, attempted to leave ""the life"" by               calling her brother's father who lived in Ft. Lauderdale.  He came to get her, and she lived with him and her  brother for about two weeks. A friend bought her a ticket  back to New York, where she resumed foster care  placement. However, the family she was placed with did  not support her. She then met a girl who introduced her to a  manipulative pimp called ""E"" in Coney Island. L.G. was  14 years old at the time and he was about 30. He was  very violent and would severely beat the girls who  worked for him,  [***7] including L.G., who was afraid  that he would kill her if she ever tried to leave him. She  recalled that ""some girls left once they realized he was  so scary, but 'E' would find them and beat them up. If a  girl made a lot of money, he would put fear in her heart  not to leave."" He beat the defendant often, sometimes  violently, for not making enough money or for  threatening to leave, and would use a belt, or an iron, or  any other handy object. Once he beat her so badly  about the face [****4]  that she was unable to leave the  house for two weeks, primarily because ""E"" was afraid  she might attract the attention of the police. He also  forced her, as well as all his other girls, to have sex  regularly with him. During the time she was with him she  worked the tracks in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, New  Jersey, and other states. ""E"" instructed L.G. to use a  false name and age if she was ever arrested. She was  with ""E"" for about 3½ years. Defendant was first arrested in Queens County for  prostitution on November 14, 2000 when she was 14  years old. In accordance with her pimp's instructions,  she provided a false name and birth date to the police to  appear older. Defendant was next arrested on  November  [***8] 2, 2003 for loitering for purposes of  prostitution, disorderly conduct, and criminal possession  of a weapon in the fourth degree for allegedly carrying a  knife. She was 17 years old at the time. L.G. admits that  she carried a small pocketknife ""no bigger than [her]  forefingers,"" which had been given to her by her pimp,  who instructed her to carry it  [*433]  with her for  protection when she was on the street. ""Johns"" had  raped, assaulted and threatened L.G. with weapons  many times while she was forced to work as a  prostitute. Defendant explained that      41 Misc. 3d 428, *431; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **420; 2013 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3605, ***4; 2013 NY Slip Op 23276, ****3 Page 6 of 11 ""[a]t the time of my second arrest, I had heard that  there was a guy out there who pretended to be a  client, but would then rape girls and beat them up. It  felt like every time I turned around, some girl was  missing. Another girl I knew was raped and beaten  up by a trick. She ended up in the hospital. I had  already been raped by clients and was terrified of it  happening again. Every time I went out I was  scared of being raped or killed."" The night she was arrested, L.G. was working in a dark  and very scary area near a bus stop when she was  stopped by a [**422]  police officer, who requested her  identification, inspected her purse and discovered the  pocketknife. L.G. thought that she was being arrested  for prostitution, not for possession of a weapon. In any  event, she pleaded guilty to the weapons charge and  was sentenced to probation for three years, which she  eventually violated. According to her, she only  discovered years later that there was a warrant for her  arrest when she applied for a certificate of disposition so  that she could get a job as a home health aide. Because  she had failed to comply with probation, she was  sentenced to 10 days' incarceration on November 28,  2006. In 2004, L.G. was 18 years old when she was finally  able to leave ""the life."" Her pimp, ""E,"" had been  arrested, which gave her a chance to escape. She  returned to a foster care placement agency, and for the  first time in her life, disclosed what had happened to her  as a child. They placed her with a family on Staten  Island to keep her away from Brooklyn, where she did  not feel safe because she had been informed that her  pimp was looking  [***10] for her. She went back to  school and stayed with her foster family in Staten Island  for a year before she was able to get a subsidized  apartment right before her 21st birthday.  [****5]   [*434]  L.G. had been previously mandated by the  family court to participate in the GEMS program back in  2001 when she was 14 years old. As a result, she  received support and counseling from them. After  leaving prostitution in 2004 she reconnected with GEMS  and became an active member, participating in their  educational initiative program and in various therapy  groups before starting school again. She received a  home health aide degree in February 2007 and was      working in that capacity during most of 2007, until the  New York City Department of Health ran a background  check and informed her that she could no longer work  because of her past convictions. She received her GED  in 2010 and subsequently qualified for a certificate as a  medical assistant. More recently, L.G. was questioned  about her ability to be a fit guardian when she petitioned  for custody of her nephew—because of her convictions. In 2008, defendant received a message from her pimp  in which he stated that he was not coming after her.  However, she still feared him and therefore did not  report him as her trafficker. In her affidavit in support of  her motion, she stated that ""[o]ne of my family members was recently  murdered by her pimp. He beat her to death. Even  though it's been many years since I was trafficked,  hearing about this was so emotionally difficult. It  touches me every day. I remember how fearful I felt  when I left. I was always afraid that 'E' was going to  come and hurt me. It's only recently that I just got  that fear out of my heart."" Defendant is currently a student at Medgar Evers  College, and expects to graduate in 2014 with a  Bachelor's degree in public administration and social  work. She avers that she wants ""to vacate my  convictions so that I can move forward with my life and  career without being held back by my past."" II. Analysis Defendant L.G.'s odyssey as a victim of human  trafficking began when she was only 12 years old; she  was picked up off the streets of New York City and  forced into prostitution for the next several [***12]    [**423]  years by a succession of exploitative men who  already had other underage girls working for them.  Having endured physical and sexual violence at the  hands of her pimps,  [*435]  johns, and family members,  defendant's childhood and adolescence were marked by  rapes, sexual assaults, kidnapping, enslavement, and  threats of death. Before she was 18 years old, L.G. had  been arrested twice for prostitution-related offenses in  Queens, resulting in a conviction for disorderly conduct  when she was 14 years old after the first arrest, and  another for criminal possession of a weapon three years  later, when she was 17 years old. In both instances,  however, she was charged and convicted as an adult in  local criminal court. As noted earlier, the facts are undisputed in this case.  At issue here is whether Criminal Procedure Law §  41 Misc. 3d 428, *433; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **421; 2013 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3605, ***9; 2013 NY Slip Op 23276, ****4 Page 7 of 11 440.10 (1) (i) empowers the court to dismiss non- prostitution convictions which directly resulted from  defendant's victimization as a trafficked person or  whether the statute's scope must be narrowly applied to  vacate only convictions for prostitution-related offenses.  [****6] Amendment of CPL 440.10 Vacatur Statute In 2010, HN1[ ] New York became the first state in the  country to pass a law which allows  [***13] defendants  to vacate their prior convictions which resulted from their  experiences as victims of human trafficking (CPL  440.10 [1] [i]). It did so by amending CPL 440.10 to  create a new form of post-conviction relief which affords  victims of sex trafficking the remedy of vacating their  convictions if they can establish that ""[t]he judgment is a conviction where the arresting  charge was under section 240.37 (loitering for the  purpose of engaging in a prostitution offense . . . )  or 230.00 (prostitution) of the penal law, and the  defendant's participation in the offense was a result  of having been a victim of sex trafficking under  section 230.34 of the penal law [New York's sex  trafficking statute], or trafficking in persons under  the [Federal] Trafficking Victims Protection Act  (United States Code, title 22, chapter 78)"" (id.).  Thus, HN2[ ] in order to obtain the requested relief, the  movant must  [*436]  establish that (1) she was a                                      trafficking victim at the time of her arrest, and (2) her  conduct or ""participation in the offense"" leading to her  arrest resulted from her being trafficked. Although New  York, unlike federal law,  [***15] does not have a  definition of what constitutes a sex trafficking victim, it  necessarily follows that any person who is a victim of  the statutory crime of sex trafficking would meet this  definition. A person [**424]  is guilty of sex trafficking  under Penal Law § 230.34 if he or she ""intentionally  advances or profits from prostitution"" by engaging in any  one of several types of conduct, such as taking or  keeping  an  individual's  passport  or  immigration  documents to induce a victim to become involved in or  to remain in prostitution (Penal Law § 230.34 [3]), or by  using different methods of force or coercion to instill a  fear in the trafficked victim to compel her to engage in  or continue to engage in prostitution (Penal Law §  230.34 [5] [a]-[h]). HN3[ ] On the federal level, the Trafficking Victims  Protection Act specifically mentioned in CPL 440.10 (1)  (i) defines ""severe forms of trafficking in persons"" to  include sex [****7]  trafficking either in which the victim  is induced to engage in a commercial sex act through  force, fraud or coercion, or where the victim induced to  engage in a commercial sex act has not attained the  age of 18 (22 USC § 7102 [9] [A]). Severe forms of  trafficking in persons also include ""the recruitment,   [***16] harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining  of a person for labor or services, through the use of  force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to  involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or  slavery"" (id. at § 7102 [9] [B]).  This court finds that L.G. was clearly a victim of sex  trafficking under both federal and New York state  standards. L.G. has demonstrated that she was clearly  a victim of sex trafficking under the relevant state sex  trafficking statute because of her traffickers' use of  force and fear to compel her participation in prostitution  (Penal Law § 230.34 [5]). Defendant also meets  [*437]   the requirements under the federal TVPA as a victim of  a ""severe"" form of trafficking because she was induced  into commercial sex while under 18 years of age (22  USC § 7102 [9] [A]; People v G.M., 32 Misc 3d 274,  280, 922 NYS2d 761 [Crim Ct, Queens County 2011];  see also People v Doe, 34 Misc 3d 237, 935 NYS2d 481  [Sup Ct, Bronx County 2011]).     41 Misc. 3d 428, *435; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **423; 2013 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3605, ***12; 2013 NY Slip Op 23276, ****5 Page 8 of 11 More to the point, L.G.'s participation in the offences  which led to her two convictions was the direct result of  her actions as a trafficking victim forced into street  prostitution by her pimp/trafficker. The People do not  contest either defendant's status or the circumstances  surrounding both of her arrests; only that her second  conviction should not be subject to vacatur under this  statute. Thus, the only disputed issue in this case is  whether defendant's conviction for a non-prostitution  offense which was the direct result of her having been  forced into sex trafficking may be vacated under CPL  440.10 (1) (i). L.G. argues that while her second  conviction for weapons possession is admittedly not a  prostitution offense, it should nevertheless be dismissed  because it resulted from her forced involvement in  trafficking activity by her pimp when he required her to  engage in street prostitution. To support the connection  between the weapons conviction and defendant's  coerced prostitution activities, defense counsel notes  that L.G. possessed a pocketknife to protect herself  against unpredictable and potentially violent situations  involving ""johns,"" and was told to do so by her trafficker.  For  [***18] the reasons explained below, this court  holds that L.G.'s conviction for possession of a weapon  in the fourth degree falls within the ambit of the vacatur  statute because her participation in that offense was  undeniably connected to the coerced trafficking activity  which led to [**425]  her arrest on prostitution-related  charges and should therefore be vacated. Vacatur Not Limited to the Arresting Charge under CPL  440.10 (1) (i) The New York legislature passed the new vacatur law,  codified at CPL 440.10 (1) (i), based upon a recognition  of the continuing harm done to trafficking victims  who [****8]  are burdened with criminal convictions as a  result of their victimization in  [*438]  the commercial  sex trade. While New York recognized ""the severity of  the crime of sex trafficking"" by passing the sex  trafficking statute in 2007 (Penal Law § 230.34), one  of  the  sponsors  of  this  new  vacatur  statute  acknowledged that ""gaps remain in our ability to provide  justice to the victims"" (Sponsor's Letter in Support, July         20, 2010, Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 10). ""Victims of trafficking into commercial sex are  frequently arrested for prostitution-related offenses  and are then saddled with the criminal record for  life, long after they may be freed from exploitation.  [This] record may prevent them from obtaining  gainful employment and impair their ability to  access or stay in public or private housing, advance  their education, or participate in other important  aspects of life. Trafficked persons should not suffer  ongoing punishment for acts they committed  unwillingly under coercion"" (id.). This new legislation was thus intended to ""give victims  of human trafficking a desperately needed second  chance they deserve"" (Sponsor's Mem in Support, Bill  Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 13; see People v G.M., 32  Misc 3d at 279; People v Doe, 34 Misc 3d at 237 [new  legislation designed to assist minor trafficking victims]). Central to the issue raised by the instant motion is  determining what is meant by the term ""arresting  charge"" in CPL 440.10 (1) (i), and whether eligibility for  relief is confined only to prostitution and loitering  offenses.  [***20] The statutory language of subdivision  (1) (i) specifies that the court may grant vacatur if ""[t]he  judgment is a conviction where the arresting charge was  under"" either of the offenses for loitering for the purpose  of engaging in a prostitution offense (Penal Law §  240.37), or prostitution (Penal Law § 230.00) (CPL  440.10 [1] [i]). Indeed, human trafficking victims are frequently  arrested and charged for a variety of offenses based on  actions which the victims were unwillingly coerced into  committing by their traffickers. Any interpretation of CPL  440.10 (1) (i) that would narrow the definition of  ""arresting charge"" to include only prostitution offenses  as being entitled to post-conviction relief would  [*439]   certainly neither address the coercive forces confronting  trafficking victims nor comport with the ameliorative  legislative purposes of providing ""relief and justice . . . to  sex trafficking victims"" (Governor's Approval Mem, Bill  Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 6). Rather, this new law is  premised upon the profound understanding that  ""[t]rafficked  persons  should  not  suffer  ongoing  punishment for acts they committed unwillingly under  coercion [of a trafficker]"" (Sponsor's Letter in Support,  July 20, 2010,  [***21] Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 10),  in which they are ""presumably not criminally liable for  the offense"" (Peter Preiser, 2010 Supplementary  Practice Commentary, McKinney's Cons Laws of NY,  41 Misc. 3d 428, *437; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **424; 2013 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3605, ***16; 2013 NY Slip Op 23276, ****7 Page 9 of 11 Book 11A, CPL 440.10, 2013 Pocket Part at 99). The insertion of the term ""arresting charge"" in CPL  440.10 (1) (i) was deliberate on the part of the  legislature. As the bill's sponsors [**426]  observed,  ""[t]he bill is keyed to the 'arresting charge' because it is  common for a person arrested on prostitution- related [****9]  charges to plead guilty to some other  lower-level offense such as disorderly conduct; the bill's  remedy should be available to such a person""  (Sponsor's Letter to Governor's Counsel, Aug. 11, 2010,  Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 11). Similarly, the  Governor's approval memorandum recognized that a  defendant could be arrested for prostitution but  convicted of another offense, and seek vacatur of that  conviction under the statute (Governor's Approval Mem,  Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 6). Thus, HN4[ ] the  legislative history of CPL 440.10 (1) (i) shows that the  legislature anticipated that a victim of human trafficking  arrested on prostitution-related charges may ultimately  plead guilty to an alternate count.  [***22] It necessarily  follows that where, as here, one of the arresting charges  was loitering for the purpose of engaging in prostitution,  and the defendant pleaded guilty to a related non- prostitution crime, then that conviction must be regarded  as having resulted from defendant's having been a  victim of sex trafficking. Consequently, that charge  may be vacated under CPL 440.10 (1) (i). In the instant case, L.G.'s second arrest charged her  with a variety of crimes other than simply loitering for the  purpose of engaging in prostitution. Affording her the  remedy of vacatur for those offenses which were also  committed under force and coercion by an underage  victim of sex trafficking is consistent with the  legislature's intent. There is no dispute that she was  clearly a minor victim at the time of her arrest, under the  coercive control of her trafficker, and that she  possessed a pocketknife to protect herself on the  streets where she was  [*440]  forced to work under  dangerous conditions because she had been raped and  kidnapped in the past. Her conviction for criminal  weapons possession was clearly the result of her having  been trafficked and therefore the arrest charge could  be considered a prostitution-related  [***23] offense. Judicial Discretion Limits Vacatur to Trafficking Related  Offenses Another significant feature of this new law is that the  amended statute contemplates the exercise of judicial  discretion because it states that the court ""may"" vacate  the judgment of conviction if certain criteria are met. As  the Governor's approval memorandum notes, this also  includes the discretion to limit the over-inclusive  application of the statute to avoid vacating convictions  for more serious crimes. ""By allowing a court to deny a  motion, even though the defendant committed a crime  as a result of his or her victimization, the bill properly  permits  judicial  consideration  of  the  nature  or  seriousness of the crime"" (Governor's Approval Mem,  Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 6). Thus, HN5[ ] the  statute grants to the court discretion to consider non- prostitution crimes for vacatur, but in exercising that  discretion, the court must ensure that serious crimes are  not vacated merely because the defendant happened to  be  a  victim  of  trafficking.  Additionally,  under  subdivision (6) of CPL 440.10, the statute specifically  contemplates the use of judicial discretion to ""take such  additional action as  [***24] is appropriate in the  circumstances.""  Previously, this court, in People v G.M. (32 Misc 3d 274,  922 NYS2d 761 [2011]), vacated a trafficking victim's  convictions for two violations stemming from drug  charges (disorderly conduct [****10]  [Penal Law §  240.20]), and [**427]  four B misdemeanor convictions,  two for criminal trespass in the third degree (Penal Law  § 140.10), and two for prostitution (Penal Law §  230.00). In that case, the People consented to the  dismissal of all six of the defendant's convictions,  including those that did not involve prostitution charges,  because they agreed that the defendant was clearly a   [*441]  victim of sex trafficking during each of her  arrests. In carefully reviewing the specific facts of this                      41 Misc. 3d 428, *439; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **425; 2013 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3605, ***21; 2013 NY Slip Op 23276, ****8 Page 10 of 11 case, the court finds no difference between defendant's  status as a victim of sex trafficking and that of the  defendant G.M. Accordingly, there is no discernible  distinction between both cases except for the fact that  L.G. pleaded guilty to the crime of fourth-degree criminal   [***25] possession of a weapon, an A misdemeanor. In People v G.M., this court left open the question HN7[ ] whether CPL 440.10 (1) (i) could be applied to non- prostitution offenses where the People have not  consented to vacatur of the resulting conviction(s). It is  now evident  [***26] from the foregoing analysis of the  legislative  history  behind  the  statute,  that  the  legislature's goal in amending the statute was to avoid  punishing the victims of human trafficking by saddling  them with a criminal record. It is also apparent that the  legislature fully expected the statute to provide relief to  trafficking victims who were not only arrested for  prostitution or loitering for the purpose of prostitution,  but were also convicted of other charges. Finally, the  legislature noted that discretion remains with the court  to determine which convictions should be vacated. Additionally, this court rejects the People's argument  that defendant failed to file this motion with due  diligence after she ceased to be a victim of sex  trafficking, as required under CPL 440.10 (1) (i).  According  to  defendant's  uncontested  factual  averments, she escaped her trafficker in 2004, but  feared until 2008 that he would track her down and  harm her. The statutory provision under which  defendant now seeks relief was not enacted until August  2010 and defendant filed her motion in September  2011. Considering the significant amount of effort  required to prepare the instant motion, and the fact that  CPL 440.10 (1) (i)  [***27] had only been in effect for  barely one year when defendant filed her motion, this  court finds that defendant made her motion with  necessary due diligence as required under CPL 440.10  (1) (i) (i).  [****11]   [*442]   Accordingly, in order for the court to exercise its  discretion to consider vacatur of each of defendant's  judgments of conviction, the court must examine the  unique factual circumstances pertaining to each  conviction. Motion to Vacate Judgment under Docket Number  2000QN056893    Defendant was arraigned on November 14, 2000 under  docket number 2000QN056893 and charged with  prostitution [**428]  (Penal Law § 230.00). Defendant  pleaded guilty on that date to disorderly conduct (Penal  Law § 240.20) and was sentenced to a conditional  discharge. This conviction precisely fits the pattern  anticipated under CPL 440.10 (1) (i) for permitting the  judgment to be vacated. Additionally, the court notes that based upon L.G.'s  uncontroverted factual averments, she was only 14  years old at the time of her conviction for disorderly  conduct. BecauseHN8[ ]  disorderly conduct is an  offense for which criminal responsibility is not imposed  on a minor under age 16 (Penal Law § 30.00 [2]), the  conviction on that charge is a nullity and should be  dismissed  [***28] (Penal Law § 30.00 [1]; People v  Lebron, 197 AD2d 416, 602 NYS2d 602 [1st Dept  1993], lv denied 82 NY2d 898, 632 NE2d 475, 610  NYS2d 165 [1993]; People v McFadden, 194 AD2d 566,  598 NYS2d 567 [2d Dept 1993], lv denied 82 NY2d 722,  622 NE2d 321, 602 NYS2d 820 [1993]). Accordingly, the judgment convicting defendant of  disorderly conduct was ordered vacated, and the  accusatory instrument dismissed by this court. Motion to Vacate Judgment under Docket Number  2003QN050066 On November 7, 2003 defendant was arraigned under  docket number 2003QN050066 and charged with  loitering for the purpose of engaging in a prostitution  offense (Penal Law § 240.37 [3]), criminal possession of  a weapon in the fourth degree (Penal Law § 265.01 [1])  and disorderly conduct (Penal Law § 240.20 [5]).  Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a  weapon in the fourth degree and received a sentence of  three years' probation. It is apparent both from  defendant's  factual  averments,  and  the  factual  allegations contained in the complaint filed in the case,  that the knife at issue which gave rise to the weapons  possession  charge,  was  recovered  incident  to  defendant's prostitution-related activity, and that she  was a victim of trafficking at the time of her arrest.  Accordingly, the judgment convicting defendant of  criminal possession of a  [***29]   [*443]  weapon in the  fourth degree was ordered vacated and the accusatory  instrument dismissed by this court. Conclusion Based upon the foregoing, this court vacated the  judgments of conviction entered under docket number  41 Misc. 3d 428, *441; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **427; 2013 N.Y. Misc.

The court further ordered that  the records of defendant's convictions be sealed under  CPL 160.50 (1) and (3) (f).  [****12]   41 Misc. 3d 428, *443; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **428; 2013 N.Y. Misc.

STATEMENT OF FACTS Commercial Sex Trafficking of [*3]  Doe In May 2013, 16-year-old Doe was working as a prostitute in Florida. She began prostituting at age 12 or 13 and  always had a pimp who received all of her income. In early May, appellant texted Doe in response to an escort advertisement. Appellant was a known pimp and  wanted Doe to work for him. In late May or early June, Doe met appellant in Maryland at his request. Doe stayed in  a hotel with appellant and ""Milky,"" another prostitute. Doe told appellant she was looking for a better situation  because her current pimp was being physically and emotionally abusive. Doe and Milky met with ""clients"" in the  hotel room they shared with appellant and gave him all of their earnings. During this period, appellant sent Doe  texts discussing her prostitution, demanding her earnings, and expressing interest in being her pimp. Appellant, Milky, and Doe subsequently went to Richmond, Virginia, where Doe and Milky continued to prostitute.  Doe met customers by advertising online and always gave appellant whatever she earned, which was generally  $160 to $200 for each ""date."" While they were in Richmond, Doe saw appellant hit Milky in the face hard enough to  make her bleed. Appellant and Doe then spent [*4]  a day or two in Alexandria, Virginia, followed by a week or two  in Washington, D.C. Milky was left behind. Doe continued to prostitute and always gave appellant whatever she  earned. At the end of June, Doe and appellant took a bus to California and stayed for a few days at appellant's mother's  house in San Francisco. During that time, Doe performed ""outcalls"" and appellant's mother acted as her driver. Doe  paid appellant's mother for driving her and gave the remainder of her earnings to appellant. Appellant and Doe  subsequently moved on to Oakland, where Doe continued to prostitute. She reluctantly ""walked the track"" because  appellant said they needed the money.       2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *1 Page 3 of 13 Over the next two months appellant and Doe travelled to Belmont, Santa Rosa, Sacramento, Salinas, San Luis  Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. Doe prostituted in each city and always gave appellant all of her earnings. On  one of two trips to Santa Barbara, Doe had more than 10 ""dates."" Doe and appellant were occasionally  accompanied by Melissa, whom appellant had recruited for prostitution. Appellant also recruited another girl (Emily)  in Belmont. Like Doe, Melissa and Emily gave all of their earnings to appellant. On numerous [*5]  occasions,  Melissa witnessed appellant post ads online for both Doe and herself. Appellant physically assaulted Doe on numerous occasions throughout their relationship and called her derogatory  names like ""stupid"" and ""bitch."" Melissa witnessed at least three such assaults. In one incident, appellant became  angry because he thought Doe was not making enough effort to find ""dates."" He suddenly started slapping and  choking her. Doe fell to the floor and appellant kicked her. Doe began crying. Appellant told her to stop crying,  straddled her, and put her in a headlock. Melissa advised Doe to seek medical treatment after the incident because Doe was bruised and had difficulty  breathing. Doe refused to go to the hospital because she had a warrant. Melissa also called the police to report the  assault. She reported the name of the motel where they were staying but did not disclose their room number.  Appellant later told Melissa that Doe was a minor and Melissa threatened to report him to the police. Appellant  responded by sending Melissa threatening text messages. Melissa called the police and reported that appellant was  abusing Doe. Throughout her time with appellant, Doe exchanged text messages [*6]  with her friend Sandra K., who was  working as a prostitute in Florida. In July 2013 Doe texted, ""I can't take it. I swear I'm going to kill myself before he  kills me."" That same day she texted, ""[H]e goes out and hits me every time my eyes close."" On another occasion  she texted, ""And I don't know what to do. I'm not walking the track. And I'm sick of verbal abuse and being beat for  no reason."" An FBI agent met Sandra while conducting a prostitution sting. After viewing Doe's texts to Sandra, another agent  tracked down Doe's location and contact information. The agent contacted Doe online and posed as a potential  customer. On August 22, FBI agents and other law enforcement officers contacted Doe in a hotel room. Appellant  left the room through a window and was apprehended shortly thereafter. Officers found 1.24 grams of  methamphetamine in the room and a small amount of marijuana. They also found a list containing telephone  numbers, times, and dollar amounts, three sex directories, and various sex toys. Appellant and Doe's phones were  seized along with a third phone they both used. Doe admitted to the police that she was acting as a prostitute yet claimed appellant was merely her boyfriend. [*7]   Doe also said that appellant had told her not to say anything to the police about what was going on. She did not tell  the FBI agents that she gave appellant money from her dates because she loved him and did not want him to be  prosecuted. After appellant was arrested, he maintained contact with Doe from jail by using a three-way call through his  mother's phone. There were 60 to 70 recordings of such calls. During one of the calls, appellant directed Doe to go  to the ""track"" in Oakland in order to make money to pay for his attorneys. He also said he did not want to hear any  excuses as to why she could or would not do so for him. Appellant also continued to tell Doe that he loved her and  talked about getting married. He told her that perjury was not a serious offense and was only punishable by a year  in jail. He also repeatedly blamed Doe for his situation. After Doe testified at the preliminary hearing, she asked appellant's mother to put her in touch with appellant again.  She felt that she had no other option than prostitution because she had no family or a place to stay. In December,  the Los Angeles County Superior Court issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting appellant from [*8]  having  any contact with Doe. A permanent restraining order was issued in July 2104. In October 2014, a District Attorney  investigator interviewed Doe to review 73 calls that took place between April 2014 and September 2014. Doe  verified that the voices heard on the calls were hers and appellant's. The investigator ultimately found recorded  calls between appellant and Doe that took place after the permanent restraining order was issued. 2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *4 Page 4 of 13 Jail inmate Charles Schmidt testified that he had repeatedly allowed appellant to use Schmidt's inmate identification  number to make phone calls to Doe. Appellant told Schmidt that he had pending charges for pimping and pandering  an underage girl and that he believed she would not testify against him because she was in love with him. Appellant  said he was hopeful this girl would continue making money for him while he was in custody. Appellant also told  Schmidt he would prey on girls who did not have any money and focused on Caucasian girls because they made  the most money. He also emphasized that he got all of the money the girls earned. Expert Testimony On The Exploitation Of Minors Through Commercial Sex Trafficking Dr. Sharon Cooper, a developmental [*9]  and forensic pediatrician, testified for the prosecution as an expert on the  sexual exploitation of minors through commercial sex trafficking. Dr. Cooper explained that sex traffickers  intentionally choose victims who appear to have certain vulnerabilities. Female victims are typically first targeted  when they are between 12 and 14 years old and come from adverse backgrounds that include neglect, sexual and  psychological abuse, domestic violence, substance abuse, and incarceration of family members. Sometimes the  victims are given drugs to make them dependent on the trafficker. Runaways and ""thrown-away children"" face the  greatest risk of being recruited into sex trafficking. Commercial sex trafficking victims are most commonly recruited ""under the guise of romance."" A ""Romeo pimp"" is  typically an older male who promises a romantic relationship or even marriage. Such a strategy renders the victim  much more likely to bond with the pimp. The pimp then transitions to a controlling and abusive relationship in which  the focus is placed on the victim's need to ""contribute to [the] family."" It is also common for victims to be used to  recruit other victims. Pimps also frequently used competition [*10]  or jealousy to manipulate and control their  victims. Dr. Cooper also explained that victims are often expected to make a certain amount of money and are punished if  they fail to do so. For example, some victims will be taken to a ""track"" and ordered to continue working until they  make their quota. Degradation and humiliation are part of the grooming process. A trafficker may also render  victims dependent upon him through ""trauma bonding,"" which the doctor described as ""a psychological form of  coercion"" in which another victim is physically abused in their presence. Victims often will not leave because they  are convinced they have nowhere else to go. A pimp or trafficker may have to use less violence because the victim  was previously conditioned to expect to be harmed in certain circumstances. Traffickers also teach their victims to  deny that they work for a pimp and claim they are merely working for themselves. Most victims do so and usually  minimize the abuse their traffickers inflict on them. Anaheim Police Lieutenant Craig Friesen also testified as a prosecution expert on commercial sex trafficking. Pimps  generally target vulnerable girls and lure them in with false promises of a [*11]  better life. Prostitutes commonly  have romantic relationships with their pimps, which gives them a false sense that they are not really in a business  relationship. Pimps receive all of the prostitute's earnings and decide how the money will be spent. A prostitute who  tried to keep the money would be physically or emotionally punished. Pimps remain in control even when they are  in a different city or are incarcerated. It is common for trafficking victims to travel to various cities within a state or  region. The victims and their pimps usually move around in order to avoid detection by law enforcement. Moving  around also isolates the victims and removes them from any support network. It is also common for traffickers to  dissuade their victims from testifying against them. DISCUSSION I. Sufficiency of the Evidence - § 236.1(c)(2) Appellant contends the evidence is insufficient to support the finding that the sex trafficking offense charged in  count 1 involved force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury, as set  forth in section 236.1(c)(2). We disagree. 2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *8 Page 5 of 13 ""When considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we review the entire  record in the [*12]  light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidence?that  is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value?from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the  defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.]"" (People v. Lindberg (2008) 45 Cal.4th 1, 27, 82 Cal. Rptr.  3d 323, 190 P.3d 664.) We determine ""whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the  prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable  doubt. [Citation.]"" (Jackson v. Virginia (1979) 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560.) In so doing, a  reviewing court ""presumes in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce  from the evidence. [Citations.]"" (People v. Kraft (2000) 23 Cal.4th 978, 1053, 99 Cal. Rptr. 2d 1, 5 P.3d 68.) As relevant here, a person is guilty of commercial sex trafficking if he or she ""causes, induces, or persuades, or  attempts to cause, induce, or persuade, a person who is a minor at the time of commission of the offense to engage  in a commercial sex act[.]"" (§ 236.1(c).) The crime is punishable by 15 years to life in state prison and a fine of not  more than $500,000 ""when the offense involves force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or  threat of unlawful injury to the victim or to another person."" (§ 236.1(c)(2).) The statute defines [*13]  ""coercion"" as  ""includ[ing] [any] scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that failure to perform an act would  result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any person; the abuse or threatened abuse of the legal  process; debt bondage; or providing and facilitating the possession of [any] controlled substance to a person with  the intent to impair the person's judgment."" (Id., subd. (h)(1).) ""Duress"" in this context ""includes a direct or implied  threat of force, violence, danger, hardship, or retribution sufficient to cause a reasonable person to acquiesce in or  perform an act which he or she would otherwise not have submitted to or performed[.]"" (Id., subd. (h)(4).) The jury was instructed on the section 236.1(c)(2) allegation in accordance with CALCRIM No. 3184. The  allegation was attendant to count 1, which was based on appellant's conduct from the time he met Doe until his  arrest. In challenging the jury's finding, appellant focuses on the evidence that he used actual force and violence  and claims the evidence compels a finding that Doe ""had no fear of [appellant], and did not prostitute herself or act  based on fear of him."" This assertion effectively ignores the controlling standard of review, [*14]  which compels us  to review the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's finding that appellant's sex trafficking of Doe prior to  this arrest involved force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury, as set  forth in section 236.1(c)(2). When viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment, the evidence supporting the true finding on the section  236.1(c)(2) allegation is overwhelming. Among other things, appellant once slapped, kicked, and choked Doe  because ""[s]he wasn't doing her job right."" Appellant also spiked Doe's drink with methamphetamine, which  contributed to her addiction to the drug. As Dr. Cooper testified, sex traffickers often make their victims dependent  upon them by giving them drugs. Appellant also deceived Doe to believe he wanted to marry her. According to Dr.  Cooper, a pimp often employs this very type of deceit as a means of inducing the victim to work for him. Doe also  complained in text messages that appellant ""hits me every time my eyes close"" and ""beat [her] for no reason."" Dr.                2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *11 Page 6 of 13 Cooper testified that sex traffickers often employ such abuse as a means of maintaining control over their victims.  This evidence is sufficient [*15]  by itself to support the finding that the sexual trafficking offense charged in count 1  involved force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury as provided in  section 236.1(c)(2). Appellant's assertion is also erroneous to the extent it presumes that the section 236.1(c)(2) enhancement is  necessarily premised upon a finding that Doe prostituted herself because she feared appellant. As we have  explained, the instilling of fear is but one theory upon which the enhancement can be based. In any event, Doe's  state of mind is essentially irrelevant to the jury's finding. Section 236.1(c)(2) does not require a finding that the  victim acted out of fear or any other particular motivation. The relevant inquiry was whether appellant's sexual  trafficking of Doe involved the use of force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of  unlawful injury, and not whether those tactics secured Doe's prostitution. As section 236.1 makes clear, ""[c]onsent  by a victim of human trafficking who is a minor at the time of the commission of the offense is not a defense to a  criminal prosecution under this section."" (§ 236.1, subd. (e); see also In re M.V. (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1517,  fn. 16, 171 Cal. Rptr. 3d 519 [""[A] minor's status as a sexually exploited youth operates independently of any notion  that [*16]  the minor somehow consented to her own victimization""].) II. CALCRIM No. 3184 As we noted ante, the jury was instructed on the section 236.1(c)(2) allegation pursuant to CALCRIM No. 3184.  Appellant claims that the jury's true finding on the allegation must be reversed because the instruction ""incorrectly  permitted jurors to find the special allegation true based on any unrelated force, fear, or violence. So, if [appellant]  used force, fear, or violence to make [Doe] iron his shirts, jurors incorrectly could have found the force allegation  true."" He further claims that ""without quantifying the amount of force, fear, or violence, jurors incorrectly could have  found the allegation true based on some minor amount of force, that was inadequate to have caused [Doe] to  engage in commercial sex acts."" Neither point has merit. First, the instruction plainly stated that in order for the allegation to be true, the People had to prove ""that when the  defendant committed the crime, he used force, fear, deceit, coercion, violence, or duress against [Doe]."" (Italics  added.) In light of this statement, no reasonable juror would have concluded the allegation could be found true  based on evidence that appellant used force that was unrelated to his commission [*17]  of the crime. (See People  v. Sanchez (2001) 26 Cal.4th 834, 852, 111 Cal. Rptr. 2d 129, 29 P.3d 209 [""Jurors are presumed able to  understand and correlate instructions and are further presumed to have followed the court's instructions].) Although appellant correctly notes that CALCRIM No. 3184 expressly defined duress, coercion, and serious harm,  ""[t]he requirement of use of force or fear has no technical meaning which must be explained to jurors[.]"" (People v.  Sullivan (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 524, 544, 59 Cal. Rptr. 3d 876; see also People v. Griffin (2004) 33 Cal.4th 1015,  1022-1024, 16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 891, 94 P.3d 1089 (Griffin) [the term ""force"" as used in the forcible rape statute (§ 261,  subd. (a)(2)) ""ha[s] a common usage meaning, rather than a specialized legal definition, and . . . hence there is no  sua sponte duty to specially instruct the jury in a rape case on the definition of that term""].) Moreover, that ""the  Legislature . . . saw fit to expressly and specifically define the terms 'menace' and 'duress' . . . , [yet] has not seen fit  to do the same for the term 'force,' . . . supports a conclusion that no specialized legal meaning was ever intended  for that term. [Citation.]"" (Griffin, supra, at p. 1023 [discussing § 261].) Second, a finding that a defendant used force as provided in section 236.1(c)(2) does not require a finding that the  force was sufficient to cause the victim to do what he or she otherwise would not have done. In arguing otherwise,  appellant misplaces his reliance on Griffin at is [*18]  progeny. In Griffin, the court held ""that 'in order to establish  force within the meaning of section 261, subd. (a)(2) [forcible rape], the prosecution need only show the defendant  used physical force of a degree sufficient to support a finding that the act of sexual intercourse was against the will  of the [victim.]' [Citation.]"" (Griffin, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 1024.) In so holding, the court faulted the Court of Appeal  for relying on People v. Cicero (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 465, 204 Cal. Rptr. 582 (Cicero), disapproved in People v.  2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *14 Page 7 of 13 Soto (2011) 51 Cal.4th 229, 119 Cal. Rptr. 3d 775, 245 P.3d 410 (Soto), which held that conviction of forcible lewd  acts on a minor (§ 288, subd. (b)(1)) requires proof of ""'physical force substantially different from or substantially  greater than that necessary to accomplish the lewd act[.]'"" (Griffin, at pp. 1021-1022, quoting Cicero, at p. 474.) The  court reasoned among other things that ""[t]here is considerable difference between the crime of lewd acts by force  on a child under the age of 14, with which Cicero was directly concerned [citation], and the crime of forcible rape.""  (Griffin, at p. 1026.) Griffin is inapposite here. Section 236.1(c)(2), unlike section 261, does not require a finding that the crime was  committed against the victim's will if the victim is a minor. As subdivision (e) of section 236.1 makes clear,  ""[c]onsent by a victim of human trafficking who is a minor at the time of the commission of the offense is not a  defense to a criminal prosecution under this section."" The same distinction [*19]  was made in Soto, supra, 51  Cal.4th 229, in which the court distinguished Griffin and recognized that consent is not a defense to the crime of  aggravated lewd conduct on a child under age 14 (§ 288, subd. (b)(1)). (Soto, at p. 248.) Because consent is not a  defense to the crime, ""the prosecution need not prove that a lewd act committed by use of force, violence, duress,  menace or fear was also against the victim's will."" (Ibid.) We discern no legitimate reason for concluding otherwise  here. III. Verdict on Count 2 Appellant contends the court erred in failing to accept the jury's orally reported verdict of not guilty on the greater  offense of human trafficking charged in count 2. We disagree. Appellant's contention is based on discussions that took place in response to a note the court received from the jury  during its deliberations. The note stated, ""Can't all agree on Count 2?lesser verdict pimping."" The court brought the  jury into the courtroom and stated: ""[T]he question is a little bit ambiguous, so we brought you out here to inquire a  little bit further and to seek some clarification in terms of where you're at on deliberations. So the question is, you  can't all agree on Count 2, dash, lesser verdict, pimping. [¶] So typically,—well, the instructions [*20]  indicate that .  . . you don't get to the question of deciding whether or not a defendant is guilty of a lesser until you've all agreed  one way or the other as to the greater, that is, you all agree that the defendant is not guilty of the greater offense, in  this case, on Count 2, it's human trafficking."" The court asked the jury foreperson, ""has the jury all agreed as to the greater count on Count 2?"" The foreperson  responded, ""Yes."" The court then stated: ""So you've all agreed the defendant is not guilty of the greater on Count 2,  because you don't get to the greater—hold on a second. You don't get to the lesser count until you've all agreed  that he's not guilty of the greater count, and on Count 2, the greater count is human trafficking. So have you all  agreed on a verdict as to the offense of Count 2, human trafficking?"" The foreperson replied, ""Yes. On the greater  counts, yes."" The court then asked, ""You all agreed or not agreed [sic]?"" The foreperson did not respond. The record indicates that the ""Jury confers amongst themselves."" The court then  added, ""So maybe I confused you a little bit. . . . [T]he jury instructions indicate you can deliberate in whatever order  you want. So you can [*21]  discuss Count 2 as it's alleged, which is human trafficking; you can begin with the  lesser charge of pimping and pandering as to Count 2 and discuss that; but on the question of reaching a verdict on  the lesser, you all have to first agree that the defendant—and the lesser is pimping—you all have to agree that the  defendant is not guilty of the charged count in Count 2, which is human trafficking."" The foreperson interjected, ""Is that the lesser or the greater?"" The court replied, ""Let me just finish. There's an  element of Count 2 which is pimping or pandering, okay? Is that where you're having some issues, that you can't all  agree?"" The foreperson replied, ""Yes."" After reiterating that pimping or pandering was an element of the offense of  human trafficking, the court asked, ""Is that why the jury is having some issues, or are you having an issue as to the  lesser included offense of pimping as to Count 2"" The foreperson replied, ""The lesser."" The court then asked if the  jury had ""all agreed as the human trafficking charge in Count 2"" and the foreperson replied, ""Not on the lesser."" 2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *18 Page 8 of 13 The court continued: ""Okay. So here is what we're going to do. I'm going to have you go back into the jury [*22]   deliberation room. I want you to carefully review the jury instructions again. So read very carefully the jury  instructions for Count 2, of which pimping and pandering is an element of Count 2, okay? If you all agree on a  verdict as to Count 2, if it's not guilty, then you go to the lesser offense or Count 2, which is pimping and/or  pandering, but you can't get to the lesser offense as to Count 2 until you all agree the defendant is not guilty of the  greater offense of human trafficking. So hopefully that's helpful, and with that, I'm not going to say anymore, but I'm  going to send you back into the jury deliberation room and again review the instruction."" After the jury left the courtroom, the court asked the attorneys if they had any comments. Defense counsel stated:  [T]hey're clearly perplexed. It appears there's some misunderstanding even amongst the jurors, just looking at the  body language . . . , so I think we leave them to deliberate and try to figure out better what their questions and  problems are before we can help them any further."" About 10 minutes later, the court indicated it had received another note that stated, ""We accidentally signed count 1  & 2 of the lesser crime. What [*23]  do we need to do, if anything. We have reached agreement [sic]."" The court  asked the foreperson if the jury had reached a verdict on each count and the foreperson replied in the affirmative.  The court then asked all of the jurors ""do you feel you need any further time to deliberate?"" They all responded,  ""No."" According to appellant, the foregoing exchanges reflect that ""[t]he jury multiple times reported a general verdict of  acquittal within the meaning of section 1151."" He claims that ""[u]nder . . . section 1164, subdivision (a), the verdict  was 'complete' when the foreperson reported (multiple times) that the jury had reached a verdict on the greater  offense, and could not agree on the lesser."" The record does not support appellant's assertion. The foreperson never stated that the jury had reached a verdict  of not guilty on the offense of human trafficking charged in count 2. When construed in their entirety, the  foreperson's comments reflect nothing more than confusion about the manner in which the jury was to decide the  charges. At one point, the foreperson even expressed confusion whether sex trafficking was the greater offense.  Even defense counsel agreed that the jury was simply confused and that further deliberations were  warranted. [*24]  Moreover, the jury returned shortly thereafter with guilty verdicts on all counts and the jurors all  agreed that no further deliberations were needed. Contrary to appellant's claim, nothing in the subject discussions  compelled the court to reject the jury's guilty verdict on count 2. IV. Alleged Instructional Error On Count 2 Appellant contends that the judgment on count 2 must also be reversed on the ground that the court's response to  the jury's question (as discussed ante) misstated the ""acquittal-first"" rule. We are not persuaded. ""Under the acquittal-first rule, a trial court may direct the order in which jury verdicts are returned by requiring an  express acquittal on the charged crime before a verdict may be returned on a lesser included offense. [Citation.]""  (People v. Bacon (2010) 50 Cal.4th 1082, 1110, 116 Cal. Rptr. 3d 723, 240 P.3d 204.) Jurors are free, however, to  deliberate on the charges in any order and may thus discuss a lesser included offense before returning a verdict on  the greater offense. (People v. Kurtzman (1988) 46 Cal.3d 322, 335-336, 250 Cal. Rptr. 244, 758 P.2d 572.) The  jury in this case was instructed pursuant to CALCRIM No. 3517 as follows: ""It is up to you to decide the order in  which you consider each crime and the relevant evidence, but I can accept a verdict of guilty of a lesser crime only  if you have found the defendant not [*25]  guilty of the corresponding greater crime.""     2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *21 Page 9 of 13 Appellant asserts that the court disregarded the acquittal-first rule when it told the jury: ""If you all agree on a verdict  as to Count 2, if it's not guilty, then you go to the lesser offense of Count 2, which is pimping and/or pandering, but  you can't get to the lesser offense as to Count 2 until you all agree the defendant is not guilty of the greater offense  of human trafficking."" This is an impermissibly selective quoting of the court's instructions. ""We determine the  correctness of the jury instructions from the entire charge of the court, not from considering only parts of an  instruction or one particular instruction. [Citation.]"" (People v. Smith (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 7, 13, 85 Cal. Rptr. 3d  180.) Here, the court's instructions also made clear that ""you can deliberate in whatever order you want. So you can  discuss Count 2 as it's alleged, which is human trafficking; you can begin with the lesser charge of pimping and  pandering as to Count 2 and discuss that; but on the question of reaching a verdict on the lesser, you all have to  first agree that the defendant—and the lesser is pimping—you all have to agree that the defendant is not guilty of  the charged count in Count 2, which is human trafficking."" [*26]  Appellant's claim of instructional error fails. V. Constitutionality of Section 236.1(c) For the first time on appeal, appellant asserts that section 236.1(c) is unconstitutional because it (1) violates the  separation of powers doctrine by delegating the judicial branch's sentencing authority to the prosecution; and (2)  violates his right to equal protection. Both claims are forfeited (People v. Fuiava (2012) 53 Cal.4th 622, 670, 137  Cal. Rptr. 3d 147, 269 P.3d 568), and in any event lack merit. The separation of powers doctrine provides that ""[t]he powers of state government are legislative, executive, and  judicial. Persons charged with the exercise of one power may not exercise either of the others except as permitted  by this Constitution."" (Cal. Const., art. III, § 3.) Appellant's claim that section 236.1(c) violates this doctrine is based  on the premise that the statute essentially proscribes the same conduct as the pimping and pandering statutes (§§  266h, 266i), yet provides for a substantially greater punishment. Appellant argues that this disparity violates the  separation of powers doctrine because it delegates to the prosecutor (i.e., the executive branch) the authority to  dictate the defendant's range of punishment. He contends that ""[s]electing the crime to prosecute falls within the  executive's discretion, but not to the extent that doing so infringes upon [*27]  the judiciary's core power of  determining and fashioning a sentence within the parameters, all parameters, set by the Legislature."" Appellant fails to sufficiently allege a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. ""[T]he separation of powers  doctrine prohibits the legislative branch from granting prosecutors the authority, after charges have been filed, to  control the legislatively specified sentencing choices available to a court. A statute conferring upon prosecutors the  discretion to make certain decisions before the filing of charges, on the other hand, is not invalid simply because the  prosecutor's exercise of such charging discretion necessarily affects the dispositional options available to the court.  Rather, such a result generally is merely incidental to the exercise of the executive function—the traditional power  of the prosecutor to charge crimes."" (Manduley v. Superior Court (2002) 27 Cal.4th 537, 553, 117 Cal. Rptr. 2d 168,  41 P.3d 3.) By enacting section 236.1(c)(2), the electorate chose to increase the punishments for those who engage in sex  trafficking of minors. ""'""[S]ubject to the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, the power to  define crimes and fix penalties is vested exclusively in the legislative branch."" [Citations.]' [Citation.]"" (Manduley v.  Superior Court, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 552.) Moreover, [*28]  ""'[t]he power of the people through the statutory  initiative is coextensive with the power of the Legislature.' [Citation.]"" (Ibid.) The fact that the enactment of these  statutes gives prosecutors the discretion to pursue charges for sex trafficking rather than pimping and/or pandering       2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *25 Page 10 of 13 does not run afoul of the separation of powers doctrine; on the contrary, this discretion is a hallmark of the doctrine.  (Ibid.) Appellant's equal protection claim is equally unavailing. Our Supreme Court has recognized that ""neither the  existence of two identical criminal statutes prescribing different levels of punishments, nor the exercise of a  prosecutor's discretion in charging under one such statute and not the other, violates equal protection principles.  [Citation.]"" (People v. Wilkinson (2004) 33 Cal.4th 821, 838, 16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 420, 94 P.3d 551, citing United States  v. Batchelder (1979) 442 U.S. 114, 124-125, 99 S. Ct. 2198, 60 L. Ed. 2d 755.) This authority, which appellant fails  to address, plainly disposes of his equal protection claim. VI. Williamson Appellant asserts that his convictions on counts 1 and 2 must be reduced to pandering (§ 266i) pursuant to the  Williamson rule. This claim is forfeited because it was not raised below and in any event lacks merit. ""Under the Williamson rule, if a general statute includes the same conduct as a special statute, the court  infers [*29]  that the Legislature intended that conduct to be prosecuted exclusively under the special statute. In  effect, the special statute is interpreted as creating an exception to the general statute for conduct that otherwise  could be prosecuted under either statute."" [Citation.] (People v. Murphy (2011) 52 Cal.4th 81, 86, 127 Cal. Rptr. 3d  78, 253 P.3d 1216.) ""[T]he Williamson preemption rule is applicable (1) when each element of the general statute  corresponds to an element on the face of the special statute, or (2) when it appears from the statutory context that a  violation of the special statute will necessarily or commonly result in a violation of the general statute. [Citation.]""  (People v. Watson (1981) 30 Cal.3d 290, 295-296, 179 Cal. Rptr. 43, 637 P.2d 279.) The Williamson rule does not apply here. Appellant labels section 266i as ""more specific"" than section 236.1(c), yet  he fails to explain how this is so. In any event, application of the Williamson rule in the manner contemplated by  appellant would effectively render section 236.1(c) a nullity. A violation of section 266i is an element of section  236.1(c). Moreover, in enacting section 236.1(c), the electorate expressed its intent to increase punishment for  defendants, like appellant, who engage in sex trafficking of minors. The Williamson rule is simply a means of  determining and effectuating legislative intent, and should never be applied to defeat such intent. (See People v.  Jenkins, supra, 28 Cal.3d at p. 502; [*30]  People v. Salemme (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 775, 783, 3 Cal. Rptr. 2d 398.)  Section 236.1(c) was enacted to create the offense of sex trafficking of minors, and in this context section 266i is an  express element of that offense. Concluding that section 266i effectively trumps section 236.1(c) here ""would be  absurd, and we must 'presume that the Legislature did not intend absurd results.' [Citation.]"" (Salemme, at p. 784.)  Because it is clear that a section 266i was not intended to create an exception to section 236.1(c), the Williamson  rule does not apply. (See People v. Murphy, supra, 52 Cal.4th at p. 86.) VII. Double Jeopardy Appellant contends he was convicted on both counts 1 and 2 in violation of the state and federal double jeopardy  clauses because the crimes involved the same victim and took place over the same timeframe. This contention was  not raised below and is thus forfeited. (In re Henry C. (1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 646, 648-649, 207 Cal. Rptr. 751.) In        2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *28 Page 11 of 13 any event, the claim is both factually and legally inaccurate. Count 1 related to appellant's conduct from May  through August 2013, while count 2 related to the conduct following his arrest in November 2013. Moreover, ""While  the Double Jeopardy Clause may protect a defendant against cumulative punishments for convictions on the same  offense, the Clause does not prohibit the State from prosecuting respondent for such offenses in a single  prosecution."" (Ohio v. Johnson (1984) 467 U.S. 493, 500, 104 S. Ct. 2536, 81 L. Ed. 2d 425.) VIII. Cruel and Unusual Punishment Appellant contends that his sentence of 36 years to life amounts to [*31]  cruel and unusual punishment in violation  of the state and federal Constitutions. We are not persuaded. The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 17 of the California Constitution  prohibit cruel and/or unusual punishment. Both clauses prohibit punishment that is disproportionate to a defendant's  personal responsibility and moral culpability. (Enmund v. Florida (1982) 458 U.S. 782, 801, 102 S. Ct. 3368, 73 L.  Ed. 2d 1140.) Under the federal Constitution, noncapital sentences are subject only to a narrow proportionality  review, if any. (See Ewing v. California (2003) 538 U.S. 11, 23, 123 S. Ct. 1179, 155 L. Ed. 2d 108.) A punishment  violates the state Constitution only if ""it is so disproportionate to the crime for which it is inflicted that it shocks the  conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity. (Fn. omitted.)"" (In re Lynch (1972) 8 Cal.3d 410,  424, 105 Cal. Rptr. 217, 503 P.2d 921.) Appellant's claim of cruel and unusual punishment focuses upon section 236.1(c)(2), which was enacted in 2012  pursuant to Proposition 35. Although he does not assert that the dictated sentence of 15 years to life is facially  unconstitutional, he claims that ""[t]he facts of this case represent the bare minimum of conduct that meets the  elements of human trafficking."" The record belies this assertion. Moreover, federal courts have repeatedly rejected  Eighth Amendment challenges to the federal human trafficking law (18 U.S.C. § 1591), upon which the state law is  patterned. (See, e.g., United States v. Alaboudi (8th Cir. 2015) 786 F.3d 1136, 1146; United States v. Flanders  (11th Cir. 2014) 752 F.3d 1317, 1343; United States v. Mozie (11th Cir. 2014) 752 F.3d 1271, 1290.) Appellant also complains that ""the gravamen [*32]  of the criminal conduct in counts 1 and 2 is essentially the same  offense as pimping and pandering. Yet, the punishments are shockingly different."" He adds that ""[i]t was not until  voters passed Proposition 35 . . . in November 2012, that a sentence could include 15 years to life and fines of up  to $1,500,000."" Appellant fails to recognize, however, that the enactment of section 236.1(c)(2) reflects the  electorate's intent to increase the punishment for such offenses when the victim is a minor and the offense involves                   2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *30 Page 12 of 13 force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury to the victim or another person. ""'It  is the prerogative of the Legislature, and the electorate by initiative, to recognize degrees of culpability and penalize  accordingly. [Citations.]' [Citation.]"" (People v. Doyle (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1251, 1267, 164 Cal. Rptr. 3d 86.)  Appellant's complaint that a violation of section 236.1(c)(2) is subject to the same punishment as second degree  murder (§ 190) is similarly unavailing and downplays the significance of his offenses. Appellant fares no better in comparing his sentence under section 236.1(c)(2) with the sentences imposed in other  states for similar crimes. As we have noted, it is questionable whether a proportionality review even applies here.  (Ewing v. California, supra, 538 U.S. at p. 23.) In any event, virtually [*33]  all of the states he identifies allow  similarly substantial punishments. (See, e.g., Minnesota, M.S.A. § 609.322 [15 to 25 years of imprisonment];  Maryland, CR § 11-303 [imprisonment not exceeding 25 years]; Rhode Island, § 11-67-3 [up to 20 years  imprisonment].) Appellant's claim of cruel and unusual punishment also fails to the extent he relies upon the enhancements that  were imposed as result of his recidivism. States do not run afoul of the Eighth Amendment by enacting law that  more harshly punish recidivists who either cannot or will not conform their conduct to social norms. (Rummel v.  Estelle (1980) 445 U.S. 263, 284-285, 100 S. Ct. 1133, 63 L. Ed. 2d 382).) In Rummel, the United States Supreme  Court upheld a mandatory life sentence under a Texas recidivist statute even though the defendant had been  convicted of obtaining $120.75 by false pretenses and his prior convictions consisted of two nonviolent felonies.  The Court reasoned that the sentence under a recidivist statute is ""based not merely on that person's most recent  offense but also on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during which he has been convicted  of and sentenced for other crimes."" (Id. at p. 284.) The statute serves the legitimate goal of deterring repeat  offenders and of segregating the recidivist ""from the rest of society [*34]  for an extended period of time."" (Ibid.) Appellant's sentence was enhanced by 21 years as a result of his recidivism, which includes prior strike and serious  felony convictions for armed robbery and a prior prison term. As the People accurately note, ""[a]ppellant spent  almost all of his entire adult life either in prison or on parole and he violated his parole over and over again."" He was  actually on parole for committing false imprisonment by violence when he committed the instant offenses. Appellant  has failed to ""overcome [his] 'considerable burden' in convincing us his sentence was disproportionate to his level of  culpability. [Citation.]"" (People v. Weddle (1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 1190, 1197, 2 Cal. Rptr. 2d 714.) His claim of cruel  and unusual punishment accordingly fails. IX. Pitchess Prior to trial, appellant filed a Pitchess motion seeking disclosure of the personnel files of Chief District Attorney  Investigator Dave Saunders. Defense counsel's declaration stated that Saunders was in a relationship with Doe's  attorney and added, ""It is my belief that . . . Saunders was involved in improper conduct related to [appellant's] case  and that conduct [sic] has been documented by members of the District Attorney [sic]."" In opposing the motion, the              2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *32 Page 13 of 13 prosecution offered [*35]  among other things that Saunders had no involvement in the case. After conducting an in  camera hearing, the court ordered that one of the documents in Saunders's life be provided to the defense subject  to a protective order. Appellant asks us to review the sealed transcripts of the in camera proceedings to determine if the court followed  the proper procedure and whether all relevant documents were disclosed. We have reviewed the sealed transcripts  and conclude there was no error. (People v. Hughes (2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 330, 116 Cal. Rptr. 2d 401, 39 P.3d  432; People v. Mooc (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1216, 1232, 114 Cal. Rptr. 2d 482, 36 P.3d 21.) X. Cumulative Error Appellant contends the cumulative effect of the alleged errors requires reversal. We reject this contention because  there was no error to cumulate. (People v. Avila (2009) 46 Cal.4th 680, 718, 94 Cal. Rptr. 3d 699, 208 P.3d 634;  People v. Bolin (1998) 18 Cal.4th 297, 335, 75 Cal. Rptr. 2d 412, 956 P.2d 374.) XI. Correction of Judgment The People ask us to order that the judgment be corrected to reflect that appellant was sentenced on count 1 to 30  years to life, rather than 15 years to life. Appellant does not dispute the error, and we shall accordingly order it  corrected. DISPOSITION We order that the judgment be corrected to reflect that appellant was sentenced to an indeterminate term of 30  years to life on count 1 (irrespective of the enhancements that were also imposed), rather than a term of 15 years to  life. The superior court clerk shall [*36]  prepare an amended abstract of judgment and forward a certified copy to  the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed. PERREN, J. We concur: GILBERT, P. J. YEGAN, J.  2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *34"
"People v. Turuc, 2023 Ill. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1965.pdf","[*1] PRESIDING JUSTICE McLAREN delivered the  judgment of the court. Justices Schostok and Kennedy  concurred in the judgment. ORDER  1 Held: The trial court properly denied, following a third- stage hearing, defendant's postconviction claim that trial  counsel was ineffective for failing to seek dismissal of a  charge of criminal sexual assault because a sheriff's  detective falsely testified to the grand jury that the  victim, a teenage runaway, had lived at defendant's  substance abuse recovery home after the victim  reached out to him. There was no prejudice from the  false statement because there was other evidence to  satisfy the element that defendant held a position of  trust as to the victim-i.e., the detective's testimony that  the victim sought help from defendant, whom the victim  believed was a substance abuse counselor, and that  they spent two days together and stayed at a motel.  2 Defendant, James W. Turuc, appeals from a  judgment, entered after an evidentiary hearing, denying his petition for relief under the Post-Conviction  Hearing Act (Act) (725 ILCS 5/122-1 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U et seq. (West 2020)). Defendant contends that he  proved that his trial counsel was ineffective forfailing to  move to dismiss a charge-of which he was later  convicted-based on false testimony [*2]  presented to  the grand jury. We affirm.  3 I. BACKGROUND  4 On June 27, 2007, the State filed a four-count  indictment against defendant. Counts I and II both  alleged criminal sexual assault in violation of section 12- 13(a)(4) of the Criminal Code of 1961 (720 ILCS 5/12/- 13(a)(4) (West 2006)). Count I alleged that defendant,  ""on or about April 16, 2007[,] through April 17, 2007,""  placed his penis in K.P.'s mouth, while defendant was  45 years old, K.P. was at least 13 years old but less  than 18 years old, and defendant ""held, as a substance  abuse treatment counselor, a position of trust in relation  to [K.P]."" Count II was identical to count I except that it  alleged that defendant placed his penis into K.P.'s anus.  Counts III and IV charged aggravated criminal sexual  abuse (id. 12-16(d)) based on the acts alleged,  respectively, in counts I and II, but without alleging a  position of trust.  5 On August 7, 2007, defendant moved to dismiss  counts I and II, alleging that the State did not prove the  element that defendant held a position of trust as a  substance abuse counselor, because the grand jury  heard evidence only that K.P. believed defendant was a  Page 2 of 11 substance abuse counselor, not that he was one in fact.  The motion alleged no other basis for dismissal. The  trial [*3]  court denied the motion.  6 After a jury trial, defendant was acquitted of counts I  and III but convicted of counts II and IV. The trial court  merged count IV into count II and sentenced defendant  to 15 years in prison. On appeal, he contended that (1)  he was denied his right to a speedy trial and his counsel  was ineffective for failing to seek dismissal on that  ground, (2) he was not proved guilty beyond a  reasonable doubt, as the State did not prove that he  held a position of trust, and (3) the trial court  2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U considered  an  improper  sentencing  factor.  See  generally People v. Turuc, 2012 IL App (2d) 100846-U.  We affirmed. Id. 1, 23.  7 In 2013, defendant initiated a proceeding under the  Act. Eventually, he filed a second amended petition,  alleging in part that his trial counsel had been ineffective  for ""failing to properly allege in a motion to dismiss  indictment [sic] that the grand jury was misled by false  testimony and deceptive evidence,"" i.e., the testimony of  Andrea Usry, a Lake County sheriff's detective, that K.P.  had stayed at defendant's substance abuse recovery  home in Wisconsin. Defendant noted that a trial court  may dismiss an indictment if the defendant establishes  that he has suffered a prejudicial denial of due [*4]   process. See People v. Oliver, 368 Ill. App. 3d 690, 694  (2006). He argued that the State violates due process if  it intentionally misleads the grand jury, uses known  perjured or false testimony, or presents other deceptive  or inaccurate evidence. See People v.DiVincenzo, 183  Ill. 2d 239, 257 (1998).1  8 To lay out the factual underpinnings of defendant's  postconviction claim, we reference in part the transcript  of the grand jury proceeding and other documents  attached to the second amended petition.  9 We begin with the grand jury transcript. Usry was the  sole witness before the grand jury. She testified that, in  April 2007, she started investigating K.P., a runaway  minor. Usry was already acquainted with K.P. from her  work as a school outreach officer in his district. She  learned that K.P.'s friend had received a call from a  phone that she then traced to defendant. She learned  that defendant was running a purported substance  abuse recovery home, ""Hote Haus,"" in Wisconsin.  Eventually, she spoke with K.P. K.P. told her that, at an  Alateen meeting, he told a woman that his parents had  kicked him out of the house. The woman gave him a  business card for Hote Haus, 1The second amended petition raised several other  claims, but they are not at issue here. 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U with defendant's name on it. She [*5]  told K.P. that he  could call the number and that defendant could help  him. At the time, defendant was 45 years old.  10 The examination continued: ""Q. And among other things [K.P] told you that he had  been with the defendant? A. Yes. Q. He had been living in that substance abuse recovery  home in Wisconsin? A. Yes. Q. And among other places that the defendant took him  was to a motel in Winthrop Harbor, Illinois? A. That's correct. Q. That's in Lake County? A. That is. Q. And that was on the evening of April 16, through the  morning of April 17, of 2007? A. Correct."" (Emphasis added.)  11 Usry testified that K.P. said that, late on April 16 or  early on April 17, 2007, defendant entered the bedroom  that he shared with K.P. and placed K.P.'s penis into his  mouth, without his consent. Soon, K.P. said he had ""  'had enough,' "" entered the other bedroom, and went to  sleep. Several hours later, as K.P. woke up, defendant  removed K.P.'s pants, rolled him over, and placed his  penis into K.P.'s anus, without K.P.'s consent.  12 Usry testified that she investigated Hote Haus  further and learned that defendant ""was running kind of  a halfway house for men that were recovering from  drugs and alcohol."" He rented 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U  [*6] the house and rented rooms to men undergoing  Page 3 of 11 recovery. Usry also found a web page that defendant  had created for Hote Haus. Her testimony continued: ""Q. [The web page] describe[d] Hote Haus as a  residence for people recovering from alcohol and who  need assistance and support of living situations in order  to facilitate the transition into independent community  life? A. Yes. Q. And [K.P.] believed that the defendant was actually a  substance abuse counselor? A. Correct.""  13  The  second  amended  petition's  allegations  continued as follows. Usry's testimony that K.P. told her  that he stayed at Hote Haus ""supported the inference  presented to the grand jury that [defendant] held himself  out as a substance abuse treatment counselor."" But  when she provided this testimony, Usry knew that it was  false. On April 30, 2007, Usry interviewed K.P. and  generated a lengthy report based thereon. Usry's report  never indicated that K.P. said or implied that he had  stayed at Hote Haus. On May 2, 2007, K.P. submitted a  written statement, which did not indicate that he stayed  at Hote Haus. Moreover, at defendant's trial, K.P.  testified that he never stayed at Hote Haus.  14 We summarize K.P.'s statement and Usry's [*7]   report to the extent necessary here.  15 In his statement, K.P. wrote that, on Friday, April 13,  2007, he ran away from home and went to an Alateen  meeting."" There, he asked about finding a place to stay.  A woman handed him a card with defendant's name and  phone number. K.P. called defendant, who picked him  up and let him stay at his home on Saturday night. On  Sunday, he stayed with defendant and several other  people in defendant's home. On Monday, he and  defendant met with Mike, a friend of 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U defendant. Afterward, defendant and K.P. spent the  night at the LaVilla Motel in Zion, where defendant  sexually assaulted K.P. on Monday evening (oral) and  Tuesday morning (anal). On Tuesday, after meeting  with Mike again, he and defendant stayed at the Skyline  Motel in Zion. On Wednesday, they met with Mike, after  which defendant and K.P. drove to a funeral in  Kentucky. On Friday, April 20, 2007, defendant drove  them back to Illinois, where they stayed at a motel. On  Saturday, K.P. stayed with a person he had met that  day. On Sunday, defendant drove K.P. home.  16 In her report, Usry disclosed the following  statements by K.P. After defendant picked him up on  Friday, April 13, 2017, they went to an [*8]  Alcoholics  Anonymous (AA) meeting until 1:00 a.m. on Saturday.  They then slept at defendant's home in Wisconsin. On  Saturday, defendant drove K.P. to Hote Haus to meet  some residents, then spent time with him at the home of  defendant's friend Mark. Defendant and K.P. spent  Saturday night at defendant's home. On Sunday, after  he and defendant met with Mike and Janice, also a  friend of defendant, he and defendant spent the night at  Janice's home. On Monday, after meeting with Mike,  they spent the night at the LaVilla Motel in Zion, where  defendant sexually assaulted K.P. On Tuesday night,  after spending the day together, they stayed at the  Skyline Motel in Zion without incident. On Wednesday  morning, defendant, having learned that his former AA  sponsor had passed away in Kentucky, drove to the  wake with K.P. and stayed two days without incident.  They returned to Illinois on Friday and stayed overnight  at a motel near the Wisconsin border. On Saturday  night, K.P. stayed at the home of a new acquaintance.  On Sunday, defendant drove K.P. home.  17 The second amended petition further alleged as  follows. In moving to dismiss the indictment, defendant's  trial counsel never alleged that Usry [*9]  provided false  or misleading testimony to the grand jury, even though  K.P.'s statement and Usry's report proved that K.P.  never 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U stayed at Hote Haus. The introduction of this false and  misleading evidence, even if unintentional, violated due  process. The violation was prejudicial, as the remaining  evidence would not have resulted in an indictment. An  element of count II, of which defendant was convicted,  was that defendant occupied a position of trust in  relation to K.P. At the grand jury proceeding, the State  presented evidence that defendant held himself out as a  substance abuse counselor and that he induced K.P. to  believe this by boarding him at Hote Haus. Without the  latter fact, the evidence would not have established  probable cause to find a position of trust and, hence, the  grand jury would not have indicted him on count II.  Thus, trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to  dismiss the indictment based on the false testimony,  and appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue  Page 4 of 11 that trial counsel was ineffective.  18 The petition proceeded to an evidentiary hearing.  Usry was the sole witness. She testified as follows. On  April 16, 2007, she began investigating K.P. [*10]  After  learning that K.P. had called a friend on defendant's  phone, and informing herself about Hote Haus, she  called defendant's number and left a message  requesting information on K.P. On April 22, 2007,  deputies brought K.P. and defendant to the sheriff's  office, where defendant spoke to Usry, but K.P. would  not. On April 30, 2007, after learning more about Hote  Haus, Usry interviewed K.P.  19 According to Usry, K.P. recounted that, after he and  defendant met, they overnighted at defendant's home in  Wisconsin. They also spent an unspecified number of  nights at Janice's home. During the daytimes, K.P. and  defendant attended several AA meetings and met with  friends of defendant. On April 16, 2007, K.P. and  defendant overnighted at the LaVilla Motel, where  defendant sexually assaulted K.P. On April 17, they  stayed at the nearby Skyline Motel without incident. On  April 18, defendant drove K.P. to Kentucky, where they  attended a funeral 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U and lodged together for two nights without incident.  When they drove back to Illinois on Friday, April 20, they  stayed together at a motel near the Wisconsin-Illinois  border without incident.  20 The examination continued: ""Q. So, during this time period, [*11]  [K.P.] never told  you that he; *** had spent any nights at Hotehaus [sic];  is that correct? A. That is correct. Q. He never told you that he was inside Hotehaus [sic];  is that correct? A. That's correct, I believe. Q. He did tell you that he was driven to that location on  two occasions; is that- A. Yes. Q. -correct? A. Yes. Q. Okay. But he didn't actually go inside the building; is  that right? A. To my understanding, no; or, if he did, I don't believe  he told me that he had gone inside. Q. Okay. *** to clarify: What [K.P.] told you *** was that  he hadn't gone inside? A. (Nodding) MR. ATWOOD [(DEFENSE ATTORNEY)]: Judge, can  the record reflect that the witness nodded her head? THE COURT: The record will so reflect.""  21 Usry testified that, later on, she went to Hote Haus  and observed its interior. In the interview, K.P. did not  describe the house's interior or point out anything that  Usry observed later in her visit. The examination  continued: 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U ""Q. During your interview *** did [K.P.] ever make any  statements to you that during that time period he was  engaged in *** what you could classify as substance  abuse counseling conversations with [defendant]? A. *** [F]rom my history of knowing [K.P.], I knew [*12]   that he was going to meetings for those issues. And  what he described was that [defendant] was helping  him. And, so, from what I knew of [K.P.] and what he  was going through and that that was a recovery house, I  umbrellaed [sic] that as that would be [sic] their  discussions; around sobriety.""  22 Asked whether K.P. elaborated on his statement  that defendant was ""helping"" him, Usry testified, ""No, no  more than that [K.P.] had received the card; and that  [defendant] helps people who are in recovery."" Asked  whether K.P. ever told her that defendant was his  ""substance abuse counselor,"" Usry testified, ""He did not  use those words, no.""  23 Usry testified that, before the grand jury, she said  nothing about K.P.'s attendance with defendant at AA  meetings. Further, other than the overnight at the  LaVilla Motel, she was not asked how long K.P. was  with defendant or where they stayed together. K.P. did  not tell her directly that defendant provided him with  shelter, food, and transportation. However, Usry inferred  as much based on K.P.'s age (14 years old) at the time  of the incident and his statement that he had no money  of his own during this period. Usry confirmed that  defendant paid for the [*13]  room at one motel where  Page 5 of 11 he and K.P. stayed. K.P. told Usry that, other than the  night of April 21-22, 2007, he and defendant stayed  overnight together each night while K.P. remained away  from home in late 2007. K.P. never told Usry that he and  defendant ever stayed at Hote Haus.  24 On cross-examination, Usry testified as follows. In  his interview, K.P. said that defendant took him to  several places for AA meetings. K.P. told Usry that,  when he ran away, he took no money with him but that  defendant and Mike, who were running a check-fraud  scheme, set up a 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U bank account for him. Asked whether K.P. gave her  ""any information that he understood about [Hote Haus],""  Usry testified, ""I don't recall."" K.P. said that the woman  at the Alateen meeting who gave him defendant's  business card told him that defendant ""had a sober- living place."" Asked to explain her grand jury testimony  that K.P. had believed that defendant was a substance  abuse counselor, Usry testified: ""A. Given the totality of the situation and of the  information that was piecemeal of saying [sic] that he  got a card. And I believe from reviewing my reports, *** the card ***  said counselor on it, perhaps. That [defendant] has a  place [*14]  for people that are recovering from alcohol  and drugs, for them to stay. When  I  interviewed-because  I  had  interviewed  [defendant] prior to [the] Grand Jury-when I interviewed  him, [defendant] told me that he was a counselor. And  [K.P.] kept saying that-that he gives people help.""  25 Usry testified that, during their interview, K.P. told  her more than once that defendant was helping him.  K.P. did not use the specific term ""substance abuse  counselor.""  26 The cross-examination continued: ""Q. Now, defense counsel asked you about the  statement regarding [K.P.] living at [Hote Haus]; and you answering [sic] affirmatively in  front of the Grand Jury? A. Yes. Q. Why did you answer affirmatively if you knew he  wasn't in the physical Hotehaus [sic] home? 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U A. Because, as stated in my reports, when I interviewed  [defendant], he stated that [K.P.] had told him that he  was 17, and that he was going to be 18 in a week or  two; and that he had to be 18 to live in the house. And during the interview, [defendant] told me that for the  first week that any one new *** wants to be a part of  Hotehaus [sic] has [sic] to stay with him 24/7. So, for me that was 24/7, the umbrella of-of the  Hotehaus [sic]. If it had not [*15]  been for the Hotehaus  [sic], [K.P.] would not have called; right? I mean that's- that was under the umbrella. I guess I look at it like-can I use an analogy? Q. If it explains why you believed- A. Okay. Q. -why you answered that affirmatively, yes. A. So, you are in jail. You have drug charges. And ***  you are sentenced or sent to Haymarket for three  months. Are you under the authority of Haymarket, or  are you still under the authority of the Court? Q. Okay. A. So, the Court still has an overreaching arm into ***  what that defendant can do while they are at  Haymarket; like, they can't have unsupervised time out  when they earn it, as opposed to people that were not  court-ordered.""  27 Usry testified that defendant told her that, to live at  his facility, a person must first be with an employee 24/7  for a week. While K.P. was with him, he was the only  employee.  28 Usry testified on redirect as follows. At the grand  jury proceeding, the prosecutor asked her specifically  whether K.P. told her that ""[h]e had been living in [Hote  Haus]"" and she answered, 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U ""Yes."" Asked whether she agreed that K.P. ""had not  been living at that facility,"" Usry testified, ""He had not  been staying in that physical facility, [*16]  correct.""  29 Asked whether defendant ever told her that he was  a substance abuse counselor, Usry testified that he did.  When asked about her testimony at defendant's trial- Page 6 of 11 that defendant told her he helped people stay clean and  sober but was not licensed as a counselor-Usry said  she did not recall giving that testimony.  30 Asked whether K.P. ever told her he was planning to  move into Hote Haus, Usry testified that she did not  recall. After refreshing her recollection with her report,  Usry testified that K.P. had not told her he planned to  stay at Hote Haus. K.P. did say that defendant would  help him find a place to stay.  31 The trial court admitted copies of the grand jury  transcript, Usry's report of her interview with K.P., K.P.'s  statement, and an excerpt from Usry's trial testimony.  32 After hearing arguments, the trial court denied the  petition. In explaining its reasons, the trial court framed  the issue as follows. If the court found that false  statements had been presented to the grand jury,  whether intentionally or otherwise, it had to determine  solely from the grand jury transcript whether, absent the  false statements, there was sufficient evidence to indict  defendant. If [*17]  so, there was no prejudice and a  motion to dismiss would have failed.  33 Next, the trial court found that Usry's grand jury  testimony that K.P. had believed that defendant was a  substance abuse counselor was not false. The court  explained that K.P.'s belief did not depend on whether  defendant actually was a substance abuse counselor,  much less on whether he was licensed.  34 The trial court then turned to Usry's grand jury  testimony that K.P. had been living at Hote Haus. The  trial court found this testimony ""[was], in fact, false."" The  court specifically found: 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U ""[K.P.] was at the Hote Haus, but he did not apparently  go in and he certainly was not living there."" Therefore,  the court noted, it would consider the sufficiency of the  grand jury evidence absent Usry's false statement. The  court continued: ""So I am going to determine whether or not I believe that  [K.P.] believed that the defendant was [a] substance  abuse counselor and the answer is yes, he did. Clearly  he did, and *** this case has a plethora of various  reasons why he believed [defendant] was a substance  abuse counselor, why he believed that he was in a  position of trust, but the whole context of the reason he  was with him [*18]  was because he believed he was  some form of substance abuse counselor. It was never testified to the Grand Jury that [K.P.]  believed [that] the defendant was a trained substance  abuse counselor. It was never testified [that K.P.]  believed that the defendant was a licensed substance  abuse counselor. That he was a substance abuse  counselor. Once again that is somebody who counsels  somebody on substance abuse. So the entire context under which he met [sic] after he'd  run away was at an Alateen meeting for substance  abuse. He is given a card *** identifying [defendant] with  the Hote Haus *** it was clear Hote Haus is something  and he can help you. Obviously that was the context. He  then called the defendant. He was picked up by the  defendant. He was at various points taken into  substance abuse meetings. He was taken to the Hote  Haus. He didn't go in. He was told the defendant ran it.  The entire context of the relationship here was that  [defendant] was a substance abuse counselor of some  form. There's no doubt *** for those reasons plus all the  reasons the Appellate Court set forth *** that [K.P.] did  believe that. So I decline *** to hold that was a  misstatement to the Grand Jury, *** but [*19]  let's say I  agreed *** that [K.P.] believed that the defendant was 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U a substance abuse counselor [sic] would there be  enough remaining for the indictment to stand. So, *** I don't think this was willful. I do think it was  sloppy and I do think it was lazy. It started with the  prosecutor and extended to the deputy. I see this  happen too often *** people clearly didn't read reports very carefully and  can ask questions that were wrong and the police too  often say yes, yes, yes, agreeing with everything also  not having reviewed the report. I don't think it was purposeful because there was an  abundance of evidence showing the position is of trust.  So, it would have been completely unnecessary. In  addition it was demonstrably capable of being rebutted.  [Usry's] report never said [K.P.] stated that. [Usry's] own  report never stated he was living there. He was there,  but he wasn't living there. And this by the way is not the  reason for my ruling. I am going to make that finding  [that] I don't think it was done purposely. That doesn't  mean the indictment couldn't be dismissed of course. So, what is left, let's assume I agree with the defense ***  Page 7 of 11 what is left is the child is a 14-year-old runaway. [*20]   *** not somebody who knew the defendant at all. *** So  a runaway, 14 years old was with [defendant] and using  his phone. Furthermore, [defendant], who [was] 45 years [old] at  the time, was taking the 14-year-old to various different  places including, once again I am not going to consider  the recovery part in Wisconsin because that's wrong, to  a motel in Winthrop Harbor. No other adults around, no  parents around, not at this house, not somebody he  knew. He was, therefore, making decisions, transporting  the child, deciding to stay at a motel, giving a phone  number where he could be reached which is his phone  number, in essence he was 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U in loco parentis in every way to [K.P.], given the age,  given lack of other parents, given his legal status as [a]  runaway, given him being away from home in need of  substance abuse treatment, for all those reasons I find  that even were I to agree that [K.P.] did or didn't believe  the defendant was a substance abuse counselor, even if  I agree with the defense on that I still find that there is  sufficient evidence in the remainder of the transcript to  sustain the indictments. For that reason, the defense has failed to show  ineffective assistance of counsel  under [*21]  either *** incompetence [or prejudice] ***  so the motion [sic] is denied.""   35 This timely appeal followed.   36 II. ANALYSIS   37 On appeal, defendant contends that he proved that  his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to  dismiss count II of the indictment on the ground that it  was obtained through Usry's false and deceptive  testimony that K.P. stayed at Hote Haus.  38 At an evidentiary hearing in a proceeding under the  Act, the defendant must prove, by the preponderance of  the evidence, a constitutional violation in the proceeding  that resulted in his conviction or sentence. People v.  Coleman, 2013 IL 113307, 92. We must accept the trial  court's factual findings unless they are manifestly  erroneous. People v. Carter, 2017 IL App (1st) 151297,  132. We review de novo issues of law. People v.  English, 2013 IL 112890, 23.  39 To establish that trial counsel was ineffective,  defendant had to prove that (1) counsel performed  unreasonably and (2) it is reasonably probable that, but  for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the  proceeding would have been different. Strickland v.  Washington, 466 U.S. 688, 694 (1984); People v.  Albanese, 104 Ill. 2d 504, 525 (1984).  2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U  40  In  contending  that  trial  counsel  performed  unreasonably in failing to move to dismiss count II on  the basis of Usry's false statement, defendant first notes  that, as the trial court found, the statement was  false [*22]  and deceptive. K.P. never stayed at Hote  Haus, and Usry had no basis to testify that he did or  even that he ever went inside the building.  41 At the evidentiary hearing, Usry admitted that K.P.  never stayed at Hote Haus and that she had no basis to  believe even that he ever went inside. In explaining why  she told the grand jury that K.P. stayed there, she  construed ""staying"" at Hote Haus to include staying in  totally separate locations, mostly in other states, with  the person who ran Hote Haus. Needless to say, the  grand jurors probably did not construe her testimony in  this unique and tortured manner. By testifying that K.P.  stayed at Hote Haus-or, perhaps we should say,  agreeing with the prosecutor's testimony that he did- Usry implied to any reasonable hearer that K.P. spent at  least one night there. Thus, defendant contends that (1)  the trial court erred in finding that Usry did not commit  perjury; and (2) even if Usry's statement was not  perjurious, it was false and deceptive, which warranted  moving to dismiss count II.2  42 Based on the foregoing, defendant contends that  trial counsel performed unreasonably because, from  K.P.'s statement and Usry's police report, counsel knew  or [*23]  should have known that K.P. did not stay at  Hote Haus and that Usry had no basis to testify that he  had. Defendant contends that counsel's mistake was  prejudicial because, absent the statement that K.P. had  been a resident of the substance abuse facility, there  was no probable cause to believe that defendant had  held a 2Third, defendant contends that, although there is  conflicting authority on whether a subsequent conviction  cures a due process violation such as the one here, the  better rule is that it does not. In view of our resolution of  the appeal, we need not address this issue.  2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U Page 8 of 11 position of trust relative to K.P. Defendant contends that  Usry testified to almost nothing about the relationship  between defendant and K.P. except that defendant took  K.P. to a motel one night and that K.P. believed that  defendant was a substance abuse counselor.  43 The State responds first that the trial court properly  found that Usry's testimony that K.P. stayed at Hote  Hause, although false, was not perjury. Based on this,  the State argues that there was no due process violation  or that, at the least, the dismissal would not have been  with prejudice. The State contends second that the court  properly [*24]  found no prejudice because sufficient  other evidence supported count II's allegation of a  position of trust. Finally, returning to the performance  prong, the State argues that trial counsel's choice of  strategy was reasonable. Thus, the State concludes,  defendant did not prove either prong of the Strickland  test for ineffective assistance.3  44 The nub of this appeal is whether, absent the false  testimony, there was sufficient evidence for the grand  jury to find probable cause that defendant occupied ""a  position of trust"" relative to K.P. See 720 ILCS 5/12- 13(a)(4) (West 2006) (a defendant commits criminal  sexual assault when, inter alia, the defendant ""held a position of trust,  authority or supervision in relation to the victim[ ]"").  Obviously, the answer to this question depends on the  meaning of the term ""position of trust."" Yet neither party  attempts to define this term according to case authority  or established principles of statutory construction.  Defendant says no more than that the grand jury heard  ""no evidence *** from which it could conclude that  [defendant] being a substance abuse counselor 3The State also contends that the trial court properly  found that Usry testified truthfully that K.P. believed  defendant [*25]  was a substance abuse counselor.  Defendant, however, concedes this point. 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U meant that K.P. trusted him."" Defendant appears to  imply that, under the statute, the minor's trust in the  adult is both necessary and sufficient to create a  position of trust. Not only is this dubious on its face, but  defendant cites no authority for it. The State, for its part,  does not address the meaning of ""position of trust"" at  all.  45 The meaning of ""position of trust"" is crucial to  deciding whether the grand jury heard sufficient  evidence of this element. Therefore, we shall address  the issue without the parties' assistance. Fortunately,  the case law is well established, consistent, and  straightforward.  46 The stem case is People v. Secor, 279 Ill. App. 3d  389 (1996). There, the defendant was convicted of  criminal sexual assault based in part on the allegation  that he occupied ""a position of trust, authority, or  supervision"" (720 ILCS 5/12-13(a)(4) (West 1994)) over  the minor victim. Secor at 391-92. On appeal, he contended that (1) the  evidence did not prove beyond a reasonabledoubt any  of the three alternative relationships (trust, authority,  supervision) with the victim and (2) section 12-13(a)(4) was unconstitutionally vague. Id.  at 392-93.  47 On the first issue, the appellate court noted the  following [*26]  trial evidence. The 14-year-old victim  testified that he and his 11-year-old brother spent a  night at the defendant's house visiting his son. Id. at  391. The victim had been there numerous times and  spent the night there twice. Id. While the victim lay in bed, the defendant sexually  fondled him several times. Id. The victim's mother  testified that her family had known the defendant for  about 10 years and that her children had overnighted at  his house approximately six times. Id. at 392.  48 The appellate court held that the State had proved  beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's relationship  to the victim fit within section 12-13(a)(4), as the  evidence ""raise[d] a strong inference of trust and  supervision."" (Emphasis added.) Id. at 394. Defendant's  function in the relationship could be characterized, ""at a  minimum, as that of baby sitter [sic] or chaperone.""  2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U Id. On the evening at issue, he assumed ""a parental or  quasi-parental role."" Id. Further, his family and the  victim's family had been friends for 10 years, which  would likely have generated mutual trust. Id.  49 On the second issue, because there was no  statutory definition of ""position of trust, authority or  supervision in relation to the victim,"" the court  relied [*27]  on the presumption that words used in a  statute have their ordinary and popularly understood  meanings. Id. at 391, 396 (citing Page 9 of 11 People v Caffrey, 97 Ill. 2d 526, 530 (1983)). The court  relied on a dictionary definition of "" 'trust' "" as ""  '[c]onfidence in the integrity, ability, character, and truth  of a person ***[;] [s]omething committed into the care of another.' "" Id. at  396 (quoting American Heritage Collegiate Dictionary  1300 (2d ed. 1985)). The court held that section 13- 4(a)(4) was not unconstitutionally vague. Id. The court  continued: ""It is evident that, in enacting section 12-3(a)(4), the  legislature sought to prevent sex offenses by *** those  in whom [a] child has placed his trust, such as the  defendant. It is the trust that makes the child particularly  vulnerable, and it is the betrayal of that trust that makes  the offense particularly devastating."" Id.  50 Several appellate court opinions have adopted  Secor's definition of ""trust"" and its explanation of the  legislature's decision to increase the grade of a sex  offense when the defendant occupies a position of trust  in relation to the victim. See People v. Miki, 2020 IL App  (2d) 190862,  55; People v. Feller, 2012 IL App (3d) 110164, 14-15;  People v. Reynolds, 294 Ill. App. 3d 58, 65, 68-69  (1997).4 4On defendant's direct appeal, we also followed Secor  and its reasoning. See Turuc, 2012 IL App (2d) 100846, 11. 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U  51 With this necessary groundwork laid, we now turn to  the specific issues [*28]  raised on appeal.  52 The parties disagree on whether the trial court's  finding that Usry's false testimony was not perjury was  manifestly erroneous. We need not resolve this  disagreement. We note the general principle that, in  addition to the grounds specified by statute (see 725  ILCS 5/114-1(a) (West 2020)), an indictment may be  dismissed if the defendant established with certainty a  violation of due process. See People v. Wolfe, 114 Ill.  App. 3d 841, 844-45 (1983). In DiVincenzo, our  supreme court stated, ""The due process rights of a  defendant may be violated if the prosecutor deliberately  or intentionally misleads the grand jury, uses known  perjured or false testimony, orpresents other deceptive  or inaccurate evidence."" (Emphasis added.) DiVincenzo,  183 Ill. 2d at257. This plainly means that, to establish a  violation, a defendant need not establish that the State's  use of deceptive or inaccurate evidence was intentional.  See People v. Basile, 2022 IL App (2d) 210740, 16, No.  129026 (Jan. 25, 2023) (pet. for leave to appeal  allowed); Oliver, 368 Ill. App. 3d at 696.  53 As the trial court properly found that Usry's  testimony that K.P. stayed at Hote Haus was false and  deceptive, defendant established a due process  violation. We next consider whether defendant proved  that the violation was prejudicial.  54 We note that the trial court found first that Usry  testified  truthfully  that  K.P.  believed [*29]   that  defendant was a substance abuse counselor. Defendant  does not contend that this finding was manifestly  erroneous, and we conclude that it was more than  sufficiently supported by Usry's grand jury testimony  about what K.P. told her of the events at the Alateen  meeting that led to his contact with defendant. Further,  K.P.'s statement, Usry's report, and testimony from  defendant's trial bolstered the court's finding that Usry  was truthful in testifying that K.P. believed defendant  was a substance abuse counselor. 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U  55 Next, the trial court found that Usry's testimony,  even absent the false statement that K.P. had stayed at  Hote Haus, established probable cause to believe that  defendant occupied a position of trust relative to K.P.  This conclusion was well founded. K.P. entrusted  himself to defendant's care by calling him and placing  confidence in him to provide him with urgently needed  help, i.e., a place to stay indefinitely. Given the context  of the call and defendant's occupation as shown on his  business card, defendant likely understood that K.P.  would look to him for help with his substance abuse  problem. It was highly probable that, when K.P. called  defendant, they discussed [*30]  their mutual interest in  defendant's provision of counseling to K.P.  56 Moreover, as the trial court noted, Usry's further  testimony, limited as it was, bolstered this evidence of a  relationship of trust. Partly, this came from the unequal  positions of K.P. and defendant: one was a teenage  runaway in need of shelter and lacking any means to  support himself on his own, and the other was a 45- year-old who took him in and supported him. K.P.'s  dependence on defendant implied a relationship of trust- he had to trust defendant to do what the minor could not  do himself, and defendant knew it. The subsequent  events bore this out. For some period, even if only a day  or  two,  defendant  decided  on  K.P.'s  housing,  transportation, and food, paying for those essentials. Page 10 of 11  57 Defendant contends that Usry's testimony ""did not  include the information that K.P. and [defendant] spent  days together during which [defendant] fed and housed  K.P.-information that would have provided probable  cause that [defendant] held a position of trust.""  Defendant's assertion is correct in the most literal  sense: Usry did not testify directly that K.P. and  defendant spent any specific number of days together  during which [*31]  defendant fed and housed K.P. (as  we shall note later, this omission is surprising and  disturbing.) However, Usry testified to facts from which  this conclusion was a reasonable inference-indeed, the  most reasonable. A young runaway 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U with no means of supporting himself sought shelter from  an adult who took him in and accompanied him at,  ""among other places,"" a motel where they shared a  room. Usry's testimony did not specify that K.P. and  defendant were together on days other than April 16  and 17, 2007, but it provided probable cause to believe  that,  at  least  for  these  two  days,  defendant  accompanied K.P. and fed and housed him-which, he  now grants, established a position of trust. Moreover,  the mention of ""other places"" (albeit in a leading  question by the prosecutor) allowed an inference that  K.P. and defendant were together for more than two  days.  58 Our conclusion is consistent with the determinative  case law that we (if not the parties) have discussed.  Even from Usry's limited testimony (minus the false  statement), there was probable cause to believe that  K.P. placed "" '[c]onfidence in the integrity, ability,  character, and truth of a person' "" and "" 'committed [his  well-being] into [*32]  the care of another.' "" Secor, 279  Ill. App. 3d at 396 (quoting American Heritage Collegiate  Dictionary 1300 (2d ed. 1985)). Usry did not testify to a  long-standing relationship of dependence of K.P. on  defendant, but the case law did not require one. In  Secor, the defendant was alone with the victim for an  evening, but the court still concluded that there was a  position of trust because their relationship was, ""at a  minimum, as that of baby sitter [sic] or chaperone."" Id. at  394. Even counting only the events of April 16-17, 2007,  defendant's relationship to the victim was at least as  extensive as that which Secor concluded was sufficient  under section 12-3(a)(4). (Although the Secor court also  noted that the defendant's family and the victim's family  had long known and interacted with each other, it  appears that this was not crucial for the court but only  further evidence of a relationship of trust. See id.). Also,  in Feller, the defendant assisted a blind girl with swimming  in a lake and then sexually assaulted her,the court held  that a relationship of trust was proved beyond a  reasonable doubt because (1) the victim, who had not  known the defendant before the day of the offense,  testified that she would 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U not have gone swimming with someone whom  she [*33]  did not trust; and (2) common sense dictated  that guiding a blind person into an unknown body of  water established a position of trust. Feller, 2012 IL App  (3d) 110164, 4, 6, 14. The duration of their  acquaintanceship was not material. Id. at 15. Again, the present case, which required only  probable cause and not proof beyond a reasonable  doubt, presented facts at least as compelling for finding  a position of trust.  59 We turn to the ultimate issue: whether defendant  proved that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to  move to dismiss count II based on Usry's false grand  jury testimony. The answer is no. Defendant did not  show a reasonable probability that, had trial counsel  filed the motion, the result of the proceeding would have  been different. Even excluding the false testimony, there  was ample evidence to indict defendant for criminal  sexual assault based on a position of trust. Thus, the  trial court properly denied his postconviction petition.  60 By affirming the judgment, however, we do not  mean to condone the provision of false information to  the grand jury. Although the trial court did not find that  Usry's  misstatement  was  intentional,  the  court  concluded that her lapse resulted from conduct that was  ""sloppy"" [*34]  and ""lazy"" on the part of both her and the  prosecutor. We agree. The prosecutor essentially fed  Usry much of her testimony, most problematically in the  question that triggered Usry's false statement. This  question was not merely leading-it was really a  statement of fact with a raised inflection at the end.  Much more importantly, it was a false statement of fact.  Usry, for whatever reason, agreed with the blatant  misstatement.  61 Moreover, the State made only a modest effort to  present evidence to the grand jury that defendant  occupied a position of trust as to K.P. Usry's lengthy  report detailed how defendant and K.P. spent more than  a week rarely separate from each other, traveling  Page 11 of 11 together, attending AA meetings and other activities  together, and lodging together. The prosecutor asked  about none of 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U this other than the initial contact between K.P. and  defendant and the events of April 16-17 at the motel and  otherwise made only a cryptic reference to ""other places  that the defendant took [K.P.]"" By adding easily  available evidence, the State could have avoided the  postconviction claim that led to this appeal. Judicial  resources have been expended to resolve an issue that  could have [*35]  easily been avoided."
"Phillips v. Cap. Internal Med. Assocs., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217760.pdf","[*1] OPINION This is an action bringing federal and state claims  against a doctor and his employer under Title VII of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, and the  Michigan state equivalent. Plaintiffs, a nurse practitioner  and a doctor, both of whom worked with or for  Defendants, bring suit on counts of assault, battery,  hostile work environment, and intentional infliction of  emotional distress. Before the Court is a motion to set  aside the default (ECF No. 16) entered against the  individual defendant, Joseph Kozlowski. For the reasons  stated below, the Court will grant the motion. I. BACKGROUND Plaintiffs Alexis Phillips and Sarah Denham worked at  Capital Internal Medicine Associates (""CIMA"") between October 2018 and  October 2022. (Compl. ¶¶ 14, 222.) Denham is still  employed as a primary care physician at CIMA, while  Phillips, a nurse practitioner, has since left the practice.  Their allegations stem from their interactions with  another doctor at CIMA, Joseph Kozlowski. Over the  course of four years, Phillips, especially, claims she was  subject to verbal and sometimes physical harassment at  Kozlowski's hands, beginning when she was a student at CIMA under his supervision. Denham, too,  claims  Kozlowski  made  inappropriate  comments  towards her; [*2]  however, her primary allegations  revolve around her efforts to push CIMA leadership to  discipline Dr. Kozlowski. Despite relaying detailed  descriptions of harassment and inappropriate behavior  directed at her and others, Denham says she was  consistently rebuffed or ignored. On April 27, 2023, Phillips and Denham filed a  complaint against CIMA and Kozlowski bringing claims  under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the  Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act (""ELCRA"") - the Michigan  analogue to Title VII. The complaint details six counts  against Dr. Kozlowski: 1) sex discrimination in violation  of Title VII, 2) sex discrimination in violation of the  ELCRA, 3) hostile work environment under Title VII, 4)  hostile work environment under the ELCRA, 5) assault  and battery, and 6) intentional infliction of emotional  distress. (Compl. ¶¶ 225-274.) CIMA filed a timely answer to the complaint (ECF No.  7). Dr. Kozlowski, on the other hand, did not. He was  served by Plaintiffs on June 9, 2023; however, the  summons was botched. Although the caption listed him  as a defendant in the action, it was addressed to CIMA  alone. (Summons, ECF No. 16-3, PageID.181.) Below  the caption, in the section marked ""Proof of Service,""  CIMA was again listed [*3]  as the recipient for the  summons. Likely recognizing the mistake, the process  server - or someone else - crossed out ""Capital Internal  Medicine Associates P.C."" and scrawled ""Joseph  Kozlowski"" above it in pen. Id. Despite the sloppy nature  of the document, court rules dictated that Kozlowski had  Page 2 of 4 until June 30 - twenty-one days from service - to  respond. (Summons.) When no answer came by the  30th, Plaintiffs moved for an entry of default as to  Kozlowski on July 3, 2023. (Appl. for Entry of Default,  ECF No. 12.) The clerk entered the 2 default that same day. (Default, ECF No. 14.) On July  20, 2023, Kozlowski filed a motion to set aside the  default. II. LEGAL STANDARD Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires  that a plaintiff serve a defendant with a summons and a  copy of the complaint.

Aug. 24, 2022) (citing  Friedman v. Est. of Presser, 929 F.2d 1151, 1156 (6th  Cir. 1991)). Therefore, courts hold plaintiffs to a high  standard for service of process, requiring ""more than  just actual knowledge of the action by a defendant."" Id.  Without proper service, a court may not exercise  personal jurisdiction over a defendant, and any ruling  made by the court as to that party is void. See Omni  Capital Int'l v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., Ltd., 484 U.S. 97, 104  (1987). When a summons and complaint are [*4]  properly  served on a party, that party must answer or respond  within the time provided by Rule 12 of the Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(1). If the  defendant fails to respond, then the plaintiff may submit  an application for entry of a default with the clerk of  court. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a). A party against whom a  default is entered may move to have the default set  aside under Rule 55(c). The Court ""may set aside an  entry of default for good cause."" Fed R. Civ. P. 55(c). III. ANALYSIS Kozlowski argues that the default entered against him  should be set aside on two bases. First, that the Court  never obtained personal jurisdiction over him because  Plaintiff's service of process was fatally defective under  Rule 4, and any ruling made by the Court against him is  therefore void. Second, that there is good cause for the  Court to set aside the entry of default 3 against him under Rule 55(c). It is not necessary to  address Kozlowski's ""good cause"" argument because  the Court concludes that it lacks personal jurisdiction  over him. A. Plaintiffs' Service of Process was Insufficient and  the Court Lacks Personal Jurisdiction Courts may only exercise personal jurisdiction over a  defendant who has been properly served. See Omni  Capital, 484 U.S. at 104. Rule 4(a)(1) lays out the  necessary contents of a proper summons. One  requirement is it must ""be [*5]  directed to the  defendant."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(a)(1)(B). Kozlowski argues that because his  summons was directed to CIMA in the caption, and only  indirectly named him elsewhere in the document, the  service was constitutionally deficient. Courts are divided on how strictly to hold plaintiffs to the  requirements of Rule 4(a). Compare Birch v. Sprint/Nextel Corp., No. 15-cv-01901,  2016 WL 8652260, at *3 (D. Colo. May 17, 2016)  (holding that naming the wrong defendant in a summons  did not invalidate service of process when the defendant  had actual notice of the suit against him) with Hampton  v. McMillin, No. 3:09-cv-406, 2010 WL 3167885, at *1  (S.D. Miss. July 6, 2010) (holding that process was  insufficient when plaintiff named the wrong party) and  Gartin v. Par Pharm. Cos., Inc., 289 F.App'x 688, 691  n.3 (5th Cir. 2008) (indicating that the sufficiency of  service of process may be challenged where a plaintiff  fails to name the party being served). The Sixth Circuit has never directly addressed this  issue; however, as previously discussed, it has ruled  that compliance with the requirements of Rule 4 is no  mere technicality. In Friedman, the court considered  whether an action should have been dismissed for lack  of personal jurisdiction where the defendant never  returned  an  acknowledgment  of  service  despite  agreement between the parties that the defendants  were aware of the suit and did not suffer prejudice as a  result of the defective process. Friedman, 929 F.2d at  1155. In holding that the district court erred [*6]  by  failing 4 to dismiss the action, the court reasoned that, ""[d]ue to  the integral relationship between service of process and  due process requirements . . . actual knowledge of an  action"" is no cure for ""a technically defective service of  process."" Id. at 1156. The Court in Friedman did not  Page 3 of 4 consider how this principle applied to Rule 4 (a)(1), but  its reasoning aligns with holdings in other circuits in  which the failure to follow each of the requirements of  Rule 4(a)(1)(A)-(G) ""is fatal to the plaintiff's case."" See  Ayres v. Jacobs & Crumplar, P.A., 99 F.2d 565, 569 (3d  Cir. 1996) (dismissing a case when the summons was  not signed and sealed by the clerk as required by Rule  4(a)(1)(F) and (G)). Courts in this Circuit have interpreted Friedman to  impose a strict reading of Rule 4 (a)(1) on plaintiffs. For  example, in In re Bavelis, 453 B.R. 832 (Bankr. S.D.  Ohio 2011), a bankruptcy court in Ohio considered  whether it was appropriate to exercise personal  jurisdiction over defendants who had not been named in  the plaintiff's summons. Relying on Friedman, it  concluded that Sixth Circuit precedent supported the  notion that ""a defendant who is not named in [a] summons has not effectively been served and  service of process on that defendant, as well as the  process itself, is therefore insufficient."" Id. at 862. The  court in Bavelis ultimately held that it lacked personal  jurisdiction over the unnamed defendants [*7]  and  instructed the plaintiff to correct their pleadings and re- serve the defendants. Id. at 865. Here, as in Bavelis, whether or not Defendant Kozlowski  had actual notice of the lawsuit, the summons was  defective. Rule 4(a)(1)(B) requires that a summons be  ""directed to the defendant."" Although Kozlowski is  named as a defendant in the caption of the summons,  the ""TO"" section of the caption only names CIMA. Id.  Kozlowski is further named underneath the caption in  pen over the crossed-out name of his co-defendant.  (Summons,  PageID.181.)  However,  that  section  concerns the process server, not the party to be served,  and it does not clearly state that 5 the summons is ""directed to"" Kozlowski. Although  Kozlowski might have been able to glean who the  defendants were supposed to be from the contents of  the complaint and the context of the summons, Rule  4(a)(1)(B) requires more explicit language. Plaintiffs contend that this case is distinguishable from  Bavelis. They point to Conner-Cooley v. AIG Life  Brokerage, 282 F.R.D. 431 (E.D. Wis. 2012), as a more  appropriatecomparison. In Conner-Cooley, the court  entered a default and default judgment against a  defendant who never responded to the plaintiff's  complaint  which  clearly  identified  the  intended  defendant. In seeking to have the defaults set aside, the  defendant-corporation [*8]  argued that service was  defective because the plaintiff had named ""AIG Life  Brokerage"" in the summons rather than the more  appropriate ""American General Life Companies LLC.""  Id. at 435. The court held for the plaintiffs on the basis  that ""service is proper despite a misnomer"" if the  complaint is ""not susceptible to any reasonable doubt or  confusion about who it was the plaintiff intended to sue."" Id. (citing Tremps v. Ascot Oils, Inc., 561 F.2d 41, 44  (7th Cir. 1977)). Plaintiff's reliance on Conner-Cooley is unavailing. As  indicated above, different circuits treat Rule 4 differently.  Some allow plaintiffs more leeway. See, e.g., United  Food & CommercialWorkers Union, Locals 197, et al. v.  Alpha Beta Co., 736 F.2d 1371, 1382 (9th Cir. 1984)  (""Rule 4 is a flexible rule which is liberally construed to uphold  service as long as defendant receives sufficient notice  of the complaint."") The Seventh is one such circuit. In  Conner-Cooley, the Wisconsin district court followed  Seventh  Circuit  precedent  that  emphasizes  the  importance of actual knowledge of a suit over technical  compliance with Rule 4. See Tremps, 561 F.2d at 44 (""A  defendant who is clearly identified by a summons and  complaint and who has been served with those  documents may not avoid the jurisdiction of the district  court merely because he is incorrectly named in them."").  The holding in Conner-Cooley was based, in large part,  on the 6 premise that the misnaming in that case [*9]  did not  create ""any reasonable doubt or confusion"" about who  the plaintiff intended to sue. Conner-Cooley, 282 F.R.D.  at 435. In contrast, the holding in Friedman suggests that such considerations are not  relevant, and the vast majority of courts in this Circuit  downplay the importance of actual knowledge and  instead emphasize the significance of process. See,  e.g., Bavelis, 453 B.R. at 63; PNC Mortg. v. Rhiel, Nos.  2:10-cv-578, 2:10-cv-579, 2011 WL 1043949, at *5  (S.D. Ohio Mar. 18, 2011); Ohio ex rel. Dewine v.  Superior Fibers, Inc., No. 2:14-cv-1843, 2017 WL  6055159, at *4-5 (S.D. Ohio Dec. 7, 2017); Arthur v.  Litton LoanServicing LP, 249 F. Supp. 2d 924, 927 (E.D.  Tenn. 2002); Engler v. Arnold, No. 4:14-cv-2442, 2015  Page 4 of 4 WL 4213642, at *2 (N.D. Ohio July 10, 2015). Even if the Sixth Circuit followed the body of law that  emphasized actual knowledge, the result may well be  the same. Unlike the defendant in Conner-Cooley,  Kozlowski proffered evidence that he was unsure of the  intended defendant to this suit. See Conner-Cooley, 282  F.R.D. at 435 (""[Defendant] does not, for example  submit an affidavit from [its lawyer] stating that when it  received the summons and complaint it could not  determine which, if any, of its clients plaintiffs intended  to sue.""). Kozlowski submitted such an affidavit stating  that ""my delay in answering the Complaint was . . .  partially due to the confusion over the summons.""  (Kozlowski Aff. ¶ 4, ECF No. 16-2.) Therefore, it would be reasonable to  conclude that the technically defective summons had a  real-world impact on Kozlowski's actual knowledge of  Plaintiffs intent to bring suit against him. Thus, this  summons provided insufficient [*10]  process even  under a laxer standard than Sixth Circuit precedent  demands."
"Rice Enters., LLC v. RSUI Indem. Co., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217212.pdf","OPINION Plaintiff, Rice Enterprises, LLC, brings the within action  against Defendants, RSUI Indemnity Company and  Zenith Insurance Company, concerning insurance  coverage for defense and indemnification based upon a  pending Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas  lawsuit (L.H. lawsuit). (ECF No. 20). Specifically, Rice's Amended Complaint avers claims for  Declaratory Judgment (Counts I and II), Breach of  Contract (Counts III, IV, and V), and Statutory Bad Faith  under 42 Pa.C.S. § 8371 (Counts VI and VII) due to 1)  RSUI's denial of indemnification under Rice's Directors  and Officers [*2]  Liability policy (D&O policy); 2) RSUI's  denial of defense and indemnification under Rice's  Commercial Umbrella Liability policy (Umbrella policy);  and 3) Zenith's denial of defense and indemnification  under Rice's Employers' Liability policy (Zenith policy).  Id. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), Zenith moves for  dismissal, contending that it owes no duty to defend  and/or indemnify under the Zenith policy because of the  policy's exclusion language, and that Rice's claim for  statutory bad faith fails as a result. (ECF No. 23). RSUI  moves for partial dismissal, contending that it owes no  duty to defend and/or indemnify under the Umbrella  policy, and that Rice's claim for statutory bad faith fails.  (ECF No. 21). Upon consideration of Defendants' Motions (ECF Nos.  21 and 23), the respective briefs (ECF Nos. 22, 24, 27,  30, and 31), and for the following reasons, Zenith's  Motion to Dismiss will be granted, and RSUI's Partial  Motion to Dismiss will be granted. I. Background A. L.H. Lawsuit On or around September 21, 2021, L.H., a minor, by  and through her parents and natural guardians T.H. and  B.H. (collectively, ""L.H.""), filed a civil action in the Court  of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania,  Page 2 of 8 against [*3]  Rice Enterprises, McDonald's USA, LLC,  and McDonald's Corporation (collectively Rice and  McDonald's). (ECF No. 20 at ¶ 6 and ECF No. 20-1).  The plaintiffs allege that on October 25, 2020, L.H., then  14 years old, applied for a job with McDonald's via the  McDonald's Careers website. Id. at ¶ 27. L.H. was hired  to work as a ""Crew Member"" at a McDonald's restaurant  operated by Rice Enterprises. Id. at ¶ 36. L.H. allegedly  did not receive the full three-day orientation training that  she was promised, nor did she receive any training  concerning sexual harassment and reporting of the  same. Id. at ¶¶ 37-44. In January 2021, a new manager, Walter A. Garner,  was hired, and he thereafter supervised L.H.'s shift. Id.  at ¶ 46. ""Unbeknownst to [L.H.],"" Garner was hired,  even though he was (and remains) publicly registered  as a ""Lifetime Offender"" on Megan's Law Public Report  following  his  2003  guilty  plea,  conviction,  and  incarceration for sexual assault of a 10-year-old girl. Id.  at ¶ 47. L.H. alleges that ""Garner began sexually  harassing [her] almost immediately after they began  working together on the same shift."" Id. at ¶ 48. Other  McDonald's  employees  and  managers  allegedly  overheard Garner's [*4]  verbal harassment. Id. at ¶¶  49-50. L.H. alleges that Garner's comments soon  ""became both more overt and more frequent,"" and then  ""Garner began touching [L.H.] inappropriately, including  brushing up against her while walking by, touching her  hair, and touching other parts of her body."" Id. at ¶ 55.  L.H. avers that ""Garner was also abusing and harassing  other minor McDonald's employees"" at the same that he  was harassing L.H. Id. at ¶ 58. L.H. and two other  employees allegedly informed McDonald's ""about the  harassment they were experiencing and the identity of  the manager,"" but it is alleged that ""McDonald's did not  take any steps to stop the harassment."" Id. at ¶¶ 65, 67.  In mid-February 2021, during a work shift , Garner  followed L.H. into the bathroom at the McDonald's  restaurant and raped her. Id. at ¶ 71. Rice allegedly learned about Garner's harassment only  after an unrelated theft on the premises prompted Rice  to review surveillance footage, which coincidentally  showed Garner groping L.H. Id. at ¶¶ 77-78. Although  ""McDonald's management spoke to Garner about the  conduct viewed on video,"" Garner was neither  disciplined nor fired. Id. at ¶ 79. This harassment  allegedly continued [*5]  until Garner was arrested in  mid-April 2021. Id. ¶¶ 80-86. L.H. has alleged a single claim for negligence against  Rice and McDonald's. Id. ¶¶ 116-119. It is alleged that  Rice  and  McDonald's  were  negligent  in  failing  adequately train L.H. ""on how to identify, address, and  report incidents of sexual harassment, sexual assault  and/or battery, and sexually hostile work environment"";  and in ""[f]ailing to adequately perform screening and/or  background checks on Garner prior to hiring"" him; and  in ""[f]ailing to adequately supervise Garner""; and in  ""failing to properly address"" employee ""complaints of  harassment and abuse""; and in""[f]ailing to publish and  distribute policies and procedures on sexual harassment  and reporting."" Id. at ¶ 117. B. Present Lawsuit 1. Allegations against Zenith Rice alleges it was the named insured on a Zenith  Employers' Liability policy. Id. at ¶ 40. On August 15,  2022, Rice provided Zenith with notice of L.H.'s  Allegheny County Complaint, and requested Zenith's  defense and indemnification for that lawsuit. Id. at ¶ 41.  On September 19, 2022, Zenith sent Rice a coverage  denial letter. Id. at ¶ 43. Zenith relies upon two  exclusions for denying coverage. Id. at ¶ 44. [*6]  Rice  argues that Zenith's coverage denial under said  exclusions is nonsensical and meritless. Id. at ¶ 50. Rice  avers claims against Zenith for Declaratory Judgment  (Count I), Breach of Contract (Count III), and Bad Faith  Pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 8371 (Count VI). 2. Rice's allegations against RSUI Rice avers that it is the named insured on an RSUI  Directors and Officers Liability policy. (ECF No. 20 at ¶  25). In or around September 22, 2021, Rice submitted  the L.H. lawsuit to RSUI, requesting defense and  indemnification under the D&O policy. Id. at ¶ 26. On  September 29, 2021 and December 2, 2021, RSUI  acknowledged that it owed a duty to defend Rice for the  L.H. Lawsuit under the D&O policy. Id. at ¶ 27.  However, on March 3, 2023, RSUI, denied indemnity  coverage for the L.H. Lawsuit under the D&O policy. Id.  at ¶ 36. Rice avers claims against RSUI for Declaratory  Judgment (Count II), Breach of Contract (Count IV), and  Bad Faith Pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 8371 (Count VII)  concerning the D&O policy. Rice also avers that it is the named insured on an RSUI  Commercial Umbrella policy. Id. at ¶ 51. The Umbrella  policy affords coverage to Rice above and beyond the  Zenith policy and the RSUI D&O policy. Id. at ¶ 52 (ECF  No. 20-8). [*7]  In or around September 22, 2021, Rice  submitted the L.H. lawsuit to RSUI, requesting defense  Page 3 of 8 and indemnification pursuant to the Umbrella policy in  relation to the L.H. Lawsuit. Id. at ¶ 53. Rice alleges that  RSUI knew of the existence of the Umbrella policy, but it  failed to acknowledge Rice's tender of coverage under  the Umbrella policy in either of its September 29th or  December 2nd letters. Id. at ¶ 55. While acknowledging  its duty to defend Rice under the D&O policy, RSUI  denies any defense or indemnity coverage under the  Umbrella policy. Id. at ¶ 56. Rice avers claims against  RSUI for Declaratory Judgment (Count II), Breach of  Contract (Count V), and Bad Faith Pursuant to 42  Pa.C.S. § 8371 (Count VII) concerning the Umbrella  policy. II. Relevant Standards A. Motion to Dismiss When reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal  Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the court must ""accept  all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in  the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine  whether,  under  any  reasonable  reading  of  the  complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief."" Eid v.  Thompson, 740 F.3d 118, 122 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting  Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 233 (3d  Cir.2008)). ""To survive a motion to dismiss a complaint  must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true,  to 'state a claim to relief [*8]  that is plausible on its  face.'"" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct.  1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp.  v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L.  Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). ""A claim has facial plausibility when  the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court  to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is  liable for the misconduct alleged."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678  (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556); see also Thompson  v. Real Estate Mortg. Network, 748 F.3d 142, 147 (3d  Cir. 2014). ""Threadbare recitals of the elements of a  cause of action, supported by mere conclusory  statements, do not suffice."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  ""Factual allegations of a complaint must be enough to  raise a right to relief above the speculative level.""  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. A pleading party need not  establish the elements of a prima facie case at this  stage; the party must only ""put forth allegations that  'raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal  evidence of the necessary element[s].'"" Fowler v. UPMC  Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 213 (3d Cir.2009) (quoting  Graff v. Subbiah Cardiology Associates, Ltd., 2008 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 44192, 2008 WL 2312671 (W.D. Pa. June  4, 2008)); see also Connelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809  F.3d 780, 790 (3d Cir.2016) (""Although a reviewing  court now affirmatively disregards a pleading's legal  conclusions, it must still . . . assume all remaining  factual allegations to be true, construe those truths in  the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and then draw all  reasonable inferences from them."") (citing Foglia v.  Renal Ventures Mgmt., LLC, 754 F.3d 153, 154 n. 1 (3d  Cir.2014)). Nonetheless, a court need not credit bald assertions,  unwarranted inferences, or legal conclusions cast in the  form of factual averments. Morse v. Lower Merion  School District, 132 F.3d 902, 906, n. 8 (3d Cir.1997).  The primary question in [*9]  deciding a motion to  dismiss is not whether the Plaintiff will ultimately prevail,  but rather whether he or she is entitled to offer evidence  to establish the facts alleged in the complaint. Maio v.  Aetna, 221 F.3d 472, 482 (3d Cir.2000). The purpose of  a motion to dismiss is to ""streamline [ ] litigation by  dispensing with needless discovery and factfinding.""  Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 326-327, 109 S. Ct.  1827, 104 L. Ed. 2d 338, (1989). B. Insurance Policy Interpretation Pennsylvania courts apply traditional rules of contract  interpretation to insurance policies. The goal is to  ascertain the parties' intent, as manifested by the policy  language. Madison Constr. Co. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins.  Co., 557 Pa. 595, 735 A.2d 100, 106 (Pa. 1999).  Pennsylvania courts give words of common usage their  ""natural, plain, and ordinary sense."" Kvaerner Metals  Div. of Kvaerner v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 589 Pa.  317, 908 A.2d 888, 897 (Pa. 2006). Clear and  unambiguous terms must be given their effect.  Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. CPB Int'l, 562 F.3d 591, 595  (3d Cir. 2009); Kvaerner, 908 A.2d at 897. ""[A] provision  is ambiguous only if reasonable people could, in the  context of the entire policy, fairly ascribe different  meanings to it."" Frog, Switch & Mfg. Co. v. Travelers  Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 742, 746 (3d Cir. 1999). C. Duties to Defend and Indemnify In determining whether an insurer has a duty to defend,  Pennsylvania courts follow the ""four corners"" rule, which  requires comparison of ""the four corners of the  insurance contract to the four corners of the complaint.""  Am. & Foreign Ins. Co. v. Jerry's Sport Ctr., Inc., 606  Pa. 584, 2 A.3d 526, 541 (Pa. 2010). ""[O]nly allegations  contained within the underlying complaint pertaining to  Page 4 of 8 injuries which are either actually or potentially [*10]   within the scope of the insurance policy obligate the  insurer to defend the insured."" Erie Ins. Exch. v.  Claypoole, 449 Pa. Super. 142, 673 A.2d 348, 355-56  (Pa. Super. Ct. 1996). ""[T]he particular cause of action  that a complainant pleads is not determinative of  whether coverage has been triggered. Instead it is  necessary to look at the factual allegations contained in  the complaint."" Mut. Benefit Ins. Co. v. Haver, 555 Pa.  534, 725 A.2d 743, 745 (Pa. 1999); see also Scopel v.  Donegal Mut. Ins. Co., 698 A.2d 602, 605 (Pa. Super.  Ct. 1997) (""[I]n focusing attention upon the cause of  action pled, [claimants] run afoul of our caselaw, which  dictates that the factual averments contained in a  complaint determine whether an insurer must defend."").  This prevents ""the use of artful pleadings designed to  avoid exclusions in liability insurance policies."" Haver,  725 A.2d at 745. III. Discussion A. Zenith's Motion to Dismiss Zenith moves to dismiss Rice's claims for defense and  indemnification under its Employer's Liability policy in  Count I (Declaratory Judgment), Count III (Breach of  Contract), and Count VI (Statutory Bad Faith). 1. Zenith Policy Zenith's policy provides that it ""will pay all sums that you  legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury to  your employees, provided the bodily injury is covered by  this Employers' Liability Insurance."" (ECF No. 20-6 Part  Two, § B). Zenith argues that exclusions within said  policy precludes coverage [*11]  of the claims and  damages at issue in the L.H. lawsuit. Part Two of the  Zenith policy contains a number of exclusions, including  the following: This insurance does not cover: . . . 4.  Any  obligation  imposed  by  a  workers'  compensation,  occupational  disease,  unemployment compensation, or disability benefits  law, or any similar law; ... 7. Damages arising out of coercion, criticism,  demotion, evaluation, reassignment, discipline,  defamation, harassment, humiliation, discrimination  against or termination of any employee, or any  personnel practices, policies, acts or omissions; Id. at p. 8 (""Exclusions C.4 and C.7""). 2. Analysis a. Exclusion C.4 Zenith argues that coverage is barred under Exclusion  C.4, because the L.H. lawsuit arises out of an obligation  imposed by a worker's compensation law. Specifically,  Zenith contends that, as alleged in her complaint, L.H.  was subjected to harassment, inappropriate touching,  abuse, sexual harassment, coercion, and sexual assault  by her supervisor on Rice's premises and during her  work shifts. (ECF No. 20-1 at ¶¶ 5-6, 43-95). The L.H.  lawsuit also claims her harm was the result of Rice's  negligent decision to hire and failure to supervise  Garner. Id. Zenith [*12]  maintains that any recovery by  L.H. from Rice would be an ""obligation imposed by a  workers' compensation,"" such that coverage under the  Employer Liability policy is excluded by policy Exclusion  C.4. Rice maintains that none of the claims or damages  asserted in the L.H. lawsuit involve or implicate any  obligation imposed by any ""occupational disease,  unemployment compensation, or disability benefits law,  or any similar law."" Rice argues that Zenith's own denial  of coverage letter concedes that L.H. does not seek to  recover benefits under the Pennsylvania Workers'  Compensation Act (""PWCA""). Rice contends that, since  no worker's compensation claim has been filed by L.H.,  coverage under the Zenith Employers' Liability policy is  not excluded. In addition, Rice argues that an  employers' liability policy covers injuries to employees. As regards Rice's argument against Exclusion C.4,  based upon no worker compensation claim having been  filed, in cases interpreting the same policy language,  courts have held that said exclusion bars coverage for  claims that are subject to workers compensation  exclusivity, regardless of whether the employee actually  sought such benefits. ""It is the fact that the [*13]   employee's claim comes within the scope of the  workers' compensation statute rather than the actual  fact that he or she has recovered or is receiving  workers' compensation for his or her harm, which is the  basis for [the workers' compensation exclusion].""  Morales v. Zenith Ins. Co., 152 So. 3d 557, 563 (Fla.  2014) (quoting 8 Couch on Ins. § 115:89 (3d ed. 2013))  (holding identical Exclusion C.4 language barred  coverage for default judgment of personal injury claim).  ""The 'obligation imposed' by the workers' compensation  law is readily understood to mean the obligation as an  employer, under workers' compensation, to provide  benefits. That inchoate obligation exists whether or not  an employee actually chooses to seek benefits.""  Page 5 of 8 Culligan v. State Comp. Ins. Fund, 81 Cal. App. 4th 429,  96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 656, 664 (Cal. App. 2000) (emphasis  added) (holding that identical Exclusion C.4 language  barred coverage for tort lawsuit where injuries were  covered  by  workers  compensation  exclusivity,  regardless of whether the employee actually seeks  workers  compensation  benefits).  The  Court  is  persuaded, that consistent with Morales and Culligan,  application of Exclusion C.4 to deny coverage does not  require that L.H. seek or claim workers compensation  benefits. As such, Exclusion C.4 applies and precludes  coverage for the L.H. lawsuit, notwithstanding L.H. has  not claim [*14]  worker compensation benefits. As regards Rice's argument that the Zenith Employer's  Liability provides a path for coverage for an injury to  employees, such as those alleged by L.H., said  argument lacks merit. The PWCA also ""provides that  worker's compensation is the exclusive remedy for  injuries arising in the course of a worker's employment.""  Durham Life Ins. Co. v. Evans, 166 F.3d 139, 160 (3d  Cir. 1999); see 77 P.S. § 481(a). ""There is a rebuttable  presumption that the injury is work related where it  occurs on the premises of the employer."" Albright v.  Concurrent Techs. Corp., No. 3:21-CV-112, 2022 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 179060, 2022 WL 4640115, at *7 (W.D. Pa.  Sept. 30, 2022). Given the broad sweep of the PWCA's  exclusivity rule, ""the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has  held that even intentional torts committed by the  employer fall within the coverage of the Act"" and are  subject to the exclusivity rule. Danese, 784 F. Supp. at  229 (citing Poyser v. Newman & Co., 514 Pa. 32, 522  A.2d 548, 551 (Pa. 1987)). Courts have broadly applied  the PWCA's exclusivity rule to preempt civil claims for  workplace torts including assault, shootings, and fraud,  among others. See, e.g., Albright v. Concurrent Techs.  Corp., No. 3:21-CV-112, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 179060,  2022 WL 4640115, at *8 (W.D. Pa. Sept. 30, 2022)  (applying PWCA's exclusivity rule to allegations of  workplace ""harassment and hostility""); Abbott v. Anchor  Glass Container Corp., 2000 PA Super 249, 758 A.2d  1219, 1225 (Pa. Super. 2000) (holding PWCA's  exclusivity rule applied to the intentional shooting by a  co-employee, resulting in death). As particularly relevant here, courts have applied the  PWCA's exclusivity rule to preempt claims of workplace  sexual harassment [*15]  and attempted rape. See  Blazevich v. Star Hotels, Inc., Civ. A. No. 3:19-198,  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62988, 2021 WL 1214688, at *8  (W.D. Pa. Mar. 31, 2021) (holding PWCA exclusivity  applied to negligent supervision claims related to sexual  harassment by co-worker); Holland v. NTP Marble, Inc.,  No. 17-CV-2909, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78097, 2019  WL 2059966, at *11 (E.D. Pa. May 8, 2019); Hershey v.  Ninety-Five Assoc., 413 Pa. Super. 158, 604 A.2d 1068,  1070 (Pa. Super 1992) (holding PWCA's exclusivity rule  applied to physical attack and attempted rape). Here,  the injuries and damages alleged by L.H. occurred  during the course of and at L.H.'s Rice employment  worksite. As such, in the facts and circumstances  presented, employer liability to L.H. would be an  obligation imposed by PWCA, and coverage therefore is  excluded by Exclusion C.4 of the Zenith policy. Rice's  arguments to the contrary fail. Exclusion C.4 applies to  exclude coverage under the Zenith policy. b. Exclusion C.7 Zenith argues that Exclusion C.7 bars coverage,  because the L.H. lawsuit arises out of ""harassment,  humiliation, discrimination, or personnel practices,  policies, acts or omissions."" In the L.H. lawsuit, L.H.  contends she was harmed as an employee due to her  supervisor  Garner's  misconduct,  including  sexual  harassment. L.H. also alleges that Rice's negligence in  its personnel practices, policies, acts and omissions  caused her harm. Zenith denied coverage based upon  allegations within the L.H. lawsuit and the application of  Exclusion C.7. Rice asserts [*16]  that Exclusion C.7 does not apply to  the allegations in the L.H. lawsuit, because the  damages sought by L.H. arise out of ""coercion, criticism,  demotion,  evaluation,  reassignment,  discipline,  defamation, harassment, humiliation..."" from Garner and  not by employer Rice. Rice further contends that the  term ""sexual misconduct"" is not specified as an  exclusion under Exclusion C. 7. Further, as regards  Exclusion C.7's terms ""personnel practices, policies,  acts or omissions,"" Rice argues that said language is  ambiguous and undefined in the policy; and, where  Zenith now seeks to exclude coverage, based upon  such policy language, Zenith's failure to define such  terms prevents enforcement of Exclusion C.7 in this  case. Presently, where coverage is denied based on an  exclusion, the burden is on the insurer to prove the  applicability of the claimed exclusion. Nationwide Mutual  Insurance Co. v. Arnold, 2019 PA Super 213, 214 A.3d  688, 695, 701-02 (Pa. Super. 2019). Exclusion C.7  precludes damages that arise out of enumerated  circumstances or events. Pennsylvania courts interpret  the phrase ""arising out of"" in policy exclusions in a very  broad manner to mean a causal, ""but for"" relationship.  Madison Contr. Co. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., 557  Page 6 of 8 Pa. 595, 735 A.2d 100, 110 (Pa. 1999); McCabe v. Old  Republic Ins Co., 425 Pa. 221, 228 A.2d 901, 903 (Pa.  1967) (stating that ""arising out of"" unambiguously  means ""causally connected with, not proximately  caused by""). [*17]  If the alleged injuries would not have  happened but for the excluded conduct, the injuries  ""arise out of"" the conduct. First Liberty Ins. Corp. v. Coll,  2015 Phila. Ct. Com. Pl. LEXIS 14, at *14 (Pa. Ct.  Comm. Pl. Jan. 6, 2015), aff'd, 131 A.3d 85 (Pa. Super.  Ct. 2015). Rice's argument, that coverage under the Zenith Policy  cannot be excluded because of the conduct of Garner,  lacks merit. Other courts have addressed identical  language contained in Exclusion C.7 and ultimately  concluded that allegations of conduct similar to  Garner's, as alleged in the L.H. lawsuit, satisfies the  ""arise out of"" causal link to exclude coverage. See, e.g.  Gen. Star Indem. Co. v. Sch. Excess Liab. Fund, 888  F.Supp. 1022, 1028 (N.D. Cal. 1995) (finding exclusion  based upon allegations of coercive conduct by  supervisor and employee humiliation); Fisher v. St. Paul  Ins. Co., 02 C 9488, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6525, 2003  WL 1903983, at *9 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 17, 2003) (upholding  exclusion  based  upon  allegations  of  sexual  discrimination, harassment, and assault); TIG Ins. Co. v.  Sweet Factory, Inc., 748 So.2d 337, 339 (Fla. Dist. Ct.  App. 1999) (upholding exclusion based upon clear and  unambiguous language wherein, like the L.H. complaint,  alleged sexual harassment of minor employee by  supervisor). Here, the L.H. lawsuit unequivocally sets  forth  allegations  of  ""damages  arising  out  of""  harassment, humiliation, and coercion."" (ECF No. 20-1  at ¶¶ 48, 56, 61-62, and 82(a)). Thus, as to the conduct  of Garner, vis-à-vis coverage for Rice, Exclusion C.7  applies to preclude coverage. Further, the L.H. lawsuit alleges her damages ""arise  out [*18]  of"" Rice's personnel practices, policies, acts or  omissions, namely, in hiring Garner despite his sexual  misconduct history, and his status as a registered sex  offender, and Rice's failure to adequately train L.H. and  take action following the observation and/or reports of  Garner's misconduct. Each of these allegations support  the applicability of Exclusion C.7 to preclude coverage  to Rice. The Court finds no ambiguity in the policy  language, and L.H.'s complaint allegations fall squarely  within the plain meaning of the terms ""personnel  practices, policies, acts or omissions."" Thus, Exclusion  C.7 applies to preclude Zenith's coverage for Rice. c. Bad Faith Finally, as regards Rice's claim for Bad Faith against  Zenith, Zenith argues that Rice's statutory bad faith  claim fails because, where the policy provides for a  reasonable basis for exclusion, there can be no bad  faith as a matter of law. Rice contends that it has  sufficiently pleaded a bad faith claim against Zenith. ""Resolution of a coverage claim on the merits in favor of  the insurer requires dismissal of a bad faith claim  premised on the denial of coverage, because under the  circumstances  the  insurer  necessarily  has  a  reasonable [*19]  basis for denying benefits."" Gold v.  State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., 880 F. Supp. 2d 587, 597  (E.D. Pa. 2012) (citing Frog, Switch, & Mfg. Co., Inc. v.  Travelers Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 742, 751 n. 9 (3d Cir.  1999)). Here, given that Exclusions C.4 and C.7 of the Zenith  policy apply to exclude coverage to Rice, Zenith's denial  of a defense and indemnification under its policy was  reasonable. As such, Rice cannot maintain a statutory  bad faith claim against Zenith for its refusal to defend  and indemnify. Accordingly, based upon the foregoing, Zenith's Motion  to Dismiss will be granted. Rice's claims against Zenith,  Counts I, III, and VI will be dismissed. Because the  Court's analysis is based upon the policy language and  allegations within the L.H. lawsuit, any amendment to  Rice's claims against Zenith would be futile. Therefore,  there will be no leave to amend. All claims against  Zenith will be dismissed, with prejudice. B. RSUI's Partial Motion to Dismiss RSUI moves to dismiss Rice's claims for Declaratory  Judgment (Count II), Breach of Contract (Count V), and  Statutory Bad Faith (Count VII), concerning Rice's  tender for defense and indemnification under the RSUI  Umbrella policy. 1. The RSUI Commercial Umbrella Liability Policy The RSUI Umbrella policy provides in relevant part as  follows: I. INSURING AGREEMENT 1. We will pay on behalf of the insured those  sums [*20]  in excess of the ""retained limit"" which  the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as  damages to which this insurance applied because  of ""bodily injury"", ""property damage"" or ""personal  and advertising injury"". *** Page 7 of 8 2. We will have the right and duty to defend any  ""suit"" seeking those damages when: a. The applicable limits of insurance of the  ""underlying insurance"" and other insurance  have been used up in the payment of  judgments or settlements; or b. No other valid and collectible insurance is  available to the insured for damages covered  by this policy. *** 9. Loss Payments a. We will have liability for any one ""occurrence"" or  offense only when the amount of the ""retained limit""  with respect to such ""occurrence"" of offense has  been paid by: (1) The insured; (2) Us on behalf of the insured (other than this  policy; or (3) The insured's underlying insurer. b. If we are obliged to indemnify the insured for any  payment or judgments or settlements, the insured  must make a written claim within 12 months of: (1) Actually paying any amount in excess of the  ""retained limit""; or (2) The insured's liability being made certain  by: (a) The final judgment of a trial; or (b)  The  written  agreement  of  the  insured, [*21]   the  claimant  or  the  claimant's legal representative and us. (ECF No. 20-8 at pp. 31, 14-16). 2. Analysis a. Duty to Defend RSUI argues that any duty to defend Rice under its  Umbrella policy has not been triggered. Specifically,  RSUI maintains that Rice's underlying insurance, which  includes the RSUI D&O policy and the Zenith policy, has  not been ""used up in the payment of judgments or  settlements,"" and Rice does not aver that ""no other valid  or collectible insurance is available to the insured for  damages covered by [the RSUI Commercial Umbrella  Liability policy]."" Given this Court's above ruling, that  there is no coverage under the Zenith Policy, no further  discussion concerning Zenith is necessary. The only  remaining issue as regards the Umbrella policy is the  status of coverage under the RSUI D&O policy. In  regards to the RSUI D&O policy, RSUI contends that, if  the D&O policy partially applies to the claims in the L.H.  lawsuit, as Rice contends, then the L.H. lawsuit is not an  uncovered occurrence for purposes of the RSUI  Umbrella policy. Rice maintains that, because of the  Zenith  coverage  denial,  it  has  an  ""uncovered  occurrence"" that would trigger RSUI's Umbrella policy. ""When an insured [*22]  is covered by both a primary  policy and an excess policy, the general rule is that the  excess liability carrier is not obligated to participate in  the defense until the primary policy limits are  exhausted."" Steven Plitt et al., Couch on Insurance §  200:42 (3d. ed. 2020). The Third Circuit has explained  that ""a true excess or secondary policy is not 'triggered'  or required to pay until the underlying primary coverage  has been exhausted."" Koppers Co. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur.  Co., 98 F.3d 1440, 1454 (3d Cir. 1996). Here, Rice's Amended Complaint does not support the  triggering of RSUI's Umbrella policy, because RSUI has  accepted Rice's defense tender under its D&O policy.  (ECF No. 20 at ¶ 27). Therefore, under the Umbrella  policy language, there has yet to be an uncovered  ""occurrence,"" notwithstanding the lack of any coverage  under the Zenith policy. In addition, Rice's claim for  excess coverage under RSUI Umbrella policy is  premature because Rice does not allege the limits of  liability and defense under the D&O policy have been  exhausted. Thus, Rice cannot claim any present duty to  defend under RSUI's Umbrella policy. Accordingly,  RSUI's Partial Motion to Dismiss, as regards defense in  the L.H. lawsuit under the Umbrella policy, will be  granted. b. Duty to Indemnify [*23]  RSUI also argues that Rice's request for indemnification  under the Umbrella policy is premature. It maintains that  coverage for loss payments is only triggered when the  retained limit has been paid by the insured, or paid by  RSUI on behalf of the insured under policies other than  the Commercial Umbrella Liability policy, or paid by  Rice's other underlying insurer(s). RSUI contends that  none of these conditions have been met; therefore, no  duty has yet arisen under the RSUI Umbrella policy.  Rice argues that its demand for indemnification is timely  and judicially economical. Specifically, it maintains that  dismissal of the claims against RSUI's Umbrella policy  should not occur, given that the L.H. lawsuit remains  unresolved and the necessity of the Umbrella policy is  unknown. Under Pennsylvania law, ""[a]n insurer is required to  indemnify only where the insured is held liable for a  claim actually covered by the policy."" USX Corp. v.  Adriatic Ins. Co., 99 F.Supp.2d 593, 611 (W.D.Pa.2000)  Page 8 of 8 (citing Gen. Accident Ins. Co. of Am. v. Allen, 547 Pa.  693, 692 A.2d 1089, 1095 (1997)). ""As a general rule, a  court entertaining a declaratory judgment action in an  insurance  coverage  case  should  refrain  from  determining the insurer's duty to indemnify until the  insured is found liable for damages in the underlying  action."" Victoria Ins. Co. v. Mincin Insulation Servs., No.  Civ.A. 08-909, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106536, 2009 WL  90644, at *5 (W.D.Pa. Jan. 14, 2009) (quotation  omitted). [*24]  Here, Rice's argument against prematurity is unavailing  based upon the above well-settled law. Rice has not  alleged that liability in the L.H. lawsuit has been  established, and where Rice has not been found liable  for damages in the underlying action, any claim for  RSUI to indemnify is premature. Further, Rice has not  alleged that any underlying coverage under the RSUI  D&O policy has been exhausted. Thus, RSUI's partial  Motion to Dismiss, as regards indemnity under the  Umbrella policy, will be granted. c. Statutory Bad Faith Finally, RSUI argues that Rice's statutory bad faith claim  fails because, when no coverage for defense and/or  indemnification exists, there can be no bad faith as a  matter of law. Rice contends that it made a legitimate  demand for coverage pursuant to the terms and  requirements of the Umbrella Policy, and that the  question, of whether RSUI's refusal to defend and  indemnify under its Umbrella Policy was in bad faith,  remains a question of fact. ""Resolution of a coverage claim on the merits in favor of  the insurer requires dismissal of a bad faith claim  premised on the denial of coverage, because under the  circumstances the insurer necessarily has a reasonable  basis [*25]  for denying benefits."" Gold v. State Farm  Fire and Cas. Co., 880 F. Supp. 2d 587, 597 (E.D. Pa.  2012) (citing Frog, Switch, & Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Travelers  Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 742, 751 n. 9 (3d Cir. 1999)). Here, given that the language of the Umbrella policy  does not provide Rice within any present right to  coverage,  RSUI's  denial  of  a  defense  and  indemnification under the Umbrella policy is reasonable.  As such, Rice cannot presently maintain a statutory bad  faith claim against RSUI concerning RSUI's denial of  coverage under the Umbrella policy. Accordingly, based upon the foregoing, RSUI's Partial  Motion to Dismiss will be granted. Rice's claims, as  regards the RSUI Umbrella Policy within Counts II  (Declaratory Judgment), Count V (Breach of Contract),  and VII (Bad Faith) will be dismissed. Because the  Court's analysis is based upon the policy language, the  pending status L.H. lawsuit, and the non-exhaustion of  the RSUI D&O policy, any amendment to Rice's  dismissed claims against RSUI related to the Umbrella  policy would be futile. Therefore, there will be no leave  to amend. A separate order will follow pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. 58,  and will direct RSUI to answer the remaining claims  against it. DATED this 6th day of December, 2023. BY THE COURT: /s/ Marilyn J. Horan MARILYN J. HORAN United States District Judge ORDER Following consideration of Defendants' Motions to  Dismiss [*26]  (ECF Nos. 21 and 23), the respective  briefs (ECF Nos. 22, 24, 27, 30, and 31), and for the  reasons stated in this Court's Opinion (ECF No. 40),  Zenith's Motion to Dismiss is granted, and RSUI's  Partial Motion to Dismiss is granted. Therefore, it is  hereby ordered as follows: 1. All claims against Zenith are dismissed. 2. Counts II, V, and VII against RSUI concerning  the Umbrella policy are dismissed. 3. No leave to amend is granted. 4. RSUI shall file an Answer to Counts II, IV, and  VII of the Amended Complaint concerning the D&O  Policy on or before December 20, 2023. DATED this 6th day of December, 2023. BY THE COURT: /s/ Marilyn J. Horan MARILYN J. HORAN United States District Judge"
"Rivas v. State, 2023 Fla. App. LEXIS 8246.pdf","N, J. A jury found Rene Elmer Rivas guilty of (1) sexual  battery on a person less than twelve years old and (2)  lewd or lascivious molestation. The trial court sentenced  him to life imprisonment. Rivas now appeals, and we  affirm. At trial, the victim testified that when she was seven  years old, Rivas molested and raped her while she was  in his care. On a separate occasion, also when the  victim was seven years old, Rivas forced her to perform  oral sex on him. About three and a half years after the incidents, the  victim confided in her friend about the sexual abuse.  The friend persuaded the victim to tell her mother. The  mother contacted the authorities, and Rivas eventually  faced trial. I. On  appeal,  Rivas  argues  that  two  testimonial  statements, one from the friend and the other from  Nurse Practitioner Natasha Woodham, were unfairly  prejudicial [*2]  and vitiated the legitimacy of the entire  trial. We disagree. The first statement that Rivas challenges is the friend's,  who testified for the State: [The State]: Do you know if [the victim] had told her  mom at that point? [Friend]: She had told me that she never told  anyone. [The State]: How did you feel about that? [Friend]: It honestly hurt me, because I know that,  through my experiences that I've had with multiple  men in my youth, it's hard to open up to someone,  especially in Hispanic communities, it's very  normalized behavior upon men. Defense counsel did not object. On appeal, Rivas  argues that the testimony prejudiced him because it  characterized child molestation as normalized behavior  among men like Rivas. Since the court admitted the statement without  objection, the issue is unpreserved, and fundamental  error analysis applies. Serrano v. State, 279 So. 3d 296,  301 (Fla. 1st DCA 2019). Fundamental error is an error  so severe that it reaches ""into the validity of the trial  itself to the extent that a verdict of guilty could not have  been obtained without the assistance of the alleged  Page 2 of 2 error."" Knight v. State, 286 So. 3d 147, 151 (Fla. 2019)  (quoting Brown v. State, 124 So. 2d 481, 484 (Fla.  1960)). The  underlying  premise  of  Rivas'  argument  is  questionable. He asserts that the friend characterized  child molestation as normalized behavior [*3]  among  men like Rivas. But the friend did not say ""child  molestation"" nor name Rivas when she mentioned  ""normalized behavior."" So the record does not support  Rivas' contention. But even if Rivas' assertion is fair, his legal argument  still fails. He argues that the friend's testimony was  unfairly prejudicial. To amount to unfair prejudice, the  testimony must have ""an undue tendency to suggest  decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not  necessarily, an emotional one."" Brown v. State, 719 So.  2d 882, 885 (Fla. 1998) (quoting Old Chief v. United  States, 519 U.S. 172, 180, 117 S. Ct. 644, 136 L. Ed. 2d  574 (1997)). Rivas does not identify the ""improper  basis"" suggested by the testimony, how the testimony  may have unduly encouraged a decision on that  improper ground, nor any rule of evidence that would  preclude the statement's admission. Even if the testimony were prejudicial, its admission  would still fall short of fundamental error. The record  does not reveal that Rivas would have been acquitted  without this specific testimony. Considering the stronger  evidence throughout the trial (such as the victim's direct  testimony about what occurred when she was seven  years old), the friend's attestation alone does not appear  to have sealed Rivas' fate. Without showing that he  could not have been convicted but for the alleged [*4]   error, Rivas fails to demonstrate fundamental error.  Knight, 286 So. 3d at 151. II. Next, Rivas challenges the statement of Nurse  Practitioner Woodham, who conducted a medical  examination on the victim. The examination disclosed a  tear of the victim's hymen: [The State]: So, your opinion is that this injury was  occurred from some penetrating force? [Woodham]: That's correct. [The State]: Is there any significance to the fact that  you found this injury in [the victim]? [Woodham]: Yes. So, as I said before, I've been at  the Children's Advocacy Center since 2015 and I've  done a lot of these exams. Most children that I do  these genital exams on, have no injuries, even  when we know that there's been something  happened to them, either video or someone's  walked on the act happening. Most of these  children, probably over 90 percent of them do not  have injuries to their genitalia at all because of the  nature of the vagina and how much it can stretch  whenever injuries happen to it. So, the fact that she  had an injury is significant. Out of all the exams that  I've done, I probably only have maybe two handfuls  of children that have had a transection to their  hymen. Defense counsel did not object. On appeal, Rivas  argues that [*5]  the testimony was unduly prejudicial  because any reasonable juror would develop an affinity  for the victim after hearing that ""the seven-year-old's  vagina was penetrated with such force that her hymen  was torn."" That, he says, could have ""tipped the scales""  in the State's favor. Rivas correctly asserts that the jury may have found this  testimony emotionally charging. That is true of nearly  any evidence pointing to a child sex crime. Yet juries are  generally allowed to consider any evidence that tends to  prove a material fact. See §§ 90.401-.402, Fla. Stat.  (2022). Woodham's testimony about the victim's  physical examination supported the State's case. Rivas  supplies no authority that would disallow the testimony  nor any ""improper basis"" it could have induced. III. To win on these unpreserved issues, Rivas would have  to demonstrate fundamental error. None of Rivas'  arguments establish that the trial court committed any  error, much less fundamental error. We affirm. A. R and W, JJ., concur."
"Rodgers v. Homes, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217337.pdf","[*1] THIS MATTER is before the Court on motions to  dismiss filed by Defendants Costner Law Office, PLLC;  Kuester Management Group; NVR Inc.-Ryan Homes;  and Flagstar Bank pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1), 12(b)(4),  12(b)(6) and 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  (Doc. Nos. 32, 34, 39, 43). Also pending is Plaintiff's pro  se Motion for Preliminary Injunction, seeking an Order  from this Court ""to stop dismissal of my [case],"" and  awarding $60 million in punitive damages. (Doc. No.  47). I. BACKGROUND Pro se Plaintiff Marcha L.M. Rodgers filed this action on  March 27, 2023, naming as Defendants Costner Law  Office, PLLC; Kuester Management Group; NVR Inc.- Ryan Homes; and Flagstar Bank. Plaintiff's claims arise  from a routine residential real estate closing in which  Plaintiff took out a mortgage to buy a residence at 959  Portrush Lane, Tega Cay, SC 29708. Plaintiff bought  the property from NVR, Inc., for $318,000.00 with an  $80,000 down payment. Defendant Costner Law Office,  PLLC was Plaintiff's closing attorney. Plaintiff financed  the sale through NVR Mortgage Finance, Inc. The  closing occurred without incident, and the special 1 warranty deed and mortgage were properly recorded.  The recorded deed conveys a fee simple estate to Plaintiff. See (Doc. No. 6-2, p. 1). Plaintiff [*2]  alleges that, after the closing, she learned  that the deed of trust was not filed, and what I had agreed to  purchase was not what was listed on record. What was  listed was not homeownership, of this property. This  deed, encumbrance all of my rights to any property, I  own nothing, all of my future rights of refinancing will  never be possible: everything I had worked for was  gone. NVR/Ryan Homes correlated this scheme with  Flagstar Bank and Costner Law Office to [deprive] me of  all  my  rights.  They  created  [an]  illusion  of  homeownership to gain financially. By filing [an]  encumbrance  deed  with  the  assessor[']s  office  [deprived] me of my ownership rights. They setup [an]  escrow account with Flagstar Bank which reversed my  payment to another account. To inflate the property  taxes collected with my payments, by tripling them to  intimidate, coercing, and sending threatening letters to  trick me into filing bankruptcy, to make it appear to me  that I own the property. (Id. p. 2). Plaintiff then alleges the following, in block  fashion: I am pursuing my rights; under article I, Pub.

The three cases cited by Plaintiff deal with  the federal criminal offenses of mail fraud. Because the allegations in Plaintiff's original Complaint  were vague, confusing, and failed to state any legally cognizable claim, the named  Defendants filed motions to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint. On August 24, 2023, the Court  ordered Plaintiff to amend her complaint within thirty days to ""clarify her factual and legal claims  against each Defendant."" (Doc. No. 30). Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on September 22,  2023. Despite the Court's Order, 2 Plaintiff's Amended Complaint neither clarifies her  factual and legal claims, nor does it tie her claims to each Defendant. In the Amended Complaint,  Plaintiff again contends that her claims arise under ""federal law.""1 The sole allegations in the  Amended Complaint are as follows:2 NVR Inc., Ryan Homes, and Costner Law Office PLLC  intentionally and willfully altered the legal status of my  contract of deed, and the character of the stated  condition of the documents. They filed and submitted a  counterfeit deed. NVR, Inc. and Costner Law Office  sold, transferred, sold, and explored the agreement to  third-party vendors without my [*4]  explicit written  consent. Kuester and Flagstar Bank aided them by  facilitating billing claims, under the contract of my  original creditor. Flagstar intentionally sent notice of  charges for mortgage payments without legal status.  They altered the billing amount by not applying  payments correctly, causing an exuberant increase in  the size of the amount of money sent. Kuester illegally  obtained funds under false misrepresentation of facts. I  have endured this pattern of sufferance and servitude  for over a year, and I am still feeling the effects  presently. All of the Defendants have not shown any  changes in their pursuit of counterfeit claims against me. (Doc. No. 31-1). Plaintiff seeks $60 million in punitive  damages. II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW Defendants move to dismiss this action for lack of  subject matter jurisdiction under FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(1), failure to state a claim under FED.  R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6), and failure to comply with FED. R. CIV. P. 8.3 Subject matter jurisdiction is a threshold question the  Court must address before reaching the merits of the case. Jones v. Am. Postal Workers  Union, 192 F.3d 417, 422 (4th Cir. 1999). The Court must dismiss any action over which it lacks  subject matter jurisdiction. Plaintiff, as the party seeking federal jurisdiction, has the burden to  show that subject matter jurisdiction [*5]  1 Plaintiff does not assert diversity jurisdiction under 28  U.S.C. § 1332. 2 The Court has fixed typos, misspellings, and  grammatical errors in the handwritten Amended  Complaint. 3 Additionally, Defendant Kuester seeks dismissal  based on insufficient service of process under Rule  12(b)(4). 3 exists. Richmond, Fredricksburg & Potomac R. Co. v.  United States, 945 F.2d 765, 768 (4th Cir. 1991).  ""Federal jurisdiction may not be premised on the mere  citation of federal statutes."" Wellerv. Dept. of Soc.  Servs. for the City of Baltimore, 901 F.2d 387, 391 (4th  Cir. 1990) (dismissal of pro se claims under Social  Security  Act  and  for  sex-based  discrimination).  Conclusory allegations of federal questions are not  sufficient to confer jurisdiction when none exists.  See,e.g., Sanderlin v. Hutchens, Senter & Britton, P.A.,  783 F. Supp. 2d 798, 800 (W.D.N.C. 2011) (dismissal of pro se plaintiffs' complaint for lack of  subject matter jurisdiction over claim against law firm,  mortgagee, and others to enjoin foreclosure sale despite  plaintiffs' assertion of ""important Federal Questions""). In reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to FED. R.  Page 3 of 4 CIV. P. 12(b)(6), the Court must accept as true all  factual allegations in the Complaint and draw all  reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the  plaintiff. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,  555-56 (2007). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion,  ""[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to  relief above the speculative level,"" with the complaint  having ""enough facts to state a claim to relief that is  plausible on its face."" Id. at 570. ""[T]he tenet [*6]  that a  court must accept as true all of the allegations contained  in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions,"" and  ""[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of  action, supported by mere conclusory statements"" are  insufficient. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)  (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). A complaint survives a motion to dismiss only if it ""states  a plausible claim for relief"" that ""permit[s] the court to  infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct""  based upon ""judicial experience and common sense."" Id. at 679  (citations omitted). While the Court may construe  Plaintiff's complaint liberally because she is proceeding  pro se, the complaint must still allege ""'facts sufficient to  state all the elements of [her] claim'"" to survive a motion  to dismiss. 4 Williams v. Wal-Mart Stores East, L.P., No. 5:18-CV-33- BO, 2018 WL 3341181, at *2 (E.D.N.C. July 6, 2018)  (quoting Bass v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 324  F.3d 761, 765 (4th Cir. 2003)). Rule 8 requires a complaint to contain a short and plain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief. FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2). ""Each  allegation must be simple, concise, and direct."" FED. R.  CIV. P. 8(d)(1). ""A 'shotgun pleading' is one that fails to  articulate claims with sufficient clarity to allow the  defendant to frame a responsive pleading or one in  which it is virtually impossible to know which allegations  of fact are intended to support which claims for relief.""  Wilkinson v. Wells [*7]  Fargo Bank, N.A., No. 3:19-CV- 00580-RJC, 2020 WL 2542867, at *3 (W.D.N.C. May 19, 2020). Pro se  complaints ""marred by shotgun pleading . . . warrant dismissal"" where it is ""impossible . . . to  decipher which allegations of fact are intended to  support which claims for relief."" Id. (quoting McCrea v.  Fargo, No. RDB-18-2490, 2019 WL 2513770, at *7 (D.  Md. June 17, 2019)). III. DISCUSSION The Court will dismiss this action for the reasons stated  in Defendants' motions to dismiss-namely, because  Plaintiff fails to show that this Court has subject matter  jurisdiction over her claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and  because Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint still does not  articulate Plaintiff's claims with sufficient clarity to allow  Defendants to frame any sort of responsive pleading or  to know which allegations match up with which claimed  violation.4 4 Plaintiff is perhaps upset because her tax and  insurances payments were placed in escrow, and her  monthly mortgage payment has increased. Or she may  be upset that her mortgage was transferred to a new  company to service her mortgage. In any event, both  actions (placing insurance and tax payments in escrow  and transferring a mortgage out to a different loan  servicer) are routine, common, and legal. 5 First, as to subject matter jurisdiction, federal [*8]   question jurisdiction is provided in 28 U.S.C. § 1331 for ""civil actions arising under the  Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States."" This means that federal courts have jurisdiction  to hear ""only those cases in which a well-pleaded  complaint establishes either that federal law creates the  cause of action or that the plaintiff's right to relief  necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial  question of federal law."" Franchise Tax Bd. v. Constr.  Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 27-28 (1983);  Battle v.Seibels Bruce Ins. Co., 288 F.3d 596, 606-07  (4th Cir. 2002). A mere reference to federal statutes ""is  not sufficient to obtain jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §  1331."" PEM Entities, LLC, v.County of Franklin, 57 F.4th  178, 183 (4th Cir. 2023). When the reference to a  federal claim is ""facially insubstantial or frivolous"" or ""so insubstantial,  implausible … or otherwise completely devoid of merit  as not to involve a federal controversy"" a complaint is  properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Id. at 183-84. Plaintiff may be attempting bring claims under the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (""Dodd-Frank""); the Fair Debt  Page 4 of 4 Collection Practices Act (""FDCPA""); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act; the Fourth and Eighth  Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; and/or 18 U.S.C.  § 1341 (criminal mail fraud). To the extent she asserts  that her claims arise under these federal laws, Plaintiff  alleges no facts to support her claims. First, there is generally no private right of action under  Dodd-Frank.  [*9] See Downey v.United States, No. CV  19-1212-CFC, 2019 WL 5595291, at *4 (D. Del. Oct. 30,  2019). There is likewise no private right of action for  criminal mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341. See Alford  v.Mecklenburg Cnty. Clerk of Superior Ct., No. 3:19-CV- 156-MOC-DSC, 2019 WL 2881556, at *5 (W.D.N.C.  July 2, 2019). As to her FDCPA claim, Plaintiff does not  allege that any of the named Defendants attempted to  collect any consumer debt from Plaintiff. Next, Title VII  of the 6 Civil  Rights  Act  prohibits  discrimination  in  the  employment context. See Lemon v. Myers Bigel,P.A.,  985 F.3d 392, 396 (4th Cir. 2021). Plaintiff has not  alleged any employer-employee relationship with any  named Defendant, nor do her allegations sound in  employment.  Finally,  the  Fourth  and  Eighth  Amendments of the U.S. Constitution apply to  government actors, not private entities like Defendants.  Monroe v. City of Charlottesville, Va., 579 F.3d 380, 386  (4th Cir. 2009) (Fourth Amendment); Holly v. Scott, 434  F.3d 287, 291 (4th Cir. 2006) (Eighth Amendment). In  sum, Plaintiff fails to show that this Court may assert  subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff's claims as  arising under federal law under Section 1331. Plaintiff also fails to state a cognizable claim against any  of the named Defendants for breach of contract or fraud.  Specifically, Plaintiff does not allege facts showing that  any of the named Defendants breached any contract  with Plaintiff. She also does not plead any required  elements of fraud such as ""the time, place, and contents  of the false representations, as well as the identity of the  person making the misrepresentation and what he  obtained thereby."" Adolphev. Option One Mortg. Corp.,  No. 3:11-CV-418-RJC, 2012 WL 5873308, at *6  (W.D.N.C. Nov. 20, 2012) (internal quotation marks  omitted) (citing Harrison v. Westinghouse Savannah  RiverCo., 176 F.3d 776, 784 (4th Cir. 1999)). In sum, Plaintiff [*10]  has failed to clarify her claims and  to show how each claim is tied to each Defendant. She  has also failed to prove that this Court has subject  matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Thus, the  Court will dismiss this action."
"Rogers v. State, 2023 Ind. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1398.pdf","[*1] Appeal from the Clark Circuit Court The Honorable Nicholas A. Karaffa, Judge Trial Court Cause No. 10C01-1912-F1-6 Memorandum Decision by Judge Weissmann Chief Judge Altice and Judge Kenworthy concur. Weissmann, Judge. [1] While in his mid-50s, Shawn Rogers sexually  molested and impregnated his 13-year-old neighbor.  Rogers pleaded guilty to one count of Level 1 felony  child molesting, for which the trial court sentenced him  to 30 years in prison. Rogers now appeals his sentence  as inappropriate under Indiana Appellate Rule 7(B) in  light of the nature of the offense and the character of the  offender. We affirm. Facts [2] In 2019, Rogers lived with his elderly mother in  Louisville, Kentucky, next door to a 13-year-old child  (Child). Child resided with a guardian. In the summer of  that year, Rogers drove Child to a Clarksville, Indiana,  hotel several times and had sexual intercourse with her  during each stay. [3] After learning of the molestation, Child's guardian  took her to the hospital and discovered she was  pregnant. When interviewed by police, Rogers admitted  he had taken Child to the hotel but claimed he only  kissed her. The State charged Rogers with four counts  of child molesting, a Level 1 felony, for separate  acts [*2]  of sexual intercourse with Child on different  dates at the same hotel. [4] Three years later, shortly before Rogers's trial was to  start, the State and Rogers entered into a plea  agreement calling for Rogers to plead guilty to one  count of Level 1 child molesting in exchange for  dismissing the remaining counts. The plea agreement  provided that the trial court would have discretion to  sentence Rogers to a maximum of 30 years in prison.  Under the agreement, Rogers also would register for life on the sex offender registry and  have no contact with Child or her family. The trial court accepted Rogers's  guilty plea. [5] At the sentencing hearing, an emotional Child  testified that Rogers had manipulated her by purchasing  things for her and making her feel that she needed him.  Child reported that Rogers's molestation had ruined her  life, worsened her depression, and left her fearful and  unable to trust. She dreaded telling her son about his  father's identity and the context in which her son was  conceived. [6] When sentencing Rogers, the trial court found the  harm caused by Rogers's offense-the pregnancy of a  13-year-old  child,  among  other  things-was  an  aggravating circumstance. The court also found [*3]  as  Page 2 of 3 an aggravating circumstance Rogers's criminal history, which consisted of one felony  conviction for making a false statement to obtain a  firearm and one misdemeanor conviction for failing to  maintain insurance. As mitigating circumstances, the  trial court found that Rogers's imprisonment would  cause undue hardship to his family, whom he supported  in various ways. [7] The trial court imposed the maximum sentence  available  under  the  plea  agreement-30  years  imprisonment. Noting that it had struggled to decide on  the proper sentence, the trial court concluded it could  not suspend any portion of the sentence. Discussion and Decision [8] Rogers challenges his sentence under Appellate  Rule 7(B). This rule permits this Court to ""revise a  sentence  authorized  by  statute  if,  after  due  consideration of the trial court's decision, the Court finds  that the sentence is inappropriate in light of the nature of  the offense and the character of the offender."" App. R.  7(B).  Our  principal  role  in  reviewing  sentence  appropriateness is to ""attempt to leaven the outliers . . .  not to achieve a perceived 'correct' sentence."" Knapp  v.State, 9 N.E.3d 1274, 1292 (Ind. 2014). We therefore  defer substantially to the trial court's sentencing  decision,  which  prevails  unless  ""overcome  by  compelling [*4]  evidence portraying in a positive light  the nature of the offense . . . and the defendant's character."" Stephenson v. State, 29  N.E.3d 111, 122 (Ind. 2015). [9] Rogers pleaded guilty to Level 1 felony child  molesting under Indiana Code § 35-42-4-3(a)(1) (2015),  which carries a statutory sentencing range of 20 to 50  years, with an advisory sentence of 30 years. Ind. Code  § 35-50-2-4(c). Thus, although the trial court sentenced  Rogers to the maximum sentence available under his  plea agreement, Roger's 30-year sentence is only the  advisory sentence for his specific conviction. A  defendant challenging an advisory sentence bears a  particularly heavy burden of persuading us that  sentencing revision is warranted, given that an advisory  sentence is not likely to be inappropriate under Rule  7(B). Mise v. State, 142 N.E.3d 1079, 1088 (Ind. Ct.  App. 2020). We conclude Rogers has not met this  burden. Nature of the Offense [10] Rogers acknowledges the serious nature of his  offense and that its severity increased due to Child's  pregnancy. But he claims the nature of the offense  supports a sentencing revision because of Child's age.  According to Rogers, if he had engaged in sexual  intercourse with Child when she was 14, rather than 13,  he could only have been charged with sexual  misconduct with a minor, a Level 4 felony, which carries  a maximum sentence of 12 years imprisonment. [*5]  See Ind. Code § 35-42-4-9(a)(1) (providing that a  person at least 21 years of age who has sexual  intercourse with a child less than 16 years of age  commits sexual misconduct with a minor, a Level 4  felony); Ind. Code § 35-50-2-5.5 (providing sentencing  range of 2 to 12 years for Level 4 felonies). [11] But Rogers did not molest a 14-year-old. He  molested a younger child, and he does not allege that  he was unaware of Child's age at the time of the  offense. The General Assembly has determined that  sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old child is a more  serious crime that carries a harsher penalty than the  molestation of a slightly older child. See generally Miller  v. State, 709 N.E.2d 48, 50 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999) (""The  nature and extent of penal sanctions are primarily  legislative considerations.""). We reject Rogers's claim  that he is entitled to greater leniency simply because he  chose to engage in sexual intercourse with a 13-year- old, rather than an older child. Character of the Offender [12] Rogers's character also does not support sentence  revision. Rogers points to evidence showing he was an  Army veteran who financially supported his family and  helped care for his mother and her home. Rogers also  notes he has a limited criminal record, expressed  remorse, and accepted responsibility for his [*6]   offense by pleading guilty. [13] But this positive character evidence was offset by  evidence showing Rogers, as a 55-year-old man,  groomed, seduced, and impregnated a 13-year-old  child. In an apparent effort to conceal his wrongdoing,  Rogers took Child to a hotel in another state multiple  times over the summer of 2019. [14] Neither is Rogers's guilty plea particularly helpful to  his argument. The timing and nature of his guilty plea  suggests it was motivated by pragmatism, rather than  remorse. Rogers did not plead guilty until the eve of trial  more than three years after he was charged and only in  exchange for dismissing three of the four pending Level  Page 3 of 3 1 felony counts. See Anglemyer v. State, 875 N.E.2d  218, 221 (Ind. 2007). (""[A] guilty plea may not be  significantly mitigating when . . . the defendant receives  a significant benefit in return for the plea.""). Rogers's  arguments that his good character supported a  sentencing reduction are unpersuasive. [15] As Rogers has not shown that his advisory  sentence is inappropriate in light of the nature of the  offense and the character of the offender, we affirm the  trial court's judgment. Altice, C.J., and Kenworthy, J., concur."

"Samsung Fire _ Marine Ins. Co., Ltd. v. UFVS Mgmt. Co., LLC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46508.pdf","MEMORANDUM KENNEY, J. I. INTRODUCTION Plaintiff Samsung Fire and Marine Insurance, Co. LTD., U.S. Branch (""Samsung) brings a declaratory judgment  action against UFVS Management Company, LLC (""UFVS""), Roosevelt Motor Inn, Inc. (""Roosevelt Inc.""), Roosevelt  Inn, LLC (""Roosevelt LLC""), and Yagna Patel (""Patel"") (collectively, ""Policyholders"") seeking a declaration that  Samsung does not have a duty to defend or indemnify Policyholders in four state court actions brought [*5]  against  them. Third-Party Defendants Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and Harleysville Preferred Insurance  Company (collectively, ""Nationwide"") bring a similar declaratory judgment action against Policyholders. Additionally,  Third-Party Defendant ACE Property and Casualty Insurance Company (""ACE"") seeks dismissal of a Fourth  Amended Third-Party Complaint filed by Policyholders and seeks similar declaratory judgment. In turn,  Policyholders seek declaratory judgment against Samsung and, separately, against Nationwide. These motions are  fully briefed and, for the reasons set forth below, the Court will enter declaratory judgment in favor of Samsung,  Nationwide, and ACE (collectively, ""Providers""). II. BACKGROUND Four women allege, in separate state court actions, that they were victims of human sex trafficking at the Roosevelt  Inn in Philadelphia (the ""Hotel""), which was owned and operated by Policyholders at all relevant times. In relevant  part, the women contend that there were clear signs of their trafficking at the Hotel and that Policyholders  negligently failed to prevent or stop the sex trafficking scheme. Policyholders were insured by Providers at the  relevant times and seek coverage [*6]  against the state court claims accordingly. a. M.B. Action On March 10, 2017, a civil action was filed on behalf of M.B., a minor, against Policyholders in the Court of  Common Please of Philadelphia County. M.B. v. Roosevelt Inn, LLC, et al., Philadelphia Ct. Com. Pl., No.  170300712 (""M.B. Action""). M.B.'s Fourth Amended Complaint, filed November 8, 2019, correctly asserts that  human sex trafficking ""is a form of modern day slavery"" and is a ""form of evil in the abuse and exploitation of the  most innocent and vulnerable."" M.B. Action, Fourth Am. Compl. ¶ 1. According to the Fourth Amended Complaint, M.B. was trafficked for sex at the Hotel as early as 2014 (when M.B.  was fourteen years old). Id. ¶ 4. In support of her negligence claim, M.B. alleges that her traffickers frequently  lingered in the Hotel's hallways and on the premises while she was engaged in commercial sex acts, paid for motel  rooms in cash (because men paid for sex in cash), displayed ""Do Not Disturb"" signs, often refused housekeeping  services, and visibly treated M.B. in an aggressive manner when in public areas of the Hotel. Id. at ¶¶ 39-49. M.B.  alleges that she was forced to engage in multiple sex acts per day and [*7]  that the many men who purchased sex     2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46508, *4 Page 4 of 12 entered and exited her room frequently throughout her stay at the Hotel and were often loitering in the hallway. Id.  at ¶¶ 50-51. Indeed, she was trafficked so frequently that the rooms she occupied were often littered with used  condoms. Id. at ¶¶ 43-44. Despite her young age, M.B. wore sexually explicit clothing when in public spaces of the  Hotel and was often accompanied by older men. Id. at ¶¶ 45, 53. Though she stayed at the Hotel for extended  periods of time, she had very few personal items at the Hotel. Id. at ¶ 52. Additionally, throughout her extended  stays, M.B. exhibited visible fear and anxiety while in public spaces of the Hotel. Id. at ¶ 47. In sum, M.B. alleges that there were ""open and obvious"" signs of sex trafficking at the hotel and that Policyholders  knew or should have known that sex crimes were occurring at the Hotel. Id. at ¶ 57. M.B. alleges that, as a result of  Policyholders' shortcomings, she suffered physical harm, mental anguish, humiliation, exploitation, degradation,  mental distress, caught a sexually transmitted disease, and lost the enjoyments of life of life's pleasures. Id. at ¶¶  63-65. M.B. asserts that Policyholders' [*8]  actions were outrageous and in reckless disregard for M.B.'s health and  welfare, thereby warranting punitive damages. Id. at ¶¶ 66-67. Through her Fourth Amended Complaint, M.B.  asserts one count of negligence and one count of negligent infliction of emotional distress against Policyholders. Id.  at ¶¶ 68-77, 88-90. b. C.A. Action On March 27, 2019, a second action was filed against Policyholders by C.A. C.A. v. Roosevelt Inn, LLC, et al.,  Philadelphia Ct. Com. Pl., No. 190303355 (""C.A. Action""). The Second Amended Complaint, filed January 7, 2021,  is similar to that of M.B. and begins by reiterating the heinous nature of human sex trafficking. C.A. Action, Sec. Am.  Compl. at ¶ 1. C.A. alleges that she was trafficked at the Hotel between 2012 and 2013. Id. at ¶ 9. The trafficking  scheme and operative facts alleged by C.A. are virtually identical to those alleged by M.B. See generally, id. at ¶¶  55-120. Additionally, C.A. alleges that she had conversations with the Hotel's employees who knew or should have  known the purpose of her stay at the Hotel. Id. at ¶ 69. C.A. alleges similar harms to those of M.B. and similarly  alleges that Policyholders' actions were outrageous and in reckless [*9]  disregard for her health and welfare. Id. at  ¶¶ 117-118. C.A. asserts one count of negligence, one count of negligent infliction of emotional distress, and one  count of negligent hiring, training, and/or supervision against Policyholders. Id. at ¶¶ 121-131, 164-166, 176-182. c. B.H. Action On November 5, 2019, a third action was filed by B.H. B.H. v. Roosevelt Inn, LLC, et al., Philadelphia Ct. Com. Pl.,  No. 190303356 (""B.H. Action""). The Second Amended Complaint, filed January 12, 2021, is similar to the two prior  actions and again begins by highlighting the devastating impact of human sex trafficking. B.H. Action, Sec. Am.  Compl. at ¶¶ 1-7. B.H. alleges that she was trafficked from January 2013 through May 2013 before being rescued  by police at the Hotel. Id. at ¶ 80. The factual allegations asserted by B.H. are similar to those of C.A., including  allegations as to conversations with the Hotel's employees. Id. at ¶¶ 55-120. Similarly, C.A. asserts one count of  negligence, one count of negligent infliction of emotional distress, and one count of negligent hiring, training, and/or  supervision against Policyholders. Id. at ¶¶ 121-131, 164-166, 176-182. d. K.R. Action On November 5, 2019, [*10]  a fourth action was filed against Policyholders by K.R. K.R. v. Roosevelt Inn, LLC, et  al., Philadelphia Ct. Com. Pl., No. 191100552 (""K.R. Action""). K.R. alleges that she was trafficked for sex at the  Hotel from March 2013 through October 2013. K.R. Action, Compl. at ¶ 8. As in the prior actions, K.R.'s Complaint  begins by admonishing human trafficking as a ""form of evil in the abuse and exploitation of the most innocent and  vulnerable."" Id. at ¶ 1. The allegations asserted by K.R. are largely similar to those of M.B., C.A., and B.H.  Additionally, the K.R. Complaint includes quoted testimony of a trafficker in which the Hotel was likened to a ""strip   2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46508, *7 Page 5 of 12 club with girls wearing little to no clothing and [where] prostitution was open and obvious."" Id. at ¶ 63. Moreover, as  articulated in the Complaint, at least two security guards observed young girls loitering in the halls ""half-naked,""  men buying sex from the young girls, and pimps being aggressive or violent with the girls. Id. at ¶¶ 65-67. K.R. similarly alleges that, by renting rooms to the traffickers and allowing the trafficking to continue, Policyholders  caused K.R. to suffer physical harm, a sexually transmitted disease, mental [*11]  anguish, humiliation, exploitation,  degradation, mental distress, and loss of the enjoyments of life. Id. at ¶ 95. Like the other actions, K.R. also alleges  that Policyholders acted outrageously and in reckless disregard of her health and welfare, thereby warranting  punitive damages. Id. K.R. asserts one count of negligence, one count of negligent infliction of emotional distress,  and one count of negligent hiring, training and/or supervision against the Policyholders. Id. at ¶¶ 98-107, 128-130,  137-143. e. Insurance Policies The relevant insurance policies were provided by Nationwide, Samsung, and ACE. Nationwide insured  Policyholders under consecutive policies from April 1, 2012 through April 20, 2013. ECF No. 70 at 6-7.  Subsequently, Samsung issued two consecutive commercial package policies of insurance to UFVS d/b/a  Roosevelt LLC which collectively covered April 20, 2013 through April 20, 2015. ECF No. 71-4 at 10. The relevant  provisions of both the Nationwide and Samsung policies are those providing coverage for bodily injury and property  damage (Coverage A) and personal and advertising injury (Coverage B). Id.; ECF No. 70 at 7. Additionally, ACE  insured UFVS d/b/a Roosevelt LLC [*12]  under three consecutive Umbrella Plus Commercial Liability Policies from  April 2011 through April 2014. ECF No. 74 at 12. The ACE policies apply in excess of the underlying primary  policies issued by Samsung and Nationwide. Id. at 12-13. In relevant part, the ACE policies all include an exclusion  for abuse or molestation, which is not included in the underlying policies. Id. at 13. III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY Samsung initiated this declaratory judgment action on October 10, 2018 and it was assigned to the Honorable  Judge Jones. ECF No. 1. Pleadings were amended several times, and many motions mooted accordingly, to  address amendments made to the complaints in the underlying cases over the course of several years. Additionally,  the pleadings were expanded to encompass cross claims, counterclaims, and claims against and by additional  insurance providers. Ultimately, on January 6, 2020, Samsung filed a Second Amended Complaint (""Samsung  Complaint"") seeking a declaration that it does not have a duty to defend or indemnify Policyholders in the  underlying cases. ECF No. 50. Included in Policyholders' Answer to the Samsung Complaint was a counterclaim for  declaratory judgment against Samsung, to [*13]  which Samsung responded on January 23, 2020. ECF Nos. 52,  53. On February 12, 2020, Policyholders filed a Fourth Amended Third-Party Complaint (""Third-Party Complaint"")  against ACE and Nationwide. ECF No. 63. Through the Third-Party Complaint, Policyholders seek declaratory  judgment against both ACE and Nationwide and further assert a breach of contract claim against ACE. Id.  Nationwide filed an Answer to the Fourth Amended Complaint and brought a counterclaim for declaratory judgment  against Policyholders on February 19, 2020, to which Policyholders responded on March 2, 2020. ECF Nos. 66, 69.  On March 12, 2020, Nationwide filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings against Policyholders. ECF No. 70.  This motion was fully briefed throughout March and April 2020. ECF Nos. 77, 81, 83, 86. On March 13, 2020, Samsung filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings against Policyholders. ECF No. 71.  This motion was fully briefed throughout March and April 2020. ECF Nos. 76, 80, 82. Also on March 13, 2020,     2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46508, *10 Page 6 of 12 Policyholders filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings against Nationwide. ECF No. 72. This Motion was fully  briefed throughout Spring 2020. ECF Nos. 75, 84, 89, 92. Additionally, on [*14]  March 13, 2020, Policyholders filed  a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings against Samsung. ECF No. 73. This motion was fully briefed throughout  Spring 2020. ECF Nos. 78, 85, 89, 90. Finally, also on March 13, 2020, ACE filed a Motion to Dismiss the Fourth  Amended Complaint. ECF No. 74. This too was fully briefed throughout March and April 2020. ECF Nos. 79, 87. On November 3, 2020, Nationwide filed a Fourth Amended Complaint against Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance  Company (""Philadelphia Indemnity"") seeking a monetary judgment for costs and fees incurred in defending  Policyholders. ECF No. 94. On January 8, 2021, Philadelphia Indemnity filed an Answer and Counterclaim against  Nationwide, to which Nationwide responded on January 14, 2021. ECF Nos. 100, 102. Also on January 8, 2021,  Philadelphia Indemnity filed a Fifth-Party Complaint against Capitol Specialty Insurance Corporation (""Capitol  Specialty"") seeking declaratory judgment, among other relief. ECF No. 101. On February 26, 2021, Capitol  Specialty filed an Answer to Philadelphia Indemnity's Fourth Amended Complaint and, additionally, brought a  Counterclaim and Crossclaim for declaratory judgment against Policyholders, Samsung, [*15]  ACE, Nationwide,  and Philadelphia Indemnity. ECF No. 106. Nationwide, ACE, Philadelphia Indemnity, and Policyholders filed their  respective Answers throughout March 2021. ECF Nos. 107, 109, 110, 113. Samsung, in turn, filed a Motion to  Dismiss the claims brought by Capitol Specialty. ECF No. 108. Samsung's Motion to Dismiss was fully briefed in  March 2021. ECF No. 112. On June 16, 2021, Roosevelt LLC and Roosevelt Inc. filed for bankruptcy, which automatically stayed this case  pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 362. ECF No. 116. Subsequently, on March 2, 2022, Judge Jones ordered that this case  be placed in civil suspense and terminated all deadlines. ECF No. 120. On November 21, 2022, this case was  reassigned from the Honorable Judge Jones to this Court. ECF No. 125. That same day the Court lifted the stay in  its entirety and removed the case from suspense, as requested by counsel and permitted by the United States  Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. ECF No. 124-3 (Order permitting that the stay be lifted  ""solely to permit the continuance and adjudication of"" this action); ECF No. 126. On November 23, 2022, Samsung  filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority, to which ACE and Nationwide [*16]  subsequently joined. ECF Nos. 127,  130, 131. Policyholders subsequently opposed the supplemental authority. ECF No. 133. Samsung, ACE, and  Nationwide responded to Policyholders' opposition in January 2023. ECF Nos. 137, 138, 139. The Court held a  status conference with all parties on December 16, 2022 to discuss the open motions. ECF No. 132. The motions  pending before the Court have now been extensively briefed and are ripe for consideration. IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), a party may move for judgment on the pleadings after the pleadings  are closed, provided the party does so early enough not to delay trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). Such a motion are only  granted ""if, on the basis of the pleadings, the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed Cetera, LLC v.  Nat'l Credit Servs., Inc., 938 F.3d 466, 469 n.7 (3d Cir. 2019) (quoting DiCarlo v. St. Mary Hosp., 530 F.3d 255, 262  (3d Cir. 2008)). Courts in this circuit construe motions for judgment on the pleadings under the same standard as motions to  dismiss made pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Katzenmoyer v. City of Reading, 158 F. Supp. 2d 491, 496 (E.D. Pa.  2001). ""The only notable difference between these two standards is that the court in a motion on the pleadings  reviews not only the complaint but also the answer and written instruments attached to the pleadings."" Sprague v.  Neil, No. 1:05-CV-1605, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77767, 2007 WL 3085604, at *2 (M.D. Pa. Oct. 19, 2007) (citing 2  Moore's Fed. Practice Civil § 12.38 (2004)). As is also true generally, ""courts must consider the complaint in its      2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46508, *13 Page 7 of 12 entirety, as [*17]  well as . . . documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters of which a court  may take judicial notice."" Inst. Inv'rs Grp. v. Avaya, Inc., 564 F.3d 242, 252 (3d Cir. 2009). To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), ""a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,  accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'"" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.  Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167  L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). A complaint is plausible on its face when its factual allegations allow a court to draw a  reasonable inference that a defendant is liable for the harm alleged. Santiago v. Warminster Twp., 629 F.3d 121,  128 (3d Cir. 2010). A court must accept as true all factual allegations contained in a complaint and interpret them in  the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Argueta v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf't, 643 F.3d 60, 74 (3d  Cir. 2011). V. DISCUSSION Providers argue that there is no duty to defend or indemnify because of both the language of each respective policy  (or relevant exclusions) and because Pennsylvania public policy bars coverage. Assuming, arguendo, that the  policies trigger a duty to defend or indemnify, the Court would still have to decide the public policy question.  Accordingly, because the Court finds that public policy bars coverage as to all Providers and for the sake of judicial  economy, the Court solely addresses this issue. a. Legal Standard The interpretation of any contract, including [*18]  insurance policies, is a question of law for the Court to decide.  Kvaerner Metals Div. of Kvaerner U.S., Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 589 Pa. 317, 908 A.2d 888, 897 (Pa.  2006). Where the language of a policy is clear and unambiguous, such language must be given effect. Standard  Venetian Blind Co. v. American Empire Ins. Co., 503 Pa. 300, 469 A.2d 563, 566 (Pa. 1983). An insurer's defense  obligation is determined by the factual allegations of the underlying complaint which are taken as true and,  generally, construed in favor of coverage. See Gedeon v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 410 Pa. 55, 188 A.2d  320, 321-22 (Pa. 1963). Specifically, to prevent ""artful pleading designed to avoid policy exclusions,"" the facts  alleged in the underlying complaint are controlling—not the legal theories or requested relief. See Nautilus Ins. Co.  v. Motel Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 320 F. Supp. 3d 636, 640 (E.D. Pa. 2018) (""[T]he focus of the coverage inquiry is on  the substance, not the form, of the allegations.""); see also Kvaerner Metals Div. of Kvaerner U.S., 908 A.2d at 896  (""[A]n insurer's duty to defend is triggered, if at all, by the factual averments contained in [the underlying]  complaint.""). Because the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify, a finding that the former is not  triggered will also preclude the latter. Kvaerner Metals Div. of Kvaerner, 908 A.2d at 896 n.7. b. The Nautilus Decisions Providers assert that, even if the four corners of their respective policies provide coverage to Policyholders, public  policy requires declaratory judgment in their favor. This is an issue that has been contemplated to some degree by  several courts in this District and [*19]  the Third Circuit. Because the parties disagree as to both their precedential  value and their applicability to this case, the Court will describe each case in turn. Nautilus Ins. Co. v. Motel Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 320 F. Supp. 3d 636 (E.D. Pa. 2018) (hereinafter ""Nautilus I"") In Nautilus I, Nautilus Insurance Company (""Nautilus"") sought a declaration that it did not have a duty to defend and  indemnify its insured, Motel Management Services (""MMS""), in a state court action alleging that MMS negligently   2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46508, *16 Page 8 of 12 failed to prevent human sex trafficking occurring on its property. 320 F. Supp. 3d 636, 638 (E.D. Pa. 2018). In the  underlying action, plaintiff E.B. alleged that she was ""recruited, enticed, solicited, harbored and/or transported to  engage in commercial sex acts"" at a motel owned and operated by MMS. Id. She alleged that rooms at the motel  were paid for in cash, that she was ""visibly"" treated aggressively by her traffickers, that MMS knowingly permitted  the traffickers' activity on its property, that MMS financially profited from the sex trafficking, and that MMS failed to  intervene and report the trafficking. Id. at 638-39. Nautilus argued that it had no duty to defend or indemnify  because: (1) coverage was excluded by an ""all assault and battery"" exclusion in the relevant policy; and (2)  public [*20]  policy bars coverage of an insured for allegations of human trafficking. Id. at 638. The Nautilus I court first analyzed whether Nautilus had a duty to defend or indemnify because the relevant policy  contained an exclusion for all assault or battery. Id. at 640-43. After finding that this exclusion barred coverage, the  court also discussed public policy considerations. Though all but one of the claims asserted against MMS sounded  in negligence (including negligent violation of Pennsylvania Human Trafficking Law) and MMS had not been  criminally charged, the court provided that ""public policy precludes coverage"" because it is against public policy to  insure against criminal acts and ""financially benefitting from human sex trafficking is criminalized under the  Pennsylvania Human Trafficking Law."" Id. at 643; see also ECF No. 136-1 (E.B. Complaint). On appeal, the Third Circuit affirmed the district court's interpretation of the assault and battery exclusion and left  open whether public policy would also preclude insurance coverage. Nautilus Ins. Co. v. Motel Management Servs.,  Inc., 781 Fed. App'x 57, 60 n.5 (3d Cir. 2019) (""Because the insurance policy excludes coverage, we need not  address whether public policy would also preclude insurance coverage for the criminal conduct and intentional torts  alleged in [*21]  E.B.'s complaint""). Nautilus Ins. Co. v. Motel Mgmt. Servs., No. 20-cv-289, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139386, 2021 WL 3164292 (E.D. Pa.  July 27, 2021) (hereinafter ""Nautilus II021) (hereinafter ""Nautilus II"") Following Nautilus I, E.B. revised her underlying complaint to remove allegations related to being held at gunpoint  and Nautilus again sought declaratory judgment that it did not need to defend or indemnify MMS in the underlying  action. Nautilus II, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139386, [WL] at *1, *3. In her amended complaint, E.B. brought two  claims under the Pennsylvania Human Trafficking Law and four negligence claims. ECF No. 136-3. Nautilus again  argued that insurance coverage was precluded because of: (1) the ""all assault or battery"" exclusion; and (2) public  policy. Nautilus II, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139386, [WL] at *3. The Nautilus II court found that Nautilus was entitled  to declaratory judgment due to res judicata. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139386, [WL] at *1. Additionally, even if res  judicata did not apply, the court found that declaratory judgment was warranted both because of the ""all assault or  battery"" exclusion and because of public policy. Indeed, ""[t]he amended complaint in the underlying action still  seeks damages against the Insured Defendants for their facilitation of illegal conduct, . . . [t]herefore, the public  policy reasoning continues to apply."" Id. at *5 n.4. Nautilus Ins. Co. v. Motel Mgmt. Servs., No. 20-cv-1607, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170748, 2021 WL 4123915 (E.D.  Pa. Sept. 9, 2021) (hereinafter ""Nautilus III21) (hereinafter ""Nautilus III"") In nearly identical underlying complaints, G.D. and N.Z. alleged that they were victims of human sex trafficking that  occurred [*22]  at and was facilitated by MMS. Nautilus III, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170748, [WL] at *1. Specifically,  G.D. and N.Z. alleged that they were ""visibly treated in an aggressive manner"" and were ""forced to take crack  cocaine . . . and [were] 'shot up' with heroin."" 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170748, [WL] at *3. The underlying complaints  asserted one claim for the violation of Pennsylvania's Human Trafficking statute and three negligence claims. 2021  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170748, [WL] at *1. As in prior cases, Nautilus argued that coverage was barred under the policy's  ""all assault or battery"" exclusion and because of public policy. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170748, [WL] at *1. The  Nautilus III court reasoned that because the allegations were clearly assaults and/or batteries and were the ""but for""   2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46508, *19 Page 9 of 12 cause of the alleged injuries, the ""all assault or battery"" exclusion applied, and coverage was barred. 2021 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 170748, [WL] at *3. Additionally, the court provided that ""insurance coverage would be against public  policy."" Id. at n.31. In a consolidated appeal of both Nautilus II and III, the Third Circuit affirmed the denial of  coverage. Nautilus Ins. Co. v. Motel Mgmt. Servs., No. 21-2590, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 30033, 2022 WL 15722613  (3d Cir. Oct. 28, 2022). The Third Circuit's decision was based solely, and entirely, on the ""all assault or battery""  exclusion. Id. c. Public Policy Bars Coverage The Third Circuit has not decided the question posed today: whether public policy bars insurance coverage for  those allegedly involved [*23]  in enabling human trafficking. However, the Nautilus cases suggest consensus  among other courts in this district, which this Court now adopts. There is no duty to defend or indemnify against  actions arising out of an insured's criminal conduct related to the sex trafficking of minors. The Court appreciates  that it may make public policy the basis of a judicial decision only in ""the clearest of cases."" See Minnesota Fire &  Cas. Co. v. Greenfield, 579 Pa. 333, 855 A.2d 854, 868 (Pa. 2004) (quoting Hall v. Amica Mut. Ins. Co., 538 Pa.  337, 648 A.2d 755, 760 (Pa. 1994)). Yet, the Court strains to imagine a clearer case than the one presented here in  which the facts alleged indicate that Policyholders engaged in criminal conduct in violation of Pennsylvania's  Human Trafficking Law. In Greenfield, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that an insured cannot invoke their insurance policy to defend  against a civil action stemming from insured's criminal activity. Minnesota Fire & Cas. Co. v. Greenfield, 579 Pa.  333, 855 A.2d 854, 868 (Pa. 2004). The relevant issue presented in Greenfield was whether there was a duty to  defend an insured whose criminal conduct (selling Schedule I drugs) resulted in an unintended death in a  negligence action. Id. at 860. The court explained that the Commonwealth's enactment of a statute criminalizing the  alleged conduct provided a ""clear enunciation"" of public policy [*24]  such that insurers were not required to defend  or indemnify against damages arising out of insured's criminal conduct. Id. at 868-69. Indeed, unlike the negligent  violation of a federal equal pay statute or unlawful tax collections, public policy ""demand[ed]"" that the sale of a  Schedule I controlled substance be excluded from insurance coverage. Id. at 867 n. 14. Here, human sex  trafficking, which has been ""explicit[ly] criminaliz[ed]"" and has a ""high potential for abuse"" (to say the very least), is  more akin to illegal drug sales than the violation of equal pay or tax laws. See id. at 867. Indeed, other Courts in this  district have relied upon public policy to bar coverage for similarly repugnant conduct that infringes upon public  safety, morals, and welfare. See Teti v. Huron Ins. Co., 914 F.Supp. 1132, 1141 (E.D. Pa. 1996) (concluding that  public policy barred insuring against damages resulting from intercourse between a teacher and minor student). Here, the Pennsylvania Human Trafficking Law provides:                2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46508, *22 Page 10 of 12 (a) Offense Defined - A person commits a [first degree] felony if the person: (1) ""[R]ecruits, entices, solicits, advertises, harbors, transports, provides, obtains, or maintains an individual if  the person knows or recklessly disregards that [*25]  the individual will be subject to sexual servitude; [or] (2) [K]nowingly benefits financially or receive anything of value from any act that facilitates any activity  described in paragraph (1)[.]"" 18 Pa. C.S. § 3011. Where an element involves a result of a person's conduct, such as here, a person acts  knowingly if they are ""aware that it is practically certain that [their] conduct will cause such a result."" Id. at § 302. A  person acts recklessly by ""consciously disregard[ing] a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element  exists or will result from his conduct."" Id. The risk must be ""of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature  and intent of the actor's conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from  the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the [person's] situation."" Id. The ""factual allegations contained in the [underlying] complaint"" are determinative of whether a duty to defend or  indemnify is triggered, rather than the cause of action pled. Mutual Benefit Ins. Co. v. Haver, 555 Pa. 534, 725 A.2d  743, 745 (Pa. 1999). Based on the facts alleged, rather than the theory of liability pled, the Pennsylvania legislature  ""has criminalized the conduct that resulted in the damages"" in the underlying case. [*26]  See Greenfield, 855 A.2d  at 868. Each complaint alleges that Policyholders ignored open and obvious signs of sex trafficking including, but  not limited to: (1) rooms littered with used condoms; (2) men loitering outside of the hotel rooms; (3) rooms paid for  in cash; (4) frequent refusal of housekeeping; (5) aggression directed at the young victims (approximately 14-16  years old) in public spaces; (6) young victims (approximately 14-16 years old) wearing sexually explicit clothing; (7)  different men entering and exiting the hotel rooms; and (8) young victims (approximately 14-16 years old) exhibiting  fear and anxiety in public spaces. See supra II(a)-(d). Collectively, these facts allege what a trafficker later  confirmed: that the Hotel ""operated like a strip club where prostitution was open and obvious."" K.R. Action, Compl.  at ¶ 63. Indeed, police rescued at least one trafficking victim from the Hotel premises prior to or concurrent with the  trafficking of other victims. B.H. Action, Compl. at ¶ 80. These facts, if true, make plain that Policyholders knowingly benefitted from acts facilitating the trafficking scheme  by renting rooms to traffickers despite the overwhelming evidence of the trafficking scheme. [*27]  Moreover, even if  Policyholders did not knowingly benefit, at the very least, Policyholders looked the other way and feigned ignorance  when confronted with clear indicia of sex trafficking. Indeed, the underlying facts alleged leave no question that  Policyholders harbored the underlying plaintiffs in reckless disregard of the sex trafficking that would result.  Plainly, Policyholders' continued business dealings with traffickers and harboring of underlying plaintiffs represent a  gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in a similar situation.  Accordingly, the Court is convinced that the factual allegations contained in the M.B., B.H., C.A., and K.R.  complaints implicate Policyholders' conduct that is criminalized under the Pennsylvania Human Trafficking Law  and repugnant to Pennsylvania public policy. As reasoned by Pennsylvania courts, it is against public policy to  provide insurance for loss attributable to particularly harmful criminal conduct. See Greenfield, 855 A.2d at 860.  Here, shielding Policyholders from the consequences of their criminal conduct would be against the safety, morals,            2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46508, *24 Page 11 of 12 and welfare of the Commonwealth. Therefore, public policy bars coverage and [*28]  Providers do not have a duty  to defend or indemnify Policyholders in the underlying state court actions."

"Solis v. Okeechobee Shooting Sports, LLC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216887.pdf","ORDER DENYING THE DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR  SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND REFERRING CASE  FOR A SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE This matter is before the Court on the Defendant's  Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at docket entry  72. The Plaintiff filed a response at docket entry 81, but  the Defendant did not elect to file a reply. For the  reasons set forth below, the Motion is denied. The Defendant seeks partial summary judgment on the  Plaintiff's Count I, a hostile work environment claim  alleging discrimination on the basis of sex and national  origin. The Motion focuses on the fourth element that  the Plaintiff must prove for her claim, that ""the  harassment was sufficiently [*2]  severe or pervasive to  alter the terms and conditions of employment and create  a discriminatory abusive working environment."" Miller v.  Tillman, 277 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir. 2002). As to this  element, the Defendant contends that the Plaintiff lacks  sufficient evidence for trial. DE 72 at 16. The Plaintiff lacks sufficient evidence, the Defendant  argues, because she only has evidence of a few,  sporadic comments about her national origin over the  span of five years. To support this argument, the  Defendant cites to a number of cases where sporadic  comments, although inappropriate, were not ""sufficiently  severe or pervasive"" to alter the terms and conditions of  employment. By way of example, the Defendant cites to  a case where a few dozen comments over eleven  months were insufficient and where ""several incidents""  over two years were insufficient. In contrast to cases  with sporadic comments, ""all of the []hostile work  environment claims decided by the Supreme Court have  involved patterns or allegations of extensive, long  lasting, unredressed, and uninhibited sexual threats or         Page 2 of 2 conduct  that  permeated  the  plaintiffs'  work  environment."" Indest v. Freeman Decorating, Inc., 164  F.3d 258, 263 (5th Cir. 1999). The Court begins its analysis of the evidence by  summarizing the content of the statements allegedly  made to [*3]  the Plaintiff. The Defendant summarizes  the content of the statements as ""your people  [Mexicans] are here to take American jobs, Mexicans do  a great job on the lawn, and Hepatitis B was because  [Plaintiff's] people caused it because they did not get  shots in their County."" DE 72 at 13. For the Plaintiff's  part, she contends that an employee of the Defendant: repeatedly made the same or similar inappropriate  comments regularly in the workplace so that at  least one sex-related comment or one national  origin comment was made at least once a week. DE 80 at 6 (emphasis added). The Plaintiff supported  her contention with a proper evidentiary citation in her  statement of additional facts at docket entry 80: Q. Okay. And the comments occurred at least once  a week in the workplace; is that right? A. Yes. DE 74-1 at 75 (Plaintiff's deposition). In the Plaintiff's  own words, the reason inappropriate comments were  made with such frequency was because: There was a lot of political going on in the news at  the time when I started, so it was very political the  whole time. And like politics, there's always  immigration in the mix, so it was a constant  conversation of how he disagreed with this,  disagreed [*4]  with that, so it was something that I  would hear all the time. Id. In response to this evidence, the Defendant filed no  reply. As a result, pursuant to Local Rule 56.1(c), the  Plaintiff's assertion and corresponding evidence is  deemed admitted by the Defendant. Thus, the  Defendant has admitted that an employee made  derogatory comments about the Plaintiff's national origin  (and sometimes her sex) a minimum of once per week  for the duration of the Plaintiff's employment—five  years—which is approximately 260 comments. Based  upon the content of the statements, the Court is  persuaded by the Plaintiff's argument that 260  comments over five years is extensive and long lasting,  such that it could substantially alter the terms and  conditions of employment. Thus, the sporadic-comment  case law relied upon by the Defendant does not apply— the Plaintiff has evidence that the discriminatory  comments made to her were not sporadic—and the  Defendant's Motion is denied. The parties shall participate in a second settlement  conference before the Honorable Magistrate Judge  Shaniek M. Maynard on or before January 9, 2024. The  parties shall immediately contact the Chambers of  Judge Maynard to schedule the conference.

[*P1]  Before accepting defendant-appellant Gary Lee  Davis's guilty plea, the trial court mistakenly advised him  that he faced a discretionary two-year period of  postrelease control if convicted of robbery under R.C.  2911.02(A)(2).

We hold that  Davis entered a guilty plea without understanding the  maximum penalty. Therefore, we reverse the trial court's  judgment and vacate Davis's guilty plea. I. Facts and Procedure  [*P2]  Davis was charged with robbery in violation of  R.C. 2911.02(A)(2). He initially pleaded not guilty.  Following a series of unsuccessful pretrial motions,  Davis signed a written form withdrawing his not-guilty  plea and pleading guilty to an amended charge of third- degree felony robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(3).  [*P3]  At the plea hearing, the state explained that the  charge stemmed from an October 2020 robbery of a  Page 2 of 4 PNC bank branch, where Davis held up a note to bank  employees which read ""give me the money."" Davis's  counsel clarified, ""there was no weapon, or any actual  threat verbalized."" As the trial court proceeded through  its colloquy, it informed Davis that he faced ""from 9 to 36  months in prison,"" and following his release he ""could  be placed on up to two years of post-release control"" for  the offense. The trial court accepted his plea.  [*P4]  At the sentencing hearing, the state recounted  Davis's criminal record, explaining that the robbery in  this case occurred while Davis was on supervised [**3]   release. The trial court imposed a 36-month sentence  consecutive to the sentences in two cases from  Montgomery County, Ohio. The trial court found that  consecutive sentences were necessary because he was  under postrelease control when he committed the  offense and due to his criminal history. In addition, the  trial court imposed a mandatory one-to-three-year  period of postrelease control.  [*P5]  In two assignments of error, Davis challenges his  plea and sentence. II. Law and Analysis  [*P6]  Davis's first assignment of error argues that the  trial court erroneously informed him during its plea  colloquy that he faced a discretionary two-year period of  postrelease control. But R.C. 2967.28 required the trial  court  to  impose  a  one-to-three-year  period  of  postrelease control. Davis maintains that the trial court  breached its duty to advise him of the maximum penalty  under Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a). A. Trial courts must ensure defendants understand the  effect of their pleas.  [*P7]  A defendant's decision to enter a guilty plea is a  solemn and serious one, filled with promise and peril.  State v. Bishop, 156 Ohio St. 3d 156, 2018-Ohio-5132,  124 N.E.3d 766, ¶ 10. Because a guilty plea operates as  a waiver of several constitutional rights, the validity of a  guilty plea turns on whether that plea was ""done  voluntarily, knowingly, [**4]  and intelligently, 'with  sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and  likely consequences.'"" Bradshaw v. Stumpf, 545 U.S.  175, 183, 125 S.Ct. 2398, 162 L.Ed.2d 143 (2005),  quoting Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 748, 90  S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970).  [*P8]  For felony offenses like Davis's, a trial court  ""shall not accept a plea of guilty or no contest without * *  * [d]etermining that the defendant is making the plea  voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the  charges and of the maximum penalty involved."" Crim.R.  11(C)(2)(a). A trial court must ""'convey to the defendant  certain information so that he can make a voluntary and  intelligent decision whether to plead guilty.'"" State v.  Brinkman, 165 Ohio St. 3d 523, 2021-Ohio-2473, 180  N.E.3d 1074, ¶ 17, quoting State v. Veney, 120 Ohio St.  3d 176, 2008-Ohio-5200, 897 N.E.2d 621, ¶ 18.  [*P9]  Postrelease control is a sanction, ""an additional  term of supervision after an offender's release from  prison that imposes certain restrictions on the offender.""  State v. Bates, 167 Ohio St. 3d 197, 2022-Ohio-475,  190 N.E.3d 610, ¶ 21. It is ""part of the 'maximum penalty  involved' in instances where the trial court imposes a  prison term."" State v. Sullivan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos.  111621 and 111917, 2023-Ohio-1036, ¶ 13. Here, the  trial court accurately explained to Davis that he faced 9  to 36 months in prison. Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) required the  trial court to ensure that Davis understood the maximum  term of postrelease control that he would face.  [*P10]  The right to be informed of the maximum  penalty is nonconstitutional, requiring only substantial  compliance with the rule. State v. Morris, 1st Dist.  Hamilton  No.  C-180520,  2019-Ohio-3011,  ¶  16.  ""Substantial  compliance  'means  that  under  the  totality [**5]  of the circumstances the defendant  subjectively understands the implications of his plea and  the rights he is waiving.'"" Id., quoting State v. Nero, 56  Ohio St.3d 106, 108, 564 N.E.2d 474 (1990). But when  ""a trial court fails to substantially comply with Crim.R. 11  regarding a nonconstitutional provision, a reviewing  court must determine whether the trial court partially  complied or failed to comply with the rule."" State v.  Stumph, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-190318, 2021-Ohio- 723, ¶ 8, citing Morris at ¶ 18, and State v. Clark, 119  Ohio St. 3d 239, 2008-Ohio-3748, 893 N.E.2d 462, ¶ 32. B. The trial court failed to comply with Crim.R. 11.  [*P11]  Davis pleaded guilty to robbery in violation of  R.C. 2911.02(A)(3), a third-degree felony. Robbery is an  offense of violence. See R.C. 2901.01(A)(9)(a). The  duration of postrelease control for a third-degree felony  depends on the nature of the offense. See R.C.  2967.28. A defendant convicted of a third-degree felony  ""that is an offense of violence and is not a felony sex  offense [faces] up to three years, but not less than one  year"" of postrelease control. R.C. 2967.28(B)(4). In  Page 3 of 4 contrast, a defendant convicted of a third-degree felony  that is a sex offense faces up to five years of  postrelease control. R.C. 2967.28(B)(1). And if the third- degree felony is neither an offense of violence nor a sex  offense, a defendant faces ""up to two years"" of  postrelease control at the discretion of the parole board.  R.C. 2967.28(C).  [*P12]  The trial court informed Davis, ""[I]f I would send  you to prison, [**6]  upon your release from prison, you  could be placed on up to two years of post-release  control."" The state acknowledges that the trial court  mistakenly advised Davis that he was subject to a  discretionary two-year period of postrelease control but  argues that the plea form provided sufficient notice of  the maximum penalty. We disagree.  [*P13]  The plea form explained that Davis was  pleading guilty to ""Robbery/2911.02(A)(3),"" which is an  ""F3"" with a potential sentence of ""9-36 MOS"" and a  $10,000 maximum fine. While the form indicated that  Davis faced one to three years of postrelease control for  a third-degree felony offense of violence, it also  indicated that he faced ""up to two years as determined  by the parole board for * * * a felony of the third degree  (F3) which does not involve physical harm or threatened  physical harm to a person."" The form failed to specify  that Davis pleaded guilty to an offense involving actual  or threatened physical harm. Rather, it merely identified  robbery as a third-degree felony, while also describing  two potential terms of postrelease control.  [*P14]  At the plea hearing, the state explained the  factual basis for the offense—that Davis ""knowingly  inflicted, attempted to inflict, [**7]  or threatened to inflict  physical harm on another."" But Davis's counsel  emphasized that the robbery consisted of ""a note that  said give me the money, that there was no weapon or  actual threat verbalized."" Later, the trial court asked  Davis if he understood that ""upon your release from  prison, you could be placed on up to two years of post- release control?""  [*P15]  Considering the conflicting information provided  to Davis at the plea hearing, we cannot conclude that  the trial court ensured that Davis had a full  understanding of the consequences of his guilty plea.  We hold that the trial court did not substantially comply  with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a)'s mandate requiring it to  determine that Davis entered his plea with an  understanding of the maximum penalty involved.  [*P16]  Next, we ""must determine whether the trial court  partially complied or failed to comply with the rule.""  Morris, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-180520, 2019-Ohio- 3011, ¶ 17, citing State v. Clark, 119 Ohio St. 3d 239,  2008-Ohio-3748, 893 N.E.2d 462, ¶ 32. Absent a  complete failure to comply with Crim.R. 11(C), a guilty  ""plea  may  only  be  vacated  if  the  defendant  demonstrates prejudice."" Id., citing Clark at ¶ 32. Davis  has not argued that the trial court's incorrect statement  constituted a complete failure, so to demonstrate  prejudice he must show ""'that he would not have  otherwise pled had the court complied with Crim.R.  11(C) [**8] .'"" State v. Fleming, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C- 210297, 2022-Ohio-740, ¶ 6, quoting State v. Littleton,  1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-150056 and C-150057, 2015- Ohio-4143, ¶ 9, citing State v. Nero, 56 Ohio St.3d 106,  108, 564 N.E.2d 474 (1990).  [*P17]   Davis  maintains  that  the  trial  court's  misstatement was prejudicial because his sentence  factored into his decision to enter a plea. As we have  explained, ""[t]he potential sentence hanging over a  pleading defendant is one of the important matters on  his mind, if not the most important."" State v. Wilson, 55  Ohio App.2d 64, 66, 379 N.E.2d 273 (1st Dist.1978).  Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a)'s prescription reflects the principle  that knowledge of the maximum penalty affects a  defendant's ""ability to weigh the risks of taking the case  to trial and perhaps facing a maximum sentence, versus  entering a plea and perhaps receiving a more lenient  sentence."" State v. Allen, 2d Dist. Miami Nos. 2021-CA- 31 and 2021-CA-32, 2022-Ohio-1872, ¶ 9, citing State v.  Burnett, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2013-CA-98, 2016-Ohio- 2655, ¶ 11. ""When a defendant receives a sentence that  exceeds what the trial court previously informed the  defendant was the maximum penalty, the prejudice is  apparent on its face."" State v. Tackett, 8th Dist.  Cuyahoga No. 111998, 2023-Ohio-2298, ¶ 22, 221  N.E.3d 172, citing State v. Drake, 9th Dist. Medina No.  16CA0056-M, 2017-Ohio-4027, ¶ 12.  [*P18]  The record demonstrates that the length of his  potential sentence influenced Davis's decision to enter  into a plea agreement. The trial court apprised Davis of  a discretionary two-year period of postrelease control,  but he ultimately received a mandatory one-to-three- year period of postrelease control. In other words, Davis  received a more severe maximum penalty than the trial  court initially explained.  [*P19]  We find that the sentence imposed by the [**9]   trial court prejudiced Davis. We sustain Davis's first  assignment of error. Davis's second assignment of error  challenging his sentence is moot and we decline to  address it. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c). Page 4 of 4"
"State v. Jose Y., 2023 N.J. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 2234.pdf","[*1] Argued November 6, 2023 - Decided December 7,  2023   Before Judges Sabatino, Marczyk, and Chase.   On appeal from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law  Division, Somerset County, Indictment No. 20-01-0028.    Samuel Clark Carrigan, Assistant Deputy Public   Defender, argued the cause for appellant (Joseph E.   Krakora, Public Defender, attorney; Samuel Clark   Carrigan, of counsel and on the briefs).       1  Under  Rule  1:38-3(c)(9),  records  of  criminal  proceedings relating to child victims of sexual assault  are anonymized and excluded from public access in  order to protect the identity of the victims. As there was  no actual child victim in this case, such anonymization is  not necessary here.      Emily M. M. Pirro, Assistant Prosecutor, argued the  cause for respondent (John P. McDonald, Somerset  County Prosecutor, attorney; Emily M. M. Pirro, of  counsel and on the brief).   The opinion of the court was delivered by CHASE,  J.S.C. (temporarily assigned).   The main issue in this criminal appeal is whether the  Luring , Enticing Child by Various Means statute,  N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a), requires the State to prove a  defendant lured or enticed a ""child,"" in this case an  undercover law enforcement officer posing as a fourteen  -year-old girl, into traveling or accompanying [*2]  the  defendant to some location other than the victim's own  home.   We reject defendant Jose Y. Martinez-Mejia's contention  that because he enticed the ""child"" to meet him alone,  and defendant traveled to the ""child's"" home, a  judgment of acquittal should have been entered. By its  plain language, the statute forbids an adult from ""luring  or enticing a child to meet or appear at any other place.""  We hold that the child's home can be the ""other place.""  Here, that location is a place ""other"" than where the  defendant was when he communicated with the child.   In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we address  unrelated arguments raised by defendant on appeal  alleging  evidentiary  issues.  Having  found  those  arguments do not demonstrate plain error, we affirm  defendant's convictions and sentence.   A-3472-21      2     Page 2 of 9 I.   The prosecution in this matter originated in October  2019 when a team of state, federal, and local law  enforcement agencies participated in an undercover  operation to investigate adults using the internet to lure  ch ildren into sexual activity. Teams of officers were  stationed  in  an  apartment  complex  in  Franklin  Township, Somerset County.   Special Agent Cedro Cruz from the [*3]  Department of  Homeland Security served as a ""chatter,"" posing as a  fourteen-year-old girl named ""Angela."" Agent Cruz  created a profile for Angela on SKOUT, a location - based  social  networking  and  dating  application  emphasizing generalized user location. Because of age  restrictions on SKOUT, Angela's profile was created  using a birthdate to reflect that she was eighteen-years  old. Angela's profile picture and other pictures  associated with her account were photographs of an  adult female border patrol officer. Agent Cruz used age- regression software to alter the photographs, making  Angela appear younger.   At a jury trial, Agent Cruz testified solely as a fact  witness that on the afternoon of October 25, 2019,  acting as Angela, he accepted a SKOUT chat request  from defendant, who went by the username ""James.""  Defendant was thirty-two years old at the time.  Defendant's first messages were ""Hi, sweetheart, how  are you?"" and ""Hi, sweetheart, what are you doing?""  When    A-3472-21      3      Angela replied with ""nothing,"" he immediately followed  up with, ""[y]our pictures turn me on, honey. Where are  you from?"" When Agent Cruz testified about this first  exchange with defendant, the following [*4]  ensued:   Q: On October 25[,] of 2019, why was the conversation  only minutes?   A: Because the defendant sent Angela a, I would say a  lewd image, and I basically said gross and that  discontinued the conversation.   Q: And by lewd image what do you mean?   A: So it was an image of a male in tight boxer shorts  and you could see the contour of his - his penis.   Defendant contacted Angela again via SKOUT the next  afternoon in an   interaction that lasted approximately two hours. When  defendant expressed a desire to meet Angela, the  following exchange ensued:   Angela: Yeah, but I'm mad young.   Defendant: How old are you now?   Angela: Fourteen. You?   Defendant: Oh, I see, 23.   Angela: Oh, okay, cool.   Defendant: Yes, love, I like your body.   Angela: Aw, thanks.   Defendant: I would like to see more pictures from you.   Angela: Why?   Defendant: I like you.    A-3472-21      4     During this exchange, and after Angela revealed her  age, defendant sent Angela   multiple photographs of himself, including a picture of  his erect penis.   Angela revealed she was home alone because her  grandmother had left   and would not be returning until the next day. Defendant  asked Angela explicit   questions about sex and [*5]  masturbation and said he  wanted ""more sexy pic tures""   of her. When Angela asked if he wanted only pictures,  he responded, ""I want to   know you in person, baby."" Defendant asked if Angela  wanted to touch his body   and told her he wanted to perform oral sex on her.   The prosecution admitted the photographs into evidence  and published   them for the jury. Agent Cruz was asked to ""describe to  the jury what they're   Page 3 of 9 seeing[.]"" He replied, ""The jury is seeing an image sent  to Angela through   SKOUT on October 26[,] of a hand holding an erect  penis.""   On re-direct, Agent Cruz testified as follows:   Q: During the course of those communications at any  point in time did you threaten the defendant that he had  to continue communicating with you?   A: No. I was trying to dissuade him from communicating  with me.   . . . .   Q: How did you do that?   A: Well, I asked if he was a pic collector, and if he would  have said yes, I am just a pic collector, then he would  have just been a pic collector. I said that I -I was  [fourteen] years old, I would hope after somebody    A-3472-21      5      hears that, that they are communicating with a  [fourteen]-year-old,  they  would  then  cease  communications with that person. [*6]  I said that I was  alone, a fourteen-year-old alone in her house to which  he asked me if there were any neighbors around and,  you know, I lived with my grandmother and my  grandmother was not home. That, any reasonable  person, that's going to dissuade you and you are not  going to travel. As a matter of fact, you might try to  either report this person, which has happened in the  past, but in this situation it didn't happen. And on top of  that he sent a picture of his erect penis to a [fourteen]- year-old.    When defendant offered to come to Angela at 4:00 p.m.  that day, she gave   him the address of the apartment in Franklin and a  phone number associated   with Agent Cruz's undercover phone.   The communication then proceeded outside of SKOUT  and directly   between defendant and the undercover phone, which  recorded every call and   text message. Agent Cruz continued to send and reply  to text messages; while   Detective Katie Feehan from the New Jersey State  Police Internet Crimes   Against Children Unit (""ICACU"") provided Angela's voice  for phone calls.   Detective Feehan testified to her role with the ICACU  and the training   that she received in acting as a child in an undercover  capacity; however, [*7]  she   was not tendered as an expert witness. She testified to  the details of her three   phone calls with defendant.         A-3472-21      6      During the first phone call, defendant asked Angela to  confirm that she was home alone. Angela told defendant  her grandmother was in Atlantic City and would not be  returning for a couple of days. Angela said her  grandmother could not take her on the trip because she  was not old enough to gamble. On a second phone call,  Angela confirmed no one else was in th e house by  saying, ""Just me and my grandma, and she isn't here.  So I mean, I'm completely alone."" On the third phone  call, the following exchange ensued:   [Angela]: . . . I'm just trying to figure out if you're coming  up. Because, if not, I'm probably just gonna go out.   [Defendant]: I mean, okay. So let me take a shower and  then go - go over there.   [Angela]: You gonna come? [Defendant]: Yes.   [Angela]: Okay. Awesome. I'm gonna clean up a little bit  then.   When Angela asked defendant what he wanted to do  when he arrived, he repeated his desire to perform oral  sex on her. She reaffirmed she was going to clean the  apartment to prepare for his arrival, and then she was  going to wait for him. [*8]    Defendant hired an Uber to take him to Franklin and  sent Angela a screen shot of his phone's Uber  application, showing that he was on his way to her  house. When defendant texted Angela that he had  Page 4 of 9 arrived, Agent Cruz could   A-3472-21      7      see him standing outside through the apartment  window. Defendant was arrested and was found to be in  possession of a cell phone, a receipt with Angela's  address written on it, $184 dollars, and two condoms.   At trial, Detective Feehan was asked on cross- examination about her training on the topic of  entrapment. Detective Feehan testified that she ha d  reviewed the relevant New Jersey law and that it closely  matched the national standard. She testified that she  had been trained to allow the subject of the investigation  ""to set the tone, pace, and subject matter of the  conversation[.]"" She was presented with a portion of the  investigative standards from the ICACU, which was  entered into evidence.   On re-direct, the following exchange took place:   Q: On cross-examination you were asked some  questions about your training with regard to the topic of  entrapment. Do you recall that?   A: Yes.   Q: And you testified that you received training about  the [*9]  federal and also State of New Jersey  entrapment laws. Is that correct?   A: Yes.   Q: Did you follow the entrapment laws in this case? A:  Yes.          A-3472-21      8      Defense counsel re-crossed Detective Feehan on those  points, asking whether ""[w]hat do you wanna do when  you get here?"" was a conversation topic that defendant  initiated, to which she replied in the negative.   During an extensive charge conference, defense  counsel raised no objections to the language of the  second-degree luring charge. The jury was instructed  that a guilty verdict on luring required the State to prove:   1. That ""Angela"" was a child. When I say Angela I have  that in quotes, or, that the defendant reasonably  believed that Angela was a child.   2. Defendant-that defendant attempted to lure or entice  Angela into a motor vehicle, structure or isolated area,  to meet or appear at any other place; and,   3. That defendant had a purpose to commit a criminal  offense with or against the child.   The jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of all  charges: second - degree luring, N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a);  second-degree attempted sexual assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:5- 1(a)(3) and 2C:14-2(c)(4); third-degree attempted  endangering the welfare of a child, N.J.S.A. 2C:24- 4(a)(1), 2C:5-1(a)(1) and (a)(3); and third-degree [*10]   attempted promoting obscene material to a minor,  N.J.S.A. 2C:34 - 3(b)(1), 2C:5-1(a)(1) and (a)(3).   After merging the attempted endangering the welfare of  a child count with the attempted sexual assault count,  the judge sentenced defendant concurrently to five  years of imprisonment on the attempted sexual assault  charge; five years   A-3472-21      9      on the luring charge; and three years on the attempted  obscene material charge. Defendant was also subjected  to Megan's Law registration requirements and parole  supervision for life.   On appeal, defendant raises the following claims for the  first time:   I. THE LURING CHARGE MUST BE VACATED  BECAUSE DEFENDANT DID NOT TRY TO LURE A  CHILD INTO GOING ANYWHERE.   II. THE DEFENDANT'S CONVICTIONS SHOULD BE  REVERSED BECAUSE INADMISSIBLE LAY OPINION  TESTIMONY  FROM  INVESTIGATING  OFFICERS  INTRODUCED UNFAIR PREJUDICE.   II.   When a party does not object to an alleged trial error, or  otherwise preserve the issue for the appellate record, it  is reviewed for plain error. Review for plain error  requires determining: ""(1) whether there was error; and  (2) whether that error was 'clearly capable of producing  an unjust result,' [under Rule] 2:10-2; that is, whether  there is 'a reasonable doubt . . . as to whether [*11]  the  error led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have  reached.'"" State v. Dunbrack, 245 N.J. 531, 544 (2021)  (quoting State v. Funderburg, 225 N.J. 66, 79 (2016)  Page 5 of 9 (omission in original)). ""To determine whether an alle  ged error rises to the level of plain error, it 'must be  evaluated in light of the overall strength of the State's  case.'"" State v. Clark, 251 N.J. 266, 287 (2022) (quoting  State v.     A-3472-21      10      Sanchez-Medina, 231 N.J. 452, 468 (2018)). ""The mere  possibility of an unjust result is not enough.""  Funderberg, 225 N.J. at 79. Where there is a failure to  object, reviewing courts presume the newly minted  objection on appeal is ""not error"" and ""unlikely to  prejudice the defendant's case."" State v. Singleton, 211  N.J. 157, 182 (2012) (citing State v. Macon, 57 N.J. 325,  333-34, (1971)).   Statutory  interpretations  are  legal  determinations  reviewed by an appellate court ""de novo, 'unconstrained  by deference to the decisions of the trial court[.]'"" State  v. Fuqua, 234 N.J. 583, 591 (2018) (quoting State v.  S.B., 230 N.J. 62, 67 (2017)). A trial court's evidentiary  rulings, by contrast, are reviewed for abuse of  discretion. State v. Garcia, 245 N.J. 412, 430 (2021)  (citing State v. Nantambu, 221 N.J. 390, 402 (2015)). An  appellate court ""will not substitute [its] judgment unless  the evidentiary ruling is 'so wide of the mark' that it  constitutes 'a clear error in judgment.'"" Ibid. (quoting  State v. Medina, 242 N.J. 397, 412 (2020)).     III.   Defendant does not claim the indictment should have  been dismissed, nor does he explicitly express that the  trial court, sua sponte, should have found that the State  had not met the elements of [*12]  the crime at the close  of its case. Rather, defendant's issue seems to be a  conceptual one, where h e believes we should hold: (1)  telling a child you want to meet for sex; (2) asking them  to meet you    A-3472-21      11      to fulfill that desire; and (3) making sure a child is alone  and vulnerable before meeting them, is not luring or  enticing the child into a sexual encount er so long as the  child makes the mistake of meeting the would -be  predator at the child's own house.   Defendant emphasizes that the forbidden conduct  element of the statute is ""to lure or entice"" a child to go  somewhere. Relying on the dictionary definitio n of  ""lure,"" defendant argues its aim is ""to lead someone into  a dangerous or difficult situation that they otherwise  would not have entered."" Merriam-Webster's Collegiate  Dictionary, (11th ed. 2020). Therefore, defendant  reasons, the statute does not criminalize traveling to the  child for the criminal purpose. Defendant concedes a  child may be ""lured"" into staying at a place that they  otherwise would have left, such as a school after -hours,  but argues if a child would be at home or school  anyway, even without the defendant's enticement, then  luring has not [*13]  taken place.   Defendant argues, in the alternative, that even if the  statutory language was not clear, the only provision that  could be considered ambiguous is the term ""to meet or  appear at any other place."" Defendant employs the  canon of ejusdem generis to argue that the phrase ""any  other place"" must also refer to places where a child  must be lured to travel towards for the statutory  elements to be met. Defendant points to the luring  statute's close relationship to the kidnapping    A-3472-21      12      statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(c), to support his theory.  Defendant argues even if the statutory language did not  support his position, the principle of lenity should apply  in favor of interpreting the statute to require the child to  be lured to travel.   The State responds that defendant is asking us to  create a ""convenient loophole"" in the statutory scheme  by finding that an adult traveling to a child's location for  the purpose of sex is not criminalized by the luring  statute. The State maintains that a complicated analysis  of the text under ejusdem generis is not required since  the clause ""to meet or appear at any other place"" is  unambiguous on its face.   The  ""ordinary  meaning  and  significance""  of  statutory [*14]  language is acknowledged as ""'the best  indicator of [the Legislature's] intent.'"" Tumpson v.  Farina, 218 N.J. 450, 467 (2014) (alteration in original)  (quoting DiProspero v. Penn, 183 N.J. 477, 492 (2005)).  Only where the statutory language at issue is  ambiguous should a court ""look to extrinsic evidence,  such as legislative history [and] committee reports"" to  determine legislative intent. Tumpson, 218 N.J. at 468.  Where the textual analysis and extrinsic aids both fail to  resolve ambiguity, the rule of lenity ""requires that the  ambiguity be resolved in favor of the defendant."" State  Page 6 of 9 v. Regis, 208 N.J. 439, 451 (2011). Courts should ""avoid  statutory interpretations that 'lead to absurd or  unreasonable results.'"" State v. Lewis, 185 N.J. 363,  369 (2005) (quoting State v. Gill, 47 N.J. 441, 444  (1966)).    A-3472-21      13     The plain language of the statutory text in question  provides in relevant   part:   A person commits a crime of the second degree if he  attempts, via electronic or any other means, to lure or  entice-a child or one who he reasonably believes to be a  child into a motor vehicle, structure or isolated area, or  to meet or appear at any other place, with a purpose to  commit a criminal offense with or against the child.   [N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a) (emphasis added).]   One must look at the wording of the entire phrase in its  context, which   prohibits to ""lure or entice,"" and the entire dictionary  definition of both words  [*15]   to  determine  the  statute's  ordinary  meaning.  Defendant's argument only focuses   on the dictionary definition of ""lure"" to conclude that ""to  lead someone into a   dangerous or difficult situation that they otherwise would  not have entered""   means to go to another location. The definition of ""lure""  includes ""to lead astray   from one's true course."" Merriam-Webster's College  Dictionary, (11th ed. 2020). And ""entice"" is defined as  ""to lure or induce; esp., to wrongfully solicit (a person) to  do something."" Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019).  The   prohibited conduct is thus defined by its aim to lead  someone into a dangerous   or difficult situation that they otherwise would not have  entered. The course of   action Angela was lured into was staying alone,  isolated, and vulnerable to meet   an adult male for an illegal sexual encounter.       A-3472-21      14      Here, the ordinary meaning of the phrase ""to meet or  appear at any other place"" also leads to the conclusion  defendant engaged in prohibited conduct when he  enticed Angela to stay at her home and not go out with  her friends. There is no reason to construe the phrase of  ""any other place"" as containing an unwritten exception  for places [*16]  where the child is already located.  Here, that location is a place ""other"" than where the  defendant was when he communicated with the child.  Defendant went through great pains to ensure Angela  would be alone before telling her he was coming over.  Indeed, by requesting the child to stay at her home, the  abuse is all the easier to commit; since it lulls the child  into a false sense of security; creating the dangerous  circumstance of isolation and vulnerability that this  statute is meant to punish. Neither the dictionary  definitions nor the language of the statute expresses a  requirement of the victim going to a different place.     Although there is no need to make any further inquiry,  our decision is also supported by the legislative history,  which suggests an intent to create an expansive  scheme to criminalize an increasing number of  dangerous behaviors. The original text, now thirty years  old, was limited to luring a child into a motor vehicle. By  contrast, the current statute criminalizes two actions  (luring and enticing), by unlimited means (electronic or  any other), with two categories of victims (children or  those reasonably believed to be children), a wide  number of    A-3472-21 [*17]       15      prohibited enticements (motor vehicles, structures,  isolated areas, and meetings or appearances at any  other place), and a broadly stated purpose element (to  commit a criminal offense with or against the child).   In addition, analyzing this statute in relation to our  kidnapping statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:13-1, also undermines  defendant's position. The kidnapping statute was meant  to address the kind of danger isolation poses to a child,  and such isolation and danger can certainly be present  at the child's own home, especially where, as here, the  child is confirmed to be home alone. See State v. Cruz- Pena, 243 N.J. 342, 354-61 (2020) (kidnapping occurs  Page 7 of 9 when the victim is confined to one place for a  substantial period, citing to a litany of cases where  kidnapping - by-confinement occurs in places where the  victim would still otherwise be); State v. LaFrance, 117  N.J. 583, 592-93 (1990) (confining a victim to his own  bedroom for a substantial period in order to isolate the  man's wife and sexually assault her constituted  kidnapping).   Defendant's request that the principle of lenity support  an interpretation in his favor is similarly unavailing, and  is not required, given the unambiguous text and  expansive legislative history. The fact that other statutes  such as the child endangerment statute, [*18]  N.J.S.A.  2C:24 -4, might also criminalize a defendant's behavior  does not compel us to adopt a crabbed interpretation of  N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a).    A-3472-21      16     IV.   The remaining arguments presented by defendant  warrant no more than a brief discussion.   A.   Lay witnesses may testify ""in the form of opinions or  inferences if [the testimony]: (a) is rationally based on  the witness's perception; and (b) will assist in  understanding the witness's testimony or determining a  fact in issue."" N.J.R.E. 701. Perception ""rests on the  acquisition of knowledge through use of one's sense of  touch, taste, sight, smell, or hearing."" State v. McLean,  205 N.J. 439, 457 (2011) (citations omitted). Lay opinion  testimony is impermissible when it constitutes ""an  expression of a belief in defendant's guilt"" or ""an opinion  on matters that were not beyond the understanding of  the jury."" Id. at 463. Lay witnesses may not opine on a  matter ""as to which the jury is as competent as [the  witness] to form a conclusion[.]"" Id. at 459 (second  alteration in original) (quoting Brindley v. Firemen's Ins.  Co., 35 N.J. Super. 1, 8 (App. Div. 1955)). So long as  the lay witness opinion is competent under N.J.R.E.  701, and is not otherwise inadmissible, it will not be  objectionable simply becau se it ""embraces an ultimate  issue to be decided by the trier of fact."" N.J.R.E. 704.  See Biunno, Weissbard & Zegas, Current [*19]  N.J.  Rules of Evidence, cmt. on N.J.R.E. 704 (2023)  (""[O]pinion testimony is not inadmissible solely because  it includes the    A-3472-21      17     ultimate issue in question. If lay or expert opinion  testimony is otherwise   competent under N.J.R.E. 701, 702 and 703, the fact  that it may embrace the   ultimate fact issue in dispute does not render it  incompetent."").   Fact testimony, by contrast, is ""ordinary fact-based  recitation by a witness   with first-hand knowledge."" McLean, 205 N.J. at 460.  For a police officer, in   the context of a narcotics trial, such fact testimony may  include:   a description of what the officer did and saw, . . . that  defendant stood on a corner, engaged in a brief  conversation, looked around, reached into a bag,  handed another person an item, accepted paper  currency in exchange, threw the bag aside as the officer  approached, and that the officer found drugs in the bag.   Ibid.   In McLean, our Supreme Court cautioned against  admitting lay opinion   testimony by a police officer where the opinion is based  on the officer's training   and experience, writing ""the analysis of admissibility has  been, as it must be,   firmly rooted in the personal observations and  perceptions of the lay witness in   the traditional meaning [*20]  of the Rule 701."" 205 N.J.  at 459. The McLean Court   considered the admissibility of a police officer's  testimony in which he first   recounted his observations of an interaction between  two individuals and then   testified as to his own belief, based on his experience,  that what he had observed   was a hand-to-hand drug transaction. Id. at 446.       Page 8 of 9 A-3472-21      18      The McLean Court found the second part of the officer's  testimony inadmissible because the police officer had  not been qualified as an expert and because the lay  opinion rule could not provide a basis for admissibility.  Id. at 463. The Court held such testimony ""was  impermissible both because it was an expression of a  belief in defendant's guilt and because it presumed to  give an opinion on matters that were not beyond the  understanding of the jury."" Ibid.   B.   Defendant argues testimony given by Detective Feehan  included inadmissible lay opinions with ""zero probative""  value, which introduced such an unfair prejudice that a  new trial is required. Specifically, defendant argues  Detective Feehan should not have been permitted to  testify that she followed the laws on entrapment.  Defendant argues the entrapment statute requires the  issue to be settled by [*21]  the factfinder. The State,  meanwhile, contends the testimony was proper.   This testimony from Detective Feehan was offered on re  -direct examination, after detailed cross-examination  squarely placed entrapment at issue. Here, Detective  Feehan's testimony was like that of the hypothetical  narcotics officer described in McLean. It was a factual  recitation of her own actions during the operation,  namely that she followed protocol, not an opinion about  anything defendant did or did not do. The jury was free  to find her    A-3472-21      19      statements credible or not. Detective Feehan was not  asked for, and did not offer, her thoughts or beliefs as to  defendant's guilt or innocence. She only recounted the  actions she took that day.   Even to the extent that Detective Feehan's testimony  could be considered a lay opinion on entrapment, such  an opinion is not inadmissible simply because it goes to  an issue to be decided by the factfinder. It must be  incompetent under N.J.R.E. 701 or inadmissible on  other grounds. The only argumen t defendant advances  on this point is that the statement had ""zero probative  value,"" possibly an attempt to disqualify the statements  under N.J.R.E. 701(b) or N.J.R.E. 401. This position is  untenable, [*22]  given that entrapment and Detective  Feehan's training on the same were extensively  explored in cross-examination by defense counsel.   Detective Feehan's one-word answer of ""yes"" to the  question, viewed in light of the overall evidence against  defendant, was not ""clearly capable"" of producing an  unjust result. R. 2:10-2. It was evidence to be weighed  by the jury under a preponderance standard if and only  if they found guilt had been established.   C.   Defendant maintains Agent Cruz's description of the  photograph sent on October 25 as ""a lewd image"" and  pointing out the contour of the penis was unnecessary  and impermissibly purported to usurp the role of the  jury. The State    A-3472-21      20     believes the testimony was proper because Agent  Cruz's description was   rationally based on his own perception, as required by  N.J.R.E. 70 1(a).   Agent Cruz's testimony that defendant ""sent a picture of  [an] erect penis   to a [fourteen-year-old],"" his characterization of the  photograph as a ""lewd   image,"" and his description of the displayed photograph  indicating the ""contour   of the penis"" are opinion testimony only to the extent  that they reflect Agent   Cruz's beliefs about the images displayed for the jury.  Our Court [*23]  recently took   up the admissibility of lay witness testimony providing  subjective   interpretations of a video recording in State v. Watson,  254 N.J. 558 (2023).   There, the Court held:   A fact witness who participated in an event can of  course testify about it and recount relevant evidence  without resort to Rule 701. Rule 701, in its purest form,  allows witnesses to offer lay opinion testimony based on  their firsthand observation of events in real time. Beyond  Page 9 of 9 that, they can offer lay opinion testimony about parts of  a recording that depict what they perceived in real time.  In those instances, they plainly have sufficient personal  knowledge within the meaning of Rules 602 and 701.    [Id. at 599.]   The Watson Court also addressed the helpfulness  prong of N.J.R.E.   701(b), holding the analysis is ""more straightforward and  depends on the facts   of the individual case."" Id. at 600. In contrast, in State v.  Higgs the Court   disallowed narration evidence by a police officer who  was not present on the    A-3472-21      21      scene because ""[t]he jury was as competent as the  detective to view the video and determine what the  image did or did not show."" 253 N.J. 333, 3 36 (2023).  Higgs is distinguishable from this case because Agent  Cruz personally participated in the chat to which he was  testifying.   Applying this [*24]  same analysis to the photos before  Agent Cruz, it is clear he was permitted to testify as to  his firsthand observations of the photographs. To the  extent  his  testimony  included  any  subjective  interpretation of the photographs, it would still be an  admissible lay opinion since he personally participated  in the chat and therefore, under Watson, ""plainly [has]  sufficient personal knowledge"" to satisfy N.J.R.E.  701(a). 254 N.J. at 599. And Agent Cruz's testimony  was helpful to the jury under N.J.R.E. 701(b) because  this testimony was offered to explain his interactions  with defendant.   Defendant  posits  Agent  Cruz's  testimony  was  inadmissible because by stating that ""any reasonable  person"" would not continue chatting with someone who  revealed themselves to be a fourteen-year-old, and by  stating ""you are not going to travel"" after learning of the  child's age, Cruz impermissibly opined on defendant's  guilt.  This  opinion,  according  to  defendant,  impermissibly invaded the province of the jury by  embracing an ultimate issue.   Agent Cruz's testimony constitutes opinion testimony in  that it is not a factual recitation of actions taken or  observations made during the operation,    A-3472-21      22      but rather a subjective characterization [*25]  of what  defendant or others in defendant's position might do.  Therefore, to be admissible, the statement must satisfy  both the perception and helpfulness prongs of N.J.R.E.  701, and it must not constitute expression of a belief  about defendant's guilt or innocence.   Here, Agent Cruz's testimony about the behavior of ""any  reasonable person"" and that such a person is ""not going  to travel"" after learning of Ange la's age is more like the  precluded evidence in McLean, in that it is a subjective  lay opinion of defendant's behavior, based on Agent  Cruz's training and experience in performing these types  of operations in the past. These statements were  inadmissible lay opinions, and it was error for them to be  admitted.   However, considering the brevity of these comments  compared to Agent Cruz's overall testimony, the error  does not rise to the level of being clearly capable of  producing an unjust result and was not plain error, given  the overall strength of the State's case and the clear  evidence of defendant's continued sexually explicit  conversation with Angela after being told her age.   Affirmed.                  A-3472-21      23"
"State v. Martinez-Mejia, 2023 N.J. Super. LEXIS 123.pdf","The opinion of the court was delivered by CHASE,  J.S.C. (temporarily assigned). The main issue in this criminal appeal is whether the  Luring, Enticing Child by Various Means statute,  N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a), requires the State to prove a  defendant lured or enticed a ""child,"" in this case an  undercover law enforcement officer posing as a  fourteen-year-old girl, into traveling or accompanying  the defendant to some location other than the victim's  own home. We reject defendant Jose Y. Martinez-Mejia's contention  that because he enticed the ""child"" to meet him alone,  and defendant traveled to the ""child's"" home, a  judgment of acquittal should have been entered. By its  plain language, [*2]  the statute forbids an adult from  ""luring or enticing a child to meet or appear at any other  place."" We hold that the child's home can be the ""other  place."" Here, that location is a place ""other"" than where  the defendant was when he communicated with the  child. In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we address  unrelated arguments raised by defendant on appeal  alleging  evidentiary  issues.  Having  found  those  arguments do not demonstrate plain error, we affirm  defendant's convictions and sentence. I. The prosecution in this matter originated in October  2019 when a team of state, federal, and local law  enforcement agencies participated in an undercover  operation to investigate adults using the internet to lure  children into sexual activity. Teams of officers were  stationed  in  an  apartment  complex  in  Franklin  Township, Somerset County. Special Agent Cedro Cruz from the Department of  Homeland Security served as a ""chatter,"" posing as a  fourteen-year-old girl named ""Angela."" Agent Cruz  created a profile for Angela on SKOUT, a location- Page 2 of 6 based  social  networking  and  dating  application  emphasizing generalized user location. Because of age  restrictions on SKOUT, Angela's profile was created  using [*3]  a birthdate to reflect that she was eighteen- years old. Angela's profile picture and other pictures  associated with her account were photographs of an  adult female border patrol officer. Agent Cruz used age- regression software to alter the photographs, making  Angela appear younger. At a jury trial, Agent Cruz testified solely as a fact  witness that on the afternoon of October 25, 2019,  acting as Angela, he accepted a SKOUT chat request  from defendant, who went by the username ""James.""  Defendant was thirty-two years old at the time.  Defendant's first messages were ""Hi, sweetheart, how  are you?"" and ""Hi, sweetheart, what are you doing?""  When Angela replied with ""nothing,"" he immediately  followed up with, ""[y]our pictures turn me on, honey.  Where are you from?"" When Agent Cruz testified about  this first exchange with defendant, the following ensued: Q: On October 25[,] of 2019, why was the  conversation only minutes? A: Because the defendant sent Angela a, I would  say a lewd image, and I basically said gross and  that discontinued the conversation. Q: And by lewd image what do you mean? A: So it was an image of a male in tight boxer  shorts and you could see the contour of his — his  penis. Defendant [*4]  contacted Angela again via SKOUT the  next  afternoon  in  an  interaction  that  lasted  approximately two hours. When defendant expressed a  desire to meet Angela, the following exchange ensued: Angela: Yeah, but I'm mad young. Defendant: How old are you now? Angela: Fourteen. You? Defendant: Oh, I see, 23. Angela: Oh, okay, cool. Defendant: Yes, love, I like your body. Angela: Aw, thanks. Defendant: I would like to see more pictures from  you. Angela: Why? Defendant: I like you. During this exchange, and after Angela revealed her  age, defendant sent Angela multiple photographs of  himself, including a picture of his erect penis. Angela revealed she was home alone because her  grandmother had left and would not be returning until  the next day. Defendant asked Angela explicit questions  about sex and masturbation and said he wanted ""more  sexy pictures"" of her. When Angela asked if he wanted  only pictures, he responded, ""I want to know you in  person, baby."" Defendant asked if Angela wanted to  touch his body and told her he wanted to perform oral  sex on her. The prosecution admitted the photographs into evidence  and published them for the jury. Agent Cruz was asked  to ""describe to the jury what they're seeing[.]"" [*5]  He  replied, ""The jury is seeing an image sent to Angela  through SKOUT on October 26[,] of a hand holding an  erect penis."" On re-direct, Agent Cruz testified as follows: Q: During the course of those communications at  any point in time did you threaten the defendant  that he had to continue communicating with you? A: No. I was trying to dissuade him from  communicating with me. . . . . Q: How did you do that? A: Well, I asked if he was a pic collector, and if he  would have said yes, I am just a pic collector, then  he would have just been a pic collector. I said that  I—I was [fourteen] years old, I would hope after  somebody hears that, that they are communicating  with a [fourteen]-year-old, they would then cease  communications with that person. I said that I was  alone, a fourteen-year-old alone in her house to  which he asked me if there were any neighbors  around and, you know, I lived with my grandmother  and my grandmother was not home. That, any  reasonable person, that's going to dissuade you  and you are not going to travel. As a matter of fact,  you might try to either report this person, which has  happened in the past, but in this situation it didn't  happen. And on top of that he sent a picture [*6]  of  his erect penis to a [fourteen]-year-old. When defendant offered to come to Angela at 4:00 p.m.  that day, she gave him the address of the apartment in  Franklin and a phone number associated with Agent  Cruz's undercover phone. The communication then proceeded outside of SKOUT  and directly between defendant and the undercover  phone, which recorded every call and text message.  Agent Cruz continued to send and reply to text  messages; while Detective Katie Feehan from the New  Jersey State Police Internet Crimes Against Children  Unit (""ICACU"") provided Angela's voice for phone calls. Page 3 of 6 Detective Feehan testified to her role with the ICACU  and the training that she received in acting as a child in  an undercover capacity; however, she was not tendered  as an expert witness. She testified to the details of her  three phone calls with defendant. During the first phone call, defendant asked Angela to  confirm that she was home alone. Angela told defendant  her grandmother was in Atlantic City and would not be  returning for a couple of days. Angela said her  grandmother could not take her on the trip because she  was not old enough to gamble. On a second phone call,  Angela confirmed no one else was in [*7]  the house by  saying, ""Just me and my grandma, and she isn't here.  So I mean, I'm completely alone."" On the third phone  call, the following exchange ensued: [Angela]: . . . I'm just trying to figure out if you're  coming up. Because, if not, I'm probably just gonna  go out. [Defendant]: I mean, okay. So let me take a shower  and then go — go over there. [Angela]: You gonna come? [Defendant]: Yes. [Angela]: Okay. Awesome. I'm gonna clean up a  little bit then. When Angela asked defendant what he wanted to do  when he arrived, he repeated his desire to perform oral  sex on her. She reaffirmed she was going to clean the  apartment to prepare for his arrival, and then she was  going to wait for him. Defendant hired an Uber to take him to Franklin and  sent Angela a screen shot of his phone's Uber  application, showing that he was on his way to her  house. When defendant texted Angela that he had  arrived, Agent Cruz could see him standing outside  through the apartment window. Defendant was arrested  and was found to be in possession of a cell phone, a  receipt with Angela's address written on it, $184 dollars,  and two condoms. At trial, Detective Feehan was asked on cross- examination about her training on the [*8]  topic of  entrapment. Detective Feehan testified that she had  reviewed the relevant New Jersey law and that it closely  matched the national standard. She testified that she  had been trained to allow the subject of the investigation  ""to set the tone, pace, and subject matter of the  conversation[.]"" She was presented with a portion of the  investigative standards from the ICACU, which was  entered into evidence. On re-direct, the following exchange took place: Q: On cross-examination you were asked some  questions about your training with regard to the  topic of entrapment. Do you recall that? A: Yes. Q: And you testified that you received training about  the federal and also State of New Jersey  entrapment laws. Is that correct? A: Yes. Q: Did you follow the entrapment laws in this case? A: Yes. Defense counsel re-crossed Detective Feehan on those  points, asking whether ""[w]hat do you wanna do when  you get here?"" was a conversation topic that defendant  initiated, to which she replied in the negative. During an extensive charge conference, defense  counsel raised no objections to the language of the  second-degree luring charge. The jury was instructed  that a guilty verdict on luring required the State [*9]  to  prove: 1. That ""Angela"" was a child. When I say Angela I  have that in quotes, or, that the defendant  reasonably believed that Angela was a child. 2. Defendant—that defendant attempted to lure or  entice Angela into a motor vehicle, structure or  isolated area, to meet or appear at any other place;  and, 3. That defendant had a purpose to commit a  criminal offense with or against the child. The jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of all  charges: second-degree luring, N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a);  second-degree attempted sexual assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:5- 1(a)(3) and 2C:14-2(c)(4); third-degree attempted  endangering the welfare of a child, N.J.S.A. 2C:24- 4(a)(1), 2C:5-1(a)(1) and (a)(3); and third-degree  attempted promoting obscene material to a minor,  N.J.S.A. 2C:34-3(b)(1), 2C:5-1(a)(1) and (a)(3). After merging the attempted endangering the welfare of  a child count with the attempted sexual assault count,  the judge sentenced defendant concurrently to five  years of imprisonment on the attempted sexual assault  charge; five years on the luring charge; and three years  on the attempted obscene material charge. Defendant  was also subjected to Megan's Law registration  requirements and parole supervision for life. On appeal, defendant raises the following claims for the  first time: I. THE LURING CHARGE MUST BE VACATED  BECAUSE [*10]  DEFENDANT DID NOT TRY TO  Page 4 of 6 LURE A CHILD INTO GOING ANYWHERE. II. THE DEFENDANT'S CONVICTIONS SHOULD  BE REVERSED BECAUSE INADMISSIBLE LAY  OPINION TESTIMONY FROM INVESTIGATING  OFFICERS INTRODUCED UNFAIR PREJUDICE. II. When a party does not object to an alleged trial error, or  otherwise preserve the issue for the appellate record, it  is reviewed for plain error. Review for plain error  requires determining: ""(1) whether there was error; and  (2) whether that error was 'clearly capable of producing  an unjust result,' [under Rule] 2:10-2; that is, whether  there is 'a reasonable doubt . . . as to whether the error  led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have  reached.'"" State v. Dunbrack, 245 N.J. 531, 544 (2021)  (quoting State v. Funderburg, 225 N.J. 66, 79 (2016)  (omission in original)). ""To determine whether an  alleged error rises to the level of plain error, it 'must be  evaluated in light of the overall strength of the State's  case.'"" State v. Clark, 251 N.J. 266, 287 (2022) (quoting  State v. Sanchez-Medina, 231 N.J. 452, 468 (2018)).  ""The mere possibility of an unjust result is not enough.""  Funderberg, 225 N.J. at 79. Where there is a failure to  object, reviewing courts presume the newly minted  objection on appeal is ""not error"" and ""unlikely to  prejudice the defendant's case."" State v. Singleton, 211  N.J. 157, 182 (2012) (citing State v. Macon, 57 N.J. 325,  333-34, (1971)). Statutory  interpretations  are  legal  determinations  reviewed  by  an  appellate  court  ""de  novo,  'unconstrained [*11]  by deference to the decisions of  the trial court[.]'"" State v. Fuqua, 234 N.J. 583, 591  (2018) (quoting State v. S.B., 230 N.J. 62, 67 (2017)). A  trial court's evidentiary rulings, by contrast, are reviewed  for abuse of discretion. State v. Garcia, 245 N.J. 412,  430 (2021) (citing State v. Nantambu, 221 N.J. 390, 402  (2015)). An appellate court ""will not substitute [its]  judgment unless the evidentiary ruling is 'so wide of the  mark' that it constitutes 'a clear error in judgment.'"" Ibid.  (quoting State v. Medina, 242 N.J. 397, 412 (2020)). III. Defendant does not claim the indictment should have  been dismissed, nor does he explicitly express that the  trial court, sua sponte, should have found that the State  had not met the elements of the crime at the close of its  case. Rather, defendant's issue seems to be a  conceptual one, where he believes we should hold: (1)  telling a child you want to meet for sex; (2) asking them  to meet you to fulfill that desire; and (3) making sure a  child is alone and vulnerable before meeting them, is  not luring or enticing the child into a sexual encounter so  long as the child makes the mistake of meeting the  would-be predator at the child's own house. Defendant emphasizes that the forbidden conduct  element of the statute is ""to lure or entice"" a child to go  somewhere. Relying on the dictionary definition of  ""lure,"" defendant argues its aim is ""to lead [*12]   someone into a dangerous or difficult situation that they  otherwise would not have entered."" Merriam- Webster's  Collegiate Dictionary, (11th ed. 2020). Therefore,  defendant reasons, the statute does not criminalize  traveling to the child for the criminal purpose. Defendant  concedes a child may be ""lured"" into staying at a place  that they otherwise would have left, such as a school  after-hours, but argues if a child would be at home or  school  anyway,  even  without  the  defendant's  enticement, then luring has not taken place. Defendant argues, in the alternative, that even if the  statutory language was not clear, the only provision that  could be considered ambiguous is the term ""to meet or  appear at any other place."" Defendant employs the  canon of ejusdem generis to argue that the phrase ""any  other place"" must also refer to places where a child  must be lured to travel towards for the statutory  elements to be met. Defendant points to the luring  statute's close relationship to the kidnapping statute,  N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(c), to support his theory. Defendant  argues even if the statutory language did not support his  position, the principle of lenity should apply in favor of  interpreting the statute to require the [*13]  child to be  lured to travel. The State responds that defendant is asking us to  create a ""convenient loophole"" in the statutory scheme  by finding that an adult traveling to a child's location for  the purpose of sex is not criminalized by the luring  statute. The State maintains that a complicated analysis  of the text under ejusdem generis is not required since  the clause ""to meet or appear at any other place"" is  unambiguous on its face. The ""ordinary meaning and significance"" of statutory  language is acknowledged as ""'the best indicator of [the  Legislature's] intent.'"" Tumpson v. Farina, 218 N.J. 450,  467 (2014) (alteration in original) (quoting DiProspero v.  Penn, 183 N.J. 477, 492 (2005)). Only where the  statutory language at issue is ambiguous should a court  ""look to extrinsic evidence, such as legislative history  [and] committee reports"" to determine legislative intent.  Tumpson, 218 N.J. at 468. Where the textual analysis  Page 5 of 6 and extrinsic aids both fail to resolve ambiguity, the rule  of lenity ""requires that the ambiguity be resolved in favor  of the defendant."" State v. Regis, 208 N.J. 439, 451  (2011). Courts should ""avoid statutory interpretations  that 'lead to absurd or unreasonable results.'"" State v.  Lewis, 185 N.J. 363, 369 (2005) (quoting State v. Gill,  47 N.J. 441, 444 (1966)). The plain language of the statutory text in question  provides in relevant part: A person commits a crime of the second degree  if [*14]  he attempts, via electronic or any other  means, to lure or entice-a child or one who he  reasonably believes to be a child into a motor  vehicle, structure or isolated area, or to meet or  appear at any other place, with a purpose to  commit a criminal offense with or against the child. [N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a) (emphasis added).] One must look at the wording of the entire phrase in its  context, which prohibits to ""lure or entice,"" and the entire  dictionary definition of both words to determine the  statute's ordinary meaning. Defendant's argument only  focuses on the dictionary definition of ""lure"" to conclude  that ""to lead someone into a dangerous or difficult  situation that they otherwise would not have entered""  means to go to another location. The definition of ""lure""  includes ""to lead astray from one's true course.""  Merriam-Webster's College Dictionary, (11th ed. 2020).  And ""entice"" is defined as ""to lure or induce; esp., to  wrongfully solicit (a person) to do something."" Black's  Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). The prohibited conduct  is thus defined by its aim to lead someone into a  dangerous or difficult situation that they otherwise would  not have entered. The course of action Angela was  lured into was staying [*15]  alone, isolated, and  vulnerable to meet an adult male for an illegal sexual  encounter. Here, the ordinary meaning of the phrase ""to meet or  appear at any other place"" also leads to the conclusion  defendant engaged in prohibited conduct when he  enticed Angela to stay at her home and not go out with  her friends. There is no reason to construe the phrase of  ""any other place"" as containing an unwritten exception  for places where the child is already located. Here, that  location is a place ""other"" than where the defendant was  when he communicated with the child. Defendant went  through great pains to ensure Angela would be alone  before telling her he was coming over. Indeed, by  requesting the child to stay at her home, the abuse is all  the easier to commit; since it lulls the child into a false  sense of security; creating the dangerous circumstance  of isolation and vulnerability that this statute is meant to  punish. Neither the dictionary definitions nor the  language of the statute expresses a requirement of the  victim going to a different place. Although there is no need to make any further inquiry,  our decision is also supported by the legislative history,  which suggests an intent to create [*16]  an expansive  scheme to criminalize an increasing number of  dangerous behaviors. The original text, now thirty years  old, was limited to luring a child into a motor vehicle. By  contrast, the current statute criminalizes two actions  (luring and enticing), by unlimited means (electronic or  any other), with two categories of victims (children or  those reasonably believed to be children), a wide  number of prohibited enticements (motor vehicles,  structures, isolated areas, and meetings or appearances  at any other place), and a broadly stated purpose  element (to commit a criminal offense with or against  the child). In addition, analyzing this statute in relation to our  kidnapping statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:13-1, also undermines  defendant's position. The kidnapping statute was meant  to address the kind of danger isolation poses to a child,  and such isolation and danger can certainly be present  at the child's own home, especially where, as here, the  child is confirmed to be home alone. See State v. Cruz- Pena, 243 N.J. 342, 354-61 (2020) (kidnapping occurs  when the victim is confined to one place for a  substantial period, citing to a litany of cases where  kidnapping-by-confinement occurs in places where the  victim would still otherwise be); State v. LaFrance, 117  N.J. 583, 592-93 (1990) (confining a victim [*17]  to his  own bedroom for a substantial period in order to isolate  the man's wife and sexually assault her constituted  kidnapping). Defendant's request that the principle of lenity support  an interpretation in his favor is similarly unavailing, and  is not required, given the unambiguous text and  expansive legislative history. The fact that other statutes  such as the child endangerment statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:24- 4, might also criminalize a defendant's behavior does  not compel us to adopt a crabbed interpretation of  N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a).

"State v. Nelson, 2023 Iowa App. LEXIS 941.pdf","TABOR, Presiding Judge. A jury found Brandon Nelson guilty of second-degree  theft for taking a motor vehicle. Nelson appeals his  conviction, contending that he did not intend to  permanently deprive the owner of the vehicle. Because  the State did not prove that element beyond a  reasonable doubt, we reverse Nelson's theft conviction  and remand for entry of judgment of acquittal. I. Facts and Prior Proceedings After working an overnight hospital shift in August 2021,  P.K. found his 2017 Chevy Sonic missing from the  parking lot. Within fifteen minutes of calling the police,  P.K. located the vehicle using his OnStar service. It was  six blocks from the hospital. The hospital pulled  surveillance footage of the parking lot; that video  showed that [*2]  the vehicle went missing ""sometime  between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m."" The car was covered in dust because P.K. lived on a  gravel road. But in the dust were ""smudge marks and  handprints"" that weren't there when he arrived at work.  Sheldon Police Officer Todd Wood believed that the  Chevy, which had a manual transmission, had been  placed into neutral and pushed to the new location.  Checking inside, P.K. discovered his cash and clothing  were gone. He also noticed a ""wadded up soaking wet""  plaid shirt that did not belong to him. Later that morning, police received calls that ""a white,  tall male subject"" was seen ""wandering about""  barefooted near a downtown restaurant. Officer Wood  spotted a man matching that description in the  convenience store parking lot. The officer observed that  the man, later identified as Nelson, was ""lost or  confused"" and ""not walking in a straight line."" Officer  Wood asked Nelson if he was okay and noticed a price  tag hanging from the shirt Nelson was wearing. After  Page 2 of 3 more questioning, Officer Wood arrested Nelson. At  the jail, O'Brien County Deputy Keven Van Meeteren  interviewed Nelson, who is a registered sex offender.  The deputy asked Nelson about his failure to  update [*3]  his address for the sex offender registry  when he moved to South Dakota. Nelson said he was  homeless there and did not have a residence to list. The State charged Nelson with theft of a motor vehicle,  a class ""D"" felony, in violation of Iowa Code sections  714.1(1) and 714.2(2) (2021). At trial, Nelson testified  that when he returned to Sheldon from South Dakota,  he was ""just trying to blend in"" and ""needed a rest."" He  admitted pushing the Chevy all six blocks from the  hospital parking lot. But he denied any intent to  permanently deprive P.K. of the car. As a homeless  man, Nelson said he was trying to avoid ""harassment""  from police, so he took the car for shelter. The jury found Nelson guilty of second-degree theft,  among other offenses. The court imposed a prison  sentence not to exceed five years. And the court  ordered that sentence to be served consecutively with  an indeterminate five-year term for Nelson's assault  conviction. Nelson appeals only his theft conviction. II. Scope and Standard of Review We review sufficiency of the evidence claims for  correction of errors at law. State v. Nall, 894 N.W.2d  514, 517 (Iowa 2017). We view the evidence in the light  most favorable to the State, but we consider all  evidence, not just the inculpatory facts. State v.  Keopasaeuth, 645 N.W.2d 637, 640 (Iowa 2002). We  uphold a verdict when [*4]  it is supported by substantial                  evidence in the record. State v. Mong, 988 N.W.2d 305,  312 (Iowa 2023). Evidence is substantial if it ""would  have convinced a rational fact finder that the defendant  is guilty of the crime charged beyond a reasonable  doubt."" State v. Constable, 505 N.W.2d 473, 478 (Iowa  1993). ""Evidence is not substantial if it raises only  suspicion, speculation or conjecture."" State v. Speicher,  625 N.W.2d 738, 741 (Iowa 2001). III. Analysis To find Nelson guilty of theft in the second degree, the  jury had to find these elements: 1. On or about the 10th day of August, 2021, [he]  knowingly took possession or control of an  automobile. 2. [He] did so with the specific intent to permanently  deprive [P.K.] of the automobile. 3. At the time of the taking, the automobile  belonged to [P.K.]. Nelson contests only the element of specific intent. The  instructions defined specific intent as ""not only being  aware of doing an act and doing it voluntarily, but in  addition, doing it with a specific purpose in mind."" From  there, the State had to prove that Nelson acted with the  specific purpose to ""permanently deprive"" P.K. of his  car. See State v. Morris, 677 N.W.2d 787, 788 (Iowa  2004) (defining intent to deprive in Iowa Code section  714.1(1) as intent to permanently deprive); State v.  Schminkey, 597 N.W.2d 785, 789 (Iowa 1999) (same). The jury instructions did not define ""permanently  deprive."" But our case law says it requires ""more than a  temporary dispossessing [*5]  of another's property.""  State v. Berger, 438 N.W.2d 29, 31 (Iowa Ct. App.  1989). Rather, to prove theft, the State had to show that  Nelson intended to withhold the property ""for an  extended period of time, or under such circumstances,  that its benefit or value is lost; or, the property is  disposed of in such a manner or under such  circumstances, as to render it unlikely that the owner will  recover the property."" Id. Nelson notes that his taking of the Chevy without the  owner's consent did not give rise to an inference that he  intended to permanently deprive P.K. of the vehicle. See  Morris, 677 N.W.2d at 788; Schminkey, 597 N.W.2d at  791. He compares his case to Morris and Schminkey. In  Schminkey, our supreme court vacated a guilty plea for  vehicle theft because the record did not support a  factual basis for the defendant's intent to permanently  deprive. 597 N.W.2d at 787. Schminkey had been  Page 3 of 3 drinking, took a truck owned by a man he did not know,  drove erratically, crashed the truck, and killed another  driver before colliding with a fence. Id. at 787. The court  found that none of those facts revealed Schminkey's  intent ""to do anything more than temporarily use the  vehicle to go home or to another bar."" Id. at 791. The  supreme court reaffirmed Schminkey in Morris. 677  N.W.2d at 788. The court reversed a theft conviction  where police stopped Morris about five miles from the  owner's residence [*6]  after he possessed the truck for  about  thirty  minutes;  Morris  fled  on  foot.  Id.  (""Abandoning the vehicle and fleeing upon observing  the presence of police was an act that would ordinarily  assure that the truck would be returned to its owner.""). In defense of this verdict, the State points to Nelson's  admission that he pushed the vehicle away from the  hospital parking lot so he could ""rest"" in it away from the  police. The State contends that the jury could  reasonably infer from that evidence that Nelson took  possession with the intent to permanently deprive P.K.  of the vehicle. For that proposition, the State relies on  State v. Rosewall, 239 N.W.2d 171, 173 (Iowa 1976)  (noting ""unexplained possession of recently stolen  property  justifies  an  inference  of  guilt  of  the  possessor""). Trouble is, the charge in Rosewall was  larceny of a motor vehicle under the 1975 criminal code.  See Iowa Code § 321.82 (1975) (imposing punishment  ""if any person steal, take and carry away, irrespective of  value, any motor vehicle""). Rosewall was convicted of  operating without the owner's consent. 239 N.W.2d at  172 (citing Iowa Code § 321.76). Neither statute  required the State to prove an intent to permanently  deprive. Id. As Nelson argues, under Schminkey and  Morris, the jurors could not infer from Larson's act of  taking the car without [*7]  P.K.'s permission that Larson  had the requisite intent. The State also argues that Nelson ""had no car . . . no  money, and was trying to leave Iowa."" Those  circumstances, according to the State, supported a  finding  that  Nelson  had  the  specific  intent  to  permanently deprive P.K. of his vehicle at the time of  the taking. The State reasons that the fact that Nelson         abandoned the vehicle does not negate the intent he  had at the time of the taking. That may be true, but  neither is abandonment ""indicative of the requisite  intent."" Morris, 677 N.W.2d at 788. The State next ventures that P.K. ""lost the value or  benefit of the property because he did not have his car  when he needed it to leave work."" But that clipped  reading of the definition of permanent deprivation  ignores the references to ""an extended period of time""  and disposal of property ""under such circumstances as  to render it unlikely that the owner will recover the  property."" Using a GPS tracking device, P.K. found his  car just six blocks from the hospital. True, the car was  taken from the parking lot between four and six hours  before P.K. noticed it missing. But the record does not  show how long Nelson possessed it. Nelson testified  that he stopped pushing [*8]  when he realized he  ""couldn't get to a comfortable spot where [he] felt like  [he] would be safe."" His testimony, like his acts and the  attending circumstances, fail to show an intent to  permanently deprive. See State v. Fuentes, No. 03- 0426, 2004 WL 1854103, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App. July 28,  2004) (finding Fuentes's testimony that he did not intend  to keep another man's van, combined with the fact that it  was not driven far and was found the same night it was  taken, undermined the State's proof of an intent). But the State emphasizes that the jury was free to reject  Nelson's testimony. See State v. Shanahan, 712  N.W.2d 121, 135 (Iowa 2006). Indeed, the jury had that  freedom. Yet, even without Nelson's testimony, the  evidence did not support the State's theory that he took  the car to leave Iowa. Nelson had no key nor other  means to operate the vehicle. The jury could not  reasonably infer that Nelson planned to push the car out  of state from Sheldon. Even viewing the evidence in the  light most favorable to the State, these facts do not  allow a reasonable factfinder to infer that Nelson had  the specific intent to permanently deprive P.K. of his  vehicle. Under these circumstances, we reverse  Nelson's theft conviction and remand for entry of  judgment of acquittal. REVERSED AND REMANDED."
"State v. Taylor-Hollingsworth, 2023 Ohio App. LEXIS 4249.pdf","[*1] DECISION APPEAL from the Franklin County Court of Common  Pleas MENTEL, J. {¶  1}  Defendant-appellant,  Richard  J.  Taylor- Hollingsworth, appeals from the August 10, 2022  judgment entry of the Franklin County Court of Common  Pleas sentencing him to an aggregate term of 16 years  in prison for committing the offenses of aggravated  robbery and felonious assault. For the following  reasons, we affirm. I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY {¶ 2} On September 28, 2018, appellant was indicted by  a Franklin County Grand Jury for aggravated robbery in  violation of R.C. 2911.01, a felony of the first degree  (Count One); felonious assault in violation of R.C.  2903.11, a felony of the second degree (Count Two);  and having weapons under disability in violation of R.C.  2923.13, a felony of the third degree (Count Three).  Counts One and Two also included firearm and repeat  violent offender specifications in violation of R.C.  2941.145(A) and 2941.149(A), respectively.  No. 22AP-527 2  {¶ 3} On October 10, 2018, appellant pleaded guilty,  pursuant to a plea agreement, to aggravated robbery  and felonious assault with firearm specifications, in  exchange for dismissal of the having weapons while  under disability count and the repeat violent offender  specifications. The trial court accepted [*2]  appellant's  plea and immediately moved to a sentencing hearing. At  the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court sentenced  appellant to serve an aggregate term of 16 years in  prison. Specifically, the trial court ordered appellant to  serve ten years of incarceration for aggravated robbery,  with a consecutive three-year sentence for the firearm  specification, and seven years for felonious assault, with  a consecutive three-year sentence for the firearm  specification. The trial court ordered the felonious  assault and aggravated robbery sentences to be run  concurrent  with  each  other,  and  the  firearm  specifications to run consecutive to the primary  convictions. Appellant appealed the trial court's sentence arguing  that the plea was not made knowingly, intelligently, and  voluntarily because the trial court did not give any  advisement concerning the mandatory imposition of  post-release control. On January 30, 2020, this court  found the trial court plainly erred during the plea  colloquy by failing to advise appellant that the sentence  included a mandatory term of post-release control. State  v. Taylor-Hollingsworth, 10th Dist. No. 18AP-873, 2020- Ohio-278,discretionary appeal not allowed, 2020-Ohio- Page 2 of 6 3018. Accordingly, we vacated appellant's plea and  remanded the matter back [*3]  to the trial court. {¶ 4} On August 10, 2022, the trial court held a second  sentencing hearing in this matter. Appellant, after being  advised of his rights pursuant to Crim.R. 11, entered a  plea of guilty to the aggravated robbery and felonious  assault offenses with firearm specifications. The having  weapons while under disability charge and repeat  violent offender specifications were dismissed nolle  prosequi. {¶ 5} The parties proceeded to a sentencing hearing  pursuant to R.C. 2929.19. During the hearing, the state  delivered an oral summary of the case. Counsel for the  appellant raised no objection to the state's recitation of  the underlying facts. (Aug. 10, 2022 Tr. at 6-7.) {¶ 6} According to the state, on August 27, 2017, at  approximately 1:32 a.m., the victims in this case, M.B.  and G.T., stopped at the Sunoco gas station located at  2281 Sullivant Avenue in Columbus, Ohio. As M.B.- wearing a large gold chain-exited his  No. 22AP-527 3  vehicle, he observed G.T. speaking with two individuals,  one of which was later identified as appellant. G.T.  heard the two individuals state that they could rob M.B.  Appellant then proceeded to brandish a firearm. To  avoid an altercation, M.B. continued into the Sunoco  gas [*4]  station store. Surveillance video showed that  appellant followed M.B. and chased him around the  inside of the store. Appellant pursued M.B out of the  store and down a nearby alleyway. Appellant then shot  M.B. in the back. While on the ground, appellant ripped  the chain off M.B.'s neck. While the unidentified  individual told appellant to kill M.B, appellant declined  and fled the scene. {¶ 7} At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court  imposed an aggregate term of 16 years in prison.  Specifically, the trial court sentenced appellant to ten  years of incarceration for aggravated robbery with an  additional  three-year  sentence  for  the  firearm  specification. The trial court also imposed seven years  of incarceration for the felonious assault with an  additional  three-year  sentence  for  the  firearm  specification. While trial court determined that the  aggravated robbery and felonious assault convictions  did not merge, it ordered the convictions to run  concurrent with each other but consecutive to the  firearms specifications. The trial court found appellant  was entitled to 225 days of jail-time credit. {¶ 8}  Appellant filed a timely appeal in this matter. II. ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR {¶ 9}  Appellant [*5]  assigns the following as trial court  error: The trial court erred in failing to merge Mr. Taylor  Hollingsworth's convictions in counts one and two at  sentencing in violation of R.C. 2941.25, the Fifth and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United  States  Constitution, and Article I, Section 10 and 16 of the Ohio  Constitution. III. STANDARD OF REVIEW {¶ 10} A trial court's decision as to whether multiple  offenses merge, pursuant to R.C. 2941.25, is a judicial  determination, which we review de novo. State v. Bailey,  __ Ohio St. __, 2022-Ohio-4407, ¶ 6, citing State v.  Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 482, 2012-Ohio-5699, ¶ 1;  State v. McKnight, 10th Dist. No. 20AP-595, 2022-Ohio- 591, ¶ 34, citing State v.Flood, 10th Dist. No. 18AP-206,  2019-Ohio-2524, ¶ 25.  No. 22AP-527 4  IV. LEGAL ANALYSIS A. Appellant's Sole Assignment of Error {¶ 11} In appellant's sole assignment of error, he argues  that the trial court erred by failing to merge the  aggravated robbery and felonious assault convictions. {¶ 12} The legal doctrine of merger is rooted in the  Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the  United States Constitution as made applicable to the  states through the Fourteenth Amendment. State v.  Pendleton, 163 Ohio St.3d 114, 2020-Ohio-6833, ¶ 8.  The Ohio Constitution similarly provides, ""[n]o person  shall be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense.""  Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 10. Among the  protections afforded under the Double Jeopardy Clause,  is the protection against multiple punishments for the  same offense. State v. Ruff, 143 Ohio St.3d 114, 2015- Ohio-995, ¶ 10. {¶ 13} The General Assembly codified the judicial  doctrine of merger in R.C. 2941.25. The statute  precludes the ""cumulative punishment of a defendant for  the same criminal act where his conduct can be  construed to constitute two statutory offenses, when in  substance and [*6]  effect, only one offense has been  committed."" State v. Roberts, 62 Ohio St.2d 170, 172-73  Page 3 of 6 (1980). R.C. 2941.25 directs: (A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be  construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of  similar import, the indictment or information may contain  counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be  convicted of only one. (B) Where the defendant's conduct constitutes two or  more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct  results in two or more offenses of the same or similar  kind committed separately or with a separate animus as  to each, the indictment or information may contain  counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be  convicted of all of them. {¶ 14} Ohio's felonious assault statute, R.C. 2903.11(A),  provides: ""(A) No person shall knowingly do either of the  following: (1) Cause serious physical harm to another or  to another's unborn; (2) Cause or attempt to cause  physical harm to another or to another's unborn by  means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance.""  Additionally, the offense of aggravated robbery, as set  forth under R.C. 2911.01, is defined as: (A) No person, in attempting or committing a theft  offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised  Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or  offense, shall do any of the following: [*7]   No. 22AP-527 5  (1) Have a deadly weapon on or about the offender's  person or under the offender's control and either display  the weapon, brandish it, indicate that the offender  possesses it, or use it; (2) Have a dangerous ordnance on or about the  offender's person or under the offender's control; (3) Inflict, or attempt to inflict, serious physical harm on  another. {¶ 15} The Supreme Court of Ohio has shaped the  nature of our allied-offenses analysis under R.C.  2941.25 through its evolving interpretations of the  statute. See, e.g.,State v. Logan, 60 Ohio St.2d 126  (1979); State v. Roberts, 62 Ohio St.2d 170 (1980);  State v. Thomas, 61 Ohio St.2d 254 (1980);State v.  Donald, 57 Ohio St.2d 73 (1979); State v. Blankenship,  38 Ohio St.3d 116 (1988); State v. Rance, 85 Ohio  St.3d 632 (1999);State v. Cabrales, 118 Ohio St.3d 54,  2008-Ohio-1625; State v. Johnson, 128 Ohio St.3d 153,  2010-Ohio-6314. {¶ 16} In Ruff, the Supreme Court revisited its decision  in Johnson to resolve when two or more offenses are  allied offenses of a similar import as contemplated  under R.C. 2941.25. State v. Ruff, 143 Ohio St.3d 114,  2015-Ohio-995, ¶ 1. The Ruff court found that when  engaging in R.C. 2941.25 analysis, ""courts must  evaluate three separate factors- the conduct, the  animus, and the import."" Id. at paragraph one of the  syllabus; State v.Harris, 10th Dist. No. 15AP-683, 2016- Ohio-3424, ¶ 42. The Supreme Court explained that  when determining whether two or more offenses are  allied offenses of a similar import as contemplated  under R.C. 2941.25, courts must ask three questions: (1)  Were  the  offenses  dissimilar  in  import  or  significance? (2) Were they committed separately? and  (3) Were they committed with separate animus [*8]  or  motivation? Ruff at ¶ 31. {¶ 17} An answer in the affirmative to any of the above  questions will permit separate convictions. State v.  Bailey, __Ohio St.3d __, 2022-Ohio-4407, ¶ 10, citing  Statev. Earley, 145 Ohio St.3d 281, 2015-Ohio-4615, ¶  12, citing Ruff at ¶ 31. ""At its heart, the allied-offense  analysis is dependent upon the facts of a case because  R.C. 2941.25 focuses on the defendant's conduct."" Ruff  at ¶ 26. When determining whether multiple offenses  merge pursuant to R.C. 2941.25, a court must review  the entire record. State v. Junod, 3d  No. 22AP-527 6  Dist. No. 10-18-08, 2019-Ohio-743, ¶ 60, citing State v.  Washington, 137 Ohio St.3d 427, 2013-Ohio-4982, ¶ 24. {¶ 18} Since Ruff, the Supreme Court has rejected ""a  bright-line rule for analyzing the issue of multiple  punishments because a one-size-fits-all rule will not  work in every situation. [Ruff] at ¶ 30. Rather, an allied- offenses analysis must be driven by the facts of each  case."" State v. Ramunas, __Ohio St.3d__, 2022-Ohio- 4199, ¶ 22 (Fischer, J., dissenting). ""[B]ecause an  offense may be committed in a variety of ways[,] and the  offenses committed may have different import,"" the Ruff  analysis must focus on the appellant's conduct to  resolve whether one or more convictions may result.  Ramunas at ¶ 22 (Fischer, J., dissenting). While a  court's R.C. 2941.25 analysis has been properly applied  as a legal question, ""it necessarily turns on an analysis  of the facts, which can lead to exceedingly fine  distinctions."" Bailey, 2022-Ohio-4407, at ¶ 11. Page 4 of 6 {¶ 19} Whether two offenses merge is a sentencing  question [*9]  and not an additional burden of proof  shouldered by the state. Washington at ¶ 18. The  defendant holds the burden to establish their entitlement  to the protections under R.C. 2941.25 against multiple  punishments for a single criminal act. Id.; see also State  v. Morris, 12th Dist. No. CA2019-12-205, 2020-Ohio- 4103, ¶ 15, citing State v. Conrad, 12th Dist. No.  CA2018-01-016,  2018-Ohio-5291,  ¶  44  (finding  defendant failed to meet their burden to demonstrate  that his convictions for aggravated robbery, aggravated  burglary, and kidnapping were allied offenses as the  facts indicated that the crimes were each committed  separately and with a separate animus).1 1 There is no dispute regarding the underlying facts that  form the basis for the felonious assault conviction, i.e.,  appellant shooting M.B. in the back causing him serious  physical harm. However, the state contends there are  three  separate  incidents  that  could  constitute  aggravated robbery: (1) when M.B. saw appellant  outside the Sunoco and overheard, ""we can rob this  guy"" before appellant pulled out a gun, which resulted in  M.B. fleeing into the store; (2) when appellant chased  M.B. around the interior of the store while brandishing a  firearm; and (3) when appellant, while holding a gun and  having just shot M.B, ripped the chain from the victim's  neck. While appellant solely discusses [*10]  the third  theory in its brief, the state argues the first two theories  are equally available as a basis to find that the felonious  assault and aggravated robbery convictions were  separate offenses. The state reasons that because  appellant pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery in  violation of R.C. 2911.01, felony of the first degree, the  nature of the aggravated robbery was never narrowed to  a single theory. The state also points to the language in  the indictment and bill of particulars that support both  R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) and (A)(2) analysis. Concerning the  first two theories, the state posits that because the  aggravated robbery was completed before the felonious  assault, the offenses were committed separately and do  not merge. ""[I]f one offense is completed before the  other begins, the offenses are considered separately for  sentencing purposes even though the two offenses may  have been committed in close proximity in time."" State  v. Fields, 12th Dist. No. CA2014-3-025, 2015-Ohio- 1345, ¶ 18. However, because we find that the  No. 22AP-527 7  1. Offenses dissimilar in import or significance {¶ 20} Our analysis begins and ends with the first prong  of the Ruff analysis- whether the offenses were  dissimilar in import and significance. There are two  circumstances  in  which  offenses  will  be  considered [*11]  dissimilar in import making sentences  of multiple counts permissible. The first is "" '[w]hen a  defendant's conduct victimizes more than one person  [because] the harm for each person is separate and  distinct.' * * * The second circumstance is when a  defendant's conduct against a single victim constitutes  two or more offenses and 'the harm that results from  each offense is separate and identifiable from the harm  of the other offense.' "" Ramunas at ¶ 23 (Fischer, J.,  dissenting), quoting Ruff at ¶ 26. As this case concerns  a single victim, we will focus our analysis on whether the  harm from the offenses of felonious assault and  aggravated robbery was separate and identifiable. {¶ 21} Offenses are"" 'not allied offenses of similar import  if neither [offense] is incident to the other.' "" State v.  Bishop, 1st Dist. No. C-220231, 2023-Ohio-947, ¶ 18,  quoting Ruff at ¶ 23. In conducting an analysis of  whether two offenses are allied offenses of similar  import, we must look beyond the statutory elements and  focus on the defendant's conduct. Flood, 2019-Ohio- 2524, at ¶ 29. The evidence at trial, or during a plea and  sentencing hearing, will determine whether the offenses  are of a similar import. Ruff at ¶ 26. {¶ 22} In the present case, first harm occurred when  appellant  committed  the  felonious  assault  by  shooting [*12]  M.B. in the back as he fled down an  alleyway. This harm would have occurred had appellant  elected not to steal the victim's chain. The second harm,  derived from the aggravated robbery, occurred when  appellant stole M.B.'s chain resulting in the loss of  property. These are two, separate and identifiable  harms that preclude merger under R.C. 2941.25(B). {¶ 23} Likewise, the resulting harms are fundamentally  distinct in their import. The word ""import"" in the context  of allied offenses means "" 'offenses of similar  importance,  consequence  and  signification.'  ""  Thundercloud v. Ross Corr. Inst., S.D.Ohio No. 2:20-cv- 4747, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48869, *21 (Mar. 16,  2021), quoting State v. Baer, 67 Ohio felonious assault and aggravated robbery do not merge  under the third theory, which is the basis for appellant's  argument, we decline to resolve the state's alternative  arguments.  No. 22AP-527 8  St.2d 220, 226 (1981). ""[O]ffenses are not allied  Page 5 of 6 offenses of similar import if they are not alike in their  significance and their resulting harm."" Ruff at ¶ 21.  Here, the harm from the felonious assault was a serious  bodily injury, i.e., a bullet wound to M.B.'s back, while  the harm suffered from the aggravated robbery was the  loss of a gold chain. Due to the disparity in the resulting  harm caused by a bullet wound as compared to [*13]   the loss of property, we cannot find that these offenses  are of a similar import. {¶ 24} Our resolution of the first prong in the Ruff  analysis aligns with numerous Ohio courts that have  found the offenses of felonious assault and aggravated  robbery were dissimilar in import and significance. See,  e.g., State v. Gambino, 11th Dist. No. 2021-T-0018,  2022-Ohio-1554, ¶ 49 (finding the ""grave injuries""  inflicted upon the victim during the felonious assault and  the subsequent harm from the aggregated robbery-the  loss of a wallet, keys, and cellphone after appellant shot  the victim-were separate, identifiable harms); State v.  Gillespie, 12th Dist. No. CA2021-01-004, 2021-Ohio- 3650, ¶ 46-47 (finding merger did not apply to  appellant's aggravated robbery and felonious assault  convictions as the harm from depriving the victim of $18  cash was separate and identifiable from the harm of  repeatedly hitting the victim with a revolver); State v.  Martin, 6th Dist. No. L-19-1133, 2021-Ohio-1615, ¶ 37  (concluding the harm from the felonious assault-  physical injury to the victim caused by several strikes to  his head and body-and the harm from the aggravated  robbery-loss of property-were separate and identifiable);  State v.Shannon, 5th Dist. No. 2020 CA 51, 2021-Ohio- 1396, ¶ 18-19 (concluding the offenses of aiding and  abetting felonious assault and aiding and abetting  aggravated robbery resulted in separate, identifiable  harms); State v. Tellis, 6th Dist. No. WD-19-050, 2020- Ohio-6982, ¶ 80 (finding the harm and injuries  from [*14]  the felonious assault-striking the victim with  a pistol and causing her to hit the concrete floor-prior to  the harm caused by the aggravated robbery-the loss of  her cellphone and $1,200-were separate and identifiable  harms); State v. Evans, 8th Dist. No. 108648, 2020- Ohio-3968, ¶ 123 (finding the offenses offelonious  assault and aggravated robbery were dissimilar in  import, and therefore did not merge, as they caused  separate, identifiable harms); State v. McLaughlin, 5th  Dist. No. CT2017-0104, 2018-Ohio-2333, ¶ 30 (finding  the felonious assault did not merge with the aggravated  robbery, kidnapping, or theft offenses as the harm to the  victim was separate and distinct); State v. Harmon, 2d  Dist. No. 26883, 2017-Ohio-8106, ¶ 65 (concluding the  No. 22AP-527 9  offense of felonious assault-brandishing the firearm and  shooting the victim in the face- prior to the robbery- taking a t-shirt from the victim's bedroom-resulted in  separate and identifiable harms); State v. Knight, 12th  Dist. No. CA2016-02-028, 2016-Ohio-7991, ¶ 19 (finding  merger did not apply to appellant's felonious assault and  aggravated robbery convictions when the harm of  robbing the victim at gunpoint while stealing money from  a vault was separate from the harm of striking the victim  in the head with a gun); State v.Napier, 5th Dist. No.  CT2015-0044, 2016-Ohio-2967, ¶ 32 (finding the  commission of the felonious assault offense-striking the  victim in the mouth knocking out his tooth-prior to the  aggravated robbery offense-using [*15]  a firearm to  take the victim's money-caused separate, identifiable  harms). {¶ 25} Appellant alleges that the ""felonious assault was  incidental to and in furtherance of the aggravated  robbery."" (Appellant's Brief at 9.) Appellant cites the  Eighth District Court of Appeals decision in State v.  Sutton, 8th Dist. No. 102300, 2015-Ohio-4074 as  instructive. Appellant acknowledges that while Sutton  did not find the felonious assault and aggravated  robbery merged, the facts of this case fill in the gaps  that were fatal to the analysis in Sutton. A brief review is  instructive. {¶ 26} In Sutton, the defendant lured the victim to her  home for the alleged purpose to have sex for hire but  with the true intention of robbing him by force. Once the  victim entered the home and undressed in the bedroom,  the defendant's boyfriend entered the room. Upon the  boyfriend entering the bedroom, Swanson reached for  his firearm, which was located in his discarded pants.  An altercation ensued over control of a firearm. Id. at ¶  4. During the altercation, the boyfriend obtained control  of the gun and shot the victim from a distance of ten  feet. Sutton then threw the victim's car keys outside and  left the residence with the boyfriend, who was carrying  the victim's firearm. Id. at ¶ 6. Sutton [*16]  was later  found guilty of, among other offenses, aggravated  robbery and felonious assault. The trial court concluded  that the offenses did not merge as they were not allied  offenses. While the Eighth District Court of Appeals  agreed with the trial court that the felonious assault and  aggravated robbery did not merge as the offenses were  committed with a separate animus, it did find that  because the serious physical harm element in both  counts reference the same gun-related injuries suffered  by the victim, the offenses were of a similar import. Id. at  ¶ 60. Page 6 of 6  No. 22AP-527 10  {¶ 27} Upon review, Sutton is distinct from the instant  case in several ways. In Sutton, the shot occurred after  an altercation over control of the gun. Here, the  feloniousassault and resulting harm, i.e., gunshot  wound, occurred after M.B. attempted to evade  appellant by fleeing down an alleyway. Moreover, unlike  Sutton, the indictment in this case was not specific as to  the serious physical harm element in the aggravated  robbery charge. As such, even under appellant's theory  of the case, the possession or brandishing of the firearm  while taking the chain could just as easily form the basis  for an aggravated robbery conviction as [*17]  utilizing  the serious physical harm element, i.e., the gunshot  wound. Finally, Sutton was charged with setting up the  victim while her boyfriend committed the aggravated  robbery. Here, appellant acted alone in shooting M.B.  before stealing his gold chain. As often is the case when  resolving whether offenses are of a similar import, the  R.C. 2941.25 analysis turns on the particular facts,  ""which can lead to exceedingly fine distinctions."" Bailey,  2022-Ohio-4407, at ¶ 11. Given the differing fact  patterns, as well as the abundance of caselaw that has  found felonious assault and aggravated robbery  offenses resulted in separate, identifiable harms,  appellant's reliance on Sutton is misplaced. {¶ 28} Accordingly, we find that the offenses of felonious  assault and aggravated robbery were dissimilar in their  import and significance. Because appellant has failed to  demonstrate all the elements under the Ruff analysis,  we decline to examine the remaining factors. McKnight,  2022-Ohio-591, at ¶ 35 (""We note again that Ruff  directed that if any one of the three prongs is met, the  counts do not merge.""). {¶ 29} Appellant's sole assignment of error is overruled."
"State v. Wanninger, 2023 Iowa App. LEXIS 945.pdf","BOWER, Chief Judge. Jeffrey Wanninger appeals his convictions for four  counts of sexual abuse in the second degree and four  counts of sexual abuse in the third degree. Wanninger  claims the convictions were not supported by sufficient  evidence. We affirm. I. Background Facts and Proceedings Wanninger began dating K.L. in 2006. At the time, K.L.  had one daughter, B.S. and was pregnant. Wanninger,  K.L., and her two daughters moved in together in 2008.  Wanninger and K.L. had a child in 2010. The couple  split up in 2018, sharing custody of their child. In 2010, Wanninger began sexually abusing B.S., who  was eight years old at the time. Wanninger would come  into B.S.'s bedroom late at night or early in the morning  and touch her genitals over her clothes until he [*2]   ejaculated. Initially, the abuse occurred once a week.  Wanninger also showed B.S. pornography. Once B.S. turned ten years old, Wanninger began  touching her genitals underneath her clothes. Like  before, he would continue doing so until he ejaculated.  B.S.'s siblings were often asleep in the room when the  abuse occurred. The abuse usually occurred twice a  week. When B.S. was between the ages of eleven and thirteen  years old, Wanninger started performing oral sex on  B.S. and encouraged her to perform oral sex on him. He  also began touching her genitals with his penis. This  abuse initially occurred three times a week but  increased in frequency as B.S. aged, eventually  occurring upwards of six times a week. When B.S.  began to menstruate, Wanninger made a sudden  decision to get a vasectomy, to K.L.'s surprise as the  two had discussed having another child together. At  trial, testimony by both K.L. and B.S. established  Wanninger wore a rubber ring around his penis and  testes during sexual acts. This abuse continued until  Page 2 of 3 Wanninger and K.L. split up in 2018. At trial B.S. testified she did not inform her mother or the  authorities about the abuse because she was afraid.  Indeed, Wanninger often [*3]  threatened to take away  ""her freedom"" and access to her phone. B.S. was  unaware of the gravity of the abuse until several years  later. Witness Alex Rosen heard allegations regarding  Wanninger's sexual abuse and contacted B.S. to verify  the allegations. After confirming, in November 2021 he  and two others confronted Wanninger in Wanninger's  home. Rosen recorded his interaction with Wanninger.  Rosen asked Wanninger if he had had oral sex with  B.S. when she was thirteen years old. Wanninger  confessed he had. This was not the only time Wanninger confessed to  abusing B.S. He also confessed the abuse to K.L., his  sister, and Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation  Special Agent Don Schnitker, each on separate  occasions. Even after the abuse stopped, Wanninger sent B.S.  Facebook messages bragging about the abuse. He  referenced ejaculating in B.S.'s mouth and stated, ""If I  disgust you why did you have it in your mouth[?]"" When confronted with this evidence at trial, Wanninger  uniformly denied guilt, citing drug abuse and mental  illness. Wanninger was convicted of four counts of sexual  abuse in the second degree and four counts of sexual  abuse in the third degree. He was sentenced to a period  of [*4]  incarceration not to exceed thirty-five years, with  a seventeen-and-one-half-year mandatory minimum. He  also received a special life sentence pursuant to section  903B.1 and was also placed on the sex offender registry  and made subject to additional restrictions under section  692A.113. Wanninger appeals, claiming his convictions are not  supported by substantial evidence. II. Standard of Review We review sufficiency of the evidence claims for  correction of errors at law. State v. Jones, 967 N.W.2d  336, 339 (Iowa 2021). The jury's verdict binds us if it is  supported by substantial evidence. State v. Mathis, 971  N.W.2d 514, 516 (Iowa 2022). ""Substantial evidence is  evidence sufficient to convince a rational trier of fact the  defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt."" Id. at  516-17. In determining whether substantial evidence  exists to support a verdict, ""we view the evidence in the  light most favorable to the State, including all 'legitimate  inferences and presumptions that that may fairly and  reasonably be deduced from the record evidence.'"" Id.  at 517 (citations omitted). III. Analysis To sustain a conviction for sexual abuse in the second  degree, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable  doubt that (i) Wanninger performed a sex act against  B.S. (ii) while she was under the age of twelve years  old. To sustain a conviction for sexual [*5]  abuse in the  third degree, the State had to prove beyond a  reasonable doubt (i) Wanninger performed a sex act  against B.S. (ii) while she was between the ages of  twelve and fifteen years old. Wanninger argues there is no evidence to corroborate  B.S.'s allegations he sexually abused her. He argues he  cannot be convicted because B.S.: (i) shared a room  with her siblings, so she could not have been abused  because her siblings would have heard; (ii) did not make  the allegations known until age nineteen; and (iii) did not  report the abuse to police, but rather ""some guy."" He  also  argues  B.S.'s  testimony  was  vague  and  contradictory to some of her statements in her  deposition. ""A sexual abuse victim's testimony alone may be  sufficient evidence for conviction."" State v. Donahue,  957 N.W.2d 1, 10-11 (Iowa 2021) (citing State v.  Hildreth, 582 N.W.2d 167, 170 (Iowa 1998); State v.  Knox,  536  N.W.2d  735,  742  (Iowa  1995)).  ""Inconsistencies and lack of detail are common in  sexual abuse cases and do not compel a jury to  conclude the victim is not credible or that there is  insufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict."" Id.  (citing State v. Walker, 935 N.W.2d 874, 881-82 (Iowa  2019); Hildreth, 582 N.W.2d at 170; State v. Rankin,  181 N.W.2d 169, 172 (Iowa 1970)). B.S.'s testimony alone provides sufficient evidence to  support  Wanninger's  convictions.  B.S.  testified  Wanninger touched her genitals over her clothes  starting when she was eight, then progressed to  touching [*6]  her genitals under her clothes, then  progressed to performing oral sex until she was fifteen.  She described how the abuse increased in frequency as  she aged. The State's expert witness testified about how  Page 3 of 3 child sex abuse victims may have difficulty recalling  specifics, such as time and place, especially when there  are multiple instances of abuse. Even if corroboration were required, other evidence  supports  Wanninger's  convictions.  B.S.  knew  Wanninger wore a penis ring when engaging in sexual  activities.  Wanninger  unexpectedly  scheduled  a  vasectomy  once  he  learned  B.S.  had  started  menstruating, despite his and K.L.'s plan to have  another child. K.L. testified she once saw Wanninger  lingering in B.S.'s bedroom doorway in the middle of the  night. Wanninger himself confessed on four separate  occasions to sexually abusing B.S. After reviewing the record, we determine sufficient  evidence supports Wanninger's convictions, irrespective  of Wanninger's contention more weight should have  been given to the defense expert's statements regarding  false confessions given under duress. Wanninger is  asking us to overturn the jury's credibility findings. That  is not our role on a challenge to the sufficiency [*7]  of  the evidence. See, e.g., State v. Lampman, 342 N.W.2d  77, 81 (Iowa Ct. App. 1983) (""The credibility of the  witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony is a  function of the factfinder.""). A reasonable juror could find  Wanninger  committed  these  crimes  beyond  a  reasonable doubt. AFFIRMED."
"Subh v. Sec. Guard, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216817.pdf","RENÉE MARIE BUMB, Chief United States District  Judge This matter comes before the Court upon a Motion to  Dismiss filed by Defendants. [Docket No. 14.] For the  reasons expressed herein the Court DENIES in part  and GRANTS in part Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND Plaintiff Majed Subh is a Palestinian man and a  practicing Muslim. [Compl. ¶ 1.] For nearly fifteen years,  he worked as a part-time security guard for Defendants,  which provide private on-site and road patrol security  guard services to several companies and organizations  throughout Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.  [Id. ¶¶ 2, 6.] In February 2017, Defendants promoted  Plaintiff to a ""Road Patrol"" position. Road Patrol involves  travelling and checking in on security guard officers and  supervisors at various locations or posts. [Id. ¶ 10-11.]  Road Patrol pays more than other security guard  positions. In Plaintiff's prior role as a security guard [*2]   supervisor, he earned $11.00 an hour. On Road Patrol,  he would earn $12.00 an hour or, if he used his own car  for the patrols, $13.00 an hour. [Id. ¶¶ 11, 15.] Plaintiff's supervisor on Road Patrol was Mance Revell.  [Id. ¶ 12.] Shortly following Defendants' promotion of Mr.  Revell to Road Patrol manager in August 2017, Plaintiff  started experiencing problems in the workplace which  he alleges were directly attributable to discriminatory  motivations by Mr. Revell. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges  that Mr. Revell would routinely remove Plaintiff from  Road Patrol and instead assign him to non-Road Patrol  posts where he would earn less money. [Id. ¶ 21.]  Sometimes, Mr. Revell would reduce Plaintiff's hours at  work altogether. [Id.] Even when Plaintiff did perform Road Patrol duties,  Plaintiff had issues with Mr. Revell and Mr. Revell's             Page 2 of 7 assistant manager, Oriel Garcia. Plaintiff alleges that  Mr. Revell would often not pay him the extra $1.00 per  hour he was entitled to for using his own vehicle on  Road Patrol and that, on one occasion, Mr. Revell and  Mr. Garcia did not pay Plaintiff for time Plaintiff spent  getting Defendants' Road Patrol vehicle serviced and  repaired. [Id. ¶¶ 15, 25.] Mr. [*3]  Revell also once  allegedly reduced Plaintiff's Road Patrol pay because  Plaintiff failed to wear his armed duty belt, a charge  Plaintiff disputes. [Id. ¶ 16.] When Plaintiff complained to  Mr. Revell about these pay issues, Mr. Revell would  ""yell[], belittle[] and forcefully demand[]"" Plaintiff to get  out of his office. [Id. ¶ 13.] Plaintiff alleges that the  payment issues would usually get resolved, but only  weeks later in a deliberate effort to cause Plaintiff to  quit. [Id. ¶ 14.] Plaintiff also alleges that Mr. Revell failed to give  Plaintiff enough notice regarding whether Road Patrol  would (or would not) be canceled when there was  inclement weather. [Id. ¶ 17.] Plaintiff would be left  guessing on those days whether Road Patrol was on or  off until the last minute. If Road Patrol was still on  despite the inclement weather, Plaintiff alleges that he  would not have enough notice to arrive to work on time  and would then be subjected to discipline by Mr. Revell.  [Id.] In January 2018, when Plaintiff asked Mr. Revell to  give  him  more  notice  regarding  Road  Patrol  cancelations, Mr. Revell became angry and threatened  to remove Plaintiff from Road Patrol altogether. [Id.] Two  weeks after Plaintiff [*4]  requested more advanced  notice if Road Patrol would be cancelled, Mr. Revell  failed to relieve Plaintiff from his night-time shift, forcing  Plaintiff to work another eight hours. [Id. ¶ 20.] Plaintiff  alleges this was deliberatively punitive. [Id.] The height of Plaintiff's difficult relationship with Mr.  Revell took place on December 14, 2020. While at work,  Mr. Revell told Plaintiff ""I hate Moslems [sic] and middle  eastern people"" and then yelled at Plaintiff to ""go back  to where [he] came from."" [Id. ¶ 26.] Plaintiff was upset  by Mr. Revell's comments and, on February 1, 2021,  made a complaint to Defendants' management that Mr.  Revell and Garcia were unfairly discriminating against  Plaintiff, citing his denials of pay, reduced hours, and  the discriminatory comments. [Id. ¶ 28.] Defendants  offered Plaintiff a work transfer to Imperial Security in  Pennsylvania. [Id. ¶¶ 32-33.] The transfer took two  months to complete, and Plaintiff did not begin work at  Imperial Security until April 2021. [Id. ¶ 33.] Following    the transfer, Plaintiff was demoted to the position of  security guard officer and his new supervisor, Kameron  Shannon, told Plaintiff that Defendants' President, Lisa  Spatafore, [*5]  specifically instructed Mr. Shannon to  not place Plaintiff on Road Patrol. [Id. ¶ 34.] From April 2021 to October 2022 Plaintiff carried out  security guard officer duties for Durham School Buses  (""Durham"") on behalf of Imperial Security. [Id. ¶ 35.]  Plaintiff's work with Durham ended in October 2022  because Defendants' contract with Durham expired and  was not renewed. [Id. ¶ 36.] Plaintiff alleges that his  placement with Durham was intentional, and that  Defendants knew the Durham contract would be ending  and that, after it did, Defendants could terminate Plaintiff  for good. [Id. ¶ 40.] Nonetheless, Plaintiff concedes that  following expiration of the Durham contract, Defendants  offered him a few hours and shifts of work over the next  several months. [Id. ¶¶ 38-39.] Plaintiff did not act on  these offers. [Id.] Plaintiff alleges that Defendants  promised him more permanent work following expiration  of the Durham contract but never placed him on another  permanent assignment. [Id. ¶ 38.] Plaintiff has not  worked for Defendants since the expiration of the  Durham contract in October 2022. [Id. ¶ 39.] II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND Plaintiff filed a timely Charge of Discrimination with the  Equal Employment [*6]  Opportunity Commission and  received a Notice of Right to Sue. [Id. ¶ 5; see also  Defs,' Mtn., Exs. A—B, Docket Nos. 14-3, 14-4.] Having  exhausted his administrative remedies, Plaintiff filed this  lawsuit on March 15, 2023, alleging discrimination and  disparate  treatment,  hostile  work  environment/harassment, and retaliation claims on the  basis of his race, color, religion and national origin  under both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42  U.S.C. §§ 2000e et. seq., and the New Jersey Law  Against Discrimination. (""NJLAD""). Defendants moved  to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  12(b)(6). [Docket No. 14.] Plaintiff opposed. [Docket No.  15.] Defendants did not submit a reply. III. LEGAL STANDARD When considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state  a claim upon which relief can be granted, pursuant to    Page 3 of 7 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a district court  must ""accept as true all allegations in the complaint and  all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom,  and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.""  Evancho v. Fisher, 423 F.3d 347, 351 (3d Cir. 2005). It  is well-settled that a pleading is sufficient if it contains ""a  short and plain statement of the claim showing that the  pleader is entitled to relief."" FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2). ""While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion  to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a  plaintiff's obligation to provide [*7]  the 'grounds' of his  'entitle[ment] to relief' requires more than labels and  conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements  of a cause of action will not do."" Bell Atl. Corp. v.  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L.  Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (first citing Conley v. Gibson, 355  U.S. 41, 47, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957); then  citing Sanjuan v. Am. Bd. of Psychiatry & Neurology,  Inc., 40 F.3d 247, 251 (7th Cir. 1994); and then citing  Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S. Ct. 2932,  92 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1986)) (alterations in original).  Further, ""to determine the sufficiency of a complaint,""  the Court must follow a three-step process: First, the court must ""tak[e] note of the elements a  plaintiff must plead to state a claim."" Second, the  court should identify allegations that, ""because they  are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to  the assumption of truth."" Third, ""whe[n] there are  well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should  assume their veracity and then determine whether  they plausibly give rise to an entitlement for relief."" Malleus v. George, 641 F.3d 560, 563 (3d Cir. 2011)  (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 664, 675, 679,  129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (alterations in  original)). A district court may ""generally consider only  the allegations contained in the complaint, exhibits  attached to the complaint and matters of public record.""  Schmidt v. Skolas, 770 F.3d 241, 249 (3d Cir. 2014)  (citing Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. White Consol.  Indus., Inc., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993)). A district court, in weighing a motion to dismiss, asks  ""not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether  the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the  claim."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 563 n.8 (quoting Scheuer  v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S. Ct. 1683, 40 L. Ed.  2d 90 (1974)); see also Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 684 (""Our  decision in Twombly expounded the [*8]  pleading  standard for 'all civil actions' . . . .""); Fowler v. UPMC  Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009) (""Iqbal . . .  provides the final nail in the coffin for the 'no set of facts'  standard that applied to federal complaints before  Twombly.""). Thus, ""[a] motion to dismiss should be  granted if the plaintiff is unable to plead 'enough facts to  state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'""  Malleus, 641 F.3d at 563 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at  570). IV. ANALYSIS A. Discrimination and Disparate Treatment Title  VII  and  the  NJLAD  prohibit  employment  discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or  national  origin.  Courts  review  employment  discrimination cases under both Title VII and the NJLAD  using  the  burden-shifting  framework  outlined  in  McDonnell Douglas Corp. v Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.  Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). To state a prima  facie case of employment discrimination, a plaintiff must  show (1) membership in a protected class; (2)  qualification for the position in question; (3) an adverse  employment  action;  and  (4)  that  the  adverse  employment action gives rise to an inference of unlawful  discrimination. Castleberry v. STI Grp., 863 F.3d 259,  263 (3d Cir. 2017). At the motion to dismiss stage, ""a  plaintiff must plead facts that would make his prima  facia case under the McDonnell Douglas framework  plausible."" Caviness v. Aramark Corr. Servs., LLC, 2015  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49421, 2015 WL 1888246, at *2  (D.N.J. Apr. 15, 2015). 1. Adverse Employment Actions Plaintiff alleges that he is a member of a protected  class, [Compl. [*9]  ¶ 1] and was trained, promoted and               Page 4 of 7 qualified to serve on Road Patrol, [Compl. ¶ 10]. He also  properly alleges several adverse employment actions  including (i) improper wage loss, including failing to  compensate Plaintiff for using his own Road Patrol  vehicle, [Compl. ¶ 15]; and (ii) his reduced hours,  demotions, and removals from Road Patrol, [id. ¶¶ 21- 22, 34]. See Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524  U.S. 742, 749, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed. 2d 633  (1998) (adverse employment action must result in  ""significant change in employment status"" including  ""hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment, or a  decision causing a significant change in benefits,"" such  as reduced hours and wages); see also Moody v. Atl.  City Bd. of Educ., 870 F.3d 206, 217 (3d Cir. 2017). The Court is not convinced, however, that Plaintiff has  properly alleged a termination. Plaintiff concedes that  following the expiration of the Durham contract, he was  offered ""a few hours or a shift"" by Defendants over the  course of the next several months. [Compl. ¶ 38.]  Defendants' offer might have resulted in further reduced  hours and pay for Plaintiff, which would be an adverse  employment action. See Moody, 870 F.3d at 217  (reduction of hours and pay may qualify as an adverse  employment action). But reduced hours and pay are  different from termination. It appears Plaintiff simply  did [*10]  not accept Defendants' offer because he  wanted (and alleges he was promised) more permanent  work from Defendants. 2. Inference of Unlawful Discrimination Defendants also argue that Plaintiff has failed to                     establish the fourth McDonald Douglas prima facie  element that any adverse employment action Plaintiff  has suffered must give rise to an inference of unlawful  discrimination. An inference of unlawful discrimination  can be established in a number of ways including  discriminatory comments by a supervisor with decision- making authority, see Johnson v. City of Philadelphia,  2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82888, 2009 WL 2914364, at *6  (E.D. Pa. Sept. 10, 2009) (citing Sarullo v. U.S. Postal  Serv., 352 F.3d 789, 798 (3d Cir. 2003), or through a  showing of disparate treatment—that is, that similarly  situated employees outside of Plaintiff's protected class  were treated more favorably, Jones v. Sch. Dist. of  Phila., 198 F.3d 403, 410-11 (3d Cir. 1999). Plaintiff's allegations regarding his supervisor's facially  discriminatory comments regarding Muslims and Middle  Easterners are sufficient to establish an inference of  discrimination at this stage. Defendants argue that Mr.  Revell did not have authority to terminate Plaintiff.  [Defs.' Br. at 7.] Maybe so, but that is irrelevant. See  Moody, 870 F.3d at 217 n.14 (fact that individual is  unable to fire or hire employees does not mean that  they are not a supervisor through whom liability may  flow from). As alleged, [*11]  Mr. Revell plainly had  authority to, and did, take adverse actions against  Plaintiff related to his wages, hours, and duties and he  had authority to assign or not assign Plaintiff work.  Properly considered in context with Mr. Revell's  comments directed at Plaintiff regarding his hatred of  Muslims and Middle Easterners, Plaintiff can plausibly  allege  an  inference  of  discrimination  against  Defendants. See Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524  U.S. 775, 790, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662  (1998) (explaining that ""claims against employers for  discriminatory employment actions with tangible results,  like hiring, firing, promotion, compensation, and work  assignment"" can result in vicarious employer liability  under Title VII). Plaintiff has thus plausibly pleaded the  prima facie McDonnell Douglas elements to state a  claim of discrimination. The Court finds, however, that Plaintiff cannot plausibly  allege disparate treatment discrimination. Plaintiff offers  only conclusory allegations that he was consistently  treated less favorably than employees outside his  protected class. [See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 19, 21-22, 44.]  Such generalized and bare allegations are insufficient to  support a theory of disparate treatment discrimination.  See Doe v. Sizewise Rentals, LLC, 2010 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 124623, 2010 WL 4861138, at *6 (D.N.J. Nov.  22, 2010), aff'd, 530 F. App'x 171 (3d Cir. 2013)  (rejecting  disparate  treatment  discrimination [*12]   Page 5 of 7 theory where allegations amounted to generalized and  conclusory accusations that plaintiffs were treated  differently than similarly situated persons outside their  protected class). Accordingly, the Court will dismiss  Plaintiff's discrimination claim insofar as it is based upon  a disparate treatment theory. B. Retaliation To establish a prima facia retaliation claim under Title  VII or the NJLAD, a plaintiff must show that (1) that he  engaged in protected activity, such as making informal  complaints of discrimination to company management;  (2) the employer took an adverse employment action  against him; and (3) there was a causal connection  between the plaintiff's protected activity and the adverse  employment action taken. See Moore v. City of  Philadelphia, 461 F.3d 331, 339 (3d Cir. 2006), as  amended (Sept. 13, 2006). Defendants do not dispute  that Plaintiff engaged in protected activity in making a  complaint to management about Mr. Revell's conduct.  They argue, instead, that Plaintiff failed to show that he  suffered an adverse employment action because  management transferred Plaintiff to another patrol  where he would not be supervised by Mr. Revell. [Defs.'  Br. at 10.] And even if Plaintiff could show an adverse  employment action, Defendants argue [*13]  that there  was no causal connection between Plaintiff's protected  activity (lodging a complaint against Mr. Revell) and any  adverse action because Plaintiff was ultimately not  terminated; Defendants' contract with Durham simply  ended and, when it did, Defendants offered additional  hour/shifts to Plaintiff which he did not act upon. [Id. at  10-11.] Defendants' characterization of the adverse employment  action is too narrow. Plaintiff sufficiently alleges an  adverse employment action through his transfer and  demotion from Road Patrol following his complaints to  Defendants. [Compl. ¶ 34; see also id. ¶¶ 6-12  (explaining that Plaintiff was hired as a security guard  officer in 2006, promoted to security guard supervisor in  2016 (paying $11.00 per hour), and again promoted to  Road Patrol in 2017 (paying up to $13.00 per hour)).] An  unfavorable transfer and demotion leading to less pay is  an obvious adverse employment action. The harder question—as usual with retaliation claims— is whether Plaintiff can plausibly show that his protected  activity caused the adverse employment action. A  plaintiff can establish a causal inference of retaliatory  discrimination  through  (i)  an  unduly  suggestive  temporal [*14]  proximity between the protected activity  and the adverse action, see Cardenas v. Massey, 269  F.3d 251, 264 (3d Cir. 2001); (ii) evidence of  ""antagonism or retaliatory animus"" towards the plaintiff  in the intervening period between the protected activity  and the adverse employment action, see LeBoon v.  Lancaster Jewish Cmty. Ctr. Ass'n, 503 F.3d 217, 233  (3d Cir. 2007); or (iii) where the ""evidence, looked at as  a whole, may suffice to raise the [causal] inference,"" id.  (quoting Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., 206 F.3d  271, 279-81 (3d Cir. 2000)). The Court finds that Plaintiff can establish a causal  inference of retaliation considering the allegations as a  whole. See Farrell, 206 F.3d at 271. Most relevantly,  Plaintiff alleges that following his transfer, Mr. Shannon,  his new supervisor, told him that the company president  Ms. Spatafore instructed Mr. Shannon ""not [to] place  Plaintiff [on] Road Patrol."" [Compl. ¶ 34.] Plaintiff does  not allege so specifically, but the inference the Court  must draw in his favor on a motion to dismiss is that Ms.  Spatafore instructed Mr. Shannon not to place Plaintiff  on Road Patrol because Plaintiff made complaints to  management.  That  may  ultimately  be  untrue.  Defendants could show that Plaintiff was demoted from  Road Patrol for legitimate reasons unrelated to his  making complaints about Mr. Revell or that there were  no Road Patrol positions which Defendants could  place [*15]  Plaintiff on. But the Court cannot assume so  at this stage of the proceedings. Thus, Plaintiff's  retaliation claims may proceed. C. Hostile Work Environment To establish a hostile work environment claim against  an employer, a plaintiff must show that: (1) the  employee suffered intentional discrimination because of  his or her protected class; (2) the discrimination was               Page 6 of 7 pervasive or severe; (3) the discrimination detrimentally  affected the plaintiff; (4) the discrimination would  detrimentally affect a reasonable person in like  circumstances; and (5) the existence of respondeat  superior liability. Mandel v. M & Q Packaging Corp., 706  F.3d 157, 167 (3d Cir. 2013). Courts evaluate the  ""overall  scenario""  in  deciding  whether  a  work  environment was hostile considering both ""facially  neutral mistreatment and overt ethnic discrimination,  which in sum constitute the hostile work environment.""  Cardenas v. Massey, 269 F.3d 251, 261 (3d Cir. 2001)  (cleaned up). Factors to evaluate include ""the frequency  of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is  physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive  utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with  an employee's work performance.'"" Id. at 167 (quoting  Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S. Ct.  367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993)). Defendants argue that Plaintiff can point to only one  offensive, but not severe or pervasive, [*16]  comment,  that Mr. Revell ""hat[ed]"" Muslims and Middle Eastern  people. [Defs.' Br. at 9.] Plaintiff responds that the Court  must consider Mr. Revell's facially discriminatory  comments about his protected status—which he argues  was plausibly severe—together with facially neutral  mistreatment by Mr. Revell related to Plaintiff's pay,  shift, and job duties. [Pl.'s Br. at 5.] Viewed as a whole,  Plaintiff argues that the alleged discrimination was  plausibly pervasive. [Id.] Considering the totality of the circumstances, the Court  finds that Plaintiff can state a claim for a hostile work  environment at this stage. As alleged, Mr. Revell's  comments that he ""hates [Muslims] and Middle Eastern  people"" and that Plaintiff should ""go back to where he  came from"" (presumably, Palestine or the Middle East)  were sufficiently severe to state a claim for a hostile  work environment. The comments reflect ""disgust for an  employee based on a protected status"" which is  sufficiently severe to alter the conditions of employment  and create an abusive working environment. See  Durand v. FedEx, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3066, 2015 WL  140215, at *8 (D.N.J. Jan. 12, 2015). Durand involved  similar comments. In that case, the court denied  reconsideration from a denial of summary judgment and  held that a supervisor's [*17]  isolated comments to the  plaintiff, a Peruvian man, that she ""hates Peruvians, all  Peruvians"" and that all Peruvians are comemierda— ""shitheads""—were ""sufficiently severe or pervasive to  alter the conditions of the plaintiff's employment and  create an abusive working environment."" Id. So too  here. Mr. Revell's alleged comments, even alone, are  plausibly severe to allege a hostile work environment at  the motion to dismiss stage. Mr. Revell's facially discriminatory comments must also  be set within the context of his facially neutral conduct  against Plaintiff over the course of three years. That  conduct includes allegedly (i) arbitrarily reducing  Plaintiff's pay, [Compl. ¶ 15-16]; (ii) reducing Plaintiff's  hours on Road Patrol, [id. ¶ 22]; (iii) demoting Plaintiff  from Road Patrol on occasion, [id. ¶ 21]; (iv) threatening  to remove Plaintiff from Road Patrol altogether [id. ¶ 17];  (v) lowering Plaintiff's pay based on allegedly false  assertions that Plaintiff failed to wear proper equipment,  [id. ¶ 16]. Taken together, Plaintiff can plausibly allege  that Defendants also created a pervasively hostile work  environment."
"Tawakkol v. Vasquez, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 32247.pdf","H, Circuit Judge: The petition for rehearing is denied. We substitute this  opinion for our prior opinion. Sammy Tawakkol sued two Texas state officials,  asserting that they violated his right to procedural due  process when they notified him that he was required to  register as a sex offender under Texas law. After [*2]  a  bench trial, the district court entered judgment in  Tawakkol's favor. Because we conclude that Tawakkol's  suit is barred by sovereign immunity, we VACATE and  REMAND with instructions to dismiss for lack of  jurisdiction. I. Background This case implicates both the federal and Texas sex  offender registration systems, so we begin with a brief  overview of each. At the federal level, the Sex Offender  Registry and Notification Act (""SORNA"") sets out a  ""comprehensive national system"" for sex offender  registration. 34 U.S.C. § 20901. SORNA requires any  individual convicted of a qualifying ""sex offense"" to  register as a ""sex offender."" Id. §§ 20913(a), 20914.  Qualifying ""sex offenses"" include, inter alia, certain  ""military offense[s] specified by the [United States]  Secretary of Defense."" Id. § 20911(5)(A)(iv). Although SORNA applies only at the federal level,  Congress grants federal funds to state jurisdictions that  agree to maintain their own parallel sex-offender  registration and community-notification laws. See id. §§  20912(a), 20927. Relevant here is Texas's SORNA- compliant sex offender registration system, Texas Code  Page 2 of 4 of Criminal Procedure article 62. Under that system, an  individual must register as an ""extrajurisdictional""  registrant in Texas if he would be ""required to register  as a sex offender [*3]  under . . . federal law or the  Uniform Code of Military Justice."" T.CC. P. art. 62.001(10)(A)(ii). We turn now to the facts of this case, which are  straightforward and undisputed. When he was a cadet  at the United States Air Force Academy, Tawakkol was  caught sneaking into women's restrooms and recording  videos of female cadets while they were using the toilet.  Tawakkol pleaded guilty to violating Article 120c(a)(2) of  the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Secretary of  Defense has designated Article 120c(a)(2) as a  SORNA-qualifying ""sex offense."" So, as a result of this  conviction, Tawakkol was required to register as a sex  offender under SORNA. Tawakkol later disenrolled from the Academy and  moved to Houston, Texas. Once there, state officials  determined that Tawakkol would be required to register  as a sex offender under Texas's system as well. They  concluded that Tawakkol's status as a ""sex offender""  under federal law rendered him an extrajurisdictional  sex offender under state law—in other words, his duty to  register in Texas hinged solely on his duty to register  under SORNA. When  state  officials  notified  Tawakkol  of  their  determination, Tawakkol filed this suit against two Texas  Department of Public Safety employees (the ""State  Defendants"") under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988. In his  complaint, Tawakkol asserted [*4]  that he had not  committed a registrable sex offense—therefore, he  alleged  that  the  State  Defendants'  registration  determination violated his procedural due process rights  under the Fourteenth Amendment. After a bench trial, the district court issued findings of  fact and conclusions of law determining that Tawakkol  was entitled to injunctive relief. Rather than address the  procedural due process arguments as pleaded in  Tawakkol's complaint, the district court's conclusions  instead hinged on its interpretation of federal law. The  district court first analyzed the language of Congress's  delegation of authority to the Secretary of Defense to  designate certain crimes as SORNA-qualifying ""sex      offenses."" It then concluded that the Secretary of  Defense had exceeded the scope of that authority in  designating Article 120c(a)(2) as a ""sex offense."" The  court thus reasoned that Tawakkol had no duty to  register  under  federal  law—therefore  the  State  Defendants lacked any basis to classify him as an  extrajurisdictional offender under state law. Based on these conclusions, the district court issued a  final judgment (1) declaring that Tawakkol was ""not  required to register as a sex offender under federal or  military law,"" and, accordingly, [*5]  (2) permanently  enjoining the State Defendants from requiring Tawakkol  to register in Texas. The State Defendants appealed,  and Tawakkol cross-appealed. II. Discussion Tawakkol invoked federal question jurisdiction under 28  U.S.C. § 1331 and jurisdiction over the claims for  declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. §§  2201 and 1343(a), respectively. On appeal, however,  the State Defendants contend that the district court  lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Tawakkol's  claims are barred by sovereign immunity. Accordingly,  our analysis begins and ends with that threshold issue. We examine jurisdictional issues, such as sovereign  immunity, de novo. City of Austin v. Paxton, 943 F.3d  993, 997 (5th Cir. 2019). Sovereign immunity under the  Eleventh Amendment precludes suits by private citizens  against states in federal court. Id. This bar extends not  only to the state itself, but also to claims against ""state  officials"" in their official capacity when the state is the  real party in interest. Id. Here, Tawakkol is suing state  officials who have not waived sovereign immunity.  Accordingly, his claims are barred in federal court  unless an exception to sovereign immunity applies.              Page 3 of 4 Tawakkol asks the court to apply the exception to  sovereign immunity carved out by the Supreme Court in  Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed.  714 (1908). [*6]  This exception permits a plaintiff to  seek an injunction ""in federal court [to] prevent[] state  executive officials from enforcing state laws that are  contrary to federal law."" Whole Woman's Health v.  Jackson, 595 U.S. 30, 142 S. Ct. 522, 532, 211 L. Ed.  2d 316 (2021) (citing Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. at 159- 60). In Green Valley, we made clear that ""[f]or Young to  apply, three criteria must be satisfied: (1) A plaintiff must  name individual state officials as defendants in their  official capacities; (2) the plaintiff must allege an  ongoing violation of federal law; and (3) the relief sought  must be properly characterized as prospective."" 969  F.3d at 471 (alterations accepted) (internal citations and  quotation marks omitted). Tawakkol argues that his suit  satisfies these requirements because he is seeking  injunctive and declaratory relief against the individuals  tasked with enforcing Texas's sex offender registration  requirements. Before we address the merits of Tawakkol's argument,  we begin by explaining Ex parte Young's legal  foundations. Ex parte Young is an exception to  sovereign immunity that comes into play when private  litigants seek to prevent state officials from enforcing an  unconstitutional state law. See 209 U.S. at 159-68. It is  rooted in the legal fiction that, in such circumstances,  the defendant-official is ""stripped of his official or  representative [*7]  character and is subjected in his  person to the consequences of his individual conduct.""  Id. at 160; see also Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of  Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 272-73, 117 S. Ct. 2028, 138 L.  Ed. 2d 438 (1997) (citing Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. at  159-60). In other words, the official ""is 'not the State for  sovereign-immunity purposes' when 'a federal court  commands [him or her] to do nothing more than refrain  from violating federal law.'"" Williams ex rel. J.E. v.  Reeves, 954 F.3d 729, 736 (5th Cir. 2020) (alteration in  original) (quoting Va. Off. for Prot. & Advoc. v. Stewart,  563 U.S. 247, 255, 131 S. Ct. 1632, 179 L. Ed. 2d 675  (2011)). This fiction, the Supreme Court has said, is  ""necessary to permit the federal courts to vindicate  federal rights and hold state officials responsible to 'the  supreme authority of the United States.'"" Pennhurst  State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 105, 104  S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1984) (quoting Ex parte  Young, 209 U.S. at 160); see also Green v. Mansour,  474 U.S. 64, 68, 106 S. Ct. 423, 88 L. Ed. 2d 371  (1985). But the Supreme Court has also instructed that  the exception must be ""narrowly construed"" to serve  only that original purpose. See, e.g., Pennhurst, 465  U.S. at 114 n.25 (observing that ""it is a very narrow  exception that will allow suit only under the[se]  standards""); Va. Off. for Prot. & Advoc., 563 U.S. at 255  (noting that ""[t]he doctrine is limited to that precise  situation""); Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 277, 106 S.  Ct. 2932, 92 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1986) (stating that the  exception is ""tailored to conform as precisely as  possible to those specific situations""). Accordingly, the  Court has repeatedly declined to interpret the exception  ""expansive[ly]."" See, e.g., Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 106  (declining to extend where violation was based on state  law); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 678, 94 S. Ct.  1347, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1974) (declining to extend  where plaintiff sought retroactive [*8]  relief); Green, 474  U.S. at 71 (declining to extend where the federal law  violation was no longer ""ongoing""). Ex parte Young's foundations and the Supreme Court's  subsequent precedent lead us to conclude that it is  inapplicable in this case—the relief requested (1) falls  outside the exception's narrow confines, (2) does not  serve the purpose of the exception, and (3) is  unsupported by any caselaw. To start, unlike Ex parte  Young, the injunctive relief that the district court ordered  did not enjoin the State Defendants from enforcing a  state law that violated federal law. To be sure, the  district court ultimately did conclude that the State  Defendants could not require Tawakkol to register as a  sex offender under Texas law—but that conclusion was  not based on a determination that the state registration  system  was  unconstitutional.  Rather,  recall  that  Tawakkol was only required to register under Texas law  because he was required to register under a federal law,  SORNA. Accordingly, the relief issued by the district  court (1) invalidated only federal law and (2) prohibited  the State Defendants from enforcing a state law merely  because it was consistent with that federal law. Such  novel  relief  falls  squarely  outside  the  narrow  parameters [*9]  articulated by Ex parte Young and its  progeny. See, e.g., 209 U.S. at 159-68; Pennhurst, 465  U.S. at 114 n.25; Va. Off. for Prot. & Advoc., 563 U.S. at  255. What's more, applying the exception to Tawakkol's suit          Page 4 of 4 would not serve Ex parte Young's purpose. Because the  district court's order invalidated a federal statute— instead of affirming it—invoking the exception here  would not advance Ex parte Young's aim of ""promot[ing]  the vindication of federal rights."" Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at  105. Rather, applying the exception here would ""stretch  [Ex parte Young] too far"" and ""upset the balance of  federal and state interests that [the exception]  embodies."" Papasan, 478 U.S. at 277. Tawakkol contends that he has met our standard  addressed in Green Valley Special Utility District v. City  of Schertz, 969 F.3d 460 (5th Cir. 2020) (en banc). As  stated above, we held in Green Valley that ""[f]or Young  to apply, three criteria must be satisfied: (1) A plaintiff  must name individual state officials as defendants in  their official capacities; (2) the plaintiff must allege an  ongoing violation of federal law; and (3) the relief sought  must be properly characterized as prospective."" 969  F.3d at 471 (internal citations and quotation marks  omitted) (alterations accepted). But Green Valley did not  purport to expand Ex parte Young's narrow parameters  to cover the claims at issue here. Green Valley turned  on whether the plaintiff satisfied Ex parte Young's  requirement that the relief sought must be prospective— an issue that we need not [*10]  reach here—and  concluded that the plaintiff satisfied that requirement for  at least one, but not all, forms of relief that it sought. Id.  at 473. Our analysis does not deviate from Green  Valley, which makes clear that our analysis is correct by  echoing the Supreme Court's statement that ""we look to  the substance rather than to the form of the relief sought  and will be guided by the policies underlying . . .  Young."" Green Valley, 969 F.3d at 471 (quoting  Papasan, 478 U.S. at 279). Green Valley involved an  attack on state law, not federal law. While Tawakkol  contends he meets these standards, the reality is quite  the opposite: the state is not performing an ongoing  violation of federal law, instead, he is contesting that  federal law, as applied by the Secretary of Defense, is  itself incorrect. That is the whole point we are making  here: Ex parte Young is not about stopping states from  following federal law and determinations of same by         federal officers. Indeed, it is telling that Tawakkol fails to direct us to any  authority—from this court or elsewhere—applying Ex  parte Young in a similar way. Given the Supreme  Court's repeated insistence on the exception's narrow  application and admonishments against broadening its  reach, [*11]  we decline to extend Ex parte Young here.  Accordingly, in the absence of any other applicable  exception, we conclude that sovereign immunity bars  Tawakkol's claims against the State Defendants."
"United States v. Adams, 578 F. Supp. 3d 692.pdf","[*692]  MEMORANDUM Defendant John Adams stands charged with sex trafficking of minors in violation of the Trafficking Victims  Protection Act (TVPA), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591 et seq., He moves to dismiss two counts brought under the TVPA  pursuant to a theory that the application of the TVPA to local prostitution is beyond the scope of the statute.             Page 2 of 6  [*693]  Defendant thus moves under Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(B)(v) for failure to state an offense. Although I am  sensitive to Defendant's arguments that federal criminal statutes should be interpreted narrowly and with an eye to  the constitutional structure of federalism, an analysis of both the TVPA's language and its legislative history lead me  to conclude that Congress intended for the TVPA to be applicable to the conduct alleged here. Defendant's motion  will therefore be denied. I. Legal Standard ""An indictment fails to state an offense if the specific facts alleged in it fall beyond the scope of the relevant criminal  statute, as a [**2]  matter of statutory interpretation."" U.S. v. Vitillo, 490 F.3d 314, 321 (3d Cir. 2007), as amended  (Aug. 10, 2007) (cleaned up). II. Discussion At the outset, I note that Defendant does not bring this challenge under the Commerce Clause to suggest that the  TVPA as applied represents an unconstitutional overreach of Congress's powers to regulate interstate commerce.  Instead, Defendant relies upon Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Bond, 572 U.S. 844, 134 S. Ct. 2077,  189 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2014), arguing that the TVPA should not apply to purely in-state conduct as a matter of criminal  statutory interpretation, when viewed through the lens of federalism. In Bond, the Supreme Court held that a federal  statute passed to control the production, distribution, and use of chemical weapons could not be used to prosecute  a local assault using chemical agents to give the victim a rash. Id. at 866. Although under a plain reading of the  statutory language the conduct appeared to meet the elements of the crime, the Supreme Court found that such an  interpretation ""would dramatically intrude upon traditional state criminal jurisdiction, and we avoid reading statutes  to have such reach in the absence of a clear indication that they do."" Id. at 856-57. The dispositive question here  then is whether the TVPA contains a clear indication that Congress meant it to be [**3]  applied to local conduct that  intrudes upon ""areas of traditional state responsibility."" Id. at 858. Given its language, the statute on its face would appear to apply applies to the conduct charged in Counts I and II  of the indictment. Counts I and II set forth allegations with respect to two minor individuals who Defendant allegedly  recruited, enticed, harbored and maintained so as to cause them to engage in commercial sex acts, while knowing  or in reckless disregard of their minor status. 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1) imposes criminal liability upon anyone who  ""knowingly in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of  the United States, recruits. entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains, patronizes, or   [*694]  solicits by any means a person ... knowing, or ... in reckless disregard of the fact ... that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act."" The statute does not make  international trafficking an element of the crime. Instead, it applies to any conduct ""in or affecting interstate or  foreign commerce."" Numerous courts have held that this is a constitutionally valid application [**4]  of the statute  under the Commerce Clause. See, e.g., United States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir. 2007) (""Congress  found that trafficking of persons has an aggregate economic impact on interstate and foreign commerce . . . and we  cannot say that this finding is irrational.""); U.S. v. Walls, 784 F.3d 543, 548-49 (9th Cir. 2015); see also United  States v. Victor Clayton, Cr. No. 18-254, ECF 154, at 1 n.1 (Nov. 9, 2021) (Surrick, J.) (""Every court that has          578 F. Supp. 3d 692, *692; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2532, **1 Page 3 of 6 considered whether the TVPA and specifically whether § 1591's prohibition of interstate (as opposed to  international) trafficking is a valid exercise of Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause, has concluded that  it is.""). Ultimately, Defendant's motion does not challenge application of the plain language of the statute to Defendant's  alleged conduct, or the power of Congress to regulate such conduct, both of which are clearly established. Rather,  under Bond, Defendant argues that regardless of its wording the statute should be construed to exclude purely local  prostitution offenses in light of the states' traditional police power over such offenses. Defendant argues that ""[t]he facts presented by the government in the instant case—which (if true) make out a  wholly-local prostitution offense—do not establish the type of conduct Congress intended to target in enacting [**5]   18 U.S.C. § 1591."" Def. Br. at 2. To support his argument, Defendant draws upon a common sense understanding  of the word ""trafficking"" to emphasize the movement of persons across borders by deceptive or coercive means to  effectively enslave victims to perform sexual acts or uncompensated labor. In particular, based upon the legislative  history of the TVPA, Defendant argues that this movement across borders in the international context was the  principal problem Congress sought to address. The defense cites extensively from the ""Purposes and Findings""  section of the TVPA, which includes, among other things, references to the ""international sex trade,"" 22 U.S.C. §  7101(b)(2), a ""growing transnational crime,"" § 7101(b)(3), the transportation of victims ""from their home  communities to unfamiliar destinations, including foreign countries ... ,"" § 7101(b)(5), ""organized criminal enterprises  worldwide,"" § 7101(b)(8), that ""[t]rafficking in persons is a transnational crime,"" § 7101(b)(24), and numerous  references to the victims of trafficking often being immigrants illegally brought to the country where they are  exploited, §§ 7101(b)(5), (17), (20). Defendant then points to statements in the legislative record by the law's original co-sponsors, Senators Brownback  and Wellstone. Sen. Brownback, for [**6]  instance, defines ""trafficking"" as ""the coercive transportation of persons  into slavery-like conditions, primarily involving forced prostitution."" 146 Cong. Rec. S10,167 (Oct. 11, 2000). Sen.  Wellstone similarly details a number of examples of women and girls from foreign countries brought to the United  States, whether by coercion or deceit, and subjected to a life of prostitution or forced labor, without any  consequences for the perpetrators of the trafficking. Id. at S10,167-68. Finally, Defendant argues that one attempt  to reauthorize the TVPA in 2007, which would have included the express federalization of crimes involving  pandering, pimping, and prostitution failed ""because it represented unwarranted federalization [*695]  of state  crimes,"" citing objections made by various entities opposed to those aspects of the bill. Def. Br. at 4. Defendant's reference to the legislative record around the original bill carries some weight. After reviewing the  record of the original passage of the TVPA myself, I agree that there were myriad references to trafficking across  international borders, but none to domestic or purely local conduct. The House Judiciary's report on the bill,  interestingly, viewed [**7]  its jurisdiction over the bill as limited to the immigration provisions and the criminal  penalty provisions. H.R. Rep. 106-487, pt. II, at 17 (Apr. 13, 2000). The international focus of the law is further  reflected in the original Act's structure, where eight out of thirteen sections were expressly focused on combatting  international trafficking. 114 Stat. 1464, Pub. L. 106-386, §§ 104-111 (Oct. 28, 2000). And were Mr. Adams to have  been accused of a prostitution offense that did not involve coercion or a minor, his citation to Section 221 of H.R.  3887, which was an earlier draft of the eventual reauthorization act of 2008, and included a provision that made it a  federal crime to ""persuade[], induce[], or entice[] any individual to engage in prostitution,"" would be strong evidence  that Congress did not intend to regulate his conduct and instead desired to leave such regulation for the states. But Mr. Adams is accused of trafficking related to a victim under the age of 18 which Congress has clearly indicated  it views as a more severe crime than prostitution generally and which it has found is under-prosecuted by the  states. A fuller view of both the congressional record and the statute itself shows this. Notably, the statute expressly  defines [**8]  ""severe forms of trafficking in persons"" as ""sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act ... in which  the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age."" § 7102(11)(A). In light of this definition,  the TVPA's ""Purposes and Findings"" section includes provisions reflecting Congress's intent to regulate certain  severe forms of sex trafficking that it understood to be inadequately punished by states. Most notably, Congress  found that ""[e]xisting legislation and law enforcement in the United States and other countries are inadequate to  deter trafficking and bring traffickers to justice, failing to reflect the gravity of the offenses involved."" § 7101(b)(14).  578 F. Supp. 3d 692, *694; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2532, **4 Page 4 of 6 Congress further lamented that ""even the most brutal instances of trafficking the sex industry are often punished  under laws that also apply to lesser offenses, so that traffickers typically escape deserved punishment."" §  7101(b)(14). Looking more deeply, the legislative history of the TVPA's reauthorizations and amendments clearly reflects an  understanding by Congress that the law and its penalties should apply against local violations that do not involve  international components. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005, in [**9]  particular,  reflects an intent that the TVPA have domestic application to minor victims who are enticed into the commercial sex  trade. Sen. Leahy, who took over co-sponsorship of the legislation with the passing of Sen. Wellstone, spoke to the  very factual situation at issue here when introducing the reauthorization act in the Senate: I am especially pleased that this reauthorization package has been improved significantly. For the first time, the  bill focuses not only on the important goal of preventing international human trafficking, but also on preventing  the human trafficking that occurs within our own borders. Children here in the United States are at tremendous  risk, especially those who are homeless or runaways, and they are particularly susceptible to being  domestically trafficked for purposes of commercial sexual exploitation.  [*696]  I will not rest until this alarming  trend is stopped. 151 Cong. Rec. S14,417. Sen. Leahy's focus on the risk that domestically based children who are homeless or  runaways may be susceptible to trafficking falls squarely within the facts alleged in this case. Over the course of the next decade and a half, Congress reauthorized or otherwise amended the provisions [**10]   of the TVPA several times. On many occasions, these amendments were made to § 1591 itself or § 1591 was  cross-referenced in related provisions of the code. At no point did Congress manifest an intent to limit the  application of § 1591, which on its face applies to any minor trafficked into commercial sex acts. Perhaps the  clearest indication of Congress's intent to apply the TVPA to domestic minors for local offenses can be found in the  Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, Pub. L. 114-22, 129 Stat. 227 (May 29, 2015). There, Congress  amended § 1591 to add the words ""solicits or patronizes"" to the list of prohibited conduct in order to clarify that both  purveyors and purchasers of sex from minors were liable under the TVPA. § 109(4). In doing so, Congress explicitly  endorsed the Eighth Circuit's decision in United States vs. Jungers, 702 F.3d 1066 (8th Cir. 2013), for its  interpretation of ""obtain"" as applying to purchasers of sex from minors. § 109(3). Jungers involved entirely local  child sex trafficking where state and federal officers conducting a sting operation in South Dakota ""pretended to be  a man offering his girlfriend's underage daughters for sex while his girlfriend was out of town."" Jungers, 702 F.3d at  1067. Although domestic applicability was not at issue in Jungers, Congress's ratification of that opinion reinforces  its implied understanding—without need to further clarify—that [**11]  § 1591 broadly applies to local sex trafficking  of minors. More recently, Congress ordered  [*697]  the Attorney General to issue guidance to all DOJ offices                  578 F. Supp. 3d 692, *695; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2532, **8 Page 5 of 6 ""emphasizing that an individual who knowingly solicits or patronizes a commercial sex act from a person who was a  minor (consistent with [18 U.S.C. § 1591(c)]) ... is guilty of an offense under chapter 77 of title 18, United States  Code, and is a party to a severe form of trafficking in persons, as that term is defined in [the TVPA at 22 U.S.C. §  7102(9)])."" Abolish Human Trafficking Act of 2017, Pub. L. 115-392, 132 Stat 5250. This again reaffirmed  Congress's broad interpretation of the statutory language to apply to all sex trafficking of minors and not just that  involving international transportation. Federal courts that have considered arguments against the application of the TVPA to purely local conduct have  similarly found that Congress provided sufficiently clear indication under the Bond standard that it intended the  TVPA to apply to conduct traditionally regulated by the state. Notably in U.S. v. Walls, the Ninth Circuit held, solely  on the basis of the ""Purpose and Findings"" section of the TVPA, §§ 7101(b)(12) and 7101(b)(14), that Congress  indicated an interest in regulating purely local conduct that fell within the definition of § 1591. 784 F.3d 543, 546-47  (9th Cir. 2015). In U.S. v. Callahan, the Sixth Circuit [**12]  addressed Bond in analyzing § 1589, which prohibits  forced labor under the TVPA. It held that the TVPA's implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment made forced  labor a special matter of federal concern that reduced any need for the court to consider traditional state policing  prerogatives. 801 F.3d 606, 619-20 (6th Cir. 2015); see also U.S. v. McMillian, 777 F.3d 444 (7th Cir. 2015)  (Posner, J.) (summarily dismissing a challenge to § 1591 as applied to purely local conduct under Bond because  ""there is no basis for so limited an interpretation""). I see no reason to reach a different conclusion. Following a wider view of the legislative history, consideration of the language of the TVPA itself, and existing  precedent, I am persuaded that § 1591 was intended by Congress to intrude upon traditional state policing  prerogatives related to prostitution in order to more robustly prosecute crimes of coercion and exploitation of  minors. Congress did so pursuant to its powers under the Commerce Clause and the Thirteenth Amendment in  order to realize the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition on slavery. Counts I and II of government's indictment  therefore charge offenses for which Defendant may be prosecuted. Defendant's motion to strike those counts of the  indictment will be denied. An appropriate order follows. /s/ Gerald Austin McHugh United States District Judge ORDER This 6th [**13]  of January 2022, upon consideration of Defendant John Adams's Motion to Dismiss Counts I and II  of the Indictment, it is hereby ORDERED that Defendant's motion is DENIED. /s/ Gerald Austin McHugh United States District Judge              578 F.

"United States v. Bixler, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646.pdf","BERNICE BOUIE DONALD, Circuit Judge. Following a seven-day trial, a jury found Defendant Appellant Prince  Bixler guilty of sex trafficking, drug trafficking, witness tampering, and possessing firearms as a felon. On appeal,  2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *1 Page 9 of 18 Bixler raises a plethora of challenges to his sex trafficking and witness tampering convictions, sentencing  enhancements, and order of restitution. For the following reasons, we affirm. I. From 2013 to 2018, Bixler operated a prostitution ring in Lexington, Kentucky. Bixler found and recruited destitute  women with pre-existing drug addictions to prostitute themselves for his financial benefit. He lured them in with  promises of free shelter, [*2]  food, and drugs, and once they became entirely dependent on him, Bixler demanded  they work as prostitutes to pay off their ""accumulated debts."" Bixler manipulated their drug addictions, controlled  their drug supply, and used intimidation and violence to ensure that the women complied. Following a lengthy investigation, Bixler was arrested on March 28, 2018. The government subpoenaed several  women, including Adrienne Ratliff and Amie Payton, to appear before a grand jury. Bixler's history with Ratliff and  Payton was representative of how he treated his other victims: he initially provided them with ""free"" shelter and  drugs, but quickly turned violent and abusive. Bixler incessantly called Ratliff and Payton in the days leading up to  their testimony. He guilted Ratliff for betraying him and hurting him, stating ""Oh, but you told them you'd testify  against me[.] . . . Do you know how bad that fucking hurt me?""; ""You know, I have kids too.""; and ""[Y]ou don't even  have a conscience, do you? . . . [I]t's just so fucked up that you don't even have a conscience man. . . . Because I  keep sitting here thinking about, you know, God damn, does she even have a conscience about the shit that  she [*3]  just done."" Ratliff repeatedly lied to Bixler and said she would not testify for fear that he would ""yell at [her]  and just go off until he got what he wanted out of [her]."" Despite Bixler's pleas, Ratliff testified against him before  the grand jury. In addition, Bixler instructed Payton not to talk to a court-appointed attorney and ""just tell the truth."" Bixler also  called Payton over thirty times the day before her scheduled grand jury appearance. The next morning, Payton  injected heroin before arriving at the courthouse and refused to testify. Payton stated, ""I was afraid to [talk]"" and ""I  didn't want Prince to be mad at me either."" She also stated that she would rather go to jail for six months than testify  against Bixler. The court subsequently appointed her counsel, and she returned the following month to testify  against Bixler before the grand jury. On September 19, 2019, the grand jury charged Bixler with four counts of sex trafficking, two counts of witness  tampering, one count of using facilities in interstate commerce to manage the trafficking scheme, six counts of drug  distribution, and three related firearms offenses. The matter proceeded to a jury trial in September 2020. [*4]  At  trial, the government presented testimony from three sex trafficking victims. The first victim to testify, Kaitlyn Moore, recalled meeting Bixler while homeless and unemployed. Moore had been  living with her boyfriend until he overdosed and went to jail. She then moved into a rehabilitation facility but  subsequently relapsed and absconded from the facility. Moore eventually found herself homeless, without any  personal belongings, and shoplifting to afford her drug habit. Shortly thereafter, Moore met Bixler at a hotel and received free heroin from him. That same night, Bixler suggested  Moore could make money through Backpage.com—a website commonly used for prostitution. Bixler told her how to  set up an account, paid for the user fees, and helped her solicit clients. Bixler also purchased a hotel room for her  dates. Moore testified that, in the beginning, she made ""easily a thousand dollars"" a day and continued receiving  free heroin from Bixler. Eventually, however, Bixler told Moore that she owed a significant debt for her living expenses, the hotel, and the  drugs. Moore testified that she felt obligated to repay the debt by prostituting herself. She stated, ""Over time, I  started to [*5]  feel like it really wasn't, like, so much a choice as where kind of I had to do it for fear. But I didn't     2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *1 Page 10 of 18 want to struggle, and I didn't want to have nothing, and it was no longer an option at one point in time. Like, I  didn't—I had to do it."" She also stated that ""once [she] started to do more dope, [she] would need more dope to not  be sick, and that cost money too."" Moore further testified that Bixler regularly carried guns and was prone to  violence. According to Moore, she once ""got smacked"" for letting one of the other women into her hotel room.  Moore testified that she feared Bixler and felt like she could not leave. The second victim to testify, Savannah Godown, recalled having a romantic relationship with Bixler. For the first few  months, Bixler was ""great"" to Godown. He supplied her with free crack cocaine daily and provided her with several  free apartments. Eventually, however, Bixler turned violent. Godown testified that Bixler hit her ""weekly,"" and that  he once ""beat [her] with an air mattress pump,"" and kicked a door in and chipped her tooth. Shortly thereafter, Bixler moved Godown into a hotel room and she became involved with Backpage.com. Bixler  imposed a strict set of [*6]  rules for Godown; he controlled the information she posted in her ads, the nature of her  clientele, and when she could leave the hotel rooms. If Godown disobeyed the rules, Bixler would ""beat [her] up for  it."" Bixler also deputized Godown to help run the operation. Bixler would instruct Godown to ""work the phone,"" pay  for the other women's hotel rooms, and collect their profits to give to Bixler. If Godown did not comply, Bixler would  again ""put his hands on [her]."" After approximately four years, Godown grew ""tired of being beat on"" and left. The third victim to testify, Savannah Evans, told a similar story to Moore. Like Moore, Evans met Bixler while  homeless and addicted to heroin. Evans testified that Bixler moved her into his house and began fronting her  heroin. Eventually, she began prostituting herself through Backpage.com to repay her debt. Bixler and his girlfriend,  Crystal Rowe, controlled Evans' account; they took photographs of her, posted ads for her services, and paid for  the advertisement fees. Bixler even drove Evans to outcalls, or calls at the client's location instead of at the hotel.  After she finished a date, Evans gave all the money she earned to Bixler, who provided [*7]  her with food, shelter,  and drugs. Evans stayed at Bixler's house full time, leaving only for calls. Evans testified that she feared Bixler and felt like she  could not leave. Bixler controlled not only her Backpage.com account, but also her heroin supply. He initially  provided her heroin on a daily basis, but Evans eventually had to beg Bixler for heroin. Evans testified that the  erratic intake caused withdrawal symptoms. According to Evans, heroin withdraw is ""like the flu. . . . Diarrhea, and  your body hurts, it aches. You feel really anxious and scared and worried about where you're going to get more  from."" Evans stated that those symptoms would subside immediately after using heroin. Evans also testified that  Bixler hit her on three separate occasions when she tried to leave, and that she saw Bixler hit at least four other  women as well. After hearing this and other evidence, the jury found Bixler guilty of sex trafficking, drug trafficking, witness  tampering, and the related offenses. The district court subsequently sentenced him to 432 months' imprisonment  and ordered him to pay $333,270 in restitution to Moore, Godown, and Evans. This appeal followed. II. Bixler first challenges [*8]  the district court's grant of the government's pre-trial motion to preclude evidence of his  alleged victims engaging in prostitution both before and after their involvement with him. HN1[ ] In ""criminal proceeding[s] involving alleged sexual misconduct,"" Federal Rule of Evidence 412 bars any  evidence ""offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual behavior."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(a)(1). However, ""not  all evidence implicating a victim's past sexual activity falls within Rule 412(a)."" United States v. Kettles, 970 F.3d  637, 642 (6th Cir. 2020). Rule 412 does not prohibit ""evidence whose exclusion would violate the defendant's  constitutional rights."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C). Bixler seizes upon this exception and argues that prohibiting  evidence of his alleged victims' past sexual behavior violated his Sixth and Fifth Amendment rights. First, Bixler contends that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment confrontation rights by curtailing relevant  cross-examination testimony from which the jury could have assessed the women's biases or motives to testify.  2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *5 Page 11 of 18 Bixler asserts that the women may have testified against Bixler in exchange for not being prosecuted for prior acts  of prostitution. This argument lacks merit. HN2[ ] The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right ""to be confronted with the witnesses  against him."" U.S. Const. amend. VI; Boggs v. Collins, 226 F.3d 728, 736 (6th Cir. 2000). ""The main and essential  purpose of confrontation is to secure [*9]  for the opponent the opportunity of cross-examination."" Davis v. Alaska,  415 U.S. 308, 315-16, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974). However, the Confrontation Clause requires only  ""an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to  whatever extent, the defense might wish."" Boggs, 226 F.3d at 736. Thus, trial judges retain broad discretion to  impose reasonable limits on cross-examination. Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89 L.  Ed. 2d 674 (1986). When a trial court limits cross-examination pertaining to a witness's motive, bias, or prejudice,  we must decide ""whether the jury was otherwise in possession of sufficient information concerning formative events  to make a discriminating appraisal of a witness' motives and bias."" United States v. Fields, 763 F.3d 443, 464 (6th  Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). The district court here permitted Bixler to elicit evidence of the women's criminal histories and their involvement with  the underlying investigation. For example, Moore testified that she twice avoided arrest on outstanding warrants— once at the time of Bixler's arrest and once a year later with the help of the same investigating detective. Godown  similarly testified that the government reduced a felony robbery charge to a misdemeanor shoplifting charge after  she spoke with the investigating detective on the underlying case. In addition, all of the women [*10]  admitted to  purchasing, possessing, and using illicit drugs. Therefore, the jury possessed sufficient information concerning the  women's motives to testify, which arose from the prospect of potential punishment and not from the nature of their  conduct. Bixler next argues that the district court violated his Fifth Amendment due process rights by precluding evidence  that bore directly on the essential element of force or coercion. Bixler asserts that evidence of prior prostitution  suggested the women participated in commercial sex acts on their own volition, and not at his behest. This  argument is likewise unavailing. HN3[ ] Although ""the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a complete  defense . . . [it] does not require the admission of irrelevant evidence (or other types of evidence whose relevance is  outweighed by other important considerations)."" United States v. Beavers, 756 F.3d 1044, 1052 (7th Cir. 2014)  (internal citations omitted). We agree with the great weight of authority from our sister circuits that prior acts of  prostitution are irrelevant to sex trafficking charges under § 1591(a). See, e.g., United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d  584, 595-96 (7th Cir. 2017); United States v. Gemma, 818 F.3d 23, 34 (1st Cir. 2016); United States v. Lockhart,  844 F.3d 501, 510 (5th Cir. 2016); United States v. Roy, 781 F.3d 416, 420 (8th Cir. 2015); United States v. Rivera,  799 F.3d 180, 186 (2d Cir. 2015); United States v. Valenzuela, 495 F. App'x 817, 819-20 (9th Cir. 2012). HN4[ ] Prior acts of prostitution lead only to improper character inferences and are not relevant to proving sex  trafficking [*11]  charges under 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a). This evidence had no bearing on whether Bixler forced or  coerced them into prostitution on the particular occasions alleged in the indictment. Bixler argues that evidence of  prior prostitution would demonstrate the women's propensity to engage in prostitution, which, in turn, would negate  their testimony that Bixler forced them into a life of prostitution. However, this is exactly the type of evidence  proscribed by Federal Rules of Evidence 412 and 404(b). See United States v. Givhan, 740 F. App'x 458, 464 (6th  Cir. 2018) (citing United States v. Mack, 808 F.3d 1074, 1084 (6th Cir. 2015)) (holding that evidence of prior  prostitution is not admissible to prove consensual prostitution on a different occasion). Furthermore, Bixler cannot show prejudicial error because the parties did, in fact, elicit evidence of prior acts of  prostitution, notwithstanding the district court's order. Bixler testified that he met Moore through Backpage.com,  where he responded to her advertisement for sex. Godown likewise testified that she worked on Backpage.com  before meeting Bixler. In addition, Evans testified that she occasionally posted advertisements for sex independent  of Bixler. 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *8 Page 12 of 18 Accordingly, Bixler cannot demonstrate that the district court committed any error, let alone prejudicial error, in  granting the government's motion in limine. [*12]  III. Second, Bixler challenges the district court's denial of his pre-trial motion to preclude the testimony of addiction  specialist Dr. Kelly Clark. HN5[ ] Federal Rule of Evidence 702 requires expert testimony to be both reliable and helpful for ""the trier of fact  to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue."" Fed. R. Evid. 702(a)-(d). Bixler challenges both  requirements. He argues that Clark could not provide reliable testimony because she never examined the victims in  this case. He also argues that Clark did not testify on matters ""beyond the ken of the average juror,"" and thus  ""invaded the province of the jury"" in determining the ultimate issue at trial—whether Bixler coerced the victims to  engage in commercial sex acts. Appellant Br. 21-22. HN6[ ] We review the district court's admission of expert  testimony for an abuse of discretion. United States v. Amawi, 695 F.3d 457, 478 (6th Cir. 2012). At trial, Clark testified about the physical and psychological impacts of drug dependency, addiction, and withdrawal.  Clark differentiated between physical dependency as the body's adjustment to the presence of drugs, and drug  addiction as a ""chronic brain disease"" that affects the user's impulse control and judgment. Trial R. 216, Page ID#:  2940, 2943. She explained that withdrawal results from the [*13]  body's readjustment to the absence of drugs. She  described withdrawal as ""very, very painful,"" and listed common symptoms as nausea, diarrhea, sweating, shaking,  and drooling. Id. at Page ID#: 2943. She stated that ""people can't function when their bodies"" go through  withdrawal. Id. Clark noted that anyone can become dependent on drugs and experience withdrawal, but only those  addicted to drugs lose control when the drugs are withheld. According to Clark, those struggling with addiction  initially reuse drugs to ""chas[e] feeling good,"" but, as the addiction cycle continues, they reuse drugs to escape the  sickness that comes from withdrawal. Id. at Page ID#: 2950. This kind of testimony does not require review of case-specific facts. See Fed. R. Evid. 702 advisory committee's  note (""[I]t might . . . be important in some cases for an expert to educate the factfinder about general principles,  without ever attempting to apply these principles to the specific facts of the case.""). Instead, Clark's testimony  helped the jury contextualize the women's vulnerabilities and understand the power Bixler held over them—subjects  that likely are beyond an ordinary juror's knowledge or experience. See Patrick Eoghan [*14]  Murray, In Need of a  Fix: Reforming Criminal Law in Light of a Contemporary Understanding of Drug Addiction, 60 UCLA L. Rev. 1006,  1025 (2013) (""For a judge or jury to get inside the mind of a drug addict requires understanding th[e] mysterious  and self-destructive compulsion [to consume drugs] that has no analog for nonaddicts.""). Accordingly, the district  court did not abuse its discretion by allowing Dr. Clark to testify as an expert regarding drug dependency and  addiction. IV. Third, Bixler contends that the government violated his equal protection rights by using a peremptory challenge to  strike the only black member of the venire. HN7[ ] The Equal Protection Clause prohibits a party from using peremptory challenges to exclude members of  the venire on account of their race. See Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986).  In evaluating a Batson challenge, the district court must follow a three-step process. Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765,  768, 115 S. Ct. 1769, 131 L. Ed. 2d 834 (1995). First, the court must determine if the opponent of the peremptory  challenge has made out a prima facie case of racial discrimination (step 1). Second, if the opponent establishes a  prima facie case, the court must then determine if the proponent has presented a race-neutral explanation (step 2).  Third, if the proponent tenders a race-neutral explanation, the court must ultimately decide [*15]  whether the  opponent has proved purposeful discrimination (step 3). Id. Notably, ""the ultimate burden of persuasion . . . rests  with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike."" Id. 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *11 Page 13 of 18 HN8[ ] Step 1. A party's use of a peremptory challenge to strike the only prospective black juror is ""more than  sufficient to establish a prima facie case of intentional discrimination."" United States v. Mahan, 190 F.3d 416, 425  (6th Cir. 1999). Bixler averred, and the government did not dispute, that the stricken juror, Juror 23, was the sole  black juror on the panel. Thus, we must move to step 2. HN9[ ] Step 2. The proponent's explanation ""need not be particularly persuasive, or even plausible, so long as it is  neutral."" United States v. Harris, 192 F.3d 580, 586 (6th Cir. 1999). An explanation is ""neutral"" if it is based on  something other than the race of the juror. Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 360, 111 S. Ct. 1859, 114 L. Ed.  2d 395 (1991). Here, the government argues that the peremptory strike was based on Juror 23's acquaintance with  Bixler, namely, that her family or friends knew Bixler. Finding that the government met its burden, we turn now to  step 3. See United States v. Lawrence, 735 F.3d 385, 444 (6th Cir. 2013) (finding that a juror's familial connection  to the defendant ""is facially reasonable and does not suggest discriminatory intent""). HN10[ ] Step 3. When the proponent presents a neutral explanation, ""the question . . . boils down to whether  [the [*16]  opponent] established by a preponderance of the evidence that the peremptory strikes were intentionally  discriminatory."" United States v. Tucker, 90 F.3d 1135, 1142 (6th Cir. 1996). The district court's decision on the  ultimate question of discriminatory intent is a finding of fact entitled to ""great deference on appeal."" Hernandez, 500  U.S. at 364. We accordingly review for clear error. Tucker, 90 F.3d at 1142. In this case, the district court found no discriminatory intent. The court noted that Juror 23 was the only juror who  ""had heard of Prince Bixler,"" and that she gave conflicting information ""on how she heard."" Juror 23 initially  indicated that, three or four years prior, she heard a family member mention ""Prince Bixler"" in passing. Juror 23  later indicated that she heard his name through a mutual family friend, not a family member, and named the specific  friend on the record. In addition, Juror 23 was the only juror with prior knowledge of Backpage.com. Under these  circumstances, we cannot find that the district court clearly erred in overruling Bixler's Batson challenge. V. Fourth, Bixler argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a continuance based on news coverage  of a local rally against sex trafficking to occur later that same day. HN11[ ] Trial courts retain broad discretion [*17]  on matters of continuances. Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S. 1, 11-12,  103 S. Ct. 1610, 75 L. Ed. 2d 610 (1982). An abuse of discretion occurs only when the court unreasonably and  arbitrarily ""'insist[s] upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay.'"" Id. (quoting Ungar v.  Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575, 589, 84 S. Ct. 841, 11 L. Ed. 2d 921 (1964)). ""There are no mechanical tests for deciding  when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process. The answer must be found in the  circumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request  is denied."" United States v. Wirsing, 719 F.2d 859, 866 (6th Cir. 1983) (citation omitted). We also look to whether  the defendant suffered any prejudice as a result of the denial. Id.; United States v. Martin, 740 F.2d 1352, 1360 (6th  Cir. 1984). Minutes before the start of voir dire, Bixler moved to continue his trial for an unspecified period of time to avoid any  potential prejudice from a local rally against ""either human trafficking or sex trafficking"" scheduled for later that  same day. Trial R. 213, Page ID#: 1904. Bixler worried that prospective jurors ""may have heard reports"" on the  news that morning, and selected jurors could hear about it on the news that night. Id. He argued that the rally  attendees would be protesting the same conduct of which he was accused, and thus, publicity of the rally could  prejudicially pervade the [*18]  courtroom and impact his ability to have a fair trial. The district court denied the  motion, assuring the parties that it would ""carefully voir dire"" the jury pool of any predispositions and warn the  selected jury ""to avoid any news concerning th[e] case, and . . . the subject matter of the case."" During voir dire, the court inquired whether the prospective jurors had any knowledge of the case or any  preconceived opinions as to Bixler's guilt. None of the jurors indicted any knowledge of the case. Instead, all the  jurors expressed their willingness to decide the charges against Bixler solely on the evidence presented at trial and  2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *15 Page 14 of 18 to presume Bixler's innocence unless proven guilty. Defense counsel specifically inquired whether the prospective  jurors had seen any news stories or accounts about commercial sex trafficking. None of the jurors answered  affirmatively, and neither party challenged any juror for cause on that basis. Throughout the trial, the district court  properly admonished the jury to avoid reading, watching, or listening to any coverage of the case, and required any  juror inadvertently exposed to such information to convey that fact to the court. Under these circumstances, [*19]   we cannot find that the unbeknownst sex trafficking rally prejudicially affected the juror pool. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Bixler's motion for a continuance. VI. Fifth, Bixler challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions for sex trafficking and witness  tampering. HN12[ ] Where, as here, a defendant properly preserves his claims of insufficient evidence, we review  those claims de novo. United States v. Mack, 808 F.3d 1074, 1080 (6th Cir. 2015). In evaluating the claims, we  must ask ""whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact  could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt."" Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S.  307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979). We must ""draw all available inferences and resolve all issues of  credibility in favor of the jury's verdict."" United States v. Conatser, 514 F.3d 508, 519 (6th Cir. 2008) (citation  omitted). A. HN13[ ] To support a conviction for sex trafficking under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1), the government must prove that  Bixler (1) recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, or maintained a person; (2) knowing that  force, threats of force, coercion, or any combination of such means would be used; (3) to cause the person to  engage in a commercial sex act. Bixler challenges only the second element, arguing [*20]  that the government  failed to present sufficient evidence of ""force"" or ""coercion."" HN14[ ] ""Coercion"" includes ""threats of serious harm"" and a ""scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person  to believe that failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any person."" 18  U.S.C. § 1591(e)(2)(A)-(B). ""Serious harm"" means any harm, whether physical or nonphysical, including psychological, financial, or reputational harm, that is  sufficiently serious, under all the surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable person of the same  background and in the same circumstances to perform or to continue performing commercial sexual activity in  order to avoid incurring that harm. 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(5). It can include physical and psychological harm incurred from severe drug withdrawal. See  Mack, 808 F.3d at 1081-83. In Mack, the defendant targeted women with pre-existing drug addictions and used those addictions to coerce them  into prostitution. Id. at 1082. The defendant initially supplied ""free"" drugs to the women, which in turn exacerbated  their addictions and resulted in a high, fictitious drug debt. Id. at 1081-82. When he abruptly cut them off and  demanded payment, the women felt compelled to engage in commercial sex acts ""to avoid the physical and  psychological [*21]  harm of heroin and cocaine withdrawal."" Id. at 1082. One woman testified that ""when she did  not prostitute herself, she would get sick from lack of heroin. Without it, she would sweat, vomit, shake, and kick her  legs uncontrollably."" Id. Under these circumstances, this court found sufficient evidence of a ""coercive and, at times,  physically abusive atmosphere in which the victims felt compelled to prostitute themselves."" Id. at 1081. Mack is controlling here. Bixler similarly exploited his victims' drug addictions and withdrawal symptoms by carefully  controlling their access to drugs. Bixler gave the women presumptively free drugs and enticed them into  codependent relationships. Once he gained their complete obedience and loyalty, Bixler demanded the women  engage in prostitution for his financial benefit. Bixler took salacious photos of them, posted advertisements on  Backpage.com, and set the prices for their services. Bixler psychologically manipulated the women by withholding  drugs until after their dates. He also used intimidation and violence to ensure the women met their daily quotas. He  2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *18 Page 15 of 18 then kept all the money earned; using the profits to repay their fictious debts. Viewing this evidence in the light  most [*22]  favorable to the government, a reasonable jury could have found that Bixler forced, threatened, or  coerced the women to engage in prostitution. Bixler also argues that the district court should have found Evans incompetent to testify and stricken her testimony  after she admitted to using heroin on the morning of trial. HN15[ ] However, ""[a] witness under the influence of  drugs is competent to testify unless he or she is so impaired that he or she cannot coherently respond to  questioning."" United States v. Frezzell, 793 F. App'x 133, 136 (3rd Cir. 2019) (quoting 98 C.J.S. Witnesses § 115  (2019)). That was not the case here. The district court determined that Evans ""had recollection, she's had narration,  she seems to understand the oath, she says she doesn't remember when she doesn't remember."" Trial R. 214,  Page ID#: 2460-61. The court accordingly concluded that Evans was competent to testify. Thus, Bixler's argument  goes to the weight and credibility of her testimony—a question ""particularly suited to the jury,"" not this court. Fed. R.  Evid. 601, Advisory Committee Notes; see United States v. Moreno, 899 F.2d 465, 469 (6th Cir. 1990). B. HN16[ ] To support a conviction for witness tampering under 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(1), the government must prove  that Bixler (1) knowingly intimidated, threatened, or corruptly persuaded; (2) with the intent to influence, delay, [*23]   or prevent; (3) the testimony of any person in an official proceeding. Bixler challenges only the first element, arguing  that the government failed to present sufficient proof of intimidation, threats, or corrupt persuasion where he told the  women to ""tell the truth."" HN17[ ] We have consistently upheld convictions for witness tampering in the absence of directly threatening  language. See United States v. Carnes, 309 F.3d 950, 956 (6th Cir. 2002); United States v. Carson, 796 F. App'x  238, 251 (6th Cir. 2019). The key inquiry is whether the evidence could have been interpreted as ""threatening in  nature or intent."" Carnes, 309 F.3d at 956 (internal quotations and citation omitted). This inquiry recognizes that  ""otherwise encouraging language can become a threat . . . when issued by a long-time abuser."" Id. at 957 (internal  quotations omitted). The evidence produced at trial demonstrated that Bixler had a long-standing pattern of threatening and abusing  Ratliff and Payton. In the days leading up to their grand jury appearances, Bixler incessantly called and delivered  messages to deter them from testifying. For example, Bixler confronted Ratliff and guilted her for betraying him.  Bixler also conveyed that, if the roles were reversed, he would ""fight with"" her rather than testify against her. In  particular, Bixler threatened: ""No, when I get the [*24]  fuck in front of you, I'm going to cuss your ass out, I might  even slap your God damn brains out. But at the end of the day - I wouldn't tell the motherfucker nothing."" Gov't Ex.  12G, 01:43-3:26. Ratliff understood these messages as attempts to pressure or intimidate her into lying to protect  him. Bixler similarly confronted Payton, telling her that the government wanted to ""conquer and destroy"" him by ""fucking  [him] with all [his] loved ones [and the people he] takes care of . . . or the people that [he would] do anything for, so  once they turn on [him], [he's] sitting in jail with nothing."" Gov't Ex. 13A, 00:28-01:07. Based on Bixler's tone and  conduct, Payton believed Bixler ""was mad at [her]"" and did not want her to testify before the grand jury. To avoid  angering Bixler, Payton used heroin on her way to the courthouse and refused to talk at the first grand jury. Payton  stated that she would rather go to jail for six months than testify against him. Under these circumstances, the jury could reasonably infer that Bixler attempted to corruptly persuade the women  and prevent them from testifying before the grand jury. This is especially true ""given the long history of [Bixler's]  abusive [*25]  behavior toward [Ratliff and Payton]."" United States v. Iu, 917 F.3d 1026, 1032 (8th Cir. 2019). VII. Finally, Bixler challenges the application of seven sentencing enhancements and the district court's calculation of  restitution. HN18[ ] When evaluating the district court's application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review factual  findings for clear error and mixed questions of law and fact de novo. United States v. Tolbert, 668 F.3d 798, 800  2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *21 Page 16 of 18 (6th Cir. 2012). ""A finding is clearly erroneous where, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court  on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed."" Id. A. We will first address Bixler's argument that the record did not adequately support six different sentencing  enhancements. First, Bixler objects to the district court's application of a four-level enhancement for ""knowingly caus[ing] another  person to engage in a sexual act—by using force against that other person; or by threatening or placing that other  person in fear [of] death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping."" 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a); see U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1(b)(1).  Several women testified at trial that Bixler frequently used violence to ensure they met call quotas. Bixler even  admitted that he ""put [his] hands on women""; in particular, he testified that he hit Godown and ""struck"" [*26]  Evans  for stealing money. Therefore, the district court did not err in applying the use of force enhancement. Second, Bixler objects to the district court's application of U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a). HN19[ ] Under section 3B1.1(a),  the district court must apply a four-level enhancement if the defendant organized or led any criminal activity that  involved five or more participants. A review of the record shows that Bixler headed an extensive criminal enterprise  that spanned several years and involved at least eight participants whom he deputized to recruit women, create  advertisements, arrange hotel rooms, collect profits, and deliver drugs. Therefore, the record amply supported  application of the leadership enhancement. Third, Bixler objects to the district court's application of a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. See  U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1. The district court determined that Bixler's convictions for witness tampering supported an  enhancement for obstructing justice. The court found that Bixler ""specifically talked about trafficking with respect to  Adrianne Ratliff."" These findings were supported by the record. Fourth, Bixler objects to the district court's application of an eight-level enhancement for threatening to cause  physical injury [*27]  to a person. See U.S.S.G. § 2J1.2(b)(1)(B). However, Bixler's argument is belied by a  recorded phone call between himself and Ratliff, in which he threatened to ""slap [her] God damn brains out."" Gov't  Ex. 12G, 01:43-3:26. Fifth, Bixler objects to the district court's drug quantity calculation under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(5). HN20[ ] Section  2D1.1(c)(5) provides that drug trafficking offenses involving at least one kilogram of heroin require a base offense  level of 30. A review of the record shows that Bixler distributed heroin to at least nine people over the course of two  years. For instance, Bixler sold Holly Falls thirty grams of heroin; Jessica Martin ten grams of heroin; and Amy  Bailey sixty grams of heroin. In addition, Bixler supplied Evans with heroin daily for two and a half years, an  approximate total of seven hundred fifty grams, and Caudill with two grams of heroin daily for a couple months.  Accordingly, the record sufficiently supported the district court's drug quantity calculation. Finally, Bixler objects to the district court's application of a two-level enhancement for an offense involving three to  seven firearms. See U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(1)(A). However, Bixler admitted that he owned three firearms recovered  from his residence and garage. Therefore, the district court [*28]  did not err in applying the firearm enhancement. B. Bixler next argues that the district court impermissibly ""double counted"" in applying multiple Sentencing Guidelines  provisions for the same conduct. HN21[ ] Double counting occurs only ""when precisely the same aspect of a defendant's conduct factors into his  sentence in two separate ways."" United States v. Farrow, 198 F.3d 179, 193 (6th Cir. 1999). ""[N]o double counting  occurs if the defendant is punished for distinct aspects of his conduct."" United States v. Battaglia, 624 F.3d 348,    2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *25 Page 17 of 18 351 (6th Cir. 2010). Even where double counting occurs, it is not necessarily impermissible. Farrow, 198 F.3d at  194. For instance, ""we allow double counting where it appears that Congress or the Sentencing Commission  intended to attach multiple penalties to the same conduct."" Id. (citing United States v. Johnson, 22 F.3d 106, 108  (6th Cir. 1994)). Bixler identifies three alleged instances of double counting. First, he asserts that the district court improperly  considered his use of force to determine his base offense level and to apply a four-level enhancement under §  2A3.1(b)(1). HN22[ ] U.S.S.G. § 2G1.1(a) provides the base offense level for sex trafficking convictions. However,  when the offense involves aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse, the cross-reference in U.S.S.G. § 2G1.1(c)(1)  provides that the district court should instead apply U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1. Section 2A3.1(b)(1) provides for a four-level  enhancement if the offense involved the former—aggravated [*29]  sexual abuse under section 2241(a) or (b). Id. at  § 2A3.1(b)(1). Based on the plain language of the Guidelines, the Sentencing Commission intended for the entirety  of § 2A3.1, including any enhancements, to apply following the application of the cross reference. See U.S.S.G. §  1B1.5(a); United States v. Kizer, 517 F. App'x 415, 420 (6th Cir. 2013) (finding that ""the Sentencing Commission  must have intended to punish defendants in this way using both the cross reference and the enhancement."").  Therefore, the district court's application of the use of force enhancement did not constitute impermissible double  counting. Second, Bixler asserts that the district court improperly considered the victims' drug addictions both as an element  of the offense and to increase the offense level under § 3A1.1(b)(1). HN23[ ] Under section 3A1.1(b)(1), the  district court must apply a two-level enhancement ""if the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the  offense was a vulnerable victim."" A ""vulnerable victim"" means one ""who is unusually vulnerable due to age, physical  or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct."" Id. at § 3A1.1 cmt. n.2.  The application notes caution that the vulnerable victim enhancement cannot be applied ""if the factor that makes a  person a vulnerable victim is incorporated in the offense guideline."" [*30]  Id. However, the district court recognized  this at sentencing and imposed the enhancement based on factors other than the women's drug addictions. For  example, the court also considered their criminal histories and economic dependency on Bixler. Therefore, the  district court's application of the vulnerable victim enhancement did not constitute impermissible double counting. Third, Bixler asserts that the district court improperly considered his attempts to influence grand jury testimony both  as an element of the offenses and to increase the offense level under § 3C1.1. However, this argument is expressly  foreclosed by the application notes. HN24[ ] The application notes allow the obstruction of justice enhancement to  apply ""where there is a separate count of conviction for such conduct."" U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 cmt. n.4; see United  States v. Pego, 567 F. App'x 323, 330 (6th Cir. 2014). Therefore, the district court's application of the obstruction of  justice enhancement also did not constitute impermissible double counting. C. Finally, Bixler contends that the district court erred in calculating the amount of restitution owed to Moore, Godown,  and Evans. HN25[ ] The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (""TVPA"") directs district courts to order restitution for  any sex trafficking offense. See 18 U.S.C. § 1593(a). Section 1593(b) requires the defendant to pay the victim ""the  full [*31]  amount of the victim's losses,"" including ""the gross income or value to the defendant of the victim's  services or labor."" Bixler argues that the government did not present sufficiently reliable proof of the women's incomes, and that the  court merely estimated the amount. HN26[ ] However, the amount of restitution need not ""be proven with  exactitude."" In re Sealed Case, 702 F.3d 59, 66, 403 U.S. App. D.C. 194 (D.C. Cir. 2012). Determining the dollar  amount of a victim's losses ""will often be difficult"" and ""such a determination will inevitably involve some degree of  approximation[.]"" Id. (citation omitted). Thus, estimates are permitted as long as there exists some reasonable and  reliable evidence of the victims' losses. United States v. Williams, 5 F.4th 1295, 1305 (11th Cir. 2021).   2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *28 Page 18 of 18 Relying on the women's trial testimony, the district court multiplied their self-reported daily earnings by the  approximate number of days worked. The court found that Moore earned approximately $1,000 per day for four  days, totaling a gross income of $4,000. It also estimated that Godown earned approximately $300 per day for 782  days, totaling a gross income of $234,642. It further determined that Evans earned approximately $160 per day for  591 days, totaling a gross income of $94,628. During its calculations, the court reduced the number of days [*32]   worked to account for sick days and ensure a conservative estimate. We find these estimates sufficiently  reasonable and reliable for purposes of the TVPA. Bixler next asserts that the court should have offset the claimed amount by the value of the items supplied to the  women, including food and lodging. However, this argument disregards the plain language of the TVPA. HN27[ ]  Section 1593(b) provides that trafficking victims shall recover ""the gross income or value [of their services]."" ""Gross  income"" is the ""[t]otal income from all sources before deductions, exemptions, or other tax reductions."" Black's Law  Dictionary 710, 767 (7th ed. 1999) (emphasis added). Therefore, ""the court was not required—or even permitted— to offset the restitution . . . by the amount [Bixler] expended on his victims' living expenses."" Williams, 5 F.4th at  1305. Accordingly, the district court did not err in calculating the amount of restitution owed under the TVPA. VIII. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Bixler's convictions, sentence, and restitution owed.  2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *31"
"United States v. Connelly, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 32176.pdf","[*1] _____________________________________ For Appellee: Katherine A. Gregory, Assistant United  States Attorney, on behalf of, Trini E. Ross, United States Attorney for the Western District of New York, Buffalo, NY. For Defendant-Appellant: Robert J. Boyle, Robert J.  Boyle, Attorney at Law, New York, NY. Appeal from a final order of the United States District  Court for the Western District of New York (William M. Skretny, J.). UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY  ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the order of the district court is  AFFIRMED. Defendant-Appellant Kenneth White (""White"") was  sentenced in 2016 to 156 months' imprisonment after  pleading guilty to one count of sex trafficking by force,  fraud, or coercion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§  1591(a)(1) and (b)(1). White challenged his sentence on  direct appeal before this Court and then before the  district court on collateral review under 28 U.S.C. §  2255. Both challenges were rejected. 1 In July 2022,  White filed a pro se motion for compassionate release  pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). The district court  denied his § 3582 motion, concluding, inter alia, that  even assuming White ""had demonstrated extraordinary  and compelling reasons for a sentence reduction (which  he has not),"" any such reasons were ""greatly  outweighed [*2]  by consideration of the [18 U.S.C. ]§  3553 (a) factors."" White v. United States, No. 13-CR- 255S (1), 2022 WL 4244219, at *6 (W.D.N.Y. Sept. 15,  2022). For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the district  court's denial of White's motion for compassionate  release. We assume the parties' familiarity with the  underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and  the issues on appeal. * * * White's direct appeal and habeas petition were rejected  on the basis of White's decision to enter into a plea  agreement and attest to his knowing, voluntary, and  competent waiver of the right to appeal and collaterally  Page 2 of 3 attack his sentence. See White v. United States, No. 16- 1736 (2d Cir. July 16, 2018) (direct appeal); White v.  United States, Nos. 18-CV-1315S, 13-CR-255S (1),  2022 WL 170607 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 19, 2022) (habeas  petition); White v. United States, Nos. 18-CV-1315S, 13- CR-255S, 2022 WL 2948974 (W.D.N.Y. July 26, 2022)  (subsequent motion for reconsideration of habeas  petition). We review the denial of a motion for compassionate  release for abuse of discretion. SeeUnited States v.  Holloway, 956 F.3d 660, 664 (2d Cir. 2020). ""A district  court has abused its discretion if it has (1) based its  ruling on an erroneous view of the law, (2) made a  clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or (3)  rendered a decision that cannot be located within the  range of permissible decisions."" United States v. Keitt,  21 F.4th 67, 71 (2d Cir. 2021) (quoting UnitedStates v.  Saladino, 7 F.4th 120, 122 (2d Cir. 2021)). White argues that the sentencing court applied the  wrong version of the Sentencing Guidelines to his crime  of conviction and erroneously assessed two Criminal  History points to his Guidelines calculation. He further  contends that [*3]  these two errors resulted in a  significant increase in his prison sentence and therefore  constitute extraordinary and compelling reasons to  reduce his sentence. See 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i).  Setting aside the merits of this claim, the district court  declined to consider whether the alleged sentencing  errors warranted § 3582 relief because White knowingly,  voluntarily, and competently agreed not to directly  appeal or collaterally attack any component of his  sentence in his 2015 plea agreement. On appeal, White  asserts that the district court abused its discretion by  refusing to consider the merits of his claim, citing  UnitedStates v. Brooker, 976 F.3d 228 (2d Cir. 2020),  which confirmed that when imprisoned persons move  for § 3582 relief, district courts may consider ""the full  slate of extraordinary and compelling reasons"" that are  ""br[ought] before them."" 2 Id. at 237. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j),  White submitted a letter dated September 22, 2023  informing this Court of a recent amendment to Section  4A1.1 of the Sentencing Guideline (""Amendment 821"").  Amendment 821 struck subsection (d) of Section 4A1.1,  which previously accorded two Criminal History points to  a guidelines calculation if a defendant committed the  instant offense while under any criminal justice  sentence. White notes that he was accorded two  Criminal History points pursuant to this subsection at  sentencing, which placed [*4]  him in Criminal History  Category III. White asserts that had he not been placed  in Category III, it is reasonably possible that the court  may have departed to Category I in light of its decision  to depart from Category III to Category II. We disagree.  Although the sentencing court granted White's request  to reduce his Criminal History Category ""on the basis  that [Category III] We need not decide whether claims that were knowingly  and validly waived in a plea agreement fall under  Brooker's ""full slate"" pronouncement. Here, the district  court's evaluation of the § 3553(a) factors offers an  independent and fully adequate basis for denial of relief  under § 3582(c)(1)(A). See 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A);  United States v. Jones, 17 F.4th 371, 374 (2d Cir. 2021)  (explaining that ""extraordinary and compelling reasons  are necessary-but not sufficient- for a defendant to  obtain relief under § 3582(c)(1)(A)""). The district court  validly considered the nature and circumstances of  White's offense, his personal history and characteristics,  and the need for the sentence imposed to provide a just  punishment, afford adequate deterrence, and protect  the public from future crimes. As to the nature and  circumstances of his offense, the district court  reasonably concluded that White's operation of an  interstate commercial sex business [*5]  was, as he  admitted in his motion for compassionate release,  nothing short of brutal in nature. As to his personal  characteristics, the district court reasonably concluded  that White did not have an abnormal upbringing or a  record of significant mental-health diagnoses or issues.  Lastly, as to the purpose behind sentencing White to  156 months' imprisonment, the district court noted that  White was already serving a sentence below the 15- year statutory minimum, and that further reducing his  sentence  would  not  properly  account  for  the  seriousness of the offense or advance any of the goals  of sentencing enumerated in § 3553(a)(2). The district court's assessment of the § 3553(a) factors  and its resulting sentence determination was well ""within  the range of permissible decisions,"" Keitt, 21 F.4th at 71  (internal overstate[d] the nature of [White's] criminal history and  the likelihood that [he] will recidivate,"" the court further  determined that ""[g]iven the two countable violation level  offenses,"" Criminal History Category II more aptly suited  White's conduct. United States v. White, No. 13-CR-255  Page 3 of 3 (1), ECF No. 98 (W.D.N.Y. May 20, 2016). For this  reason, we are not convinced that the sentencing court  would have departed further to Category I based on the  Guidelines amendment. quotation marks and citation omitted), [*6]  as was its  conclusion that ""consideration of the [18 U.S.C. §]  3553(a) factors outweigh[ed] any extraordinary and  compelling reasons for a sentence reduction."" 2022 WL  4244219, at *7. We can discern no basis to vacate the  district court's well-reasoned order. We have considered White's remaining arguments and  find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM  the order of the district court. FOR THE COURT: Catherine O'Hagan Wolfe, Clerk"
"United States v. Crim. Frederik Barbieri, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217647.pdf","[*1] Order Denying Motion for Sentence Reduction This matter is before the Court on the Defendant  Frederik Barbieri's motion for reduction of sentence  pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). (Mot., ECF No.  120.) The Government has responded opposing  Barbieri's motion. (Resp., ECF No. 122.) Barbieri has  not replied, and the time to do so has passed. After  careful consideration of the parties' written submissions,  the record, and the legal authorities, the Court denies  Barbieri's motion for reduction of sentence. (Mot., ECF  No. 120.) 1. Background On March 13, 2018, a federal grand jury indicted  Barbieri with conspiracy to commit offenses against the  United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 (Count  One), delivery of firearms to a contract carrier without  written notification in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(e)  (Count Two), smuggling goods outside the United  States in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 554 (Count Three),  exporting  firearms,  firearms  accessories,  and  ammunition in violation of 22 U.S.C. § 2778 (Count  Four), and possession of firearms with obliterated serial  numbers in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(k)) (Count Five).  (ECF No. 14.) On May 15, 2018, pursuant to a plea  agreement (ECF No. 28) and factual proffer (ECF No.  27), Barbieri pled guilty to Counts One and Four of the  indictment-specifically, [*2]  to conspiracy to commit  offenses against the United States in violation of 18  U.S.C. § 371 and unlicensed exportation of firearms and  firearm accessories from the United States to Brazil in  violation of 22 U.S.C. § 2778(b)(2) and (c). Ahead of Barbieri's sentencing, the United States  Probation Office prepared a Presentence Investigation  Report (""PSI""). After considering Barbieri's objections to  the PSI, the Court ultimately determined that Barbieri  had a total offense level of 35, a criminal history  category of I, and an advisory guideline range of 168- 210 months. (See Sentencing Tr. 28-29, ECF No. 74.)  On July 19, 2018, the Court sentenced Barbieri to 152  months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. (J. 2-3, ECF No. 40.) As of  the filing of his motion, Barbieri had an anticipated  release date of December 10, 2027. SeeFind aninmate,  FEDERAL  BUREAU  OF  PRISONS,  https://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/ (last visited Dec. 6,  2023). Since Barbieri was sentenced, the United States  Sentencing  Commission  issued  a  sentencing  adjustment for certain zero-point offenders, which  provides, in relevant part, for ""a decrease of two levels  from the offense level . . . for offenders who did not  receive any criminal history points . [*3]  . . and whose  instant offense did not involve specified aggravating  factors"" (""Amendment 821""). Barbieri now seeks  retroactive application of Amendment 821 to the Court's  judgment sentencing him to 152 months in prison and  three years of supervised release. 2. Legal Standard ""[A] motion to modify an otherwise final judgment  Page 2 of 3 pursuant to § 3582(c)(2) is a limited and narrow  exception to the rule that final judgments are not to be  modified."" United States v. Armstrong, 347 F.3d 905,  909 (11th Cir. 2003) (cleaned up). Specifically, §  3582(c)(2) provides: [I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to  a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range  that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing  Commission . . . , the court may reduce the term of  imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in  section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if  such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy  statements issued bythe Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. § 3582 (emphasis added). Thus, under §  3582(c)(2), the Court must undertake a two-step  process to determine whether a final sentence should  be modified based on a sentencing range that has been  lowered by the Sentencing Commission. First, the Court must determine if a retroactive  amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines indeed  lowered a defendant's guidelines range [*4]  and  whether a reduction is consistent with the applicable  policy statements. Second, the Court must consider the  § 3553(a) factors to determine if it will exercise its  discretion to reduce that defendant's sentence. Among other things, the Sentencing Commission policy  statement applicable here provides that a court ""shall  not reduce the defendant's term of imprisonment under  18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) . . . to a term that is less than the  minimum of the amended guideline range[.]"" U.S.S.G. §  1B1.10(b)(2)(A). In addition, although Amendment 821  went into effect on November 1, 2023, the policy  statement ""delays the effective date of orders reducing a  defendant's term of imprisonment to a date no earlier than February 1,  2024."" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10 cmt. n. 7. In other words, if a  defendant is scheduled for release before February 1,  2024, he is not entitled to relief under Amendment 821. Finally, the § 3553(a) factors are: (1) the nature and  circumstances of the offense and the history and  characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the  sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the  offense, promote respect for the law, provide just  punishment for the offense, afford adequate deterrence  to criminal conduct, protect the public from further  crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with  needed [*5]  educational or vocational training, medical  care, or other correctional treatment in the most  effective manner; (3) the kinds of sentences available;  (4) the applicable sentencing guidelines range; (5) any  pertinent policy statement; (6) the need to avoid  unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants  with similar records who have been found guilty of  similar conduct; and (7) the need to provide restitution to  any victims of the offense. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). 3. Analysis A. Barbieri is not eligible for a sentence reduction. As noted, the retroactive amendment that Barbieri  invokes here is Amendment 821-the adjustment for  certain zero-point offenders. See U.S.S.G. § 4C1.1.  Pursuant to Amendment 821, a defendant is eligible for  a two-level reduction in his offense level, if he meets all  the following criteria: (1) the defendant did not receive any criminal history  points from Chapter Four, Part A; (2) the defendant did not receive an adjustment under  §3A1.4 (Terrorism); (3) the defendant did not use violence or credible  threats of violence in connection with the offense; (4) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily  injury; (5) the instant offense of conviction is not a sex offense; (6) the defendant did not personally cause substantial  financial [*6]  hardship; (7) the defendant did not possess, receive, purchase,  transport, transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of a  firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another  participant to do so) in connection with the offense; (8) the instant offense of conviction is not covered by  §2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights); (9) the defendant did not receive an adjustment under  §3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable Victim) or  §3A1.5 (Serious Human Rights Offense); and (10) the defendant did not receive an adjustment under  §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) and was not engaged in a  continuing criminal enterprise, as defined in 21 U.S.C. §  848[.] See id. Here, Barbieri plainly fails to meet requirements seven  Page 3 of 3 and ten-i.e., that he ""did not possess, receive, purchase,  transport, transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of a  firearm or other dangerous weapon . . . in connection  with the offense[.]"" and that he ""did not receive an  adjustment under §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) and was  not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise, as  defined in 21 U.S.C. § 848."" See id. Among other things,  Barbieri's factual proffer establishes that: From in or around May 2013 through in or around  February 2018, [Barbieri] conspired with others: (1) to  possess firearms with obliterated [*7]  serial numbers;  (2) to deliver firearms to a common and contract carrier  for shipment in interstate commerce without providing  written notice to the carrier that such firearms were  being transported; (3) to smuggle firearms, firearm  accessories, and ammunition from the United States to  Brazil; and (4) to illegally export firearms, firearm  accessories, and ammunition designated as defense  articles from the United States to Brazil without first  obtaining a license or written approval from the United  States Department of State, Directorate of Defense  Trade Control. (Factual Proffer 1, ECF No. 27.) It is therefore  indisputable that Barbieri does not meet requirement  number seven, as the possession and disposition of  firearms played an integral role in the offenses for which  Barbieri was convicted. In addition, Barbieri received  sentencing enhancements as a leader and organizer of  his trafficking organization, making him also ineligible for  the two-level decrease under requirement number ten.  Thus, because Barbieri plainly does not satisfy all the  requisite criteria for a two-level reduction in his offense  level, his motion must be denied. Moreover, because Barbieri does not qualify for a [*8]   reduction pursuant to Amendment 821, the Court  declines to reach the second step of the analysis to  consider the § 3553(a) factors."
"United States v. Crow, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 32380.pdf","[*1] Appeal from the United States District Court for the  Southern District of Florida D.C. Docket No. 2:22-cr- 14035-JEM-1 ____________________ USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 2 of 10 2 Opinion of the Court 22-14267 Before ROSENBAUM, JILL PRYOR, and BLACK,  Circuit Judges. PER CURIAM: Daniel Crow appeals his sentence of 360 months'  imprison-ment for enticement of a minor to engage in  sexual activity and production of child pornography.  Crow asserts several issues on appeal, which we  address in turn. After review, 1 we affirm in part, and  vacate and remand for resentencing in part. I. DISCUSSION A. Grouping of Counts Crow contends the district court erred in failing to group  his counts together when calculating his guideline  range, because his counts involved substantially the  same harm under U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2. The Government  concedes error on this issue. Oﬀenses ""shall be grouped"" for guideline oﬀense level  calcu-lation purposes when they ""involve substantially  the same harm."" U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2. The Guidelines list  four circumstances where counts involve ""substantially  the same harm"": 1 When reviewing the district court's findings with  respect to Guidelines is-sues, we consider legal issues  de novo [*2] , factual findings for clear error, and the  court's application of the Guidelines to the facts with due  deference, which is akin to clear error review. United  States v. Rothenberg, 610 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir.  2010). In order to be clearly erroneous, the finding of the  district court must leave us with a ""definite and firm  conviction that a mistake has been committed."" Id.  (quotation marks omitted). USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 3 of 10 22-14267 Opinion of the Court 3 (a) When counts involve the same victim and the same  act or transaction. (b) When counts involve the same victim and two or  more acts or transactions connected by a common  criminal objective or constituting part of a common  scheme or plan. (c) When one of the counts embodies conduct that is  treated as a specific oﬀense characteristic in, or other  adjustment to, the guideline applicable to another of the  Page 2 of 4 counts. (d) When the oﬀense level is determined largely on the  basis of the total amount of harm or loss, the quantity of  a substance involved, or some other meas-ure of  aggregate harm, or if the oﬀense behavior is ongoing or  continuous in nature and the oﬀense guideline is written  to cover such behavior. Id. Subsection (d) specifically precludes the grouping of  a ""produc-tion of child pornography"" offense under that  subsection. Id. However, offenses need only meet the  criteria of one subsection of § 3D1.2 to qualify for  grouping [*3]  as ""substantially the same harm."" See id.  § 3D1.2(d) (""Exclusion of an offense from grouping  under this subsection does not necessarily preclude  grouping under an-other subsection""). The district court erred in failing to group Crow's counts.  See United States v. Nagel, 835 F.3d 1371, 1374 (11th  Cir. 2016) (re-viewing the district court's decisions  regarding grouping de novo). The conduct embodying  Crow's enticement offense was used to apply a specific  offense characteristic enhancement to his USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 4 of 10 4 Opinion of the Court 22-14267 production offense. Namely, Crow's production of child  pornog-raphy ""involved the use of a computer [to]  persuade, induce, en-tice, coerce, or facilitate the travel  of, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct, or to  otherwise solicit participation by a minor in such  conduct."" This enhancement placed Crow's counts  squarely within § 3D1.2(c), which requires grouping  ""[w]hen one of the counts embodies conduct that is  treated as a specific offense char-acteristic in . . .  another of the counts."" U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2(c). Thus, the  court erred in failing to group Crow's offenses, and we  vacate and remand for resentencing as to this issue. B. Pattern of Activity Enhancement Crow asserts the court [*4]  erred in applying a five-level  enhance-ment for a ""pattern of activity involving  prohibited sexual con-duct"" under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.5,  because the court sustained the pat-tern enhancement  on facts that were not suﬃciently proven at the  sentencing hearing. Under § 4B1.5, the district court applies a five-level  enhance-ment when the defendant engaged in a  ""pattern of activity involv-ing prohibited sexual conduct.""  U.S.S.G. § 4B1.5(b)(1). For pur-poses of § 4B1.5,  ""prohibited sexual conduct"" includes, among other  things, ""any oﬀense described in 18 U.S.C. §  2426(b)(1)(A) or (B)"" and ""the production of child  pornography."" U.S.S.G. § 4B1.5, comment. (n.4(A)). 2 It  does not include receipt or possession of 2Deferral to the Guidelines commentary is necessary  only if the text of the Guidelines is ambiguous. United  States v. Dupree, 57 F.4th 1269, 1275-77 (11th Cir.  2023) (en banc). USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 5 of 10 22-14267 Opinion of the Court 5 child pornography. Id. Section 2426(b)(1)(A) cross- references to oﬀenses contained in chapter 117, which  includes enticement of a minor under 18 U.S.C. §  2422(b). 18 U.S.C. § 2426(b)(1)(A). A defendant engaged in a ""pattern"" under § 4B1.5 if he  en-gaged in such conduct ""on at least two separate  occasions.""  Id.  §  4B1.5,  comment.  (n.4(B)(i)).  ""[R]epeated prohibited sexual con-duct with a single  victim may qualify as a 'pattern of activity' for purposes  of § 4B1.5(b)(1)."" United States v. Fox, 926 F.3d 1275,  1279 (11th Cir. 2019). But ""separate occasions""  requires [*5]   events  that  are  ""independent  and  distinguishable"" from one another. Id. at 1280.  Noncontinuous instances of prohibited sexual conduct  that occur on different days constitute ""separate  occasions."" United States v.Isaac, 987 F.3d 980, 994  (11th Cir. 2021). The Government did not put forth ""sufficient and  reliable"" evidence at the sentencing hearing in support  of any facts sustain-ing the pattern enhancement. See  United States v. Washington, 714 F.3d 1358, 1361 (11th  Cir. 2013) (""When the government seeks to apply an  enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines over a  de-fendant's factual objection, it has the burden of  introducing 'suffi-cient and reliable' evidence to prove  the necessary facts by a pre-ponderance of the  evidence.""). Because Crow made a factual ob-jection to  the enhancement, the record to be considered was lim- ited to Crow's factual proffer, which admitted to only a  single sex-ual encounter involving oral sex with Victim 1  on May 22, 2020. The Government's assertion of facts  at the sentencing hearing be-yond those contained in  the factual proffer, absent additional USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  Page 3 of 4 12/07/2023 Page: 6 of 10 6 Opinion of the Court 22-14267 supporting evidence, could not be relied upon by the  district court. See id. (""[A]bsent a stipulation or  agreement between the parties, [*6]  an attorney's  factual assertions at a sentencing hearing do not con- stitute evidence that a district court can rely on.""). The  district court stated the support for the enhancement  was provided ""based on what [Victim 1] said,""  suggesting that it relied upon every state-ment by or  about Victim 1 contained in the PSI when imposing the  enhancement, despite Crow's factual objections. The  court relied upon insufficiently proven evidence when it  sustained Crow's pat-tern enhancement based upon the  ""separation in time of the vari-ous relationships with  Victim 1."" However, the facts contained in Crow's factual proffer  are sufficient to sustain his pattern enhancement. See  United States v.Gill, 864 F.3d 1279, 1280 (11th Cir.  2017) (explaining we may affirm on any ground  supported by the record, regardless of whether the  district court considered or relied upon that ground  below). Crow concedes in his factual proffer that he  engaged in oral sex with Vic-tim 1 on May 22, 2020, and  that he produced child pornography when he filmed that  sexual encounter. He further concedes that at  unidentified points prior to his May 22 meeting with  Victim 1, Crow requested naked photos and videos from  Victim 1 and made plans with Victim 1 to meet and  engage in sexual [*7]  acts. Between his requests for  illicit images from Victim 1 and his formulation of plans  to meet up with Victim 1 for sex, Crow engaged in  entice-ment prohibited by 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), which  qualifies as ""prohib-ited sexual conduct"" under the  commentary to § 4B1.5. This con-duct occurred on a  different day than his production of child USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 7 of 10 22-14267 Opinion of the Court 7 pornography on May 22, constituting distinct, ""separate  occasions"" sufficient to establish a pattern under §  4B1.5. See Fox, 926 F.3d at 1279; Isaac, 987 F.3d at  994. Thus, while the district court sustained Crow's  enhancement  on  insufficiently  proven  factual  allegations, the existing and undisputed record supports  the enhancement on alternative grounds. Thus, we  affirm as to this issue. C. Distribution Enhancement Crow also argues the court erred in applying a two-level  en-hancement for ""distribution"" of child pornography  under U.S.S.G. § 2G2.1(b)(3), because his sending of a  video from his phone to Victim 1's phone did not  constitute ""distribution."" The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level  enhance-ment when a defendant ""knowingly engaged in  distribution""  of  child  pornography.  U.S.S.G.  §  2G2.1(b)(3). The commentary to the Guidelines  provides that: ""Distribution"" [*8]  means any act, including possession  with intent to distribute, production, transmission,  advertisement, and transportation, related to the transfer  of material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor.  Accordingly, distribution includes posting material  involving the sexual exploitation of a minor on a website  for public viewing but does not include the mere  solicitation of such material by a defendant. Id. § 2G2.1, comment. (n.1(A)). We have stated  ""distribute"" ordi-narily means ""to deliver, give out,  dispense, or disperse to others."" United States v.  Grzybowicz, 747 F.3d 1296, 1307 (11th Cir. 2014)  (holding a defendant did not engage in a ""distribution"" of  child USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 8 of 10 8 Opinion of the Court 22-14267 pornography under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a) when he sent  four images of child pornography from his cellphone to  his personal email ac-count, because the images were  not transferred ""to others""). More-over, distribution  impliedly involves ""deliver[y] to someone other than the  person who does the delivering."" Id. at 1307-08. The district court did not clearly err in imposing the  distri-bution  enhancement  under  §  2G2.1.  By  airdropping a video from his cell phone to Victim 1's cell  phone, Crow delivered, gave out, dispersed, or  dispensed that video to another. [*9]  See id. at 1307.  While Crow asserts Victim 1, presumably by virtue of  her inclusion in the video, does not constitute another  person to whom Crow could ""distribute"" the video, Crow  provides no argument or legal author-ity as to why  Victim 1 should not constitute an ""other"" for purposes of  determining whether he engaged in a distribution. Thus,  be-cause airdropping a video to another's cell phone is  Page 4 of 4 a ""deliver[y]"" to another, the court did not clearly err in  applying  a  two-level  en-hancement  for  Crow's  distribution. Accordingly, we aﬃrm as to this issue. D. Use of Computer Enhancement Crow asserts the court erred in applying a two-level en- hancement for ""use of a computer"" pursuant to U.S.S.G.  § 2G2.1(b)(6)(B), because an iPhone is not a  ""computer"" as in-tended in the Guidelines. Section 2G2.1 provides for a two-level enhancement  when, as part of a defendant's production of child  pornography, the of-fense involved: USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 9 of 10 22-14267 Opinion of the Court 9 the use of a computer or an interactive computer ser- vice to (i) persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facili-tate  the travel of, a minor to engage in sexually ex-plicit  conduct, or to otherwise solicit participation by [*10]  a  minor in such conduct; or (ii) solicit participation with a  minor in sexually explicit conduct . . . . U.S.S.G. § 2G2.1(b)(6). The Guidelines Commentary  cross-refer-ences to 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(1), which  defines ""computer"" as ""an electronic, magnetic, optical,  electrochemical, or other high speed data processing  device performing logical, arithmetic, or storage  functions."" 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(1) (cited in U.S.S.G. §  2G2.1, com-ment. (n.1)). We have previously held a  defendant's use of a cell phone constitutes the use of a  computer as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(1). United  States v. Mathis, 767 F.3d 1264, 1283 (11th Cir. 2014),  abrogated on other grounds by Lockhart v. United  States, 577 U.S. 347 (2016)). The court did not clearly err in applying a two-level  enhance-ment for ""use of a computer."" Crow's iPhone  possessed much of the functionality of a typical  computer, and he used it as such: send-ing and  receiving messages over the internet, booking a hotel  room, and filming and distributing a video. Thus, Crow's  use of an iPhone falls within the unambiguous, plain  reading of ""use of a computer"" as it appears in §  2G2.1(b)(6). Accordingly, we aﬃrm as to this issue. E. Downward variance Crow lastly argues the court abused its discretion in  denying a downward variance, because the facts and  circumstances of his USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 10 of 10 10 Opinion of the Court 22-14267 case place [*11]  it outside the heartland of cases for  which the Sentencing Guidelines were intended to  apply. Because our vacatur and re-mand of Crow's  sentence under Issue I will result in a new sentenc-ing  hearing under a new Guidelines range, we do not  address the merits of the district court's denial of a  downward variance."
"United States v. Cutler, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 32169.pdf","KOBES, Circuit Judge. Jordan Cutler pleaded guilty to distributing child  pornography, 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2). The district court  varied up from a Guidelines range of 108 to 135 months  and sentenced him to 180 months in prison. Cutler  argues that the court procedurally erred in calculating  the Guidelines range and that his sentence is  substantively unreasonable. We affirm. I. Cutler says that the district court erred by assessing one  criminal history point under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(c) for a set  of uncounseled Arkansas misdemeanors from 2010.  See United States v. Luscombe, 950 F.3d 1021, 1031  (8th Cir. 2020) (HN1[ ] ""[Significant procedural] errors  include . . . incorrectly calculating[] the Guidelines range  . . . .""). ""In reviewing a sentence for significant  procedural error, we review the district court's factual  findings for clear error and application of the [*2]   Guidelines de novo."" Id. (cleaned up) (citation omitted).  And ""we may affirm on any ground supported by the  record."" United States v. Garrido, 995 F.2d 808, 813  (8th Cir. 1993). The 2010 misdemeanors included one count of criminal  trespass, two counts of criminal mischief, and one count  of theft of property. Cutler was ordered to pay fines and  costs for each count, and he received a 30-day    Page 3 of 4 suspended prison sentence. Cutler testified that he  never received counsel and never waived his right to it.  Though the district court believed him, it still gave him  the point. That point made the difference between a  criminal history category of I and II, raising his  Guidelines range from 97-121 months to 108-135  months. HN2[ ]  The  Sixth  Amendment  guarantees  a  misdemeanor defendant's right to counsel where he  receives a suspended prison sentence. Alabama v.  Shelton, 535 U.S. 654, 662, 674, 122 S. Ct. 1764, 152  L. Ed. 2d 888 (2002). All agree on appeal that Cutler  had this right, did not waive it, and was not represented.  But the parties disagree about the consequences of the  constitutional deprivation. Cutler says that it tainted the  convictions, so the court could not use any of them to  assess a criminal history point. The Government argues  that it only invalidated the unconstitutional sentence; the  convictions with associated fines survive and support a  criminal [*3]  history point. Our precedent is clear: the constitutional deprivation  invalidates only Cutler's suspended prison sentence.  United States v. White, 529 F.2d 1390, 1394 (8th Cir.  1976) (vacating invalid suspended prison sentence for  an  uncounseled  misdemeanor  but  affirming  the  conviction  with  associated  fines).  The  2010  misdemeanor convictions remain intact with the  associated fines. Cf. Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367, 373- 74, 99 S. Ct. 1158, 59 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1979) (holding a  penalty of fines with no prison term imposed for an  uncounseled misdemeanor does not implicate the Sixth  Amendment right to counsel). HN3[ ] And uncounseled  misdemeanor convictions with fines, ""valid under Scott  because no prison term was imposed, [are] also valid  when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent  conviction."" Nichols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738, 748- 49, 114 S. Ct. 1921, 128 L. Ed. 2d 745 (1994). Although the district court could not consider Cutler's  invalid suspended prison sentence in its criminal history  calculation, it could consider the constitutionally valid  fines that he received for his criminal mischief and theft         of property convictions. See United States v. Long, No.  97-1440, 1997 WL 375191, at *1 (8th Cir. July 9, 1997)  (per  curiam)  (assuming  without  deciding  that  misdemeanor defendant's conviction resulting in a  suspended prison sentence was uncounseled and  concluding  that  his  ""probationary  sentence  and  monetary fine provided a basis for assessing the  criminal history point""); United States v. Acuna-Reyna,  677 F.3d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir. 2012) (affirming use of  ""constitutionally [*4]  valid portion of a sentence"" in  calculating criminal history); United States v. Jackson,  493 F.3d 1179, 1183 (10th Cir. 2007) (Gorsuch, J.)  (same); United States v. Ortega, 94 F.3d 764, 769 (2d  Cir. 1996) (same). These sentences support the district  court's  one-point  assessment  for  Cutler's  2010  misdemeanors, so we find no procedural error. II. HN4[ ]  Cutler  also  challenges  the  substantive  reasonableness of his above-Guidelines sentence,  which we review under a ""deferential abuse-of- discretion standard."" United States v. Feemster, 572  F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir. 2009) (en banc) (citation  omitted). A district court abuses its discretion if it ""fails to  consider a relevant factor that should have received  significant weight, gives significant weight to an  improper or irrelevant factor, or considers only  appropriate factors but nevertheless commits a clear  error of judgment by arriving at a sentence that lies  outside the limited range of choice dictated by the facts  of the case."" United States v. Fiorito, 640 F.3d 338, 352  (8th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). It is ""the unusual case  when we reverse a district court sentence—whether  within, above, or below the applicable Guidelines  range—as substantively unreasonable."" Feemster, 572  F.3d at 464. Cutler argues that the district court abused its discretion  by focusing on offense conduct that the Guidelines  already  captured  in  his  offense  characteristic  enhancements. See U.S.S.G. § 2G2.1(b). But the court  found that the Guidelines [*5]  did not reflect the           Page 4 of 4 ""heinous"" nature of Cutler's offense. They did not  capture Cutler's threats to kidnap, rape, torture, and kill  young girls—including a five-year-old. Nor did they show  that he conditioned those threats on his victims  documenting sex acts on themselves and other minors.  Cutler's sentencing enhancements told a story, just not  the whole one. The court was free to consider the whole  story in weighing the § 3553(a) factors and varying up.  See Fiorito, 640 F.3d at 352 (HN5[ ] ""[A] district court  may impose an upward variance based on facts already  included in the advisory sentencing guidelines where  the advisory guidelines do not fully account for those  facts.""). Cutler also says that the district court abused its  discretion by considering its reputation and public  perception, which he says is an improper factor. The  court posed a hypothetical: ""If I'm sitting in the barber  shop talking to the fellows, and I tell them somebody  went into Court and here's all of the stuff he did and he  got ten years, what would the average guy sitting on the  park bench in the barbershop say? They would say,  there is no justice in this world."" Cutler claims that this  comment shows that the court succumbed to ""peer  pressure"" when [*6]  it varied up. We don't think so. The  court was wrestling with ""the need for the sentence  imposed . . . to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to  promote respect for the law, and to provide just  punishment for the offense."" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A).  It found that no one—not the court, the public (that  ""average guy"" in the barbershop), nor even Cutler— would find the Guidelines reasonable in this case. This  was not an abuse of discretion. III. The district court's judgment is affirmed."
"United States v. Friend, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 32368.pdf","[*1] Appeal from the United States District Court for the  Eastern District of Virginia, at Norfolk. John A. Gibney,  Jr., Senior District Judge. (2:22-cr-00042-JAG-RJK-1) Submitted: November 30, 2023 Decided: December 7,  2023 Before WILKINSON and HARRIS, Circuit Judges, and  TRAXLER, Senior Circuit Judge. Vacated and remanded by unpublished per curiam  opinion. ON BRIEF: Geremy C. Kamens, Federal Public  Defender, Frances H. Pratt, Assistant Federal Public  Defender, Keith Loren Kimball, Assistant Federal Public  Defender, OFFICE OF THE FEDERAL PUBLIC  DEFENDER,  Alexandria,  Virginia,  for  Appellant.  Jacqueline Romy Bechara, Alexandria, Virginia, Emily  Rebecca Gantt, OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES  ATTORNEY, Norfolk, Virginia, for Appellee. Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this  circuit. PER CURIAM: Christafer Douglas Friend seeks to appeal the life  sentence imposed following his guilty plea, pursuant to  a written plea agreement, to attempted sex trafficking of  a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 1591(a)(1),  (b)(1). The district court additionally imposed a lifetime  term  of  supervised  release.  Friend  raises  two  challenges on appeal. First, he contends that his life  sentence  is  substantively  and  procedurally  unreasonable. [*2]  Second, he argues that the district  court reversibly erred by including a discretionary  condition of supervised release (the ""special computer  condition"") * in the written judgment that it did not orally  pronounce at sentencing. Friend contends that this error  requires us to vacate his sentence and remand for  resentencing. Invoking the waiver of appeal rights contained in the  plea agreement, the Government has moved to dismiss  the appeal to the extent Friend challenges the  reasonableness of his sentence. The Government also  moves to vacate, in part. It acknowledges the district  court's error in failing to pronounce the special computer  condition and concedes that this argument is not barred  by the appeal waiver. However, the Government argues  that, for various reasons, a full resentencing is  inappropriate. * This condition mandates that Friend shall not own or have a computer in his residence or  place of employment. Also, the defendant shall not use  a computer to access any online computer services in  any location, including employment, without the prior  approval of the probation officer. This includes any  Page 2 of 2 internet service provider bulletin board systems, or any  other public or private [*3]  computer network. (J.A. 154). ""J.A."" refers to the joint appendix filed by the  parties in this appeal. 2 A district court is required to orally pronounce at  sentencing all discretionary conditions of supervised  release. United States v. Rogers, 961 F.3d 291, 296  (4th Cir. 2020); see also United States v. Singletary  (Singletary I), 984 F.3d 341, 345 (4th Cir. 2021). This  requirement ""is a critical part of the defendant's right to  be present at sentencing,"" Rogers, 961 F.3d at 300 (internal quotation marks  omitted), and ensures the defendant has an opportunity  to challenge unwarranted conditions before they are  imposed, id. at 298. The usual remedy for a  Rogers/Singletary error is to vacate the sentence and  remand for a full resentencing. See Singletary I, 984  F.3d at 346 & n.4. The Government argues that, in light of Friend's life  sentence, a full resentencing is unwarranted because  Friend ""likely will never be subject to the challenged  condition."" The Government therefore suggests that the  appropriate remedy is either simply to vacate the special  computer condition, or to vacate the condition and  remand for resentencing on that condition only.  However, ""defendants with valid Singletary claims are  entitled to a full vacatur of their sentences and remand  for resentencing."" United States v. Singletary (Singletary II), 75 F.4th 416, 427 n.7 (4th Cir. 2023)  (noting, however, that defendants raising such claims  can ""elect to request a narrower [*4]  remedy, in the  form of a limited remand on only the challenged  conditions""). Friend does not request a narrower  remedy. Although the Government attempts to distinguish these  cases, we find the Government's arguments for  departing from our established precedent unpersuasive.  We have recognized that ""custodial and supervised  release terms [are] components of one unified  sentence."" United States v. Ketter, 908 F.3d 61, 65 (4th  Cir. 2018); see SingletaryI, 984 F.3d at 346 & n.4  (rejecting suggestion to ""simply . . . strike"" challenged  conditions 3 from written judgment and reiterating that ""Rogers drew  no distinction between the defendant's supervised  release  sentence  and  his  custodial  sentence"").  Accordingly, we find that the usual remedy for a Rogers  error is appropriate in this case. Because this ""leaves us  with no occasion to reach [Friend's] other arguments,""  Singletary I, 984 F.3d at 346, we deny the Government's  motion. We therefore vacate Friend's sentence and remand for  resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because  the facts and legal contentions are adequately  presented in the materials before this court and  argument would not aid the decisional process.

"United States v. Gil, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217887.pdf","[*1] Jason M. Frierson, United States Attorney and  Thomas W. Flynn, Trial Attorney, Tax  Division, as counsel for the United States of America,  and George P. Kelesis and Sunethra Muralidhara, as counsel for the defendant, Raul Gil, hereby stipulate  that the Plea Agreement for Defendant Raul Gil Pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(A) and (B) [ECF 7]  (""Plea Agreement"") filed in the above-entitled action on August 2, 2022, be amended to incorporate an  amendment to the federal sentencing guidelines that became effective November 1, 2023 and which will  be in effect at the time set for sentencing in this matter. This Stipulation is entered into for the following reasons:  1. On August 2, 2022 Defendant Raul Gil appeared  before the court and entered a plea  of guilty to a single count of tax evasion pursuant to 26  U.S.C. § 7201 as more fully set forth in the Criminal Information filed that same date [ECF 5] and  the contemporaneously filed Plea Agreement [ECF 7]. 2. The Plea Agreement including a number of stipulated  sentencing factors for the   court's consideration, including an acknowledgment  that ""[t]he District Court will determine   defendant's  criminal  history  category  under  the  sentencing guidelines.""  3. In April 2023, the U.S. Sentencing Commission [*2]   promulgated amendments,  including Amendment 821 to the federal sentencing  guidelines, which became effective November 1, 2023. 4. Part B of Amendment 821 creates a new section to  the guideline manual which  reads in pertinent part:  §4C1.1. Adjustment for Certain Zero-Point Offenders (a)Adjustment.- If the defendant meets all of the  following criteria: (1) the defendant did not receive any criminal history  Page 2 of 4 points from Chapter Four, Part A; (2) the defendant did not receive an adjustment under  §3A1.4 (Terrorism); (3) the defendant did not use violence or credible  threats of violence in connection with the offense; (4) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily  injury; (5) the instant offense of conviction is not a sex offense; (6) the defendant did not personally cause substantial  financial hardship; (7) the defendant did not possess, receive, purchase,  transport, transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of a firearm or other dangerous  weapon (or induce another participant to do so) in connection with the offense; (8) the instant offense of conviction is not covered by  §2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights); (9) the defendant did not receive an adjustment under  §3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable  Victim)  or  §3A1.5  (Serious  Human  Rights [*3]  Offense); and (10) the defendant did not receive an adjustment under  §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise, as  defined in 21 U.S.C. § 848; decrease the offense level determined under Chapters  Two and Three by 2 levels. 4. Defendant Gil has no prior criminal history and meets  all criteria for application of  the  2-level  adjustment  under  the  foregoing  recommended amendment.  5. Accordingly, the parties stipulate that Section VII  (Sentencing Factors), paragraphs  15 and 16, and Section VIII (Positions Regarding  Sentencing), paragraph 18, be amended to incorporate the provisions of the Amendment 821 to the Guidelines  Manual that will be effective at the time of sentencing as follows: VII. SENTENCING FACTORS   * * *  15. Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility: Under  USSG § 3E1.1(a), the United   States will recommend that defendant receive a two- level downward adjustment for   acceptance of responsibility unless defendant (a) fails  to truthfully admit facts  establishing a factual basis for the guilty plea when  defendant enters the plea; (b) fails  to truthfully admit facts establishing the amount of  restitution owed when defendant   enters the guilty plea; (c) provides false or misleading  information to [*4]  the United  States, the Court, Pretrial Services, or the Probation  Office; (d) denies involvement  in the offense or provides conflicting statements  regarding defendant's involvement   or falsely denies or frivolously contests conduct  relevant to the offense; (e) attempts  to withdraw defendant's guilty plea; (f) commits or  attempts to commit any crime;  (g) fails to appear in court; or (h) violates the conditions  of pretrial release.  Under USSG § 3E1.1(b), if the District Court determines  that defendant's total  offense level before operation of § 3E1.1(a) is 16 or  Page 3 of 4 higher, and if the United States   recommends  a  two-level  downward  adjustment  pursuant to the preceding paragraph,   the United States will move for an additional one-level  downward adjustment for  acceptance of responsibility before sentencing because  defendant communicated  defendant's decision to plead guilty in a timely manner  that enabled the United States   to avoid preparing for trial and to efficiently allocate its  resources. The United States  anticipates recommending a three-level reduction  pursuant to USSG §§3E1.1(a) and  (b).  16. Criminal History Category. Defendant acknowledges  that the District  Court may base defendant's sentence in part on  defendant's criminal [*5]  record or   criminal history. Assuming that Defendant has zero  points for his criminal history  category and is a ""zero-point offender"" under the criteria  established by section  §4C1.1. in Amendment 821, the total applicable offense  level in this matter is 21. A   total offense level of 21 results in a guideline range of  37-46 months.  VIII. POSITIONS REGARDING SENTENCING  18. The parties will jointly recommend that the District  Court impose a sentence   of 37 months' imprisonment. The parties agree that a  sentence of 37 months is  sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with  the purposes of 18 U.S.C. §  3553. The parties also agree that a term of supervised  release of three years is   appropriate, and that given the amount of mandatory  restitution to be paid by  Defendant, a fine is not necessary.  The parties acknowledge and agree that all other terms,  conditions, obligations, rights and  responsibilities set forth in the August 2, 2022 Plea  Agreement [ECF 7] shall remain in effect.   The parties represent this stipulation is made in good  faith for the purpose of promoting the   ends of justice.   DATED this 6th day of December 2023.  COOK & KELESIS, LTD.

"United States v. Mahee, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216654.pdf","OPINION AND ORDER The Court issues this written opinion and order to further  explain its oral ruling made during Richard Mahee's  sentencing on November 28, 2023, which concluded  that Mahee was not entitled to a ""zero point offender""  downward adjustment under § 4C1.1 of the United  States Sentencing Guidelines. I. Legal Issue Section 4C1.1 of the United States Sentencing  Guidelines (USSG or Guidelines) became effective on  November 1, 2023. It provides in relevant part: (a) ADJUSTMENT.—If the defendant meets all of  the following criteria: . . . . (10) the defendant did not receive an  adjustment under § 3B1.1 (Aggravating Role)  and was not engaged in a continuing criminal  enterprise, as defined in 21 U.S.C. § 848; decrease the offense level determined under  Chapters Two and Three by 2 levels. USSG § 4C1.1 (emphasis added) (the Zero-Point  Offender Adjustment). The parties disagreed on whether  Mahee was entitled to the Zero-Point Offender  Adjustment. [*2]  The Court concluded that he was not. II. Background Mahee and nine others were indicted in December 2021  on various charges related to a scheme to improperly  obtain loans through the federal Paycheck Protection  Program (PPP). On February 8, 2023, Mahee pleaded  guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud as charged in  Count 1 of the indictment. At sentencing, the Court  determined, without any objection from the parties, that  Mahee was subject to a 4-level aggravating role  enhancement under § 3B1.1 of the Guidelines. That  Guideline provides for an increase in the offense level if  the defendant served as an organizer or leader of  criminal activity involving at least five participants (the  Aggravating Role Adjustment).             Page 2 of 4 In its sentencing memorandum and during the  sentencing hearing, the Government objected to the  application of the Zero-Point Offender Adjustment on  the basis that Mahee was ineligible for it given the  Court's application of the Aggravating Role Adjustment.  Specifically, the Government argued that a defendant  could not be eligible for the Zero-Point Offender  Adjustment unless he satisfied both elements in §  4C1.1(a)(10)—meaning a defendant who received  either an Aggravating Role Adjustment or was engaged  in a continuing [*3]  criminal enterprise was disqualified. Mahee advocated for application of the Zero-Point  Offender Adjustment notwithstanding the aggravating  role finding, contending that the word ""and"" in USSG §  4C1.1(a)(10) ""should be taken literally as it reads,"" and  relying on United States v. Garcon, 54 F.4th 1274 (11th  Cir. 2022) (en banc). In short, Mahee's argument was  that because he was only subject to the Aggravating  Role Adjustment and was not engaged in a continuing  criminal enterprise (CCE), he was eligible for the  reduction. III. Discussion The Court begins and ends its analysis with the text of §  4C1.1(a), which is unambiguous. A defendant is only  entitled to the Zero-Point Offender Adjustment in §  4C1.1(a) if he meets every criterion listed in  subsections (1) through (10): ""If the defendant meets all  of the following . . . ."" USSG § 4C1.1(a) (emphasis  added). Those criteria are described in the negative— identifying things that the defendant cannot have done  and that the offense cannot have involved in order for  the downward adjustment to apply: (1) the defendant did not receive any criminal  history points from Chapter Four, Part A; (2)  the  defendant  did  not  receive  an  adjustment under §3A1.4 (Terrorism); (3) the defendant did not use violence or  credible threats of violence in connection with  the offense;     (4) the offense did not [*4]  result in death or  serious bodily injury; (5) the instant offense of conviction is not a  sex offense; (6) the defendant did not personally cause  substantial financial hardship; (7) the defendant did not possess, receive,  purchase, transport, transfer, sell, or otherwise  dispose of a firearm or other dangerous  weapon (or induce another participant to do so)  in connection with the offense; (8) the instant offense of conviction is not  covered  by  §2H1.1  (Offenses  Involving  Individual Rights); (9)  the  defendant  did  not  receive  an  adjustment  under  §3A1.1  (Hate  Crime  Motivation or Vulnerable Victim) or §3A1.5  (Serious Human Rights Offense); and (10) the defendant did not receive an  adjustment under §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role)  and was not engaged in a continuing criminal  enterprise, as defined in 21 U.S.C. § 848; decrease the offense level determined under  Chapters Two and Three by 2 levels. Id. (emphasis added). Reading the full context makes clear that the Zero-Point  Offender Adjustment can only apply when the defendant  has not done any of the things listed. If a defendant (or  the crime) meets just one of the listed factors, the  adjustment is not available. To be eligible, then, Mahee  cannot  have  received  an  Aggravating  Role  Adjustment. [*5]  He cannot have been engaged in a  CCE. The crime of which he was convicted cannot have  been a sex offense. He cannot have used violence in  the commission of the crime. And so on. Since he  conceded he was subject to the Aggravating Role  Adjustment and the Court applied it, Mahee is not  eligible for the Zero-Point Offender Adjustment. Mahee's read of § 4C1.1(a) would treat ""and"" in  subsection (10) to mean ""but."" His argument was that  he is entitled to the downward adjustment because he  did not both (1) receive an Aggravating Role Adjustment  and (2) engage in a CCE. As two appellate courts have  concluded in interpreting a very similar restriction,  however, Mahee's argument would only be correct if the  provision ""were phrased in terms of what the  Page 3 of 4 government would have to prove was true of the  defendant, but . . . the statute is phrased in terms of  what the defendant must show was not true of him.""  United States v. Draheim, 958 F.3d 651, 657 (7th Cir.  2020) (emphasis in original) (quoting United States v.  Bazel, 80 F.3d 1140, 1143 (6th Cir. 1996)). In Bazel, the Sixth Circuit interpreted use of the word  ""and"" in the safety-valve provision of the First Step Act,  18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(4), and corresponding Guideline, §  5C1.2. 80 F.3d 1140. The relevant language in Bazel is  effectively the same as that at issue here. Specifically, §  3553(f) provides: [T]he court shall impose a sentence . . . without  regard [*6]  to any statutory minimum sentence, if  the court finds at sentencing . . . that— . . . (4) the defendant was not an organizer, leader,  manager, or supervisor of others in the offense,  as determined under the sentencing guidelines  and was not engaged in a continuing criminal  enterprise, as defined in section 408 of the  Controlled Substances Act . . . . (Emphasis added.) Similar to the situation here, Bazel had not been found  to have participated in a CCE but did have an  aggravating role. Id. at 1141. Bazel made the same  argument that Mahee did—asserting the safety valve  should be applied because he was not both (1) a leader  in the offense and (2) engaged in a CCE. Id. at 1142.  The appellate court rejected that argument: Section 3553(f) and § 5C1.2 thus require the court  to make a finding both that the defendant was not  an ""organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor"" and  that the defendant was not engaged in a CCE in  order to open the ""safety valve."" Once the district  court determined that Bazel was an ""organizer,  leader, manager, or supervisor,"" it could not make  one of the findings necessary to opening the ""safety  valve."" Id. (emphasis in original). In rejecting the same type of  argument by the defendant in Draheim, the Seventh  Circuit adopted Bazel's reasoning. 958 F.3d 651. Mahee nevertheless contended [*7]  that the Court  should rely on the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in Garcon.    There, the court addressed the meaning of the word  ""and"" in a different subsection of the safety-valve  provision—§ 3553(f)(1). That section provides that the  defendant is eligible for the safety valve if he does not  have ""(A) more than 4 criminal history points . . .; (B) a  prior 3-point offense . . .; and (C) a prior 2-point violent  offense."" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1)(C) (emphasis added).  The Eleventh Circuit held that ""and"" really means  ""and""—i.e., the safety valve can be applied to the  defendant unless he meets (A), (B), and (C). This  makes sense given the structure of the provision. As  Garcon concluded, ""when 'and' is used to connect a list  of requirements, the word ordinarily has a 'conjunctive'  sense, meaning that all the requirements must be met.""  54 F.4th at 1278 (citing United States v. Palomar- Santiago,     U.S.    , 141 S. Ct. 1615, 1620-21, 209 L.  Ed. 2d 703 (2021)). Mahee argued that the Court should apply the same  logic to its interpretation of subsection (10) of the Zero- Point Offender Adjustment. But this ignores the  difference in structure between § 3553(f)(1) and USSG  § 4C1.1(a)(10). Subsections (A), (B), and (C) in §  3553(f)(1) list one set of factors, only the full set of  which will disqualify the defendant from safety-valve  consideration. By contrast, subsection (10) of § 4C1.1  (as does § 3553(f)(4)) identifies two separate role  adjustments the defendant must avoid to be eligible [*8]   for the Zero-Point Offender Adjustment. Section  4C1.1(a)(10) can only be properly read as allowing  application of that adjustment if the defendant ""did not  receive"" an Aggravating Role Adjustment and the  defendant ""was not engaged in"" a CCE. As the Bazel court explained, a defendant cannot  successfully argue that he must meet all of the  requirements in each subsection of § 3553(f)(1) through  (5), but that he need not meet ""the separate  requirements of the two portions of § 3553(f)(4)  separated by the word 'and.'"" 80 F.3d at 1144. Similarly  here, Mahee could not demonstrate entitlement to the  Zero-Point Offender Adjustment by arguing that he met  all of the requirements of subsections (1) through (9) but  only one of two parts contained in § 4C1.1(a)(10) that  are separated by the word ""and."""
"United States v. Munne, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216877.pdf","Order Denying Motion for Sentence Reduction This matter is before the Court on the Defendant  Thomas Munne's motion for reduction of sentence  pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). (Mot., ECF No. 97.)  The Government has responded opposing Munne's  motion. (Resp., ECF No. 99.) Munne has not replied,  and the time to do so has passed. After careful  consideration of the parties' written submissions, the  record, and the legal authorities, the Court denies  Munne's motion for reduction of sentence. (Mot., ECF  No. 97.) 1. Background On May 3, 2022, a federal grand jury indicted Munne  with conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery (Count  One), aiding and abetting Hobbs Act robbery (Count  Two), and carjacking (Count Three). (ECF No. 1.) In  October 2022, Munne proceeded to trial. On October  13, 2022, the jury convicted Munne of conspiracy to  commit [*2]  Hobbs Act robbery (Count One) and aiding  and abetting Hobbs Act robbery (Count Two), and  acquitted Munne of carjacking (Count Three). (ECF No.  58.) Ahead of Munne's sentencing, the United States  Probation Office prepared a Presentence Investigation  Report (""PSI""). After considering Munne's objections to  the PSI, the Court ultimately determined that Munne had  a total offense level of 35, a criminal history category of  I, and an advisory guideline range of 168-210 months.  (See Sentencing Tr. 8-9, ECF No. 85.) On January 3,  2023, the Court sentenced Munne to 168 months in  prison, followed by three years of supervised release.  (J. 2-3, ECF No. 75.) As of the filing of his motion,  Munne had served about 13% of his sentence. Since Munne was sentenced, the United States  Sentencing  Commission  issued  a  sentencing  adjustment for certain zero-point offenders, which  provides, in relevant part, for ""a decrease of two levels  from the offense level . . . for offenders who did not  receive any criminal history points . . . and whose  instant offense did not involve specified aggravating  factors""  (""Amendment  821"").  Munne  now  seeks  retroactive application of Amendment 821 to the Court's  judgment sentencing him to 168 months in prison [*3]   and three years of supervised release. 2. Legal Standard ""[A] motion to modify an otherwise final judgment  pursuant to § 3582(c)(2) is a limited and narrow  exception to the rule that final judgments are not to be  modified."" United States v. Armstrong, 347 F.3d 905,  Page 2 of 3 909 (11th Cir. 2003) (cleaned up). Specifically, §  3582(c)(2) provides: [I]n the case of a defendant who has been  sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a  sentencing range that has subsequently been  lowered by the Sentencing Commission . . ., the  court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after  considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a)  to the extent that they are applicable, if such a  reduction is consistent with applicable policy  statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. § 3582 (emphasis added). Thus, under §  3582(c)(2), the Court must undertake a two-step  process to determine whether a final sentence should  be modified based on a sentencing range that has been  lowered by the Sentencing Commission. First, the Court must determine if a retroactive  amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines indeed  lowered a defendant's guidelines range and whether a  reduction is consistent with the applicable policy  statements. Second, the Court must consider the §  3553(a) factors to determine if it will exercise its  discretion to reduce that defendant's [*4]  sentence. Among other things, the Sentencing Commission policy  statement applicable here provides that a court ""shall  not reduce the defendant's term of imprisonment under  18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) . . . to a term that is less than the  minimum of the amended guideline range[.]"" U.S.S.G. §  1B1.10(b)(2)(A). In addition, although Amendment 821  went into effect on November 1, 2023, the policy  statement ""delays the effective date of orders reducing a  defendant's term of imprisonment to a date no earlier  than February 1, 2024."" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10 cmt. n. 7. In  other words, if a defendant is scheduled for release  before February 1, 2024, he is not entitled to relief under  Amendment 821. Finally, the § 3553(a) factors are: (1) the nature and  circumstances of the offense and the history and  characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the  sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the  offense, promote respect for the law, provide just  punishment for the offense, afford adequate deterrence  to criminal conduct, protect the public from further  crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with  needed educational or vocational training, medical care,  or other correctional treatment in the most effective  manner; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the  applicable sentencing guidelines range; [*5]  (5) any  pertinent policy statement; (6) the need to avoid  unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants  with similar records who have been found guilty of  similar conduct; and (7) the need to provide restitution to  any victims of the offense. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). 3. Analysis A. The Court lacks jurisdiction to rule on Munne's  motion. On January 13, 2023, Munne filed a notice of appeal to  the Eleventh Circuit from the jury's October 13, 2022,  verdict and the Court's January 3, 2023, judgment. (ECF  No. 76.) Munne's appeal, which involves various  aspects of his case, including his sentence generally, is  currently  pending.  Accordingly,  the  Court  lacks  jurisdiction to rule on Munne's motion. As the Eleventh  Circuit has unequivocally explained, ""the filing of an  appeal of virtually any sort acts to freeze all proceedings  in the district court pending resolution of the appeal.""  Shewchun v. United States, 797 F.2d 941, 942 (11th  Cir. 1986). Notably, Munne admits that the Court lacks  jurisdiction to grant him a sentence reduction at this  time, clarifying in his motion that ""due to the Court's lack  of jurisdiction in this matter due to the pending appeal,  th[e] [m]otion is being filed to preserve th[e] issue[.]""  (See Mot. 3, ECF No. 97.) Thus, the Court denies  Munne's [*6]  motion because it does not have  jurisdiction to grant Munne's requested relief or  otherwise modify his sentence while the appeal is  pending. B. Munne is not eligible for a sentence reduction. Even if the Court had jurisdiction to grant Munne's  request for a sentence reduction, however, it would not  do so, as Munne does not meet all the necessary  criteria. As noted, the retroactive amendment that  Munne  invokes  here  is  Amendment  821—the  adjustment for certain zero-point offenders. See  U.S.S.G. § 4C1.1. Pursuant to Amendment 821, a  defendant is eligible for a two-level reduction in his  offense level, if he meets all the following criteria: (1) the defendant did not receive any criminal  history points from Chapter Four, Part A; (2) the defendant did not receive an adjustment  under §3A1.4 (Terrorism); (3) the defendant did not use violence or credible  threats of violence in connection with the offense; (4) the offense did not result in death or serious  Page 3 of 3 bodily injury; (5) the instant offense of conviction is not a sex  offense; (6) the defendant did not personally cause  substantial financial hardship; (7) the defendant did not possess, receive,  purchase, transport, transfer, sell, or otherwise  dispose of a firearm or other dangerous weapon  (or [*7]  induce another participant to do so) in  connection with the offense; (8) the instant offense of conviction is not covered  by §2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights); (9) the defendant did not receive an adjustment  under §3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable  Victim) or §3A1.5 (Serious Human Rights Offense);  and (10) the defendant did not receive an adjustment  under §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) and was not  engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise, as  defined in 21 U.S.C. § 848[.] See id. Here, Munne plainly fails to meet requirement number  seven—i.e., that he ""did not possess, receive, purchase,  transport, transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of a  firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another  participant to do so) in connection with the offense[.]""  See  id.  The  evidence  developed  at  trial,  as  acknowledged by the Court at sentencing, establishes  that Munne clearly planned for and induced his co- conspirator to obtain a gun to carry out the armed  abduction and robbery which forms that factual basis for  Munne's criminal case. (See Trial Trs., ECF Nos. 81,  82.) Indeed, Munne's co-conspirator specifically testified  at trial that they ""discussed the fact that [he] w[as] going  to bring a gun"" to commit the crime and [*8]  that Munne  ""told [him] to get a gun from somebody else."" (See Oct.  12, 2023, Trial Tr. 46, ECF No. 82.) In addition, at  sentencing, the Court specifically noted that Munne's  ""coconspirator possessed a firearm, and the trial  testimony showed that [Munne] was aware of the  firearm."" (See Sentencing Tr. 8, ECF No. 85.) Thus,  because Munne plainly does not satisfy all the requisite  criteria for a two-level reduction in his offense level, his  motion must be denied. Moreover, because Munne does not qualify for a  reduction pursuant to Amendment 821, the Court  declines to reach the second step of the analysis to  consider the § 3553(a) factors."
"United States v. Nichols, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081.pdf",
"United States v. Paul, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72619.pdf","MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER I. INTRODUCTION This matter is before the undersigned United States District Judge for a ruling on Defendant Lee Andrew Paul's  (""Paul"") Motion Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence [Docket No. 203] (the ""§ 2255  Page 2 of 7 Motion""). Paul has also filed a letter [Docket No. 220] requesting a sentence reduction. For the reasons set forth  below, Paul's § 2255 Motion and request for a reduced sentence are denied. II. BACKGROUND On December 11, 2015, a jury returned a verdict finding Paul guilty of three counts of commercial sex trafficking in  violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Jury Verdict [Docket No. 98]. Paul's convictions arose from the sex trafficking of  two girls, ages 12 and 16, and a 19 year old woman. In Counts I and II, the jury found Paul trafficked the minor girls.  Id. In all three Counts, the jury found Paul used force, fraud or coercion in furtherance of his crimes. Id. Paul was  sentenced to a prison term of 396 months on each of Counts I, II, and III, to be served concurrently. [*2]   Sentencing J. [Docket No. 147] at 2; Sentencing Tr. [Docket No. 169] at 46. Paul appealed his conviction, arguing: 1) the evidence was insufficient to support each count of conviction; 2) each  count in the superseding indictment contained multiple crimes and was therefore duplicitous; and 3) the district  court's jury instructions defining ""coercion"" and ""fraud"" rendered § 1591(a) void for vagueness as applied. United  States v. Paul, 885 F.3d 1099 (8th Cir. 2018). On March 22, 2018, the Eighth Circuit affirmed Paul's conviction. Id.  at 1101. The Supreme Court denied Paul's writ of certiorari on October 1, 2018. See Paul v. United States, 139 S.  Ct. 290, 202 L. Ed. 2d 190 (2018). Paul then filed this § 2255 Motion. He asserts ineffective assistance of counsel claims against his trial counsel,  Michael Colich, and his appellate counsel, Virginia Villa. Paul also argues that the Government failed to establish  the requisite knowledge for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1591. In addition to the § 2255 Motion, Paul requests  that his sentence be reduced because he has rehabilitated himself while in prison and desires to assist his family  during the COVID-19 pandemic. III. DISCUSSION A. Legal Standard Persons in federal custody are provided a limited opportunity to collaterally attack the constitutionality, jurisdictional  basis, or legality of their sentence [*3]  under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. See United States v. Addonizio, 442 U.S. 178, 185,  99 S. Ct. 2235, 60 L. Ed. 2d 805 (1979). ""Relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is reserved for transgressions of  constitutional rights and for a narrow range of injuries that could not have been raised on direct appeal, and if  uncorrected, would result in a complete miscarriage of justice."" Walking Eagle v. United States, 742 F.3d 1079,  1081-82 (8th Cir. 2014) (quoting United States v. Apfel, 97 F.3d 1074, 1076 (8th Cir. 1996)). Section 2255 generally may not ""be used to relitigate matters decided on direct appeal."" Sun Bear v. United States,  644 F.3d 700, 702 (8th Cir. 2011) (citing Davis v. United States, 417 U.S. 333, 346-47, 94 S. Ct. 2298, 41 L. Ed. 2d  109 (1974)); see also United States v. Shabazz, 657 F.2d 189, 190 (8th Cir. 1981) (per curiam) (""Claims which  were raised and decided on direct appeal cannot be relitigated on a motion to vacate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §  2255.""). B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel     2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72619, *1 Page 3 of 7 ""To establish ineffective assistance of counsel within the context of section 2255 . . . a movant faces a heavy  burden."" Apfel, 97 F.3d at 1076. A defendant must show that ""(1) his attorney's performance failed to conform to the  degree of skill, care, and diligence of a reasonably competent attorney; and (2) he was prejudiced by the attorney's  poor performance."" Pierce v. United States, 686 F.3d 529, 531 (8th Cir. 2012) (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466  U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984)). The defendant must overcome the ""strong presumption"" that  his counsel provided reasonable assistance. Id. Overcoming that presumption requires a showing that, ""in light of  all the circumstances, the lawyer's performance was outside the range of professionally competent assistance.""  Cox v. Norris, 133 F.3d 565, 573 (8th Cir. 1997). If the defendant can show his counsel's performance was  inadequate, [*4]  he then must show that, but for the deficient performance, the outcome of his case would have  been different. Id. Paul argues that his trial and appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by: (1) failing to challenge  the Third Superseding Indictment [Docket No. 89]; (2) failing to assert prosecutorial misconduct; (3) failing to file a  pretrial severance motion; (4) failing to object to the Jury Instructions and Verdict Form; (5) failing to challenge §  1591(a) as unconstitutionally vague; and (6) advising Paul to stipulate to the interstate commerce element of  Counts I-III. 1. Challenging the Third Superseding Indictment Count I of the Third Superseding Indictment charged Paul with using ""force, fraud, and coercion"" to traffic Z.S.,  ""who had not yet attained the age of 14 years . . . all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591(a),  1591(b)(1), 1591(c), 1594(a), 1594(c), and 2."" Count II charged Paul with using ""force, fraud, and coercion"" to traffic  K.J., ""who had not yet attained the age of 18 years . . . all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections  1591(a), 1591(b)(1), 1591(c), 1594(a), 1594(c), and 2."" Count III charged Paul with using ""force, fraud, and  coercion"" to traffic A.S., all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591(a), 1591(b)(1), 1591(c),  1594(a), 1594(c), and 2."" Paul argues his ""trial Counsel failed to conduct a proper inquisition [*5]  into who were the participants of the  alleged 'conspiracy' [under 18 U.S.C. § 1594(c)] and 'venture' [under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2)] in Counts 1 and 2, by  not disputing it's [sic] lack of correlation to Paul's case."" Mem. Supp. [Docket No. 204] at 9; Reply [Docket No. 219]  at 2. Paul contends he was the only person indicted and charged with conspiracy to commit trafficking, and ""A.S.  was not mentioned in the charging instrument as being a co-conspirator."" Mem. Supp. at 7, 9. Paul argues that ""in  permitting the government to try the case on Conspiracy to commit Sex Trafficking of a Minor, the District Court  allowed the introduction of an enormous amount of evidence of the Substantive offense [of] 1591(a)(2)."" Mem.  Supp. at 7. This argument fails to recognize that because Paul was charged with the substantive offense of §  1591(a), evidence relevant to the substantive offense would have been admitted regardless of whether Paul had  also been charged with conspiracy to commit sex trafficking under § 1594(c). Paul has not demonstrated how  counsel's failure to challenge the Third Superseding Indictment as defective based on the conspiracy charge was  deficient, much less prejudicial, under the Strickland standard. Paul also contends his trial counsel [*6]  was ineffective for failing to raise duplicity and multiplicity challenges to the  Third Superseding Indictment. Paul's duplicity arguments are based on his contention that § 1591(a) includes two  separate crimes—sex trafficking minors and sex trafficking through force, fraud or coercion—and there was no  unanimous finding by the jury as to either crime. This argument was considered and rejected by the Eighth Circuit  on direct appeal. Paul, 885 F.3d at 1104-05. The Eighth Circuit held that ""the district court eliminated this risk of  non-unanimity by instructing the jury, and reflecting on the verdict form for Count I (Z.S.) and for Count II (K.J.), that  it must make separate findings whether Paul committed (i) 'the crime of sex trafficking of a minor,' and (ii) 'the crime  of sex trafficking by use of force, fraud, or coercion.' In convicting Paul of Counts I and II, the jury unanimously  found Paul guilty of both offenses against both victims. Thus, there was no duplicity."" Paul, 885 F.3d at 1105. Paul's multiplicity argument is that he should not have been charged for three counts of trafficking, because the  three individuals he trafficked ""were alleged to be transported at the same time on the same trip."" Reply at 10. This  argument fails because [*7]  each of the individual victims warrant a separate count of sex trafficking. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72619, *3 Page 4 of 7 Paul also argues that the Third Superseding Indictment was constructively amended, and that trial and appellate  counsel were ineffective for failing to challenge the constructive amendment. ""In cases in which courts have found a  constructive amendment of an indictment by virtue of the trial court's instructions to the jury, the instructions in  effect allowed the jury to convict the defendant of an offense different from or in addition to the offenses alleged in  the indictment."" United States v. Begnaud, 783 F.2d 144, 147 (8th Cir. 1986). Paul contends the Jury Instructions  and Verdict Form constructively amended the Third Superseding Indictment by stating that Paul was charged in  Counts I and II with using force, fraud, and coercion. Mem. Supp. at 15-16; Reply at 4-5. This argument is meritless  because the Jury Instructions and Verdict Form were correct. Counts I and II expressly charged Paul with sex  trafficking Z.S. and K.J. ""knowing that force, fraud or coercion would be used."" The Jury Instructions and Verdict  Form did not allow the jury to convict Paul of a different or additional offense beyond the offenses alleged in the  Third Superseding Indictment. Paul similarly [*8]  argues that the Government ""misled the Court that Paul was charged with Force, Fraud, and  Coercion in Counts I and II,"" and that as a result the Government was improperly permitted to introduce evidence of  Paul's sexual assaults on victims Z.S. and K.J. Reply at 5. Paul argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to  object to the admission of this evidence. Again, Counts I and II explicitly charge Paul with sex trafficking Z.S. and  K.J. through the use of force, fraud, and coercion. The evidence of Paul's assaults on Z.S. and K.J. was properly  admitted as direct evidence of the crimes charged. 2. No Prosecutorial Misconduct Paul claims that his trial and appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to assert prosecutorial  misconduct. Paul contends the prosecutor misled the grand jury into returning the First Superseding Indictment  [Docket No. 21], which added a sex trafficking charge for trafficking A.S. (Count III). Paul argues the initial  Indictment [Docket No. 15], which charged Paul with engaging in and conspiring to sex traffick Z.S. and K.J., was  based on a criminal complaint and affidavit that included A.S.'s name. Paul contends the prosecutor  subsequently [*9]  redacted A.S.'s name from the complaint and affidavit, and used the redacted materials to obtain  the First Superseding Indictment that added A.S. as a victim. Paul argues his counsel should have objected to the  Government alleging A.S. was both a co-conspirator and a victim. ""As a general rule, prosecutorial misconduct does not warrant federal habeas relief unless the misconduct infected  the trial with enough unfairness to render petitioner's conviction a denial of due process."" Louisell v. Dir. of Iowa  Dep't of Corr., 178 F.3d 1019, 1023 (8th Cir. 1999) (internal quotations and alterations omitted). Paul does not  explain how redacting a sex trafficking victim's name in grand jury materials is improper. Nor has Paul alleged that  the grand jury was somehow unaware of or confused as to the true identity of A.S. Paul also argues the Third Superseding Indictment constituted prosecutorial misconduct because it charged Paul  with sex trafficking by use of force fraud and coercion. Paul contends he ""was prejudiced because the government  repeatedly stated [during trial] that the defendant used force, fraud and coercion to cause all three of his victims to  engage in commercial sex actions."" Mem. Supp. at 30. This argument lacks any basis. Paul has not shown any prosecutorial [*10]  misconduct, much less misconduct that caused enough unfairness to  render Paul's convictions a denial of due process. Paul's counsel was not deficient for failing to assert prosecutorial  misconduct. 3. Pretrial Motion for Severance Paul also claims his trial attorney was ineffective for not filing a pretrial motion to sever Counts I and II (sex  trafficking minors Z.S. and K.J. using force, fraud, and coercion) from Count III (sex trafficking A.J. using force,  fraud, and coercion). Paul argues that the evidence in Count III had a ""spill over"" effect that prejudiced the jury's  judgment on Counts I and II. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72619, *7 Page 5 of 7 Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a) states that ""[t]he indictment or information may charge a defendant in  separate counts with 2 or more offenses if the offenses charged . . . are of the same or similar character, or are  based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan."" The  offenses in Counts I and II were ""of the same or similar character"" and were ""based on the same act or transaction""  as Count III, because Paul sex trafficked all three victims at the same time and in each other's presence. All three  Counts were also parts of a ""common scheme or plan"" by Paul [*11]  to victimize young, vulnerable women. Trial  counsel's decision not to seek to sever Count III was neither deficient nor prejudicial as the severance motion would  have been without merit. 4. Jury Instructions and Verdict Form Paul also argues his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the Jury Instructions and Verdict Form. ""Jury  instructions are acceptable if, taken as a whole, they adequately apprise the jury of the essential elements of the  offenses charged and the burden of proof required of the government."" United States v. Brown, 478 F.3d 926, 928  (8th Cir. 2007). Paul argues the Court's Jury Instructions for Counts I and II were erroneous because they stated the wrong mens  rea requirement for proving Paul's knowledge of Z.S. and K.J.'s ages. The Court disagrees. The Jury Instructions  for Counts I and II track nearly verbatim the offense of sex trafficking a minor under § 1591, including the requisite  mens rea. Compare 18 U.S.C.A. § 1591(a)(1), (c) with Jury Instructions 10, 11, 14. Taken as a whole, the Jury  Instructions addressing Counts 1 and 2 ""adequately apprise the jury of the essential elements of the offenses  charged and the burden of proof required of the government."" Brown, 478 F.3d at 928. Counsel's lack of objection  to the Jury Instructions was not ineffective assistance [*12]  under the Strickland standard. Paul also argues that counsel was ineffective for not requesting a specific unanimity instruction or special verdict  form. This argument fails because the Eighth Circuit has held in this case that ""the district court eliminated th[e] risk  of non-unanimity by instructing the jury, and reflecting on the verdict form for Count I (Z.S.) And for Count II (K.J.),  that it must make separate findings whether Paul committed (i) 'the crime of sex trafficking of a minor,' and (ii) 'the  crime of sex trafficking by the use of force, fraud, or coercion.'"" Paul, 885 F.3d at 1105. 5. Constitutionality of § 1591(a) Paul argues his counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the constitutionality of § 1591(a) as unconstitutionally  vague. Paul claims § 1591 is vague because it lacks clarity as to whether the statute includes a single offense or  multiple offenses. The challenged statute provides: (a) Whoever knowingly— (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce ... recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains,  or maintains by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture which has engaged  in an act described in violation of paragraph (1), knowing, [*13]  or in reckless disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion  described in subsection (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be used to cause the person to engage  in a commercial sex act, or that the person has not attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage  in a commercial sex act, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) (2012).   2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72619, *10 Page 6 of 7 ""A statute is void for vagueness if it: (1) fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is  prohibited, or (2) it is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement."" Paul,  885 F.3d at 1105. Paul does not explain how a person of ordinary intelligence would lack notice of what is  prohibited by § 1591, or how the statute encourages discriminatory enforcement. Moreover, the Eighth Circuit  concluded in Paul's appeal that although there may be some ambiguity as to whether § 1591 includes two separate  crimes—the crime of sex trafficking of a minor and the crime of sex trafficking by use of force, fraud, or coercion— the concern is not relevant here because ""the jury unanimously found Paul guilty of both offenses against both [Z.S.  and K.J.]."" Paul, 885 F.3d at 1105. Counsel's failure to challenge § 1591 as void for vagueness on [*14]  this  ground was not deficient or prejudicial. 6. Stipulation to Interstate Commerce Element Paul argues his trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance by advising him to stipulate to the interstate commerce  element of Counts I-III. At trial, the parties stipulated that various websites, hotels, and cell phone carriers were  entities ""affecting interstate commerce."" Trial Tr. Vol. III [Docket No. 166] at 652-654. The Government introduced  substantial evidence of Paul's use of these entities in the commission of his crimes. Paul argues ""no reasonable  counsel would have advised his client to lift the Government's burden of proof and stipulate to an essential element  of the offense."" Mem. Supp. at 52. A trial counsel's decision to stipulate to facts is a tactical decision. Edgemon v. Lockhart, 768 F.2d 252, 255 (8th  Cir. 1985). Matters of trial tactics do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel unless the chosen tactic is  ""wholly without reason."" Williams-Bey v. Trickey, 894 F.2d 314, 316 (8th Cir. 1990). Based on the evidence  presented by the Government that Paul used hotels, cell phone carriers, and websites in committing his crimes,  Paul's trial counsel was not deficient in advising Paul to stipulate to the interstate commerce element of the sex  trafficking offenses charged in Counts [*15]  I-III. If contested, the element would be readily susceptible to easy  proof by the prosecution. C. Rehaif Paul argues his convictions on all counts must be vacated under Rehaif v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2191, 204 L.  Ed. 2d 594 (2019). He contends that under Rehaif, the Government was required to prove that Paul knew his  conduct was unlawful. Rehaif involved a charge for unlawful possession of a firearm. The holding in Rehaif requires the Government prove  that a person whose prohibited status bars them from possessing a firearm know of both this status and his  possession of a firearm to ""knowingly violate"" the ban in 18 U.S.C. § 922(g). Id. at 2196-97, 2200. The rationale  behind the holding is that ""the possession of a gun can be entirely innocent,"" and ""[i]t is therefore the defendant's  status [as a felon or alien], and not his conduct alone, that makes the difference. Without knowledge of that status,  the defendant may well lack the intent needed to make his behavior wrongful. His behavior may instead be an  innocent mistake to which criminal sanctions normally do not attach."" Id. at 2197. Paul argues that under Rehaif, the Government was required to prove that Paul knew he had violated the material  elements of § 1591(a). He contends the Jury Instructions wrongly stated that ""the government is not required [*16]   to prove that the defendant knew his acts or omissions were unlawful."" Jury Instructions No. 14. This argument lacks merit. Unlike the statute at issue in Rehaif, the sex trafficking statute does not criminalize  otherwise innocent conduct. Paul's behavior in sex trafficking two minors and a 19-year old woman using force,     2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72619, *13 Page 7 of 7 fraud and coercion was not ""an innocent mistake to which criminal sanctions normally do not attach."" Rehaif, 139 S.  Ct. at 2197. The jury was properly instructed that the Government need not prove that Paul knew his acts or  omissions were unlawful. Additionally, the Jury Instructions correctly declined to apply a mens rea requirement to  the interstate commerce element of § 1591. See United States v. Collier, 932 F.3d 1067, 1075 (8th Cir. 2019)  (holding that ""knowingly"" does not apply to the ""interstate or foreign commerce"" element of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1)). D. Request for Reduced Sentence Paul has filed a letter requesting that the Court reduce his sentence. He states that he has completed several  educational courses offered by the Bureau of Prisons and has rehabilitated himself while in custody. Paul also  states that the mother of his children is a health care worker, and that he desires to assist his family while they are  enduring the COVID 19 pandemic. The Court is hopeful that [*17]  the many educational and vocational opportunities Paul has afforded himself while  in custody will improve his remaining time in custody and allow him to find steady employment and lead a  productive life upon his release. The Court also recognizes that the current pandemic presents added difficulty and  stress to prisoners and their families. However, Paul has not identified an exception to the general rule that ""[t]he  court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed. 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c). The request for a  reduced sentence is denied. IV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY The Court may grant a certificate of appealability only where a defendant has made a substantial showing of the  denial of a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2); Tiedeman v. Benson, 122 F.3d 518, 523 (8th Cir. 1997). To  make such a showing, ""[t]he petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court's  assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong."" Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S. Ct.  1595, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542 (2000). The Court finds it unlikely that another court would decide the issues raised in this  § 2255 Motion differently, or that any of the issues raised in Paul's Motion would be debatable among reasonable  jurists. Therefore, the Court declines to grant a certificate of appealability."
"United States v. Raniere, 55 F.4th 354.pdf","[*357]  JA.C, Circuit Judge: After a six-week jury trial, Keith Raniere was convicted  in the United States District Court for the Eastern District  of New York (Nicholas G. Garaufis, Judge) of numerous  counts related to his leadership of two organizations: a  self-styled  executive  coaching  and  self-help  organization called [**3]  NXIVM and a secret society  called ""DOS,"" an acronym for ""Dominus Obsequious  Sororium,""  a  phrase  that  roughly  translates  to  ""Lord/Master of the Obedient Female Companions."" At  trial, the Government presented evidence that Raniere  led both entities as pyramid organizations, and that he— alongside his ""inner circle""—committed, attempted, or  conspired to commit various crimes, including sex  trafficking, forced labor, identity theft, wire fraud,  racketeering, sexual exploitation of a minor, possession  of child pornography, and obstruction of justice. During  the lengthy trial, the Government also presented  evidence that members of the organizations recruited  and groomed sexual partners for Raniere, and that  numerous  women  were  coerced  to  engage  in  nonconsensual sexual acts with Raniere. On appeal, Raniere raises numerous challenges to his  various convictions. By summary order issued on the  same day as this opinion, we dispose of most of  Raniere's arguments (along with the appeal of Raniere's  co-defendant, Clare Bronfman). We write separately  here to address Raniere's arguments concerning his sex  trafficking convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 1591. Raniere's  arguments  turn  on  the  meaning  of  ""commercial sex act,"" [**4]  which the statute defines as  ""any sex act, on account of which anything of value is  given to or received by any person."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(e)(3). He principally argues that to qualify as a  ""commercial sex act,"" there must be a monetary or  financial component to the ""[]thing of value"" that is given  or received, and the sexual exploitation must be for  profit. We conclude that the statute has no such  requirement. Accordingly,  [*358]  we AFFIRM the  District Court's judgment concerning his sex trafficking  convictions.     55 F.4th 354, *354; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 33910, **2 Page 4 of 10 I. BACKGROUND In or around 2003, Raniere founded an organization  called NXIVM, a self-styled executive coaching and self- help organization. New members paid thousands of  dollars to attend self-help workshops. NXIVM members  referred to Raniere as ""Vanguard."" In 2015, Raniere created the secret society ""DOS,""  which was structured as a pyramid, with Raniere at the  head, followed by first-line ""masters"" and their  subordinate ""slaves."" ""Slaves"" were expected to be  obedient to their ""masters."" Apart from Raniere, all DOS members were women.  And Raniere's identity as the head of DOS was initially  concealed from newly recruited ""slaves,"" who were told  that the organization was a ""women's-only secret [**5]   society."" DOS ""masters"" recruited slaves mostly from NXIVM and  targeted women who were experiencing difficulties in  their lives. To join, DOS recruits were required to  provide ""collateral"" to prove their commitment to the  organization. ""Collateral"" took many forms, including  sexually explicit photographs and videos of themselves,  rights to financial assets, and letters containing  damaging accusations—whether true or untrue—about  family members and friends. DOS ""slaves"" were expected to provide their ""masters""  with services called ""acts of care,"" which included  buying them groceries, editing videos, cleaning, and  organizing. Each ""slave"" was expected to provide about                    an hour of work per week for her ""master"" as her  ""normal contribution."" In some cases, ""masters""  assigned their ""slaves"" to engage in sexual conduct with  Raniere and implied that collateral might be released if  the slaves refused. DOS ""slaves"" were also required to  be branded with a symbol that, unbeknownst to them,  consisted of Raniere's initials. During the branding  ceremony, participants were normally required to be  nude and to say, ""Master[,] please brand me. It would  be an honor, an honor that I want to wear for the [**6]   [re]st of my life."" Allison Mack—a DOS ""master"" and one of Raniere's co- defendants who pleaded guilty to racketeering and  racketeering conspiracy—recruited Nicole to join DOS  as a ""slave"" in February 2016. As part of that process,  Mack asked that Nicole provide ""collateral."" Nicole  provided a series  [*359]  of letters she wrote falsely  alleging sexual abuse by her father and other damaging  accusations, as well as a sexually explicit video of  herself. She was later required to provide additional  ""collateral,"" including credit card authorizations and the  right to her grandmother's wedding ring. Mack subsequently ""assigned"" Nicole to contact  Raniere and tell him that she would do ""anything that he  asked."" On May 31, 2016—while Nicole and Mack were  together in Mack's house—Raniere called Mack, and  Mack instructed Nicole to go outside so that Nicole  would meet Raniere ""across the grass"" from the house's  backdoor. Raniere subsequently blindfolded Nicole, led  her into a car, and drove her to a house. He then led  Nicole—still blindfolded—through some trees and inside  a building. There, he instructed her to undress and tied  her to a table. Another person in the room, whose  identity was unknown to Nicole, [**7]  performed oral  sex on Nicole. Nicole subsequently told Mack about the  incident, and Mack called Nicole ""really brave."" Nicole had additional sexual encounters with Raniere  during her time as a DOS ""slave."" Mack regularly  required Nicole and other ""slaves"" to pose for nude  photographs, including close-up photographs of their  genitalia. Nicole also performed uncompensated work  for Mack, including transcribing tapes and reviewing  articles. Mack also recruited another ""slave,"" India, who in turn  recruited a second-order ""slave"" named Jay. Jay  provided ""collateral"" to India, including a sex tape and a    55 F.4th 354, *358; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 33910, **4 Page 5 of 10 video describing abuse to which she was subjected as a  child. She provided further ""collateral"" on a monthly  basis. Jay was required to perform uncompensated services  for Mack, including cleaning her house, doing her  laundry, and picking up her groceries. She was also  required  to  transcribe  certain  videos  without  compensation. In addition, Mack gave Jay a ""special  assignment"" to ""seduce"" Raniere and ""have him take a  naked picture"" of Jay; Jay understood this assignment  to include having sex with Raniere. Jay refused to carry  out the assignment and decided to leave DOS. After Raniere and several [**8]  members of his ""inner  circle"" were indicted, each of Raniere's co-defendants  pleaded guilty to various crimes. Following a six-week  jury trial before Judge Garaufis, Raniere was convicted  of: racketeering conspiracy (Count 1); racketeering  (Count 2); forced labor conspiracy (Count 3); wire fraud  conspiracy (Count 4); sex trafficking conspiracy (Count  5); sex trafficking of Nicole (Count 6); and attempted sex  trafficking of Jay (Count 7). In support of their guilty  finding for Count 2, the jury found that the Government  had proved that Raniere had engaged in all of the  alleged racketeering acts: four acts of conspiracy to  commit identity theft, two acts of identity theft,  conspiracy to unlawfully possess an identification  document, two acts of sexual exploitation of a child,  possession of child pornography, conspiracy to alter  records for use in an official proceeding, trafficking for  labor and services, document servitude, extortion, sex  trafficking of Nicole,  [*360]  and forced labor. The  District Court sentenced Raniere principally to 120  years' imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.               II. DISCUSSION We dispose of most of Raniere's arguments on appeal  in a summary order filed simultaneously herewith. We  write separately in this opinion to address Raniere's  argument that a ""commercial sex act""—statutorily  defined as ""any sex act, on account of which anything of  value is given to or received by any person,"" 18 U.S.C.  § 1591(e)(3)—must involve the exchange of monetary  or financial benefits. We first address the statutory text  before turning to Raniere's specific challenges. A. ""Commercial Sex Act"" Congress enacted the statute at the center of this  appeal, 18 U.S.C. § 1591, as part of the Trafficking  Victims Protection Act of 2000 (""TVPA""), Pub. L. No.  106-386, 114 Stat. 1464 (2000). HN1[ ] In passing the  TVPA, Congress's purpose was ""to combat trafficking in  persons, a contemporary manifestation of slavery  whose victims are predominantly women and children,  to ensure just and effective punishment of traffickers,  and to protect their victims."" [**10]  22 U.S.C. § 7101(a). In relevant part, Section 1591 provides for punishment  of any individual: (a) Who[] knowingly— (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign  commerce, . . . recruits, entices, harbors,  transports,  provides,  obtains,  advertises,  maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any means  a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything  of value, from participation in a venture which  has engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), [while also] knowing[] . . . that means of force,  threats of force, fraud, coercion . . . , or any  combination of such means will be used to cause  the person to engage in a commercial sex act, . . . . 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) (emphasis added). Section 1591 goes on to define a ""commercial sex act""  as ""any sex act, on account of which anything of value is  given to or received by any person."" Id. § 1591(e)(3)  (emphasis added). The statute does not explicitly define  the phrase ""anything of value,"" and the scope of that  phrase is the subject of the present appeal. Raniere argues that Section 1591 ""was designed to  55 F.4th 354, *359; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 33910, **7 Page 6 of 10 punish  sexual  exploitation  for  economic  profit.""  Raniere's Br. 23-24; see also Raniere's Supp. Br. 9. He  therefore concludes that the phrase ""anything of value,""  as it is used in the statute, must mean ""economic  benefit[]."" Raniere's [**11]  Br. at 24. We do not agree. HN2[ ] We begin our analysis ""with the statutory text,  exhausting 'all the textual and structural clues' bearing  on its meaning and construing each word 'in its context  and in light of the terms surrounding it.'"" United States v.  Bedi, 15 F.4th 222, 226 (2d Cir. 2021) (footnote omitted)  (first quoting Wis. Cent. Ltd. v. United States, 138 S. Ct.  2067, 2074, 201 L. Ed. 2d 490 (2018); then quoting  Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 9, 125 S. Ct. 377, 160 L.  Ed. 2d 271 (2004)). Where, as here, a phrase is ""not  defined by statute, we normally construe it in accord  with its ordinary or natural meaning."" Smith v. United  States, 508 U.S. 223, 228, 113 S. Ct. 2050, 124 L. Ed.  2d 138 (1993). If we find that a phrase is unambiguous  and is ""coherent  [*361]  and consistent"" with the  statutory scheme, then ""the inquiry ceases."" Friends of  the E. Hampton Airport, Inc. v. Town of E. Hampton,  841 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Kingdomware  Techs., Inc. v. United States, 579 U.S. 162, 171, 136 S.  Ct. 1969, 195 L. Ed. 2d 334 (2016)); see also Matal v.  Tam, 582 U.S. 218, 137 S. Ct. 1744, 1756, 198 L. Ed.  2d 366 (2017) (rejecting a proposed ""resort to legislative  history"" as unpersuasive because a court's ""inquiry into  the meaning of the statute's text ceases when 'the  statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory  scheme is coherent and consistent'"") (quoting Barnhart  v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 450, 456, 122 S. Ct.  941, 151 L. Ed. 2d 908 (2002)). We start with the prefix ""any"" in the phrase ""anything of  value."" ""Read naturally, the word 'any' has an expansive  meaning, that is, one or some indiscriminately of  whatever kind."" Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S.  214, 219, 128 S. Ct. 831, 169 L. Ed. 2d 680 (2008)  (cleaned up). Our understanding of ""anything of value""              is thus guided by the expansive meaning of ""any."" See  United States v. Cook, 782 F.3d 983, 988 (8th Cir.  2015) (""The phrase 'anything of value' [in Section  1591(e)(3)] is extremely broad.""). In addition, we  observe  that [**12]   Congress's  definition  of  ""commercial sex act""—""any sex act, on account of  which anything of value is given to or received by any  person,"" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(3) (emphases added)— uses the word or prefix ""any"" three times. Congress's  repeated use of the word ""any"" in its definition  ""commercial sex act"" further supports an expansive  understanding of the specific phrase at issue here,  ""anything of value."" We have previously had occasion, albeit in other  contexts, to consider the remainder of the phrase. We  have clarified in those other contexts that the phrase  ""thing of value"" ""is generally construed to cover  intangibles as well as tangibles."" United States v.  Girard, 601 F.2d 69, 71 (2d Cir. 1979). In Girard, we  observed that all of the following are ""things of value"":  ""amusement,"" ""[s]exual intercourse, or the promise of  sexual intercourse,"" ""a promise to reinstate an  employee,"" ""an agreement not to run in a primary  election,"" and ""[t]he testimony of a witness."" Id.  (citations omitted). And in United States v. Maneri, we  held that the phrase ""thing of value"" includes  intangibles, specifically ""the opportunity for a sexual  encounter, in return for distributing child pornography"" in  the context of the advisory Sentencing Guidelines for 18  U.S.C. § 2252. 353 F.3d 165, 168 (2d Cir. 2003).  Although the statutory phrase [**13]  at issue here is  ""anything of value"" and not a misspelled version, ""any  thing of value,"" our earlier holdings on ""thing of value""  remain instructive. Indeed, adding the expansive prefix  ""any"" onto ""thing"" only underscores our understanding  that ""anything of value"" should be broadly understood to  include intangibles. A ""thing of value"" as it appears in  Section 1591 may be intangible. Finally,  and  consistent  with  our  expansive  understanding of the phrase thus far,  [*362]  we  interpret the word ""value"" to refer to ""a subjective, rather  than objective, concept."" Cook, 782 F.3d at 988 (quoting  United States v. Petrovic, 701 F.3d 849, 858 (8th Cir.  2012)). Stated differently, in the ordinary sense, we  construe the word ""value"" to ""focus . . . on the value  which the [recipient] subjectively attaches to what is  sought to be received."" Id. at 988-89 (quoting Petrovic,  701 F.3d at 858); see also United States v. Williams,  705 F.2d 603, 623 (2d Cir. 1983) (concluding that the  phrase ""anything of value,"" as it is used in the bribery  statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201, ""has consistently been given a  55 F.4th 354, *360; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 33910, **10 Page 7 of 10 broad meaning"" and that the district court correctly  construed the phrase ""to focus on the value that the  defendants subjectively attached to the items received"").  This conforms with the dictionary definition of ""value,""  which includes ""relative worth, utility, or importance."" 3  Webster's Third New International Dictionary [**14]   2530 (1976). HN3[ ] Bearing in mind these textual clues, we  conclude that, as it is used in Section 1591, the phrase  ""anything of value"" need not have a monetary or  financial component. Nothing in the statutory text  indicates such a requirement, and in fact, a natural  reading of the broad language used in Section  1591(e)(3) forecloses such a reading. Put another way,  for purposes of the statute, monetary worth is not the  sole measure of ""value."" See United States v. Nilsen,  967 F.2d 539, 543 (11th Cir. 1992) (discussing the  phrase ""thing of value"" as it is used in 18 U.S.C. § 876).  Accordingly, we hold that for sexual exploitation to be  actionable under Section 1591, it need not have been  conducted—as Raniere argues it must—for profit. B. Raniere's Arguments Turning to Raniere's specific arguments on appeal as  they concern his sex trafficking convictions, we find  none of them persuasive. a. Challenges to the Jury Instruction Raniere first argues that the District Court erred in its  instructions to the jury on the sex trafficking counts. HN4[ ] ""We review de novo a properly preserved  challenge to a jury instruction, reversing where the                 charge, viewed as a whole, either failed to inform the  jury adequately of the law or misled the jury about the  correct legal rule."" United States v. Capers, 20 F.4th  105, 116 (2d Cir. 2021) (quoting United States v.  Binday, 804 F.3d 558, 581-82 (2d Cir. 2015)). ""In  reviewing a jury instruction, [**15]  we 'examine not only  the specific language that the defendant challenges but  also the instructions as a whole to see if the entire  charge delivered a correct interpretation of the law.'""  United States v. Al Kassar, 660 F.3d 108, 127 (2d Cir.  2011) (quoting United States v. Bala, 236 F.3d 87, 94- 95 (2d Cir. 2000)).  [*363]  The District Court instructed the jury on the  ""element"" of sex trafficking as follows: The third element that the Government must prove  is that the Defendant knew that Nicole would be  engaged in a commercial sexual act. A commercial  sexual act is any sex act of which anything of value  is given to or received by any person because of  such sex act. HN5[ ] It is not required that the  victim actually performed a commercial sex act as  long as the Government has proved that the  Defendant  recruited,  enticed,  harbored,  transported,  provided,  obtained,  maintained,  patronized or solicited the victim for purposes of  engaging in commercial sex acts. A thing ""of value""  need not involve a monetary exchange and need  not have any financial component. The phrase ""any  sex act"" should be given its plain meaning and may  include any act performed with another for sexual  gratification. Jury Charge at 99-100, United States v. Mack, No. 18- CR-204 (NGG) (E.D.N.Y. June 18, 2019), ECF No. 728  (emphases added). Raniere's initial objection is to the first italicized  sentence above. In particular, [**16]  he disputes the  propriety of the District Court's usage of the phrase  ""because of"" and argues that the sentence should have  read: ""A 'commercial sex act' is any sex act on account  of which anything of value is given to or received by any  person."" Defendant Keith Raniere's Requests to Charge  at 64, 86, Mack, No. 18-CR-204 (June 7, 2019), ECF  No. 692-1 (emphasis added). He argues that the phrase  ""because of"" ""means only a 'connection to' or a  proximate causational relationship to,"" whereas ""on  account of"" ""underscores a quid pro quo."" Raniere's    55 F.4th 354, *362; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 33910, **13 Page 8 of 10 Supp. Br. 18. We find no error in the District Court's use of the term  ""because of."" Although the statute, 18 U.S.C. §  1591(e)(3), uses the phrase ""on account of,"" we find no  meaningful  difference  between  that  phrase  and  ""because of."" Raniere does not point to any authority  supporting his view of the difference in meaning  between ""because of"" and ""on account of,"" which we  understand to be virtually indistinguishable. Indeed, in a  different context, the Supreme Court has noted that  ""[t]he words 'because of' mean 'by reason of: on account  of.'"" Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 176,  129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009) (quoting 1  Webster's Third New International Dictionary 194  (1966)). As a result, the District Court's use of ""because  of"" neither [**17]  failed to inform the jury adequately of  the law nor misled the jury about the correct legal rule. Raniere next challenges the second italicized sentence  in the above jury instructions: ""A thing 'of value' need  not involve a monetary exchange and need not have  any financial component."" He argues that a ""commercial  sex act"" must involve the exchange of monetary of  financial benefits. For the reasons stated in Section II.A  of this opinion, ante, we reject his argument. As we  have concluded, the phrase ""anything of value"" need  not have a monetary or financial component, and the  actionable sexual exploitation need not have been  conducted for profit. The jury was neither misinformed  nor misled about the law. Accordingly, we find no error  in the District Court's instruction.  [*364]  b. Sufficiency-of-the-Evidence Challenge to  the Sex Trafficking Counts Next, Raniere challenges the sufficiency of the evidence  presented against him at trial concerning his Section  1591 counts: sex trafficking conspiracy, sex trafficking of  Nicole, and attempted sex trafficking of Jay. HN6[ ] When preserved, we review claims of  insufficient evidence de novo. Capers, 20 F.4th at 113.  When hearing a sufficiency challenge on appeal, we         make a ""limited inquiry tailored [**18]  to ensure that a  defendant receives the minimum that due process  requires: a 'meaningful opportunity to defend' against  the charge against him and a jury finding of guilt 'beyond  a reasonable doubt.'"" Musacchio v. United States, 577  U.S. 237, 243, 136 S. Ct. 709, 193 L. Ed. 2d 639 (2016)  (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 314-15, 99  S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979)). ""All that a  defendant is entitled to on a sufficiency challenge is for  the court to make a 'legal' determination whether the  evidence was strong enough to reach a jury at all."" Id. at  244 (quoting Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319). HN7[ ] It is no surprise then that a defendant raising a  sufficiency challenge ""face[s] a heavy burden."" Capers,  20 F.4th at 113 (quoting United States v. Ho, 984 F.3d  191, 199 (2d Cir. 2020)). Indeed, ""we must sustain the  jury's verdict if, crediting every inference that could have  been drawn in the government's favor and viewing the  evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,  any rational trier of fact could have found the essential  elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt."" Id.  (cleaned up). We ""may enter a judgment of acquittal  only if the evidence that the defendant committed the  crime alleged is nonexistent or so meager that no  reasonable jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable  doubt."" Id. (quoting United States v. Atilla, 966 F.3d 118,  128 (2d Cir. 2020)). In conducting our review, ""[w]e must analyze the  evidence in conjunction, not in isolation, and apply the  sufficiency test to the totality of [**19]  the government's  case and not to each element, as each fact may gain  color from others."" Atilla, 966 F.3d at 128 (cleaned up).  And ""[w]e must credit every inference that the jury might  have drawn in favor of the government, because the  task of choosing among competing, permissible  inferences is for the jury, not for the reviewing court."" Id.  (cleaned up). i. ""Anything of Value"" Raniere first argues that the Government failed to  provide evidence that ""anything of value"" was received  or given in connection with a sex act. We disagree. The Government did in fact present evidence at trial that  DOS ""masters,"" including Mack, obtained ""things of  value"" in connection with assigning their DOS ""slaves""  to engage in sexual acts with Raniere. For example, the  Government presented evidence that Mack was able to  maintain and strengthen her privileged position in the  DOS hierarchy because of the relationship between  55 F.4th 354, *363; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 33910, **16 Page 9 of 10 Raniere and one of Mack's ""slaves,"" Nicole. The  Government also presented evidence that Raniere set  an expectation that DOS ""masters"" would receive  approximately 40 hours of ""work"" per week from their  various ""slaves."" Gov. App'x 235 (testimony of Lauren  Salzman, one of Raniere's co-conspirators who pleaded  guilty [**20]   to  racketeering  and  racketeering  conspiracy). Moreover, those ""masters"" who were able  to recruit a sufficient number of ""slaves"" (and ""slaves"" of  ""slaves"") would qualify for a ""special position"" and  receive ""special privileges"" from  [*365]  Raniere. Id.  Furthermore, the Government presented evidence that  Raniere authorized certain payments to Mack for her  work as ""head trainer"" at the same time that Mack  encouraged  a  ""slave,""  India,  to  ""complete  [an]  assignment"" involving ""tak[ing] all her clothes off, while  [Raniere was] clothed, pos[ing] in the most revealing  way, and hav[ing Raniere] take a picture of her."" Id. at  1269, 1271 (emails between Raniere and Mack). Raniere argues that ""[m]aintaining a spot in the first line""  of DOS cannot constitute ""anything of value"" for  purposes of Section 1591. Id. at 1047 (Government  counsel's trial summation). But as discussed above, we  reject the argument that only the exchange of things  with monetary value can suffice for purposes of the  statutory definition of ""commercial sex act."" A privileged  position in an organization may constitute intangible  ""value."" And indeed, here, evidence presented at trial  demonstrated that the privileged position came with  direct benefits, including [**21]  free labor from the  ""slaves"" who were expected to perform ""acts of care"" for  their ""masters."" The evidence regarding the giving or receiving of  ""anything of value"" submitted at trial was neither  nonexistent nor meager. We conclude that the evidence  was strong enough to reach a jury and that Raniere was  afforded at least ""the minimum that due process  requires."" Musacchio, 577 U.S. at 243. We therefore  decline to disturb Raniere's convictions on these counts.  The Government did not fail to provide sufficient  evidence that ""anything of value"" was received or given  in connection with a sex act. ii. ""On Account of"" Next, Raniere argues that even if things of value were  given or received, they were not given or received ""on  account of"" a sexual act. The Government presented  evidence that on May 31, 2016, Raniere blindfolded  Nicole, ordered her to undress, and tied her to a table,  after which a third person performed oral sex on Nicole  in Raniere's presence. Raniere argues that the  Government failed to present evidence that Mack— Nicole's ""master""—received anything of value ""on  account of"" the May 31, 2016 sexual act. In another context, the Supreme Court has interpreted  the phrase ""'on account of' to ""require[e] a causal [**22]   connection between the term that the phrase 'on  account of' modifies and the factor specified in the  statute . . . ."" Rousey v. Jacoway, 544 U.S. 320, 326,  125 S. Ct. 1561, 161 L. Ed. 2d 563 (2005) (interpreting  11 U.S.C. § 522(d)(10)(E)). Similarly, we interpret the  statutory language in Section 1591(e)(3) to require a  causal connection between the sexual act and the  giving or receiving of anything of value. With that in mind, we conclude that Raniere's sufficiency  challenge lacks merit. At trial, the Government offered  evidence from which a reasonable jury could have  concluded that Mack's receipt of various things of value  were causally connected to her assigning her ""slaves"" to  engage in sexual acts with Raniere, including the May  31, 2016 incident. This included testimony that Mack  directed Nicole ""[t]o reach out to . . . Raniere,"" which  Nicole first did in April 2016 by email. Gov. App'x 747-48  (testimony of Nicole). The Government also offered  testimony that Nicole understood Mack's relationship  with Raniere to be the ""most important relationship"" to  Mack, and that, accordingly, Nicole understood that it  was ""important to [Nicole's] relationship with [Mack] to  make [Raniere] happy"" and that how Nicole ""related to  [Raniere] . . . reflected on [Mack]."" Id. at 764-65  (testimony of Nicole). Nicole understood [**23]  that she  needed to be ""well behaved"" in front of Raniere. Id.   [*366]  at 765. And Nicole kept Mack apprised of her  relationship with Raniere, including by informing her of  the May 31, 2016 incident. Id. at 760. She further  received  encouragement  from  Mack  to  ""make  [Raniere's] life easier."" Id. at 764. The Government's evidence purporting to establish that  Mack received things of value ""on account of"" her  assigning ""slaves"" to engage in sexual acts with Raniere  was neither nonexistent nor meager. Based on this  evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude that Mack's  privileged position in DOS was causally connected with  her ""assignment"" of Nicole to Raniere for sexual  purposes. As with the evidence that ""anything of value""  was received or given in connection with a sex act, the  evidence relevant to whether Mack received things of  value ""on account of"" her assigning ""slaves"" to engage  in sexual acts with Raniere was strong enough to reach  55 F.4th 354, *364; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 33910, **19 Page 10 of 10 a jury. Thus, we conclude that Raniere had a  meaningful opportunity to defend himself. iii. ""Coercion"" Finally, Raniere argues that there was no evidence that  the sexual acts were ""coerced"" as required by 18 U.S.C.  § 1591. The statute defines ""coercion"" to include  ""threats  of  serious [**24]   harm,""  18  U.S.C.  §  1591(e)(2)(A), and the statute in turn defines ""serious  harm"" to mean: any harm, whether physical or nonphysical,  including psychological, financial, or reputational  harm, that is sufficiently serious, under all the  surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable  person of the same background and in the same  circumstances to perform or to continue performing  commercial sexual activity in order to avoid  incurring that harm. Id. § 1591(e)(5). Nicole testified that she felt that she had ""[n]o choice"" in  complying with Mack's instruction to ""tell [Raniere] that  [she] would do anything that he asked [her] to do."" Gov.  App'x 756 (testimony of Nicole). She further testified that  she had submitted ""collateral"" to Mack in the form of,  inter alia, letters implicating her family members in  criminal activity, a sexually explicit video, and a letter  about a prominent former romantic partner that could  ""ruin [Nicole's] career."" Id. at 740. Nicole testified that  she understood that breaking her ""commitment"" to DOS  and her ""master"" would mean that her ""collateral"" would  be released. Id. at 746. Once again, Raniere has failed to persuade us that  there is insufficient evidence to sustain his convictions.  Any rational trier [**25]  of fact could have found  coercion beyond a reasonable doubt."
United States v. Robinson.pdf,"[*26]  JA.C, Circuit Judge: Defendant-appellant Devon Robinson appeals from the  January 26, 2011 judgment of the United States District  Court for the Eastern District of New York (John  Gleeson, Judge), convicting him, following a jury trial, on  two counts of sex trafficking of a minor in violation of  18 U.S.C. § 1591. On an issue of first impression, we  consider the appropriate construction of 18 U.S.C. §  1591(c), an evidentiary provision added by the HN1[ ]  William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008 (""TVPRA""), Pub. L. No.  110-457, 122 Stat. 5044 (2008), which provides that ""[i]n  a prosecution . . . in which the defendant had a  reasonable opportunity to  [**3] observe the [victim], the  Government need not prove that the defendant knew  that the person had not attained the age of 18 years."" 18  U.S.C. § 1591(c) (Supp. II 2008). We hold that this  provision, when applicable, imposes strict liability with  regard to the defendant's awareness of the victim's age,  thus relieving the government's usual burden to prove  knowledge or reckless disregard of the victim's  underage status under § 1591(a). We reject Robinson's  remaining evidentiary and sentencing challenges as  lacking merit, and therefore affirm the judgment of the  District Court. BACKGROUND On April 14, 2010, a federal grand jury returned a  superseding indictment charging Devon Robinson with  three counts of child sex trafficking in violation of 18  U.S.C. § 1591. Two counts proceeded to trial, both  relating to a single minor victim, Jane Doe, who was  born on April 5, 1991. These two counts corresponded  to the two versions of § 1591 in effect when Robinson is  alleged to have trafficked Jane Doe. Count One, as  renumbered at trial, charged sex trafficking  [*27]  of  a minor under the amended version of § 1591 and  covered the period from December 23, 2008, when the  amendments took effect, through April  [**4] 5, 2009,        702 F.3d 22, *22; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **2 Page 6 of 16 when Jane Doe turned eighteen. Count Two charged  sex trafficking of a minor under the preceding version  of § 1591(a) and covered the period from January 1,  2007 through December 22, 2008.                                              A. The Trial A jury trial commenced before Judge Gleeson in the  Eastern District of New York on June 21, 2010. During  trial, the government called Jane Doe—who at that time  was nineteen years old—to testify. After she invoked the  Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination  and was granted immunity, the government received  permission to treat her as a hostile witness. She testified  that she had run away from home on several occasions  in her early teenage years, and had dropped out of high  school at the age of seventeen. While in high school,  Jane Doe began to work as an exotic dancer at a strip  club and as a prostitute. She was arrested several times  for and convicted of prostitution in Queens, New York, in  2008 and 2009. Jane Doe testified that she met  Robinson through his sister two and a half years prior to  the trial and started dating him when she was  seventeen. She also testified that she  [**7] told  ""everybody"" that she was nineteen at the time.  Throughout the trial, Jane Doe insisted that Robinson  was her boyfriend rather than her pimp, and that he was  only living off of her income as a prostitute rather than  facilitating that line of work. The balance of the evidence against Robinson  consisted primarily of recorded statements. On July 18,  2008, Robinson made a videotaped statement to a  detective and an assistant district attorney (""ADA"") in  the Queens County District Attorney's Office, in which  he admitted that he had been staying with his ""girlfriend""  Jane Doe at the Courtesy Hotel in Hempstead, New  York, for about three months and that Jane Doe paid for  their room. The videotaped statement included the  following exchange: ADA: You gotta, the obvious thing[ ] [is] you got to  be real with us[.]  [*28]  DR: But I ain't gonna say I'm a pimp though.  But you know. ADA: You watch out for them and they give you  money[.] DR: They take care of me. Word[.] ADA: I think that's by definition a pimp[.]        702 F.3d 22, *27; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **4 Page 7 of 16 DR: (laughter) * * * DR: [Robinson admitted to having promoted  prostitution on an occasion in the past.] So I  stopped it. So I tried to do something else. You feel  what I'm saying? ADA: That's when you  [**8] moved on to the  prostitution. DR: Exactly. Tried to do something else. And  awright [sic], it worked for a little while. Gov't App'x 11. The prosecution also introduced thirty- five recorded telephone calls that Robinson made from  various detention facilities between July 20, 2008, and  April 10, 2010. As demonstrated in the following  excerpts, Robinson repeatedly implored Jane Doe to  make money for him: September 2, 2008: ""You're gonna make that bread  tonight, right baby? . . . . So you're gonna make  daddy happy when I call you in the morning?"" Id. at  29. September 7, 2008: ""Listen, every night, you give  [Robinson's grandmother] 200 f***ing dollars man . .  . . [J]ust make 200 tomorrow, give all that sh** to  my grandma man. . . . [T]onight, yo, you better on  some real sh** man, like these next 7 days man. 2,  4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. Yo man, that's 1400. 200 dollars  every mother f***ing day to my grandmother for the  next 7 days man."" Id. at 48, 50, 54. September 9, 2008: ""Can you please make me  happy baby? That's all, man. That's all I want you to  do man is just to get that money out for me baby. . .  . How hard is it, right? Every date that you go on,  right, when you finish with the date, how hard   [**9] is it to get the date to drop you off on 115?""  Id. at 58, 62. In other conversations, Robinson threatened Jane Doe  when she failed to deliver the money: September 16, 2008: ""Word to my mother . . . if my  grandmas have to bail me out, when I come home  I'm not f***in with you no more and I'm gonna beat  the sh** out of you . . . I'm gonna beat the sh** out  of you stupid slut a** man."" Id. at 101. September  26, 2008: ""I'm ready to send a bit** over there to  wash you the f*** up . . . . I said I'm ready to send,  I'm ready to send somebody over there to f*** you    up man. . . . All right, listen I'm gonna get the last  laugh man. Always remember that, when I come  home I'm gonna have the last laugh. Cause I'm  gonna beat the sh** out of your stupid a**. Word to  mother I'ma throw you in a f***ing garbage can and  let everybody know you ain't sh**. . . . [S]tupid bit**,  f*** you talking about[?] Yo, just make sure man  you get that money tonight man. And you take that  to my grandmother man on some real sh** man.""  Id. at 110, 113. October 4, 2008: Jane Doe: ""If I was to ever leave you, what  would you do?"" Robinson: ""Kill your a**."" Jane Doe: ""Didn't you use to say till death do  us part? . . . . What does  [**10] that mean?  You're gonna kill me before I leave right?""  [*29]  Robinson: ""Yeap, kill you."" Id. at 132. During other phone calls, Robinson discussed women  named ""Angie"" and ""Creame."" For instance, in an  October 11, 2008 call, Robinson told his cousin, Tykim,  that when he got out of jail, ""Creame is back in my  possession."" Robinson also said that he spoke to  Creame and that she was ""ready to come back to her  n***er"" and that Robinson told her ""just stay where  you're at though right now man I'll be home soon man.  You're coming back to a pimp."" Id. at 140. B. The Verdict and Sentence On June 24, 2010, the jury returned a guilty verdict on  both counts of sex trafficking of a minor in violation of  § 1591. The jury also found by special verdict that  Robinson (1) knew that Jane Doe was under the age of  eighteen, (2) recklessly disregarded that fact, and (3)  that he had a reasonable opportunity to observe Jane  Doe. On January 21, 2011, Robinson was sentenced  principally to 180 months of imprisonment on each  count, to run concurrently, followed by five years of  supervised release. Judgment was entered on January  26, 2011. This appeal  [**11] followed. DISCUSSION Section 1591 was first enacted as part of the  Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (""TVPA""),  702 F.3d 22, *28; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **6 Page 8 of 16 Pub. L. No. 106-386, 114 Stat. 1464 (Oct. 28, 2000),  the stated purpose of which was ""to combat trafficking  in persons, a contemporary manifestation of slavery  whose victims are predominantly women and children,  to ensure just and effective punishment of traffickers,  and to protect their victims."" 22 U.S.C. § 7101(a) (2002).  HN4[ ] The TVPA defined as ""severe forms of  trafficking in persons"" the two forms of sex trafficking  proscribed by § 1591—sex trafficking involving a  commercial sex act ""induced by force, fraud, or  coercion,"" or in which the person induced to perform the  sex act was under the age of eighteen. Id. § 7102(8)(A)  (2000). Under the TVPA, a conviction for child sex  trafficking under § 1591 required proof, inter alia, that  the defendant acted ""knowing . . . that the person has  not attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act . . . ."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a) (2000) (emphasis supplied). Section 1591  [**12] was amended by the William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008 (""TVPRA""), Pub. L. No.  110-457, 122 Stat. 5044 (2008), which took effect on  December 23, 2008. Under the amended version of §  1591, a defendant could be convicted of child sex  trafficking upon a showing, inter alia, that he acted  ""knowing, or in reckless disregard of the fact . . . that the  person has not attained the age of 18 years and will be  caused to engage in a commercial sex act."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a) (Supp. II 2008) (emphasis supplied).HN5[ ]   The TVPRA  [*30]  also added a new subsection (c),  which provides as follows: In a prosecution under subsection (a)(1) in which  the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to  observe the person so recruited, enticed, harbored,  transported, provided, obtained or maintained, the                 Government need not prove that the defendant  knew that the person had not attained the age of 18  years. Id. § 1591(c) (Supp. II 2008). The proper construction of  the new § 1591(c) is an issue of first impression in our  Circuit. As noted above, Count One charged Robinson with sex  trafficking of a minor, in violation of the amended  version of § 1591, while Count Two charged him with  sex trafficking of a minor, in violation of the previous  version of § 1591. On appeal, Robinson primarily  contests his knowledge or reckless disregard of Jane  Doe's status as a minor. Specifically, Robinson argues  that his conviction should be reversed because (1) the  District Court erred by instructing the jury that he could  be convicted upon a showing that he had a ""reasonable  opportunity"" to observe Jane Doe, and (2) evidence was  insufficient to prove that he knew or recklessly  disregarded that Jane Doe was a minor. Robinson also  argues (3) that  [**14] the District Court erred by  admitting certain recorded telephone calls, and (4) that  his  sentence  of  180  months  was  procedurally  unreasonable. We address these arguments in turn. A. The Jury Instructions on Count One Robinson challenges the jury instructions on Count One,  which charged him with sex trafficking of a minor, in  violation of the amended version of § 1591. Robinson's  argument  focuses  on  the  statute's  mens  rea  requirement with regard to his awareness that Jane Doe  was a minor. The District Court charged the jury, in  relevant part, that ""[t]o prove Count One, the  government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt . . .  that [the defendant] knew that Jane Doe had not  attained the age of eighteen years, or he recklessly  disregarded that fact, or he had a reasonable  opportunity to observe Jane Doe."" Joint App'x 215. In  other  words,  the  District  Court  identified  three  independent ways of proving criminal liability with  respect to Robinson's awareness of Jane Doe's status  as a minor: (1) he knew that she was under eighteen,  (2) he recklessly disregarded the fact that she was  under eighteen, or (3) he had a reasonable opportunity  to observe her. On appeal, where our HN6[ ] review of jury  instructions  [**15] for legal error is de novo, United  States v. Kozeny, 667 F.3d 122, 130 (2d Cir. 2011), the  parties present two widely divergent interpretations of  the statute. Robinson argues that § 1591(c) is a  702 F.3d 22, *29; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **11 Page 9 of 16 conjunctive requirement, meaning the government must  prove both that he had a reasonable opportunity to  observe Jane Doe and that he recklessly disregarded  her age. In support of this view, he cites the only federal  decision addressing this question. See United States v.  Wilson, No. 10-60102-CR, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  75149, 2010 WL 2991561 (S.D. Fla. July 27, 2010),  report and recommendation adopted by 2010 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 83178, 2010 WL 3239211 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 16,  2010). In Wilson, the district court adopted the  magistrate judge's report and recommendation, which  stated that ""where the Government elects to proceed  under the reckless disregard level of mens rea, Section  1591(c) requires the Government to prove beyond a  reasonable doubt not only that the defendant acted in  reckless disregard [of the victim's status as a minor], but  also that the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to  observe the person recruited."" 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  75149, [WL] at *7.  [*31]  By contrast, the government defends the District  Court's instructions, arguing that the word ""knew"" in §  1591(c) refers to  [**16] knowledge and reckless  disregard, thus creating a freestanding alternative to  proving either of the mens rea alternatives in § 1591(a).  See Gov't Br. 43 (""The district court correctly read §  1591(c) to mean that the government need not prove  the knowledge element—whether under a knowing or  reckless disregard standard—in cases where the  defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the  victim."" (emphasis in original)). Robinson responds to the government's interpretation  by pointing out that the amended version of § 1591(a)  requires the government to prove ""know[ledge]"" or  ""reckless disregard,"" whereas § 1591(c) mentions only  that in certain circumstances the government need not  prove that the defendant ""knew"" that the victim was a  minor. Compare 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) (Supp. II 2008)  (defendant must have acted ""knowing, or in reckless  disregard of the fact, that . . . the person has not  attained the age of 18 years""), with id. § 1591(c) (Supp.  II 2008) (in certain circumstances, ""the Government  need not prove that the defendant knew that the person  had not attained the age of 18 years""). Based on this  discrepancy,  Robinson  frames  the  government's  argument as an unwarranted effort ""to  [**17] insert  language into a statute in the interest of achieving  symmetry."" Appellant's Br. 43; see also Duncan v.  Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 173, 121 S. Ct. 2120, 150 L. Ed.  2d 251 (2001) (""[W]here Congress includes particular  language in one section of a statute but omits it in  another section of the same Act, it is generally  presumed  that  Congress  acts  intentionally  and  purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.""  (quotation marks omitted)). HN7[ ] We must begin, of course, with the plain  language of the statute, and ""our inquiry must cease if  the statutory language is unambiguous . . . and the  statutory scheme is coherent and consistent."" Schindler  Elevator Corp. v. United States ex rel. Kirk, 131 S. Ct.  1885, 1893, 179 L. Ed. 2d 825 (2011) (alterations and  internal quotation marks omitted). ""The plainness or  ambiguity of statutory language is determined by  reference to the language itself, the specific context in  which that language is used, and the broader context of  the statute as a whole."" Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519  U.S. 337, 341, 117 S. Ct. 843, 136 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1997).  ""In interpreting the statute at issue, we consider not only  the bare meaning of the critical word or phrase but also  its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.""  Holloway v. United States, 526 U.S. 1, 6, 119 S. Ct.  966, 143 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1999)  [**18] (alteration and  internal quotation marks omitted). Or, as Justice Scalia  observed in another context, ""the words of a statute are  not to be read in isolation; statutory interpretation is a  'holistic endeavor.'"" Regions Hosp. v. Shalala, 522 U.S.  448, 466, 118 S. Ct. 909, 139 L. Ed. 2d 895 (1998)  (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting United Sav. Assn. of  Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Assocs., Ltd., 484  U.S. 365, 371, 108 S. Ct. 626, 98 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1988)). Robinson's interpretation is mistaken. The text and  structure of the statute do not indicate that § 1591(c)  imposes an additional element on top of the mens rea  requirement in § 1591(a). Quite to the contrary, §  1591(c) states what the government ""need not prove.""  18 U.S.C. § 1591(c) (Supp. II 2008) (emphasis  supplied). The better reading of § 1591(c) is that HN8[ ] the  government may prove that the defendant had a  reasonable opportunity to view the victim in lieu of  proving knowledge.  [*32]  In relevant part, § 1591(c)  reads: where ""the defendant had a reasonable  opportunity to observe the [victim], the Government  need not prove that the defendant knew that the person  had not attained the age of 18 years."" Id. Viewed in  context, the most natural reading of this provision is that  proof  that  the  defendant  had  a  reasonable   [**19] opportunity to observe the victim may substitute  for proof that the defendant knew the victim's underage  status. Because § 1591(a) requires proof of knowledge  or reckless disregard—not both—the government may  satisfy its burden by proving knowledge or the substitute  702 F.3d 22, *30; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **15 Page 10 of 16 for knowledge under § 1591(c). Accordingly, § 1591(c)  supplies an alternative to proving any mens rea with  regard to the defendant's awareness of the victim's age.  This reading gives force to the provision's obvious  goal—to reduce the government's burden where the  defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the  victim. This commonsensical understanding of § 1591(c) also  vindicates ""the cardinal rule that, HN9[ ] if possible,  effect shall be given to every clause and part of a  statute."" RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated  Bank, 132 S. Ct. 2065, 2071, 182 L. Ed. 2d 967 (2012)  (quotation marks omitted); see also Duncan, 533 U.S. at  174 (""It is our duty to give effect, if possible, to every  clause and word of a statute."" (quotation marks  omitted)). If Robinson were correct that § 1591(c)'s use  of the word ""knew"" did not remove the usual mens rea  requirement, then § 1591(c) would add nothing to the  statute.  That  is  because  by  including  reckless   [**20] disregard as one of the mens rea options, §  1591(a) already provides that a defendant may be  proved guilty without having known that the victim was a  minor. In sum, HN10[ ] the plain reading of § 1591(c),  and the only interpretation that preserves any meaning,  is that the provision creates strict liability where the  defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the  victim. Accordingly, just as the District Court instructed,  § 1591(a) and § 1591(c) provide the government with  three distinct options—prove beyond a reasonable  doubt that: (1) the defendant had knowledge of the  victim's underage status; (2) that the defendant  recklessly disregarded that fact; or (3) that the  defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the  victim. We are mindful that HN11[ ] criminal statutes are  generally construed to include mens rea requirements.  See Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 605-06,  114 S. Ct. 1793, 128 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1994); United  States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 437-38, 98 S.  Ct. 2864, 57 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1978). But that presumption  does not apply to sex crimes against minors, see  Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 251 n.8, 72  S. Ct. 240, 96 L. Ed. 288 (1952), at least when ""the  perpetrator confronts the underage victim personally,""  United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 72  n.2, 115 S. Ct. 464, 130 L. Ed. 2d 372 (1994).      [**21] Moreover, the presumption applies  [*33]  when  someone engages in ""otherwise innocent conduct,""  including constitutionally protected conduct, id. at 72,  and thus has little purchase for Robinson, who was  engaged in sex trafficking. See United States v.  Griffith, 284 F.3d 338, 351 (2d Cir. 2002) (""[A] defendant  is already on notice that he is committing a crime when  he transports an individual of any age in interstate  commerce for the purpose of prostitution.""); see also X- Citement Video, 513 U.S. at 73 n.3 (""Criminal intent  serves to separate those who understand the wrongful  nature of their act from those who do not, but does not  require knowledge of the precise consequences that  may flow from that act once aware that the act is  wrongful.""); cf., e.g., United States v. Feola, 420 U.S.  671, 684, 95 S. Ct. 1255, 43 L. Ed. 2d 541 (1975)  (holding that ""to effectuate the congressional purpose of  according maximum protection to federal officers,"" a  federal criminal statute punishing assaults against  federal officers ""cannot be construed as embodying an  unexpressed requirement that an assailant be aware  that his victim is a federal officer""). Our interpretation of § 1591(c) also maintains uniformity  with the other federal child-protective statutes that use  nearly identical language and that have been interpreted  to ""lack [ ] mens rea requirements with respect to [the  victim's] age."" United States v. Jennings, 496 F.3d 344,  353 (4th Cir. 2007). For example, in 18 U.S.C. § 2241  and § 2243—two provisions that punish sexual abuse of  children—Congress drafted subsections labeled ""[s]tate  of mind proof  [**23] requirement,"" which explain that  ""the Government need not prove that the defendant  knew"" the victim was a minor. 18 U.S.C. § 2241(d), §  2243(d). Courts have uniformly interpreted these                         702 F.3d 22, *32; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **19 Page 11 of 16 provisions as disclaiming mens rea requirements with  respect to the victim's age. See, e.g., United States v.  White Calf, 634 F.3d 453, 457 (8th Cir. 2011)  (addressing § 2243(d)); United States v. Ransom, 942  F.2d 775, 776 n.1 (10th Cir. 1991) (addressing §  2241(d)); see also Jennings, 496 F.3d at 352-53  (addressing both sections and applying the same  principle to § 2244); United States v. Juvenile Male, 211  F.3d 1169, 1171 (9th Cir. 2000) (addressing § 2241(c)).  Moreover, one of these provisions—§ 2241(d)— evidently was the template for § 1591(c). Having used  identical language, Congress obviously intended the  same principle to apply with respect to § 1591(c), thus  making the defendant's awareness of the victim's age   [*34]  irrelevant when the defendant had a reasonable  opportunity to observe the victim. Finally, we note that § 1591(c)'s drafting history further  supports  [**25] our textual analysis. The legislative  reform that culminated in the adoption of § 1591(c) in  the 2008 amendments began in the House of  Representatives with a bill that would have left  knowledge as the only mental state referenced in §  1591(a) but would have added the following provision:  ""In a prosecution under this subsection, the Government  need not prove that the defendant knew that the person  had not attained the age of 18 years."" H.R. 3887, 110th  Cong. § 221 (as passed by H.R., Dec. 4, 2007). The  House bill thus proposed to make the trafficking of  minors into a strict-liability crime with respect to a  defendant's awareness of the victim's age, even if the                            defendant never observed the victim. The members of  the Senate Judiciary Committee apparently disfavored  this strict-liability option and instead reported a bill  adding ""or in reckless disregard"" to the mens rea  requirement in § 1591(a). S. 3061, 110th Cong. § 222  (as reported by S. Comm. on the Judiciary, Sept. 8,  2008). The House then responded by passing another  bill, this time keeping the proposed mens rea language  from the reported Senate bill but adding the provision  that now appears in § 1591(c)—providing that when ""the  defendant  [**26] had a reasonable opportunity to  observe"" the victim, ""the Government need not prove  that the defendant knew that the person had not  attained the age of 18 years."" H.R. 7311, 110th Cong. §  222 (as passed by H.R. Dec. 10, 2008). This drafting  history helps clarify what is already apparent when  reading § 1591 in its entirety: The government need not  prove any mens rea with regard to the defendant's  awareness of the victim's age if the defendant had a  reasonable opportunity to observe the victim. Given this holding, we conclude that the District Court  did not err in giving the three-part jury instruction. HN12[ ] In a prosecution under § 1591, the government may  satisfy its burden of proof with respect to the defendant's  awareness of the victim's age by proving any of the  following beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the defendant  knew that the victim was under eighteen, (2) the  defendant recklessly disregarded the fact that the victim  was under eighteen, or (3) the defendant had a  reasonable opportunity to observe the victim. B. The Sufficiency Challenge Robinson raises sufficiency challenges on Counts One                  702 F.3d 22, *33; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **24 Page 12 of 16 and Two, arguing that the government failed to present  sufficient evidence that he either knew or recklessly  disregarded Jane Doe's minor status. HN13[ ] When  reviewing a sufficiency challenge, we will uphold the  judgments of conviction if ""any rational trier of fact could  have found the essential elements of the crime beyond  a reasonable doubt."" Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307,  319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979). As we   [*35]  have  [**28] often stated, this standard is  ""exceedingly deferential,"" to the jury's role as factfinder.  United States v. Hassan, 578 F.3d 108, 126 (2d Cir.  2008). ""In considering such a challenge, we must view  the evidence in the light most favorable to the  government, crediting every inference that could have  been drawn in the government's favor, and deferring to  the jury's assessment of witness credibility, and its  assessment of the weight of the evidence."" United  States v. Chavez, 549 F.3d 119, 124 (2d Cir. 2008)  (internal citations, alterations, and internal quotation  marks omitted). Robinson primarily argues that the evidence was  insufficient to prove his knowledge or reckless disregard  of Jane Doe's status as a minor because Jane Doe  testified repeatedly that she told Robinson, his family,  and ""everybody"" she was nineteen. When she was  arrested for prostitution, Jane Doe also told the police  she was nineteen; the police were able to determine her  true age only by producing her arrest record (or ""rap  sheet""). Robinson also cites the testimony of Donald  Smith, who worked at a hotel frequented by Robinson  and Jane Doe, and who testified that an African  American female staying with Robinson appeared   [**29] to be ""maybe 21, 22"" years old. The government responds by pointing out that  Robinson's ""reasonable opportunity to observe"" Jane  Doe was ""a highly relevant circumstance from which an  inference of knowledge or reckless disregard can be  drawn."" Gov't Br. 37. For example, in a call recorded on  January 5, 2010 (when Jane Doe was eighteen years  old), Jane Doe stated that she and Robinson had ""been  together"" every weekend ""for like three years."" In  another  conversation,  Robinson  and  Jane  Doe  discussed her birthday. The government argues that  even if people who interacted with Jane Doe on a short- term or casual basis could be deceived about her age,  ""it would strain credulity to suggest that someone who  had known her as long and as intimately as Robinson  would not have learned her true age."" Gov't Br. 39.    Finally, the jury had an opportunity to observe Jane Doe  testify at trial, when she was nineteen years old, and  also to view several photographs of Jane Doe taken  before she turned eighteen. The government concludes  that it was well within the province of the jury to find that  Jane Doe's appearance  [**30] and demeanor were  such that her status as a minor would have been  obvious to someone intimately involved in her life. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the  government, see Evans v. United States, 504 U.S. 255,  257, 112 S. Ct. 1881, 119 L. Ed. 2d 57 (1992), we  conclude that the record supports the jury's finding of  guilt on Counts One and Two. With regard to Count  One, it is uncontested that Robinson had a ""reasonable  opportunity to observe"" Jane Doe when he was causing  her to engage in commercial sex acts as a minor, and,  as explained above, that showing satisfies the  government's burden under the amended statute. See  18 U.S.C. § 1591(c) (Supp. II 2008). Therefore, we  reject Robinson's sufficiency argument with respect to  Count One. And, even if we disregarded § 1591(c), the  jury still had sufficient evidence under the amended  version of § 1591(a) to render its special verdict with  respect to Robinson's reckless disregard of Jane Doe's  status as a minor. A reasonable jury could conclude that  Robinson's ability to personally observe his underage  victim, especially given  [*36]  their intimate relationship,  put him on notice of an unjustifiably high risk that she  was underage. See note 9, ante. For the same  [**31] reasons, a reasonable jury also  could conclude, both with respect to the Count One time  period and the Count Two time period, that Robinson  knew that Jane Doe was under the age of eighteen at  the time he was causing her to engage in commercial  sex acts within those respective time spans. The  government's case rested on circumstantial evidence,  but HN14[ ] ""the mens rea elements of knowledge and  intent can often be proved through circumstantial  evidence  and  the  reasonable  inferences  drawn  therefrom."" United States v. MacPherson, 424 F.3d 183,  189 (2d Cir. 2005). In fact, ""[a] verdict of guilty may be  based entirely on circumstantial evidence as long as the  inferences of culpability drawn from the circumstances  are reasonable."" Id. at 190. Moreover, our role in  reviewing  sufficiency  arguments  is  ""exceedingly  deferential,"" Hassan, 578 F.3d at 126, because ""it is the  task of the jury, not the court, to choose among  competing inferences,"" MacPherson, 424 F.3d at 190  (quotation marks omitted). A reasonable jury could determine, based on the  702 F.3d 22, *34; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **27 Page 13 of 16 evidence of the relationship between Robinson and  Jane Doe, that during both relevant time periods  Robinson was aware of Jane Doe's status as a minor,  especially  [**32] given that their relationship began  before Jane Doe dropped out of high school during her  junior year. The jury also had an opportunity to witness  Jane Doe's appearance at trial in June 2010 when she  was nineteen, and based on that appearance jurors  could have inferred that Robinson knew that Jane Doe  was a minor both before and after the statutory  amendment in December 2008. See, e.g., United States  v. Brooks, 610 F.3d 1186, 1197 (9th Cir. 2010) (jury's  ""opportunity to consider [the victim's] appearance during  her testimony, at which time she was eighteen,"" was  among the evidence sufficient to show defendant's  knowledge that the victim was a minor). While this  evidence by no means required the jury to infer  Robinson's knowledge of Jane Doe's underage status,  looking at the evidence as a whole and drawing all  reasonable inferences in the government's favor, we  cannot say that no rational trier of fact could have found  beyond a reasonable doubt that Robinson knew that  Jane Doe was a minor. C. The Evidentiary Rulings Robinson also challenges the admission of recorded  telephone calls that included evidence of his relationship  with other prostitutes and evidence that he threatened  and used  [**33] force against Jane Doe. HN15[ ] We  review a district court's evidentiary rulings with  deference, ""mindful of its superior position to assess  relevancy and to weigh the probative value of evidence  against its potential for unfair prejudice."" United States  v. Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d 102, 131 (2d Cir. 2010). ""We  will reverse an evidentiary ruling only for 'abuse of  discretion.'"" Id.; see also In re Sims, 534 F.3d 117, 132  (2d Cir. 2008) (explaining that the term of art ""abuse of  discretion"" includes errors of law). 1. Evidence Regarding Robinson's Relationship with  Other Prostitutes First, Robinson argues that the District Court erred by  admitting several recorded telephone calls in which  Robinson discussed his former, current, or prospective  control of other prostitutes, including Angie and Creame.  Robinson  asserts  that  this  evidence  served  to  demonstrate  only  his  propensity  to  engage  in  prostitution-related  activity,  and  was  therefore  inadmissible  [*37]  under Rule 404(b) of the Federal  Rules of Evidence. In this case, the District Court held that the  conversations that made reference to other prostitutes  did not constitute ""other act"" evidence within the  meaning of Rule 404(b), and therefore admitted the  conversations as proof of the nature of the relationship  between Robinson and Jane Doe. In particular, the  District Court noted that ""a critical factual dispute"" in the  case was whether the relationship between Robinson  and Jane Doe could be ""characterized as the  relationship between a pimp and a prostitute."" Joint  App'x 97. The District Court concluded that the  conversations in which Robinson discussed other  prostitutes ""shed important light [on] whether or not  Jane Doe was a prostitute working with or for the  defendant."" Id. We find no error in that decision. HN17[ ] Evidence of  uncharged criminal conduct is not evidence of ""other  crimes, wrongs, or acts"" under Rule 404(b) if that  conduct ""arose out of  [**35] the same transaction or  series of transactions as the charged offense, if it is  inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the  charged offense, or if it is necessary to complete the  story of the crime on trial."" United States v. Carboni, 204  F.3d 39, 44 (2d Cir. 2000) (quotation marks omitted);  see also United States v. Quinones, 511 F.3d 289, 309  (2d Cir. 2007). Robinson argued at trial that Jane Doe  was his ""girlfriend"" and that he had no control over her  prostitution activities. Evidence that Robinson was in the  prostitution business and controlled prostitutes other  than Jane Doe was therefore ""necessary to complete  the story of the crime on trial."" Carboni, 204 F.3d at 44  (quotation marks omitted); see also United States v.  Curley, 639 F.3d 50, 59 (2d Cir. 2011) (holding that  defendant's  prior  uncharged  acts  of  abuse  demonstrated ""a pattern of activity that continued up to  the time of the charged conduct,"" and were therefore              702 F.3d 22, *36; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **31 Page 14 of 16 probative of the defendant's intent). Robinson also argues that, because he had stipulated  that he had ""promoted prostitution on an occasion in the  past,"" the District Court erred by failing to exclude the  conversations about other prostitutes as needlessly   [**36] cumulative and unfairly prejudicial under Rule  403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. But contrary to  Robinson's  assertions,  the  recordings  were  not  cumulative of Robinson's stipulation. The stipulation did  not ""complete the story,"" Carboni, 204 F.3d at 44,  because it did not demonstrate the context of  Robinson's conversations with Jane Doe, including Jane  Doe's awareness that Robinson prostituted other  women and her struggles to maintain a preferred status  among those women. Nor was the evidence regarding  the other prostitutes unfairly prejudicial. Indeed, that  evidence was no more inflammatory than the child   [*38]  sex trafficking charges involving Jane Doe. See,  e.g., United States v. Roldan-Zapata, 916 F.2d 795, 804  (2d Cir. 1990) (holding that prior act evidence was not  unduly prejudicial because, in part, it ""did not involve  conduct any more sensational or disturbing than the  crimes with which [the defendant] was charged""). We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its  discretion by admitting the recorded telephone calls  involving other prostitutes as direct proof of the charged  crimes. See Quinones, 511 F.3d at 309. 2. Evidence That Robinson Threatened and Used  Force Against Jane Doe Robinson further contends that the District Court erred  by admitting recorded telephone calls in which he  threatened, among other things, to beat Jane Doe and  to kill her if she were to leave him. Robinson argues that  this evidence was irrelevant because Robinson was  charged with sex trafficking of a minor—not with sex  trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion. We disagree.  Evidence of threats was relevant here because it  addressed the nature of the relationship between  Robinson and Jane Doe. A reasonable juror, for          example, could conclude that Robinson sounded a lot  more like Jane Doe's pimp than her ""boyfriend,"" ""lover,""  or ""best friend,"" when he threatened that, if she did not  have the ""f***ing money,"" he would ""beat the sh** out of  [her] stupid a** . . . [and] throw [her] in a f***ing garbage  can and let everybody know [she] ain't sh**."" Robinson's fallback  [**38] argument, that the threat  evidence caused him unfair prejudice, is equally  unavailing. The sole case Robinson cites in support of  his prejudice argument, United States v. Colombo, 869  F.2d 149 (2d Cir. 1989), is readily distinguishable. In  that case, we reversed a conspiracy conviction where  the district court admitted ""background"" evidence that  the  defendant's  co-conspirators  had  raped  and  sodomized a woman in the course of a robbery— despite the fact that the defendant was not present  during the sexual assault and did not know that it would  occur. Id. at 153. Here, by contrast, Robinson's threats  were not simply gratuitous evidence of violence offered  to show the ""background"" of the charged offense.  Instead, the evidence of these threats related to material  factual disputes at trial. On these facts, we conclude that the District Court did  not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of  Robinson's threats of using force against Jane Doe. D. The Sentencing Challenge Finally, Robinson contends that his sentence of 180  months  of  imprisonment  was  procedurally  unreasonable. HN19[ ] We review a criminal sentence  for reasonableness, which ""amounts to review for abuse  of discretion."" United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180,  187 (2d Cir. 2008)  [**39] (en banc). ""Reasonableness  review requires an examination of the length of the  sentence (substantive reasonableness) as well as the  procedure employed in arriving at the sentence  (procedural  reasonableness).""  United  States  v.  Johnson, 567 F.3d 40, 51 (2d Cir. 2009). A district court  commits procedural error where it fails to calculate (or  improperly calculates) the Sentencing Guidelines range,  treats the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, fails to  consider the § 3553(a) factors, selects a sentence  based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails adequately to  explain the chosen sentence. Gall v. United States, 552  U.S. 38, 51, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445 (2007). Robinson's entire sentencing claim rests on a single  word in the District Court's remarks at the sentencing  proceeding, as highlighted in the following passage: 702 F.3d 22, *37; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **34 Page 15 of 16  [*39]  The driving factors of this sentence have to  be, in my judgment . . . this very chilling, really,  ownership of [Jane Doe] by the defendant and the  threats . . . that he wasn't kidding around when he  said he was going to come home and beat her up,  the evidence in the conversations themselves that  he had done that in the past and she still came  back, and the use of that control to force them on  her, and  [**40] I mean force. I listened to her testimony. I mean, she was an  impressive young woman, I thought, but she was a  minor in the situation she was in and, make no  mistake about it, no matter what she says, she was  coerced as a minor to prostitute herself by this  defendant. That bundle of activity—the ownership of a person,  the threatening, the physical abuse, forcing them to  become a prostitute—is so much more worthy of . .  . condemnation expressed in the form of jail time  than most of the federal crimes we see. Joint App'x 261-62 (emphasis supplied). Robinson  contends that the highlighted word demonstrates a  ""significant procedural error,"" Gall, 552 U.S. at 51,  because there was no evidence that he forced Jane  Doe ""to become a prostitute"" in the first instance. We  disagree. The clear import of the District Court's  remarks, taken as a whole, was not that Robinson had  corrupted an otherwise innocent victim, but that he had  taken control of Jane Doe and forced her to engage in  prostitution. For example, the tapes contain numerous  conversations in which Robinson coerced Jane Doe to  prostitute herself when she was reluctant or unwilling to  do so. We find no error, procedural or otherwise, in the   [**41] District Court's commentary on the nature of the  relationship between Robinson and his victim, or in the  Court's sentencing decision."
"United States v. Smith, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217838.pdf","[*1] ORDER ON DEFENDANTS' JOINT MOTION TO  COMPEL DISCLOSURE OF VICTIM'S NAME, DATE OF BIRTH, AND CRIMINAL  HISTORY THIS CAUSE is before the Court on the Defendants  Xavier Latrell Smith and Jayla Denice Welch (""Defendants"") Joint Motion to Compel  Disclosure of Victim's Name, Date of Birth, and Criminal History, (""Motion"") ECF No. [75]. The  Government filed a Response, ECF No. [93], and  Defendants filed a Reply, ECF No. [100]. The Court has  considered the Motion, the Government's Response, the Defendants' Reply, the  record and applicable law, and is otherwise fully  advised. Defendants' Motion is granted. I. BACKGROUND Defendants are charged by Indictment with Conspiracy  to Commit Sex Trafficking (Count I), Sex Trafficking of a  Minor (Count II), Transporting a Minor to Engage in  Sexual Activity (Count III), Coercion and Enticement of a  Minor to Engage in Sexual Activity (Count IV),  Commission of Sex Offense by Registered Sex  Offender (Smith) (Counts V and VI). See ECF No. 1 CASE NO. 23-20122-CR-BLOOM [3].  Separate  Arraignments  were  held  for  the  Defendants on April 7, 2023, and June 13, 2023,  ordering all parties to comply with Local Rule 88.10  (Criminal Discovery). ECF Nos. [11], [34]. The Standing  Orders advised the [*2]  parties that upon a properly  filed Motion, the Court could order that responsive  discovery or inspection be ""denied, restricted, or  deferred."" Id. On April 21, 2023, and June 26, 2023, this Court  entered Protective Orders to protect the Minor Victim  from any public, or general disclosures. See ECF Nos.  [20], [38]. Provisions in the Protective Orders include:  Counsels for both parties shall not provide materials  subject to the standing order to any person unless  provide by the Order or with prior Court approval;  Defendants may only possess Confidential materials in  the presence of their counsel and as necessary to  prepare for the case; counsel for both parties shall only  refer to the victim as ""Minor Victim"" in any public filing or  under seal; counsel for the Defendants must ensure that  they or any necessary third party that obtains access  also receive a copy of this Court's Protective Order;  counsel for both parties must destroy or cause to be  destroyed all copies of materials responsive to this  standing order. Id. The Defendants now seeks an Order from this Court  requiring the Government to disclose the victim's name,  date of birth, and criminal history. The Defendants  Page 2 of 5 assert this information [*3]  is material to prepare their  defenses, complete their independent due diligence  investigations, and otherwise adequately prepare for  trial. Id. at 1. Defendants argue that Brady v. Maryland,  373 U.S. 83 (1963), Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S.  150 (1972), Local Rule 88.10(o)(2), the Federal Rules of  Criminal Procedure, and the Fifth and the Sixth  Amendments to the United States Constitution support  their Motion. Id. at 2-3. 2 CASE NO. 23-20122-CR-BLOOM The Government responds that Defendant's Motion  should be denied because the Defendants are not  entitled to Minor Victim's identity at this stage of the  proceedings and neither the United States Constitution  nor Rule 16 require the Government to disclose said  information. II. LEGAL STANDARD Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure ""is  the primary rule governing pretrial discovery in criminal  cases, and it 'spells out the materials the prosecution  must produce on the defendant's request.'"" United  States v. Russell, No. 22-20348, 2022 WL 17736195, at  *1 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 17, 2022) (quoting United States v.  Jordan, 316 F.3d 1215, 1249 (11th Cir. 2003)). In  addition to the discovery obligations embodied by Rule  16, a criminal defendant's due process rights obligate  the prosecution to disclose information that is favorable  to the defendant and that is material either to guilt or to  punishment. Brady v. Maryland, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963). Favorable evidence for Brady purposes includes both  exculpatory and impeachment evidence. See Giglio v.  United States, 92 S. Ct. 763 (1972); Jordan, 316 F.3d at  1253. But mere ""favorableness"" to the defendant is not enough to  qualify for Brady protections-the information must  also [*4]  be material. Evidence ""is material as long as  there is a strong indication that it will play an important  role in uncovering admissible evidence, aiding witness  preparation,  corroborating  testimony,  or  assisting  impeachment or rebuttal."" United States v. Lloyd, 992  F.2d 348, 351 (D.C.Cir.1993). In Giglio v. U.S., 405 U.S. 150 (1972), the Supreme  Court extended Brady to disclosure of impeachment  material. U.S. v. Singleton, No. 22-14048, 2023 WL  2164588, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 13, 2023). See Jordan,  316 F.3d at 1253. Under Giglio, ""[w]hen the reliability of  a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence,  nondisclosure of evidence affecting credibility"" 3 CASE NO. 23-20122-CR-BLOOM justifies a new trial. Giglio, 405 U.S. at 153-54. The  difference between Brady material and Giglio material is  that Brady information is exculpatory, meaning it ""relates  to evidence which directly tends to lessen a defendant's  guilt,"" while Giglio material is impeaching, meaning that  it relates to ""witness credibility type evidence of a collateral nature...  indirectly making it less likely that the defendant is  guilty."" U.S. v. Hopkins, 2008 WL 4453583, at *2 (E.D.  Cal. Oct. 3, 2008). The purpose of Giglio and its  progeny is ""to insure that the jury knows the facts that  might motivate a witness in giving testimony."" Brown v.  Wainwright, 785 F.2d 1457, 1465 (11th Cir.1986)  (quoting Smith v. Kemp, 715 F.2d 1459, 1467 (11th Cir.), cert.  denied, 464 U.S. 1003, 104 S.Ct. 510, 78 L.Ed.2d 699  (1983)). III. DISCUSSION Defendants assert that due process requires certain  evidence  be  disclosed,  specifically  exculpatory  evidence. Brady 373 U.S. at 87. Moreover, [*5]  Local  Rule 88.10(o)(2) requires that ""[d]iscovery which is to be made in connection with trial  shall be made not later than fourteen (14) days after the  arraignment, or such other time as ordered by the  court."" Id. Defendants asserts that this includes  identification of any government witnesses, promises of  immunity, preferential treatment, or other inducements  falling within Giglio 405 U.S. 250, as embedded in Local  Rule 88.10(d). In support, Defendants cite to Roviaro v.  U.S., 353 U.S. 53 (1957), that there is ""no fixed rule with  respect to disclosure"" rather, balance must be struck  between ""the public interest [] against the individual's  right to prepare his defense."" Id. at 629. The  circumstances of the case, possible defenses, etc., are  among the ""relevant factors"" that may be involved in the  balancing test. Id. One of the relevant factors is ""the possible  significance of the informer's testimony."" Id. Page 3 of 5 Defendants claim that here, Minor Victim is highly  significant to this case, and therefore 4 CASE NO. 23-20122-CR-BLOOM Defendants are likely more entitled to the disclosure of  her identity. ECF No. [75] at 3. Finally, Defendants' state that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments  of the United States Constitution compel disclosure of  Minor Victim's identity as it is essential to their defense.  ECF No. [75] at 2. The Government responds [*6]  that Rule 16 of the  Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure does not entitle  Defendants to Minor Victim's information. ECF No. [93]  at 7. For support, the Government cites to United States v. Fischel, 686 F.2d  1082, 1090 (5th Cir. 1982) (""discovery in criminal cases  is narrowly limited. . . [with] no provision for the  production of [witness] names""); United States v. Belfast, No. 06-20758, 2007 WL  9705938 (Apr. 26, 2007) (""[a]lthough [d]efendant may not have the right to a disclosure of  alleged victim's identity, [the] district court may compel  the Government to identify its witnesses in advance of  the trial to ensure the orderly administration of justice."")  (citing United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296 (2nd Cir.  1976)); and United States v. Green, No. 04 CR.424 (RWS), 2004  WL 2985361 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2004) (""A district court  may compel the government to provide [] a pretrial  disclosure of the identity of the government's witness []  in the exercise of the court's discretion"" but disclosure  ""should not be granted unless the defendant makes 'a  specific showing that disclosure is both material to the  preparation for his defense and reasonable in light of  the circumstances'"") (citations omitted). The Government argues that Defendants have failed to  make a proper showing to warrant disclosure. ECF No.  [93] at 8. The Government attacks Defendants' claim  that they cannot adequately prepare their defense  because the government has provided ""hundreds of  pages of materials"" yet ""much [that] has been made  available [*7]  has yet to be reviewed,"" thus Defendants'  argument is without merit. Id. Furthermore much of the  evidence is already contained within Defendants' cellular phones. Id. 5 CASE NO. 23-20122-CR-BLOOM The Government also contends that Roviaro, 353 U.S.  53 does not require the Government to disclose the  requested information. Instead, the Government ""has  the privilege to withhold from disclosure the identity of  persons who furnish information of violations of law"" to  pertinent law enforcement officials. Id. at 60. However,  the Government concedes that this privilege is not  absolute, noting that if the protected communication  does not reveal an identity, or if the identity has already  been disclosed, the privilege gives way. Id. at 60-61.  The Government points out that ""relevant factors"" in Roviaro serve as a balancing test  on disclosure of identity. Consequently, the Government  reasons that the existence of this balancing test directly  contradicts Defendants' assertion that the Government  is automatically required to disclose the Minor Victim's  identity. ECF No. [93] at 10. Regarding Local Rule 88.10(o)(2), the Government  points out that while the Rule requires that discovery in  connection with the trial be made no later than fourteen  days after arraignment, [*8]  the second clause allows  for differentiated timing: ""or at such other time as  ordered by the court."" The Government argues that if any information it has is  subject to Rule 16, this clause permits withholding the  information without running ""afoul"" of the rule. ECF No.  [93] at 12. The Government does not contend that it  filed a relevant motion as to Local Rule 88.10, or that  this Court made such a ruling. Regarding  Defendants'  Constitutional  claims,  the  Government argues that Defendants only make  superficial allegations as to Constitutional implications in  this case. Id. at [13]. The Government argues that as  Minor Victim's identity is not exculpatory, constitutional  protections are no implicated. Id. 6 CASE NO. 23-20122-CR-BLOOM The Government recognizes that if Minor Victim is  called to testify at trial, then her criminal history (if any  exists)1 would be discoverable under Giglio 405 U.S.  150 ""as materials that could be used to impeach her  credibility."" Id. at 13. Therefore, the Government has  agreed to produce such materials three weeks prior to  trial. Id. Here, the Government distinguishes production  Page 4 of 5 timing of impeachment materials from Rule 16 and  Brady materials, arguing that ""pure"" Giglio materials do not require immediate [*9]   production, rather, the requirement is a sufficient  amount of time for effective use at trial or closer to the  time of the witness' testimony. ECF No. [93] at 13. The  Government relies on United States v. Russell, No. 22- 20348, 2022 WL 17736195 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 17, 2022),  holding that ""the disclosure of 'pure' Giglio materials []  are not set in stone, and that as long as [d]efendant is  afforded enough time to use the materials effectively at  trial, 'there is no violation of his rights from deferring  production of this material until closer to the time of the  witnesses' testimony'"" (quoting United States v. Aiken,  76 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1344-45 (S.D. Fla 1999)). See  also Aiken, 76 F. Supp at 1344 (ordering pure  impeachment  materials  on  plea  and  immunity  agreements, records of convictions, etc. to be produced  within ten business days of that trial and allowing the  Government to make a further showing to defer  disclosure if needed). Defendants reply that the Standing Discovery Orders in  this case require disclosure, ECF No. [100] at 1,  compare ECF Nos. [20], [38]. Further the Government's  ""strained reading"" of 1 Minor Victim could not have consented to her  trafficking. Furthermore, transcripts of the Detention  Hearing as to Defendant Welch have on the record  alleged that Minor Victim asked Defendant Smith ""if she  made  enough  money,  whether  she  would  be  allowed [*10]  to go see her family."" ECF No. [58] at 8.  Furthermore, one of the alleged terms placed upon  Minor Victim by Defendants was a requirement that she  make one thousand dollars per week with all payments  going to defendant Smith. Id. 7 CASE NO. 23-20122-CR-BLOOM Local  Rule  88.10(o)(2)  would  mean  that  the  Government could simply withhold critical information  from Defendants ""and await an Order from the Court""  whenever they wish. ECF No. [100] at 2. Next, Defendants argue that Minor Victim's  identity is not privileged since she had ""a role in this  case."" Id. Defendants contend that the Government's  reliance on 18 U.S.C. § 3509(d) is misplaced as §  3509(d) provides that information pertaining to a minor  victim may be disclosed ""to persons, who by reason of their participating in the  proceeding, have reason to know such information."" Id.  at 3; see 18 U.S.C. § 3509(d)(1)(ii). Defendants agree with the Government that Roviaro  requires a balancing test to ""determine when the  Government's privilege must give way to a defendant's  right to prepare his defense."" Id. at 2. However,  Defendants assert that when disclosure is ""relevant and  helpful to the defense of an accused or is essential to a  fair determination of a cause, the privilege must give  way."" Roviaro, 353 U.S. at 628. Further, Defendants  argue that [*11]  Roviaro is analogous to this case as  the Supreme Court reversed upon a finding that the  Government failed to disclose the identity of that  informer, who was the soler participant other than that  petitioner. Id.; see also ECF No. [100] at 4. Defendants also attack the Government's reliance on  United States v. Russell, 2022 WL 17736915 (S.D. Fla.  Dec. 17, 2022) and United States v. Calderon, 127 F.3d  1314 (11th Cir. 1997). Defendants argue that Calderon  is distinguishable. In Calderon, the Government did not  possess the testimony in question (""there was nothing to  provide because the information was not 'in the  possession of the United States' within the meaning of  18 U.S.C. § 3500 or Rule 26.2"") Id. at 1335. In Russell,  the Government had already ""made certain advance  disclosures of Giglio [] material in response to  Defendant's [] requests. . . . [and had] produced the  criminal records of the two alleged adult victims, and that a background search on the  alleged minor victim did not yield any results."") 8 CASE NO. 23-20122-CR-BLOOM 2022 WL 17736195, at *4. Moreover, in Russell, the  Government did not have any additional materials  responsive to the remaining requests by that defendant.  Id. Nevertheless, that court noted that the Government  must ""continue to live up to"" its Brady obligations. Id. at  *5. Finally, Defendants contend that the Government's  argument on 18 U.S.C. § 3509, and reliance on Lewis,  2017 WL 750456 (S.D. Ga. Feb. 27, 2017) are  misplaced. [*12]  ECF No. [100] at 3. Lewis concerned a protective order against disclosure of  an alleged minor victim's identity during trial. 2017 WL  750456, at *5. As there are already protective orders in  place for Minor Victim, Defendants argue that Lewis is  unavailing.  Defendants  did  not  address  the  Page 5 of 5 Government's argument that disclosure of Minor  Victim's information is not reasonable per § 3509(d).  Defendants instead reiterate that § 3509(d) provides  that a minor victim's information may be disclosed to  persons who have reason to know ""by reason of their  participation in the proceeding."" § 3509(d); see ECF No.  [100] at 3; see also ECF No. [93] at 8. Furthermore,  Defendants point out that the protective orders as to  Minor Victim's identity satisfy concerns raised regarding  § 3509 and Lewis. See ECF No. [100] at 2; see ECF  Nos. [20], [38]. The  Court  finds  Defendants'  arguments  to  be  persuasive. Roviaro imposes a balancing test to  determine whether disclosure of privileged information,  such as the true identity of an informer, to determine  whether that privilege must give way to the fundamental  requirements of fairness. Furthermore, the Local Rules  dictate that if there are promises of immunity, leniency,  or other inducements within the scope of Giglio, the  Government  shall [*13]   disclose  those  to  the  Defendants. L.R. 88.10(d). Correspondingly, the Standing Discovery  Orders in this case make clear that ""it is the continuing  duty of counsel for both sides to immediately reveal [all]  material within the scope of Local Rule 88.10."" ECF  Nos. [11], [34]. 9 CASE NO. 23-20122-CR-BLOOM Finally,  Defendants'  argument  regarding  §  3509(d)(1)(A)(ii) is correct. The statutory privacy  protections for child victims allows for disclosure of a  minor's confidential information only to persons involved  in the proceeding who have reason to know of such  information. Of note, § 3509(d)(1)(A)(i) requires that  even with this limited disclosure, that information must  remain confidential, restricted, and secure. The statute,  along with the Protective Orders already entered, will  also guard Minor Victim from potential embarrassment  and harms. The  Government  must  provide  the  information  requested, specifically the Minor Victim's legal name,  date of birth, and criminal history, if any exists."

PER CURIAM: Thomas A. Burns, appointed counsel for Christopher  John Streeter in this appeal following Streeter's  conviction on one count of sex trafficking of a minor and  his resultant life sentence, has filed a motion to  withdraw on appeal. The motion is supported by a brief  prepared pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738  (1967). Our independent review of the entire record  reveals that counsel's assessment of the relative merit  of the appeal is correct. Because independent  examination of the entire record reveals no arguable  issue of merit, counsel's motion to withdraw is  GRANTED, and Streeter's conviction and sentence are  AFFIRMED. 1 1 After Burns filed the Anders brief, Streeter filed, pro  se, motions both to dis-charge Burns as counsel and to  be appointed new appellate counsel. We con-clude that  both motions are meritless and warrant no further  discussion, par-ticularly given our decision to grant  counsel's motion under Anders and affirm [*2]  the  district court."

"Vidal v. Galaxy 2439 Enters., LLC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217264.pdf","MEMORANDUM OPINION SHIPP, District Judge This matter comes before the Court upon the Motion to  Dismiss Plaintiff Leslie Vidal's (""Plaintiff"") Complaint  (ECF No. 1), jointly filed by Defendants Galaxy 2439  Enterprises, LLC (""Galaxy"") and Genesis Biotechnology  Group,  LLC  (""Genesis"")  (hereinafter  collectively  ""Defendants""). (ECF No. 5). Plaintiff opposed the Motion  (ECF No. 8), and Defendants replied (ECF No. 9). The  Court has considered the parties' written submissions  and decides the Motion without oral argument, pursuant  to Local Civil Rule 78.1. For the reasons set forth below,  Counts One, Three, and Four against Genesis are  dismissed  with  prejudice;  Count  Two  against  Defendants is dismissed with prejudice; and Counts  One, Three, and Four against Galaxy are dismissed  without prejudice. I. BACKGROUND A. Statement of Facts On or about February 22, 2021, Defendants hired  Plaintiff [*2]   as  a  part-time  Human  Resources  Consultant to assist ""Defendants in its [sic] review of  current Human Resources practices, and assist with  Defendants' launch of its [sic] new professional  employer organization division, Professional Core  Solutions."" (Compl. ¶¶ 9-10, ECF No. 1.) Around May  2021, Defendants promoted Plaintiff to a full-time  ""Human Resources & Business Development Manager.""  (Id. ¶¶ 12-13 .) Plaintiff alleges that, throughout her employment, she  ""continuously  raised  concerns,  objections,  and  complaints to her supervisors regarding . . . Defendants'  unlawful, discriminatory employment practices."" (Id. ¶       Page 2 of 11 14.) Plaintiff asserts that she raised, disclosed, and  reported the following concerns to employees in  Defendants' Human Resources Department: (1) failure  to follow standardized hiring procedures; (2) improper  payment of hourly employees; and (3) inconsistencies  in employee discipline and performance processes,  such as that ""female employees and employees in  racially protected classes were severely disciplined for  infractions  or  performance  concerns  and  white  employees were not severely disciplined, if at all."" (Id.  ¶¶ 15, 18, 20.) Despite such reports, Plaintiff states  that [*3]  Defendants did not take any action to address  the improper behavior. (Id. ¶¶ 16-17, 19, 20-21.) On or about June 28, 2021, Defendants had a job fair to  recruit employees for various positions; Plaintiff, as the  Human  Resources  and  Business  Development  Manager, ""was tasked with . . . attempting to match  each candidate with an open position."" (Id. ¶¶ 23-24.)  Based on an executive's (the ""Executive"") request ""that  Plaintiff direct all candidates [with hospitality experience]  to her job station first,"" Plaintiff ""directed [to the  Executive] a Black male job fair attendee . . . who  indicated that he had experience in the hospitality  industry."" (Id. ¶¶ 25-26.) Plaintiff [*4]  asserts that as  she approached the Executive with the Black job fair  attendee, the Executive ""began to make a shooing  gesture toward Plaintiff stating kilo, I am not going to  interview him,' or words to that effect."" (Id. ¶ 27.) Plaintiff  states that she informed several employees about the  Executive's conduct, which ""she believed . . . constituted  discrimination."" (Id. ¶ 28.) In turn, Plaintiff alleges that a                                       Human Resources Generalist ""informed Plaintiff that  [the Executive] had exhibited racially discriminatory  behavior in the past."" (Id. ¶ 29.) The next day, Plaintiff had a phone call with Defendants'  Human Resources team wherein the team members  discussed how they were ""pleased with the outcome of  the job fair and had deemed it a success."" (Id. ¶ 30.)  Later that day, Plaintiff alleges that the Black job fair  attendee called and stated that ""he believed that [the  Executive] refused to interview him . . . because he is  Black.""  (Id.  ¶¶  31-32.)  Plaintiff  then  informed  Defendants' Senior Human Resources Manager and  Human  Resources  Director  of  the  Executive's  supposedly discriminatory conduct at the job fair and the  job fair attendee's complaint. (Id. ¶ 33.) Plaintiff alleges  that the [*5]  Senior Human Resources Manager  responded that the Executive ""previously exhibited  discriminatory behavior in Defendants' workplace,"" and  ""that [the Executive] is not an 'FIR expert.'"" (Id. ¶ 34.)  Plaintiff further states that the Senior Human Resources  Manager  ""refused  to  commit  to  conducting  an  investigation,"" because ""the matter 'was quite sensitive'  due to [the Executive's] position within the company,  and her romantic relationship with [the CEO]."" (Id. ¶  36.) On June 30, 2021, Defendants' Human Resources  Director and Chief Legal Officer held a meeting with  Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 38.) Plaintiff states that she reiterated the  alleged discriminatory conduct she observed, including  the Executive's conduct at the job fair and Defendants'  hiring, payroll, and disciplinary practices. (Id. at ¶¶ 39- 40.) Plaintiff alleges the Human Resources Director and  Chief Legal Officer ""instructed [her] to keep the  substance  of  her  complaints  and  the  meeting  confidential."" (Id. ¶¶ 39-41.) Plaintiff asserts that, at the  end of that same day, Defendants terminated her ""for  'poor performance,' for 'not meeting goals set for the job  fair,' and finally because the discrimination concerns  raised by Plaintiff [*6]  were investigated and 'did not  line up.'"" (Id. ¶ 42.) Plaintiff states that she had ""not  been told previously that there were any issues with her  job performance."" (Id. ¶ 43.) B. Procedural History     Page 3 of 11 This is not the first time Plaintiff has litigated the  circumstances leading to her termination. On June 24,  2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint in New Jersey Superior  Court against Defendants, along with their CEO, Human  Resources Director, and Senior Human Resources  Manager. (See generally N.J. Super. Ct. Compl., ECF  No. 5-2., Ex. B.) The state complaint pled essentially the  same facts as Plaintiff pleads in this case Plaintiff  claimed that she was terminated after complaining to  Defendants' Human Resources Department about  supposed unlawful practices in hiring, payroll, and  discipline, as well as at the job fair incident. (Compare  Compl. ¶¶ 9-46 with N.J. Super. Ct. Compl. ¶¶ 21-32.)  Plaintiff asserted three counts in her state court  complaint: (1) retaliation under the Conscientious  Employee Protection Act (""CEPA""); (2) retaliation under  the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (""NJLAD"");  and (3) associational discrimination and wrongful  discharge under the NJLAD. (See generally N.J. Super.  Ct. Compl.) On October 27, 2022, the state [*7]  court entered a  consent order dismissing with prejudice Count Three of  Plaintiffs complaint. (Oct. 27, 2022 N.J. Super. Ct.  Consent Order, ECF No. 5-2, Ex. C.) The state court  also dismissed with prejudice Plaintiffs complaint in its  entirety as to Genesis, its CEO, and its Senior Human  Resources Manager. (Id.) The state court reserved  decision on whether Plaintiff stated a claim for retaliation  under CEPA or the NJLAD against Galaxy and its  Human Resources Director. (Id. at 46.) On December 12, 2022, the state court dismissed  Counts One and Two of Plaintiff's state law complaint  against Galaxy and its Human Resources Director  without prejudice. (Dec. 12, 2022 N.J. Super. Ct. Order,  ECF No. 5-2, Ex. C.) The court found Plaintiff's CEPA  claim failed because ""[her] references to unspecified  employment practices [were] insufficient to support the  assertion that [she] had a reasonable belief that any law  was being violated."" (Id. at 49.) The state court found  Plaintiff's NJLAD claim also failed because ""[her]  allegations  [were]  not  enough  to  support  [her]  conclusion that the executive refused to interview the  [j]ob [f]air [a]ttendee because he was Black."" (Id. at 50.) On April 4, 2023, Plaintiff [*8]  filed a complaint in this  Court. (ECF No. 1.) Defendants moved to dismiss  Plaintiff's complaint for failure to state a claim upon  which relief may be granted, pursuant to Federal Rule of  Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (ECF No. 5.) Plaintiff opposed   (ECF No. 8), and Defendants replied (ECF No. 9). II. LEGAL STANDARD A district court conducts a three-part analysis when  considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).  Malleus v. George, 641 F.3d 560, 563 (3d Cir. 2011).  First, the court must identify ""the elements a plaintiff  must plead to state a claim."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.  662, 675, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009).  Second, the court must identify and accept as true, all of  the plaintiff's well-pleaded factual allegations and  ""construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the  plaintiff."" Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210  (3d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). The court can discard  bare  legal  conclusions  or  factually  unsupported  accusations that merely state the defendant unlawfully  harmed the plaintiff. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citing  Twombly v. Bell Atl. Corp., 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.  Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). Third, the court  must determine whether ""the [well-pleaded] facts  alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show that the  plaintiff has a 'plausible claim for relief.' Fowler, 578  F.3d at 211 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679). A facially  plausible claim ""allows the court to draw the reasonable  inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct  alleged."" Id. at 210 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). On  a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the ""defendant bears the burden  of showing [*9]  that no claim has been presented.""  Hedges v. United States, 404 F.3d 744, 750 (3d Cir.  2005) (citing Kehr Packages, Inc. v. Fidelcor, Inc., 926  F.2d 1406, 1409 (3d Cir. 1991)). III. DISCUSSION Plaintiff asserts four Counts against Defendants: (1)  retaliation under 42 U.S.C. § 1981; (2) violation of  CEPA; (3) wrongful termination in violation of New  Jersey public policy pursuant to Pierce v. Ortho  Pharmaceutical Corp., 84 N.J. 58, 417 A.2d 505 (1980);  and (4) violation of the NJLAD. (See Compl. ¶¶ 47-79.)  Each claim stems from Plaintiff's allegation that  Defendants fired her because she ""made complaints  about unlawful human resources practices and racial  discrimination in the workplace."" (See Compl. ¶¶ 48, 60,  66, 72.) A. Claim Preclusion  Page 4 of 11 i. Claims Against Genesis The Court first addresses the question of whether the  previous dismissal of Plaintiff's claims in state court has  preclusive effect in this proceeding. See Giordano v.  Saxon Mortg. Servs. Inc., No. 12-7937, 2013 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 202677, 2013 WL 12158378, at *5 (D.N.J. Oct.  31, 2013) (""Judicial estoppel is a fact-specific, equitable  doctrine, applied at courts' discretion."" (citing New  Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749, 121 S. Ct.  1808, 149 L. Ed. 2d 968 (2001)). Pursuant to the Full  Faith and Credit Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1738, federal courts  must ""give preclusive effect to state-court judgments  whenever the courts of the State from which the  judgments emerged would do so."" Allen v. McCurry, 449  U.S. 90, 96, 101 S. Ct. 411, 66 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1980)  (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1738); see also Adelphia Gateway,  LLC v. Pa. Env't Hearing Bd., 62 F.4th 819, 825 (3d Cir.  2023). Federal courts must ""look to the law of the  adjudicating state"" to determine whether a prior state  court judgment has preclusive effect. Greenleaf v.  Garlock, Inc., 174 F.3d 352, 357 (3d Cir. 1999). In New  Jersey,  the  claim  preclusion  doctrine  gives  preclusive [*10]  effect ""to a prior judgment if a particular  issue, although not litigated, could have been raised in  the earlier proceeding."" Bd. of Trs. of Trucking Emps. of  N. Jersey Welfare Fund, Inc. v. Centra, 983 F.2d 495,  504 (3d Cir. 1992). In other words, claim preclusion bars  consideration of any claims a plaintiff actually brought or  ""could have asserted in the previous lawsuit."" Beasley v.  Howard, 14 F.4th 226, 231-32 (3d Cir. 2021). Claim preclusion requires: ""(1) a final judgment on the  merits in a prior suit involving (2) the same parties or  their privies and (3) a subsequent suit based on the  same causes of action."" United States v. Athlone Indus.,  Inc., 746 F.2d 977, 983 (3d Cir. 1984); Pittman v. La  Fontaine, 756 F. Supp. 834, 841 (D.N.J. 1991) (""To  invoke preclusion, it is required that the subsequent  action must involve substantially similar or identical  causes of action, issues, parties and relief as were  involved in the prior action.""). First, here, there was a final judgment on the merits in  which the state court dismissed all claims against  Genesis with prejudice. (N.J. Super. Ct. Consent Order  45-46.) See Dowdell v. Univ. of Med. & Dentistry, 94 F.  Supp. 2d 527, 533 (D.N.J. 2000) (finding that under  New Jersey law, ""dismissal with prejudice 'constitutes  an adjudication on the merits as fully and completely as  if the order had been entered after a trial.""' (quoting  Feinsod v. Noon, 261 N.J. Super. 82, 617 A.2d 1234,  1235 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1992))). Second,  Genesis was a defendant in the state suit and is also a  defendant in the instant action. Id. at 536 n.10 (finding  the second factor satisfied when ""[Noth parties in the  present [*11]  action were engaged in the state suit."").  Third, Plaintiff's current suit against Genesis is based on  the same causes of action as her previous state action.  To find two causes of action the same, a court must  analyze: (1) whether the wrong for which redress is sought is  the same in both actions (that is, whether the acts  complained of and the demand for relief are the  same)[;] (2) whether the theory of recovery is the  same[;] (3) whether the witnesses and documents  necessary at trial are the same[;] and (4) whether  the material facts alleged are the same. Pittman, 756 F. Supp. at 841 (citing Culver v. Ins. Co. of  N. Am., 115 N.J. 451, 559 A.2d 400, 405 (N.J. 1989)).  Plaintiff's Complaint in this action and her complaint in  the state action both assert claims under the theory that  Plaintiff  was  wrongfully  terminated  based  on  Defendants' retaliation, and both complaints seek relief  through damages. See Dowdell, 94 F. Supp. 2d at 540  (finding that the wrong for which redress is sought is the  same in federal court as it was in state court when  ""termination and its surrounding events served as the  basis for both [plaintiff's] state and federal complaints"").  Plaintiff pleads the same material facts as she did in her  dismissed state action, which would require the  assessment of the same evidence and possible  witnesses. [*12]  The Court, accordingly, finds that  claims under CEPA and the NJLAD against Genesis,  which were brought in state court, must be dismissed.                   Page 5 of 11 See id. (precluding plaintiff's claim because the plaintiff  ""raise[d] claims predicated on events indistinguishable  from those raised in his state complaint.""). Further, Plaintiff had the opportunity to plead her § 1981  and Pierce claims against Genesis in New Jersey state  court, which had jurisdiction to hear all of Plaintiff's  claims brought in this federal action, but failed to do so.  See Marina Bay Towers Urb. Renewal II, L.P. v. City of  N. Wildwood, No. 09-369, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60147,  2009 WL 2147356, at *3 (D.N.J. July 14, 2009) (""[C]ivil  rights claims based on federal law can be brought and  heard in state court."" (citing Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S.  455, 458-59, 110 S. Ct. 792, 107 L. Ed. 2d 887 (1990))).  Claim preclusion thus bars Plaintiff's remaining claims  as to Genesis. See In re Dex Media, Inc., 595 B.R. 19,  33 (D. Del. 2018) (""Claim preclusion 'bars not only  claims that were brought in the previous action, but also  claims that could have been brought.' (quoting  Elkadrawy v. Vanguard Grp., Inc., 584 F.3d 169, 173  (3d Cir. 2009))); Dowdell, 94 F. Supp. 2d at 540 (""The  mere fact that [plaintiff] predicates his instant claims on  Title VII, rather than the NJLAD, does not bar preclusion  of these claims.""); Davis v. U.S. Steel Supply, 688 F.2d  166, 175 (3d Cir. 1982) (precluding plaintiff's § 1981  claim because a nearly identical claim was brought in  state  court  pursuant  to  a  municipal [*13]   antidiscrimination  ordinance  and  dismissed  with  prejudice). Finally, finding that the claims against Genesis are  precluded does not violate any due process concerns.  See Pittman, 756 F. Supp. at 845 (""[E]ven where . . . a  prior decision meets a state's requirements for claim  preclusion, the prior decision will not be given preclusive  effect if due process was not provided by the state  forum in which the claim was previously litigated."");  Kremer v. Chem. Constr. Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 482, 102  S. Ct. 1883, 72 L. Ed. 2d 262 (1982) (finding that the  state must satisfy applicable requirements of the Due  Process Clause, and that ""other state and federal courts  are not required to accord full faith and credit"" if the  state judgment is ""constitutionally infirm""). Based on the  record, the Court cannot find any due process violations  or concerns arising out of the state action. (See  generally Oct. 27, 2022 N.J. Super. Ct. Consent Order;        Dec. 12, 2022 N.J. Super. Ct. Order.) Moreover, Plaintiff  has not alleged that she did not have a full and fair  opportunity to litigate in state court. See Peduto v. City  of N. Wildwood, 878 F.2d 725, 726 (3d Cir. 1989)  (finding that appellants were not denied due process of  law in state court because they were afforded ""a full and  fair  opportunity""  and  appellants  never  alleged  otherwise). Nor did Plaintiff object to the state court  dismissing all claims against Genesis with prejudice—in  fact, she consented to that dismissal. (Oct. 27, [*14]   2022 N.J. Super. Ct. Consent Order 2.) See Nanavati v.  Burdette Tomlin Mem? Hosp., 857 F.2d 96, 111 (3d Cir.  1988) (finding no due process violation where plaintiff  did not object to dismissal of complaint, file an appeal,  or move to reconsider). The Court therefore dismisses Plaintiff's Complaint with  prejudice in its entirety as to Genesis under the claim  preclusion doctrine. ii. Claims Against Galaxy Claim preclusion does not bar Plaintiffs claims against  Galaxy because the state court dismissed Plaintiffs  claims against Galaxy without prejudice. (Dec. 12, 2022  N.J. Super. Ct. Order.) Dismissal without prejudice ""is  neither final nor appealable because the deficiency may  be corrected by the plaintiff without affecting the cause  of action."" Borelli v. Reading, 532 F.2d 950, 951 (3d Cir.  1976). The Court, accordingly, addresses each Count  remaining against Galaxy. B. CEPA Claim Against Galaxy Plaintiff asserts that she was wrongfully terminated by  Defendants for engaging in a protected activity. (Compl.                Page 6 of 11 ¶¶ 55-64.) Plaintiff alleges Defendants' retaliation and  adverse treatment of Plaintiff are in violation of CEPA.  (See id.) Defendants counter that Plaintiff's CEPA claim  is barred by the statute of limitations. (Defs.' Moving Br.,  14-18, ECF No. 5-1; Defs.' Reply Br. 1-13, ECF No. 9.) i. Statute of Limitations [*15]  Although a motion to dismiss is generally not the proper  vehicle for asserting a time bar, the Third Circuit permits  a defendant to assert a statute of limitations defense via  a motion to dismiss if ""the time alleged in the statement  of a claim shows that the cause of action has not been  brought within the statute of limitations."" Viney v.  Jenkintown Sch. Dist., 51 F. Supp. 3d 553, 555 (E.D.  Pa. 2014) (quoting Robinson v. Johnson, 313 F.3d 128,  135 (3d Cir. 2002)); Oshiver v. Levin, Fishbein, Sedran  & Berman, 38 F.3d 1380, 1384 n.1 (3d Cir. 1994)  (finding that an exception exists ""where the complaint  facially shows noncompliance with the limitations period  and the affirmative defense clearly appears on the face  of the pleading.""). Defendants assert that that is the  case here, and Plaintiff does not allege that the dates  set out in the Complaint are insufficient to examine the  timeliness of her claims; instead, Plaintiff relies upon the  equitable tolling doctrine to assert that her CEPA claim  should not be dismissed. (Defs.' Moving Br. 17-18; Pl.'s  Opp'n Br. 16, ECF No. 8-1.) Plaintiff alleges in her Complaint that Defendants  discharged her on June 30, 2021. (Compl. ¶ 42.) The  parties do not dispute that the statute of limitations for a  CEPA claim is one year. N.J.S.A. 34:19-5. (See Pl.'s  Opp'n Br. 13-16; Defs.' Moving Br. 17-18.) When an  employer wrongfully terminates an employee, the  statute of limitations [*16]  begins to run on the date of  actual discharge. See Farneski v. County of Hunterdon,  916 F. Supp. 2d 573, 588 (D.N.J. 2013) (citing Alderiso  v. Med. Ctr. of Ocean Cnty., Inc., 167 N.J. 191, 770  A.2d 275 (N.J. 2001)); Jones v. Jersey City Med Ctr., 20  F. Supp. 2d 770, 773 (D.N.J. 1998) (dismissing a CEPA  claim brought two years after discharge). The one-year  statute of limitations for Plaintiffs CEPA claim is thus  June 30, 2022. See N.J.S.A. 34:19-5. Plaintiff timely  filed a CEPA claim in New Jersey Superior Court on  June 24, 2022, which the court dismissed without  prejudice against Galaxy on December 12, 2022. (See  N.J. Super. Ct. Compl.; Dec. 12, 2022 N.J. Super. Ct.  Order.) On April 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed her Complaint in  this Court, well after CEPA's one year statute of  limitations expired. (See Compl.) The Court, therefore,  can conclusively determine that the applicable one-year  statute of limitations bars Plaintiffs claim and finds  Defendants' statute of limitations defense at the motion  to dismiss stage to be proper. Plaintiffs CEPA claim is  thus barred unless the equitable tolling doctrine applies. ii. Equitable Tolling Equitable tolling allows a plaintiff to bring suit ""after the  statutory time period for filing a complaint has expired if  [the plaintiff has] been prevented from filing in a timely  manner due to sufficiently inequitable circumstances.""  Seitzinger v. Reading Hosp. & Med. Ctr., 165 F.3d 236,  240 (3d Cir. 1999) (emphasis added). These inequitable  circumstances are ""narrowly [*17]  defined."" Fahey v.  Hollywood Bicycle Ctr., Inc., No. 08-3573, 2009 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 22179, 2009 WL 749856, at *4 (D.N.J. Mar.  18, 2009) (quoting R.A.C. v. P.J.S., Jr., 192 N.J. 81, 927  A.2d 97, 107 (N.J. 2007)). Specifically, the Third Circuit  has held that ""equitable tolling may be appropriate[:] . . .  (1) [if] the defendant has actively misled the plaintiff[;]  (2) if the plaintiff has 'in some extraordinary way' been  prevented from asserting [her] rights[;] or (3) if the  plaintiff has timely asserted [her] rights mistakenly in the  wrong forum."" United States v. Midgley, 142 F.3d 174,  179 (3d Cir. 1998) (quoting Kocian v. Getty Refin. &  Mktg. Co., 707 F.2d 748, 753 (3d Cir. 1983)). Plaintiff invokes the doctrine of equitable tolling to  prevent her CEPA claim from being dismissed as time  barred. (Pl.'s Opp'n Br. 13-16.) Plaintiff states that her  claims  in  state  court  were  ""dismissed  on  procedural/pleading grounds,"" but were filed in this  Court with additional federal civil rights claims. (Pl.'s  Opp'n Br. 16.) Plaintiff does not assert that she was  actively misled by Defendants, was prevented from  asserting her rights in an extraordinary way, or timely  asserted her rights in the wrong forum. Instead, Plaintiff  argues equitable tolling should apply because she  timely filed her CEPA claim in state court without  ""sle[eping] on her rights."" (Id.) Plaintiff fails to allege a valid basis for equitable tolling  on her CEPA claim. As noted, Plaintiff has not alleged  any  inequitable  circumstances  or  improper [*18]   conduct by Defendants in the state action or the instant  case. See Midgley, 142 F.3d at 179 (""Absent a showing  of intentional inducement or trickery by the defendant, a  statute of limitations should be tolled only in the 'rare  situation where equitable tolling is demanded by sound  legal principles as well as the interests of justice.'""  (quoting Alvarez-Machain v. United States, 96 F.3d  1246, 1251 (9th Cir. 1996))). The state court dismissed  Page 7 of 11 Plaintiff's CEPA claim for failure to state a claim, not for  any technical errors involving jurisdiction or venue. See  Schmidt v. Celgene Corp., 425 N.J. Super. 600, 42 A.3d  892, 900 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2012) (finding that  ""the primary purpose of these equitable doctrines  avoiding a technical defeat of a meritorious claim on  which the doors of the courthouse have been shut—was  not implicated"" because plaintiff's initial CEPA claim was  dismissed on the merits rather than on jurisdictional  grounds); but see Galligan v. Westfield Ctr. Serv., Inc.,  82 N.J. 188, 412 A.2d 122 (N.J. 1980) (granting  equitable tolling to plaintiff's claim that was misfiled and  dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in  federal court). It was Plaintiff who chose to commence  litigation in state court only six days before CEPA's  statute of limitations ran. See Gonzalez v. Portfolio  Recovery Assocs., LLC, No. 13-1350, 2013 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 135909, 2013 WL 5334075, at *3 (D.N.J. Sept.  20, 2013) (declining to apply equitable tolling because  ""[plaintiff] chose to file his first complaint just two months  before the statute of limitations ran . . . . That [*19]  the  statute of limitations ran while the state-court motion to  dismiss was pending cannot be blamed on [d]efendant;  [d]efendant did nothing to mislead [p]laintiff or prevent  [p]laintiff from exercising his rights.""). Plaintiffs mere  assertion that Defendants received timely notice of the  potential claim is insufficient to overcome the hurdles for  equitable tolling to apply. See Midgley, 142 F.3d at 179  (""Federal courts invoke the doctrine of equitable tolling  'only  sparingly.'  (citations  omitted)).  The  Court,  accordingly, dismisses Plaintiffs CEPA claim against  Galaxy with prejudice. C. 42 U.S.C. § 1981 Claim Against Galaxy                   Count One of Plaintiffs Complaint asserts a retaliation  claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 based on her termination  after she raised complaints regarding ""unlawful human  resources practices and racial discrimination in the  workplace."" (Compl. ¶ 48.) Specifically, Plaintiff alleges  she engaged in protected conduct when she made  separate complaints to Defendants regarding their: (1)  engagement in disparate disciplinary treatment towards  women and minority employees; and (2) discriminatory  refusal to hire a Black job applicant. (See id. ¶¶ 47-54;  Pl.'s Opp'n Br. 9-10.) ""The Supreme Court has established that § 1981  protects [*20]  individuals against retaliation."" Curry v.  Devereux Found., 541 F. Supp. 3d 555, 559 (E.D. Pa.  2021) (citing CBOCS, 553 U.S. at 451). 42 U.S.C. §  1981 further prohibits retaliation against individuals who  help others ""suffering direct racial discrimination.""  CBOCS, 553 U.S. at 452. To maintain a prima facie § 1981 retaliation claim,  Plaintiff must adequately allege that: (1) she engaged in  a protected activity; (2) she suffered an adverse  employment action by Defendants, her employer; and  (3) a causal connection exists between the protected  activity and the adverse employment action. See Est. of  Oliva ex rel. McHugh v. New Jersey, 604 F.3d 788, 798  (3d Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). The Third Circuit then  utilizes a burden-shifting framework: if the plaintiff  succeeds in establishing a prima facie case, the burden  shifts to the defendant ""to articulate some legitimate,  nondiscriminatory [or nonretaliatory] reason for the  employee's rejection[;]"" if the defendant successfully  carries this burden, the plaintiff then must have an  opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the  evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the  defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext  for retaliation. See Jarmon v. Trader Joe 's Co., No. 21- 3889, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38448, 2023 WL 2402874,  at *3 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 8, 2023) (first alteration in original)  (quoting Shaner v.

Thurston, 469 U.S.  111, 121, 105 S. Ct. 613, 83 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1985)).

The complaint must state enough facts to  raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal  evidence of the necessary element."" Id. (quoting  Wilkerson v. New Media Tech. Charter Sch. Inc., 522  F.3d 315, 321-22 (3d Cir. 2008) (emphasis in original)). ""In a retaliation case[,] a plaintiff must demonstrate that  there had been an underlying § 1981 violation.""  Castleberry v. STI Grp., 863 F.3d 259, 267 (3d Cir.  2017) (quoting Est. of Oliva, 604 F.3d at 798) (noting  that a plaintiff must have ""acted under a good faith,  reasonable belief that [an underlying § 1981] violation  existed."" (quoting Daniels v. Sch. Dist. of Phila., 776  F.3d 181, 193 (3d Cir. 2015))). The Court, therefore,  first considers whether Plaintiff adequately alleges that  there is an underlying § 1981 violation. See id. For the  two events at issue, Plaintiff appears to allege that §  1981's guarantee that all persons are entitled to the  same ""full and equal benefit"" of the law was violated  because Galaxy, an employer, [*22]  discriminated and  disparately treated employees and a job applicant  differently based on race and/or sex. (See Compl. ¶ 21.)  See also 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a); Est. of Oliva, 604 F.3d at  798. i. Disparate Treatment         Plaintiff alleges that ""while reviewing Defendants'  Human  Resources  practices,  [she]  identified  inconsistencies  in  the  employee  discipline  and  performance processes; specifically, Plaintiff's review  identified that female employees and employees in  racially protected classes were severely disciplined for  infractions  or  performance  concerns  and  white  employees were not severely disciplined, if at all.""  (Compl. ¶ 20.) Plaintiff states that she ""reasonably  believed that Defendants' practices of disparate  treatment towards employees based [on] sex and/or  race were unlawful"" and reported them to Defendants'  Human Resources Department. (Id. ¶¶ 21, 22).  Defendants argue that Plaintiff ""fails to plead any facts  supporting the reasonableness of [the] allegation,  including who these employees were, what positions  they held, what they were disciplined for, and how  exactly they were treated disparately."" (Defs.' Moving  Br. 11-12; see also Defs.' Reply 1 3-14.) As previously set forth, ""a plaintiff establishes a [§ 1981]  retaliation claim if she [*23]  shows that she had a  reasonable belief that her employer was engaged in an  unlawful employment practice and that the employer  retaliated against her for protesting against that  practice."" Curry, 541 F. Supp. 3d at 560 (quoting  Drinkwater v. Union Carbide Corp., 904 F.2d 853, 865  (3d Cir. 1990)). Yet, a ""§ 1981 cause of action in the  employment  context  which  is  based  on  racial  discrimination must set forth facts to establish that the  allegedly disparate treatment was the result of  'intentional' or 'purposeful' discrimination."" Hicks v.  Arthur, 843 F. Supp. 949, 954 (E.D. Pa. 1994) (quoting  Weldon v. Kraft, 896 F.2d 793, 796 (3d Cir. 1990)); see  also Brown v. Joel Tanis & Sons, Inc., No. 13-02984,  2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95149, 2016 WL 3951378, at *4  (D.N.J. July 21, 2016). ""A § 1981 plaintiff cannot satisfy  the 'purposeful' criterion with 'vague and conclusory  allegations' in the complaint."" Id. (citing Armstrong v.  Sch. Dist. of Phila., 597 F. Supp. 1309, 1312 (E.D. Pa.  1984). With Plaintiff's allegations accepted as true, this Court  finds that Plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts to survive  the motion to dismiss. Plaintiff fails to provide any facts  from her review of Defendants' Human Resources  practices  that  suggest  intentional  or  purposeful  discrimination. For example, despite stating that she  ""identified"" such concerns through her review, Plaintiff  fails to list any inconsistencies in the employee  discipline and performance process, the number of  employees who were treated disparately, or what  infractions or performance concerns were addressed  Page 9 of 11 with the disparately treated employees. [*24]  See Lara,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 158267, 2020 WL 5211206, at *9  (denying a motion to dismiss in part because the plaintiff  cited specific interactions and comments made by  defendants, which suggested a plausible claim for  disparate treatment based on race-based discrimination  and retaliation); Warrick v. N.J. Off. of Att'y Gen., No.  20-14274, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96999, 2022 WL  1763855, at *5 (D.N.J. May 31, 2022) (finding that the  plaintiff pled sufficient facts for a disparate treatment  claim  because  the  amended  complaint  alleged  ""numerous examples of, for instance, [d]efendants  promoting white colleagues within four years and  promoting African American employees within twenty- one years""). Here, Plaintiff's pleadings amount only to  vague and conclusory allegations that fail to raise a  reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal  evidence of a necessary element. ii. The Executive's Conduct Plaintiff next alleges that the Executive's refusal to  interview  a  job  applicant  constitutes  illegal  discriminatory conduct because Plaintiff reasonably  believes the Executive based her decision on racial  discrimination. (Compl. ¶¶ 25-35.) Defendants again  state that Plaintiff ""fails to plead sufficient facts to  establish an underlying violation."" (Defs.' Moving Br. 13;  see also Defs.' Reply Br. 14.) To establish a discrimination claim under § 1981, ""a  plaintiff must show (1) [*25]  that he [or she] belongs to  a racial minority; (2) an intent to discriminate on the  basis of race by the defendant; and (3) discrimination  concerning one or more of the activities enumerated in §  1981."" Castleberry, 863 F.3d at 266 (citing Est. of Oliva,  604 F.3d at 797). The Court, accepting all reasonable inferences as true,  does not identify any factual support to suggest or  satisfy the second prong—that the Executive refused to  interview the job applicant because he was Black. (See  Compl. ¶¶ 25-34.) Plaintiff relies only upon her and the  job applicant's belief that the Executive declined to  interview the Black job applicant because of his race.  (Id. ¶ 28.) Without more factual detail, Plaintiff fails to  adequately allege an underlying § 1981 violation.      ""[S]uch allegations are conclusory since [Plaintiff] fails to  allege facts to show that [the Executive's] actions were  somehow connected to any protected category, let  alone [to the job applicant's] race."" Mudie v. Phila. Coll.  of Osteopathic Med., 577 F. Supp. 3d 375, 381 (E.D.  Pa. 2021) (finding that plaintiff's allegations that are  ""race-related are bald legal conclusions and lack factual  support"" because ""[plaintiff] fail[ed] to provide facts to  show that [d]efendants' actions were related to her race,  as opposed to some other reason or due to a  personality conflict); Curry, 541 F. Supp. 3d at 562  (finding [*26]  that an employee's direct comments such  as ""angry Black woman"" was enough to allow  discovery); Savage v. Temple Univ. - of Commonwealth  Sys. of Higher Educ., No. 19-6026, 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 111715, 2020 WL 3469039, at *6 (E.D. Pa. June  25, 2020) (finding that plaintiff made ""legal conclusions,  not factual allegations,"" which are not ""consider[ed] . . .  in deciding a motion to dismiss[,]"" because plaintiff ""pled  that he was terminated and discriminated against]  because of his race.""); Doe v. Triangle Doughnuts, LLC,  472 F. Supp. 3d 115, 137 (E.D. Pa. 2020) (finding that  plaintiff's allegations failed to state enough facts to raise  a reasonable expectation that discovery would reveal  evidence of discriminatory intent, despite plaintiff's  allegation that a racial comment was made at her). The Court finds that Plaintiff fails to state a claim for  retaliation because she has not adequately alleged that  there was an underlying § 1981 violation of sex and/or  race discrimination, even under the more deferential  pleading standard applicable to discrimination claims.  See Castleberry, 863 F.3d at 267; Triangle Doughnuts,  472 F. Supp. 3d at 136. The Court, accordingly,  dismisses Plaintiffs § 1981 claim against Galaxy without  prejudice. D. NJLAD Claim Against Galaxy              Page 10 of 11 Under Count Four, Plaintiff asserts that ""Defendants'  decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment is a  retaliatory action and constitutes a violation of the  [NJLAD]."" (Compl. ¶ 76.) In short, Plaintiff alleges a  claim [*27]  of retaliation under the NJLAD against  Galaxy. The NJLAD makes it illegal for an employer to terminate  an employee on the basis of race, national origin, sex  and other protected characteristics. Victoria v. Fluor  Enters. Inc., No. 13-7587, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  134574, 2015 WL 5822056, at *6 (D.N.J. Oct. 2, 2015)  (citing N.J.S.A. 10:5-12). The factors to establish a  prima facie case of retaliation under the NJLAD are the  same as those required under § 1981. Mann v. Prince  Telecom, LLC, No. 12-6263, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  104699, 2013 WL 3884189, at *5 (D.N.J. July 26, 2013).  The analysis for Plaintiffs NJLAD claim against Galaxy  is, thus, also the same. See Venson v. Pro Custom  Solar, LLC, No. 19-19227, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  205438, 2021 WL 4963294, at *3 (D.N.J. Oct. 25, 2021)  (finding plaintiff's failed to articulate a claim of retaliation  under § 1981, and thus ""their claims of retaliation under  the NJLAD are also futile."") This Court, accordingly,  adopts the analysis previously provided for Plaintiffs §  1981 claim and dismisses Plaintiffs NJLAD claim  without prejudice. E. Pierce Claim Against Galaxy Plaintiffs Complaint asserts a Pierce claim for common  law wrongful termination under Pierce v. Ortho  Pharmaceutical Corp., 84 N.J. 58, 417 A.2d 505, 512  (1980). (Compl. ¶¶ 65-70.) Plaintiff alleges that she was  discharged in retaliation for making complaints about  alleged unlawful racial discrimination and Human  Resources procedures. (Id. at 68.) Defendants move to  dismiss Plaintiffs Pierce claim for failure to identify any  clear mandate of public policy. (Defs.' Moving Br. 22.)  Defendants assert that even if such a mandate is  identified, Plaintiff [*28]  cannot support that such a  policy was violated or that she sufficiently expressed  more than just her ""vague concerns."" (Id.) Where a plaintiff bases her common law Pierce claim on  the public policy of the NJLAD and asserts a claim  under both, the former claim is subsumed by the latter.  See, e.g., Campbell v. Sedgwick Detert, Moran &  Arnold, No. 11-642, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126480,  2011 WL 5248150, at *3 (D.N.J. Nov. 2, 2011) (citation  omitted); Rodriguez v. Springhill Suites by Marriott, No.  13-6841, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16605, 2014 WL  575529, at *2 (D.N.J. Feb. 10, 2014) (""New Jersey  courts and courts interpreting New Jersey law have held  that common law claims for wrongful discharge in  violation of public policy are preempted when a statutory  remedy under the NJLAD exists."" (quoting Santiago v.  City of Vineland, 107 F. Supp. 2d 512, 567 (D.N.J.  2000))); N.J.S.A. § 10:5-13(b) (""All remedies available in  common law tort actions shall be available to prevailing  plaintiff's [under the NJLAD].""). The only exception to  when a Pierce claim is not preempted as coterminous  with the NJLAD is if the cause of action finds its basis in  the New Jersey State Constitution. Campbell, 2011 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 126480, 2011 WL 5248150, at *3. Here,  Plaintiff does not cite or refer to the New Jersey State  Constitution; thus Plaintiffs Pierce claim is coterminous  with her NJLAD claim and must be dismissed. See  Schanzer v. Rutgers Univ., 934 F. Supp. 669, 679  (D.N.J. 1996) (dismissing plaintiff's Pierce claim  because the ""NJLAD provides the full panoply of rights  and remedies that are available under the common  law.""); Santiago, 107 F. Supp. 2d at 568 (dismissing  plaintiff's common law Pierce claims [*29]  because they  ""are duplicative of the cause of action under the NJLAD  and therefore are preempted by the statute.""); see also  Rodriguez, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16605, 2014 WL  575529, at *2 (""To the extent [p]laintiff may allege that  the NJLAD supplies the clear mandate of public policy,  a common law claim for wrongful discharge cannot be  predicated on the policy expressed through the NJLAD  in light of the statutory remedy available.""). For the reasons stated above, Plaintiff's Pierce claim  against Galaxy is dismissed without prejudice."
"Williams v. Sisolak, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 32338.pdf","[*1] U.S. COURT OF APPEALS Appeal from the United States District Court for the  District of Nevada Andrew P. Gordon, District Judge, Presiding Submitted December 5, 2023** San Francisco, California * This disposition is not appropriate for publication and  is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit  Rule 36-3. ** The panel unanimously concludes this case is  suitable for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R.  App. P. 34(a)(2). Before: S.R. THOMAS and BRESS, Circuit Judges, and  EZRA,***District Judge. Plaintiffs appeal the district  court's dismissal of their federal and state law claims  against Nevada state and local officials for abuse  plaintiffs allegedly suffered in Nevada's commercial sex  industry. The district court determined that plaintiffs  lacked Article III standing to assert these claims against  the government defendants. We review the district  court's grant of a motion to dismiss and questions of  Article III standing de novo. Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire &  Marine Ins. Co., 519 F.3d 1025, 1030 (9th Cir. 2008);  City & Cnty. of S.F. v. Garland, 42 F.4th 1078, 1084 (9th  Cir. 2022). We review the denial of leave to amend for  abuse of discretion. Garmon v.Cnty. of L.A., 828 F.3d  837, 842 (9th Cir. 2016). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We affirm. To establish Article III standing, plaintiffs must allege ""  (i) that [they] suffered an injury in fact that is concrete,  particularized, and actual or imminent; (ii) that the injury  was likely caused by the defendant; and [*2]  (iii) that  the injury would likely be redressed by judicial relief.""  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2203  (2021) (citing Lujanv. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S.  555, 560-61 (1992)). The second element, traceability,  is at issue here. To meet that requirement, plaintiffs  must allege that their injuries are ""fairly traceable"" to the  defendants' conduct and  *** The Honorable David A. Ezra, United States District  Judge for the   District of Hawaii, sitting by designation.   2  ""not the result of the independent action of some third  party not before the court."" Namisnak v. Uber Techs., Inc., 971 F.3d 1088, 1094  Page 2 of 2 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561).  Although this does not require a showing of proximate  cause, it does require plaintiffs to ""establish a 'line of  causation' between defendants' action and their alleged  harm that is more than 'attenuated.'"" Maya v. Centex  Corp., 658 F.3d 1060, 1070 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting  Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 757 (1984)). Particularly  relevant here, ""[i]n cases where a chain of causation  'involves numerous third parties' whose 'independent  decisions' collectively have a 'significant effect' on  plaintiffs' injuries, the Supreme Court and this court  have found the causal chain too weak to support  standing at the pleading stage."" Id. The district court correctly concluded that plaintiffs lack  Article III standing to sue the government defendants  because plaintiffs' injuries are the result of allegedly  illegal third-party conduct in Nevada's [*3]  commercial  sex industry. While the government defendants have  various roles in regulating that industry, the injuries  plaintiffs suffered were allegedly inflicted by the  ""independent action[s]"" of third parties, Lujan, 504 U.S.  at 560-namely, the traffickers, escort agencies, strip  clubs, and brothels who were also named in their  complaint. Plaintiffs' allegations are therefore insufficient  to support traceability under Article III. See id. When  plaintiffs raise claims based on government action or  inaction, they must sufficiently allege that government  defendants' actions ""exert[] a 'determinative or coercive 3 effect' on the third-party conduct that directly causes  the[ir] injury."" WildEarthGuardians v. United States  Forest Serv., 70 F.4th 1212, 1217 (9th Cir. 2023)  (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997)).  Plaintiffs' allegations do not meet that standard,  especially when by the allegations of the complaint  certain third parties engaged in conduct that violated  federal and state laws against sex trafficking. The record does not support plaintiffs' assertions that  the district court failed to consider all their allegations.  Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in denying  leave to amend because amendment as to the  government defendants would have been futile. See  Bonin v. Calderon, 59 F.3d 815, 845 (9th Cir. 1995)  (""Futility of amendment can, by itself, justify the  denial [*4]  of a motion for leave to amend.""). AFFIRMED. 4"

The  court has reviewed the Motion, Plaintiff's opposition to  the Motion (""Opposition""), see ECF No. 17, Defendant's  reply brief, see ECF No. 18, all exhibits to the parties'  briefs, and the record in this matter and is thoroughly  apprised in the premises. For the reasons discussed  herein, the court hereby GRANTSin part andDENIESin  part the Motion. I. BACKGROUND2 Plaintiff Wilson is an African-American man. ECF No. 1  ¶ 3. Plaintiff Del Valle is a Hispanic woman and Plaintiff  Wilson's mother. Id. ¶ 4. Defendant is Plaintiff Wilson's  former employer and Plaintiff Del Valle's current  employer. Id. ¶¶ 3-4. Plaintiff Wilson was hired on or about December 7,  2019. Id. ¶ 6. He asserts that while working for  Defendant, he observed employees who were not  African-American 1 This action currently is stayed pending disposition of  the Motion. Plaintiffs have filed a motion to lift the stay,  see ECF No. 23, which is mooted by this ruling. 2 All background facts are taken from the complaint and  as such are allegations. [*2]  1 being given ""special privileges"" that were denied to  him.3 Id. ¶ 8. Plaintiff Wilson complained of this  disparate treatment to his union representative, who  allegedly replied that Plaintiff Wilson should stop  complaining and be glad he had a job. Id. ¶ 9. Plaintiff  Wilson was terminated on April 15, 2020. Id. ¶¶ 10-11.  The reason given for his termination was that he had  been observed sleeping on the job on February 23,  2020. Id. ¶ 11. Plaintiff Wilson denies ever falling asleep on  the job, and he asserts that between the date of the  alleged infraction and the date of his termination, no one  addressed the incident with him. Id. ¶¶ 13-14. The  acting director, who handed Plaintiff Wilson his  termination letter, allegedly said that if Plaintiff Wilson  had kept his mouth shut, he would not have lost his job.  Id. ¶¶ 11, 45. Plaintiff Wilson filed a complaint with the Connecticut  Commission on Human Rights  and  Opportunities  (""CHRO""),  which  was  Page 2 of 12 dismissed on January 18, 2022.4 Id. ¶ 15; see also ECF  No. 14-3. Plaintiff Del Valle has been employed by Defendant  since 2014. ECF No. 1 ¶ 17. She alleges that  throughout her time working for Defendant, she has  been treated differently than non-Hispanic [*3]  and  male employees. Id. ¶ 18. More specifically, Plaintiff Del  Valle alleges she was made to ""perform harder, more  physically demanding work"" than non-Hispanic women,  and has been denied work breaks. Id. ¶ 19. Plaintiff Del  Valle describes one white female coworker who is  absent when toilsome work needs doing and who only  appears when the work is done. Id. ¶ 23. This behavior  has not been 3 It is not clear what these ""special privileges"" were,  specifically. 4 Plaintiff Wilson asserts that he received a release of  jurisdiction on this date, but the exhibits to the Motion  clearly show that what he received was a dismissal. 2 addressed. Id. Another white woman Plaintiff Del Valle  works with is not disciplined for taking long lunch  breaks. Id. ¶ 22. Plaintiff Del Valle also alleges that she has not been  permitted to wear shoes other than steel-toed boots, but  a white colleague is permitted to do so and ""to go  where[]ever she wants."" Id. ¶ 21. The complaint also  describes an incident where a white female colleague  broke some equipment but was not disciplined for the  error. Id. ¶ 20. Plaintiff Del Valle speculates that a  minority employee would have been scrutinized if they  had made the same [*4]  mistake. Id. She does not  describe any other incident that would support her  speculation, though. She also states that she has heard her crew leader  comment that women should not be working for  Defendant, and that her supervisor and her crew leader  have referred to Hispanic employees as ""you people.""  Id. ¶¶ 24-25. Finally, she asserts that over the course of  her  employment,  she  has  been  given  fewer  opportunities for overtime than her peers who are not  Hispanic women. Id. ¶ 26. Plaintiff Del Valle filed an internal complaint of race and  gender discrimination with Defendant's Affirmative  Action Unit on January 22, 2020.5 Id. ¶ 27. On February  4, 2020, she complained to someone in management  about the pattern of discrimination. Id. ¶ 43. On May 5,  2020, she was notified that her complaints would yield  no responsive action from management. Id. ¶ 44. On  May 15, 2020, the acting director and a supervisor told 5 A substantial part of the complaint is devoted to  describing an incident earlier in January where Plaintiff  Del Valle argued with the acting director and Plaintiff  Wilson's supervisor about an apparent discrepancy in  Plaintiff Wilson's paycheck. The director and the  supervisor allegedly [*5]  told her that Plaintiff Wilson  was a liar and a poor worker, and they accused Plaintiff  Del Valle of using the office computers to collect  information about her son's paycheck, which she  denied. ECF No. 1 ¶ 28-40. Plaintiff Del Valle accused  the others of being disrespectful. The altercation  culminated in Plaintiff Del Valle's office keys being  confiscated. These allegations are never relied upon for  any of Plaintiffs' claims, and their relevance are unclear,  so the court will not discuss them in any further detail. 3 her that they had known her complaint would go  nowhere, and that now they would get rid of her. Id. ¶  45. On May 12, 2021, Plaintiff Del Valle suffered an injury  while at work and was reassigned to light duty. Id. ¶ 46.  She claims that her multiple requests to be assigned to  the position of backup clerk have been denied because  she is restricted to light duty, but she asserts that her  physical limitations do not prevent her performing the  tasks of a backup clerk. Id. ¶ 48-49. She also asserts  that she has been denied access to certain trainings  although her physical limitations would not prevent her  being able to participate in those trainings. Id. ¶¶ 42, 51- 52. Plaintiff [*6]  del Valle filed a complaint of discrimination  and retaliation with the CHRO on June 30, 2020. Id. ¶  54. On March 23, 2022, a Release of Jurisdiction was  issued. Id. Plaintiffs filed their complaint on April 23, 2022,  asserting six claims. See generally ECF No. 1. Counts One and Two raise Title VII claims  as to both the plaintiffs (racial discrimination and  retaliation, respectively). Counts Three and Four allege  discrimination against Plaintiff Del Valle on the basis of  her disability in violation of the Americans with  Page 3 of 12 Disabilities Act (""ADA"") and the Connecticut Fair  Employment Practices Act (""CFEPA""), respectively.  Counts Five and Six allege gender discrimination as to  Plaintiff in violation of Title VII and the CFEPA,  respectively. Plaintiffs seek damages plus costs and  fees. II. LEGAL STANDARD It is axiomatic that federal courts have limited jurisdiction  and must dismiss actions where subject matter  jurisdiction is lacking. See Nike, Inc. v. Already, LLC,  663 F.3d 89, 4 94 (2d. Cir. 2011). A party may move to dismiss a claim  where the federal courts do not have jurisdiction to hear  it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). In resolving a motion to  dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, a district  court may refer to evidence outside the pleadings.  Makarova v. United States, 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir.  2000). Dismissal also is appropriate where the [*7]  facts  alleged in the complaint are insufficient to state a  plausible claim for relief. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.  662, 678 (2009). To avoid dismissal under Federal Rule  of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a plaintiff must plead  ""enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible  on its face,"" and not merely ""conceivable."" Bell Atl.  Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). When  reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6),  the court must accept as true all factual allegations in  the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in the  nonmovant's favor. See ATSI Commc'ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d  87, 98 (2d Cir. 2007). Although a complaint ""does not  need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff's obligation  to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitle[ment] to relief'  requires more than labels and conclusions, and a  formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action  will not do."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555; see also  Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at 684 (concluding that the Twombly  pleading standard applies in ""all civil actions""). III. DISCUSSION Defendant alleges that all the claims must be dismissed.  With respect to Plaintiff Wilson's two claims, they argue that both his  discrimination and retaliation claim (Counts One and  Two, respectively) must be dismissed because he has  failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. They also  argue that he has failed to state a claim for 5 discrimination. And with respect to Plaintiff Del Valle's  claims, [*8]  they argue that the Eleventh Amendment  bars her CFEPA and ADA claims (Counts Three, Four,  and Six), that she has failed to exhaust administrative  remedies for her disability claim under the CFEPA  (Count Four), and that she has failed to state any of her  claims. Because the Eleventh Amendment argument calls  jurisdiction into question, the court will begin there. 1. CFEPA and ADA Claims The Eleventh Amendment bars federal courts from  hearing suits brought against a state by its citizens. See  generally Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890). But ""[a]  sovereign's immunity may be waived, and the [Supreme  Court of the United States] consistently has held that a  State may consent to suit against it in federal court."" Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S.  89, 99 (1984). Such a waiver of immunity must be  expressed in clear terms. Id. Similarly, Congress ""has  power with respect to the rights protected by the  Fourteenth Amendment to abrogate the Eleventh  Amendment immunity,"" but this exercise of power also  must be done unequivocally. Id. A state agency enjoys the protection of the Eleventh  Amendment where it functions as an ""arm of the State.""  Regents of the Univ. of California v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425,  429- 30 (1997). Where an action names a state agency  as a defendant, but the suit ""is in essence one for the  recovery of money from the state, the state is the real,  substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its  sovereign immunity from suit . . . ."" Id. [*9]  At 429  (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury of  Ind., 323 U.S. 459 (1945)). Because a suit against the  Connecticut Department of Transportation essentially is  a suit against the State of Connecticut, the court finds  that Defendant is entitled to exercise 6 sovereign immunity where that protection has not been  waived. See Martires v.Connecticut Dep't of Transp.,  596 F. Supp. 2d 425, 445 (D. Conn. 2009) (finding that  the Connecticut Department of Transportation was  protected by sovereign immunity against civil rights  claims). Page 4 of 12 And it is well settled that Connecticut has not consented  to defend CFEPA claims in federal court. See Lyon v.  Jones, 168 F. Supp. 2d 1, *6 (D. Conn. 2001)  (dismissing CFEPA claims as barred by the Eleventh  Amendment). To the contrary, the CFEPA specifies that  suits may be brought only in the state's superior court.  Pawlow v. Dep't ofEmergency Servs. & Pub. Prot., 172  F. Supp. 3d 568, 578 (D. Conn. 2016). Therefore, this  federal court may not hear the CFEPA claims brought in  this action. Plaintiffs argue that the court may hear the CFEPA  claims pursuant to supplemental jurisdiction, but  supplemental  jurisdiction  cannot  defeat  Eleventh  Amendment immunity. Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 121  (""[N]either pendent jurisdiction nor any other basis of  jurisdiction may override the Eleventh Amendment."");  see also Vadenv. Connecticut, 557 F. Supp. 2d 279,  289 (D. Conn. 2008) (""[T]he Eleventh Amendment  necessarily also bars exercise of federal statutory  supplemental jurisdiction over suits against a State."").  Therefore, it is clear that Counts Four6 and Six must be  dismissed. Plaintiff Del Valle's ADA claim is barred for [*10]  the  same reason. The Supreme Court has held, clearly and  unequivocally, that the Eleventh Amendment shields  state employers from claims arising under Title I of the  ADA, which is the part of the ADA that addresses  discrimination in employment. Bd. of Trustees of Univ.  of Alabama v. Garrett, 6 Because the court concludes that Count Four is  barred by sovereign immunity, the court need not reach  the question of whether Plaintiff Del Valle exhausted her  administrative remedies with respect to this claim. 7 531 U.S. 356, 360 (2001); see also Mary Jo C. v. New  York State & Loc. Ret. Sys., 707 F.3d 144, 171 (2d Cir.  2013) (""A public employee may not bring a Title II claim  against his or her employer, at least when the defendant  employer employs fifteen or more employees."").7 Thus,  there can be no argument that Count Three also must  be dismissed.8 2. Title VII Claims The Eleventh Amendment does not bar citizens from  suing state agencies under Title VII, though. The court  therefore turns to Counts One, Two, and Five. Counts  One  and  Two  assert  claims  of  racial  discrimination and retaliation, respectively, as to each  plaintiff. Count Five asserts gender discrimination as to  Plaintiff Del Valle. Defendant argues that all these  counts must be dismissed as they relate to Plaintiff Del  Valle because they fail to state a claim. And Defendant  argues  that  Counts  One  and  Two  must  be  dismissed [*11]  as they relate to Plaintiff Wilson  because he failed to exhaust his administrative  remedies. Finally, Defendant argues that Plaintiff Wilson  has failed to state a claim in Count One (the  discrimination claim). i. Exhaustion The court takes up the exhaustion argument first. There  is a comprehensive administrative framework in place to  address claims arising under Title VII. Plaintiffs must  first file a complaint with the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission (""EEOC""), who 7 The complaint names 14 of Defendant's employees by  name, and references others more generally, so the  court is satisfied that this case fits within the ambit of  Mary Jo C. 8Plaintiffs have filed a motion to amend the complaint,  see ECF No. 25, asserting that such amendment is  necessary to incorporate the fact that the CHRO and the  EEOC have issued a release of jurisdiction and a notice  of right to sue in relation to a complaint of disability  discrimination from Plaintiff Del Valle. The court finds  the proposed amendment would be futile, since this new  factual allegation does not save the disability claims  from dismissal under the Eleventh Amendment. The  motion to amend therefore must be denied, and the  court  need  not  address  the  additional  communications [*12]  from the CHRO or the EEOC any  further. 8 investigates the allegations and determines whether  they ought to bring claims against the employer, or  whether they ought to release jurisdiction and allow the  plaintiff to pursue their claims individually. 42 U.S.C.A. §  2000e-5(b), (e). Many states, Connecticut among them,  have an analogous state agency that also reviews  allegations  of  employment  discrimination.  In  Connecticut, it is the CHRO.9 The EEOC is required to  defer to the CHRO for 60 days following the filing of a  discrimination complaint to allow the state to handle the  claim, if it chooses to do so. 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-5(c).  After this deferral period, the EEOC has jurisdiction to  Page 5 of 12 review the claim. Id. If the EEOC fails to make any  determination as to the complaint within 180 days of  having jurisdiction over it, the EEOC ""shall"" so notify the grievant, and the grievant then has  90 days to commence a civil suit. 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e- 5(f)(1). The administrative timeline for Plaintiffs is not entirely  clear. It appears that each plaintiff filed their grievance  with the CHRO, which in turn sent each complaint to the  EEOC for dual filing. ECF Nos. 14-2, 14-4. Plaintiff Del  Valle's complaint is dated June 30, 2020, and is stamped as being received by the State  of Connecticut [*13]  on July 10, 2020. ECF No. 14-4.  Plaintiff Wilson's complaint is dated June 30, 2020, and  is stamped as being received by the State of  Connecticut on July 21, 2020. ECF No. 14-2. Plaintiff Del Valle asserts that the CHRO released its  jurisdiction as to her complaint on March 23, 2022,  though the release itself was not docketed. ECF No. 1 ¶  54. Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff Del Valle  has exhausted the administrative remedies for her Title  VII claims, and so the court will accept that there is no  procedural impediment to her claims in Counts One,  Two, and Five. 9 There are specific time periods within which a  complaint must be filed with the CHRO and the EEOC,  but there is no argument that Plaintiffs' complaints were  untimely. 9 However, it appears that Plaintiff Wilson never received  a release of jurisdiction from the CHRO. Rather, on  January 18, 2022, he received a final agency action of  ""No Reasonable Cause,"" ECF No. 14-3, which is a dismissal  for the reason that there is ""no reasonable possibility  that investigating the complaint will result in a finding of  reasonable cause."" Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 46a-83(c).  Defendant argues in the Motion that this final agency  action does not serve to exhaust Defendant's [*14]   administrative remedies absent an official release of  jurisdiction. The court need not address this argument, though,  because whatever happened with the CHRO, it is clear  that Plaintiff Wilson did receive a right-to-sue notice  from the EEOC on June 14, 2022. See ECF No. 17-1.  The court finds that this notice satisfies the exhaustion  requirement as to his Title VII claims. Defendant's argument to the contrary is unavailing.  Defendant contends that Plaintiff Wilson's Title VII  claims still should be dismissed because he was  required to wait until after he had received this release  to file this action, but he filed suit well before receipt of  the notice, and thus his claims were premature. Defendant concedes, though, that under Title VII, the  exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional, and so it  may be waived or estopped where appropriate. Pietras  v. Bd.of Fire Comm'rs of Farmingville Fire Dist., 180  F.3d 468, 474 (2d Cir. 1999) (""The Supreme Court has  stated that 'filing a timely charge of discrimination with  the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in  federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of  limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable  tolling.'"") (quoting Zipes v.Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455  U.S. 385, 393 (1982)). Still, Defendant argues that  allowing these claims to proceed under these [*15]   circumstances would defeat the purpose of 10 exhaustion, namely, to allow an administrative agency  the first opportunity to take remedial action. The court is unpersuaded. In the first instance, the  EEOC had ample time to exercise its authority to  adjudicate the complaint, and it declined to take any  remedial action with respect to Plaintiff Wilson's claims.  Moreover, according to the relevant regulations, Plaintiff  Wilson should have received a release of jurisdiction  long before he did. By the court's calculation, had the  EEOC disposed of his complaint within 180 days of  having jurisdiction over it, Plaintiff Wilson would have  had his right-to-sue notice by March 18, 2021.10 But, of  course, a global pandemic can affect an agency's ability  to function efficiently, and for that same reason, the  court finds it appropriate to approach Plaintiff Wilson's  complaint with appreciation for the unique challenges  presented in navigating the administrative process when  the administration is not operating at full capacity. Moreover, even absent a global emergency, the court  finds  equitable  modification  of  the  exhaustion  requirement to be uniquely necessary in the present  circumstances. The court [*16]  recognizes that district  courts often dismiss premature Title VII claims, but  without prejudice to refiling once the right to sue has  been issued. See, e.g., Hladki v.Jeffrey's Consol., Ltd.,  652 F. Supp. 388, 393 (E.D.N.Y. 1987). In this case,  though, the notice did not issue until after this case had  Page 6 of 12 been initiated and the Motion had been filed, and so  refiling a separate action may well have rendered  Plaintiff Wilson's claim subject to claim preclusion. But  the 90-day period to initiate a civil suit has long expired  by the 10 This date is 240 days from the date the State of  Connecticut stamped its receipt of the complaint, which  represents the 180 days the EEOC has to investigate a  claim, plus 60 days for which it was required to defer  jurisdiction to the CHRO. 11 date of this ruling, which may well preclude Plaintiff  Wilson from pursuing his claims in a separate suit.  Thus, the court finds it in the interest of justice to grant  Plaintiff Wilson equitable relief in this case, and to  excuse him from strict compliance with the exhaustion  requirement. See Pinkard v. Pullman-Standard, 678  F.2d 1211, 1219 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982), reh'g en banc  denied, 685 F.2d 1383, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1105  (1983) (waiving exhaustion where procedural anomalies  related to class actions caused a plaintiff to miss his  opportunity to file suit after receipt of the right to  sue [*17]  notice). Because failure to exhaust is Defendant's only argument  for dismissing Plaintiff Wilson's retaliation claim in Count  Two, the Motion is denied with respect to that claim. 3. Failure to State a Claim Finally,  Defendant  argues  that  Plaintiff  Wilson's  discrimination claim and each of Plaintiff Del Valle's  remaining claims should be dismissed because they fail  to state a cognizable claim under Title VII. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that it is  unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an  employee because of that employee's race, color, or  sex. 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-2. The statute is intended ""to assure  equality of employment opportunities and to eliminate  those discriminatory practices and devices which have  fostered racially stratified job environments to the  disadvantage of minority citizens."" McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 800  (1973), holding modified by Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,  507 U.S. 604 (1993). ""Title VII prohibits both intentional  discrimination (known as 'disparate treatment') as well  as, in some cases, practices that are not intended to  discriminate but in fact have a disproportionately  adverse effect on minorities (known as 'disparate  impact')."" Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 577 (2009). Recognizing that ""most discrimination and retaliation is  not carried out so openly as to 12 provide direct proof of it,"" Sanders v. New York City  Hum. Res. Admin., 361 F.3d 749, 755 (2d Cir. 2004),  plaintiffs asserting [*18]  disparate treatment claims11  may show discriminatory intent by either direct or  circumstantial evidence of animus, Radwan v.Manuel,  55 F.4th 101, 132 (2d Cir. 2022). Direct evidence of discriminatory animus includes  employer policies, practices, or decisions that expressly  rely upon a protected characteristic. Young v. United  ParcelServ., Inc., 575 U.S. 206, 213 (2015). Plaintiffs do  not allege that Defendant took any action against them  explicitly because of their race or gender, so there is no  direct evidence of discrimination. The absence of direct  evidence is not fatal to their claims, though. They still  may show circumstantial evidence of discriminatory  animus using the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. First,  they must make out a prima facie case by showing that  they are a member of a protected class, that they are  qualified for the positions they held or continue to hold,  that they suffered an adverse action, and that the facts  imply a discriminatory intent. Radwan, 55 F.4th at 130.  With respect to the third element, an adverse action is  defined as a materially adverse change in the terms and  conditions of employment. Sanders, 361 F.3d at 755. It  must be more than an inconvenience or a change in an  employee's responsibilities. Id. And with respect to the  fourth element, there are several recognized methods  by  which  a  Title  VII  plaintiff [*19]   can  show  circumstances which might lead a reasonable juror to  infer discriminatory animus, one of which is to point to  comparators who are similarly situated to the plaintiff,  but who are not of the same protected class, and who  were not treated as harshly as the plaintiff. Radwan, 55 F.4th at 132. 11 Plaintiffs do not proceed under a disparate impact  theory. 13 If the plaintiffs successfully present a prima facie case of  discrimination, the burden shifts to Defendant to proffer  a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse  Page 7 of 12 action. Id. at 130. Then the burden shifts back to  Plaintiffs to show that the proffered reason is pretextual.  Id. There is no dispute that Plaintiffs have satisfied the first  and second elements of the prima facie test (that they  are members of a protected class and are qualified for  the work they were hired to perform). Defendant argues,  however, that neither plaintiff has alleged an adverse  action nor any facts that support an inference of  discrimination. i. Discrimination as to Plaintiff Wilson With respect to Plaintiff Wilson, Defendant argues that  the alleged denial of ""special privileges"" does not qualify as an adverse  action for purposes of Title VII. The court hesitates to  find that [*20]  the denial of perquisites made available  to some workers can never provide the basis for a Title  VII claim, but it agrees with Defendant in this instance.  Absent any description in the complaint of what these  ""special privileges"" were, the court cannot assess  whether they qualify as materially adverse changes to  the terms of Plaintiff Wilson's employment. Accordingly, the Motion is  granted insofar as Count One seeks to recover for the  denial of these ""special privileges."" However, it cannot be argued that Plaintiff Wilson's  termination qualifies as an adverse action sufficient to  carry his Title VII claim. Thus, the court finds the third  element of the prima facie case satisfied with respect to  Plaintiff Wilson in Count One. 14 The court also finds the fourth element satisfied.12  There are two facts which, when taken together, may  lead a reasonable factfinder to infer discriminatory  animus. First, Plaintiff Wilson was fired for an incident  (which he denies occurs at all) that allegedly occurred  over a month before he was fired, for which he received  no intervening discipline before his termination. And  second, at the termination itself, Defendant's acting  director allegedly told Plaintiff [*21]  Wilson that if he  had ""kept his mouth shut"" then he would not have been  losing his job. That remark appears to refer to Plaintiff  Wilson's complaints about racial discrimination, and the  fact that the remark was made at the moment of his  termination is sufficient to allow a reasonable factfinder  to infer that the termination was motivated by  discriminatory animus.13 Although the McDonnell Douglas framework has two  additional steps, Defendant does not make any  argument as to their burden at the next step. That is to  say, Defendant does not argue that they had a  legitimate reason for terminating Plaintiff Wilson. But  even assuming that they were to point to the same  justification given at the time of the termination (Plaintiff  Wilson's alleged nap on the job), the court would find  that these same two facts would support an inference  that the justification is pretextual. Accordingly, the Motion must be denied with respect to  Plaintiff Wilson's Title VII claim for discrimination in  Count One. 12Defendant argues that Plaintiff Wilson has not  described any similarly-situated individuals, and this is  true, but that argument related to the individuals  receiving ""special treatment,"" which the court already  has [*22]  found is not an adequately-pled adverse  action. Thus, the court will not address this argument  here. 13The court acknowledges Defendant's point that  Plaintiff Wilson made his complaint to his union representative and not to his manager, but again, the  fact that a manager referred to it allows the court to  draw the reasonable inference from the alleged facts  that the complaint had made its way to Defendant. 15 ii. Discrimination as to Plaintiff Del Valle Plaintiff Del Valle asserts that she has experienced  adverse action in the denial of training and overtime  opportunities, the assignment of more arduous tasks,  fewer perquisites, and the rejection of her request to be  the backup clerk. Plaintiff Del Valle points out that courts have concluded  that the denial of opportunities for professional  development, like trainings, can qualify as an adverse  action, where those opportunities ""bear on either [the]  plaintiff's opportunities for professional growth and  career advancement or directly on [the] plaintiff's  compensation."" Nakis v. Potter, No. 01 CIV. 10047 (HBP), 2004 WL  2903718, at *20 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 2004). But it is not  alleged that the trainings from which Plaintiff Del Valle  was excluded had any effect on her career or  Page 8 of 12 compensation. The only trainings she cites are one on  [*23] ""the double wing"" and one involving ""signs and  markings,"" the latter of which enabled employees to  earn some sort of ""fuel certification."" There is no  explanation of what it would mean for Plaintiff Del  Valle's career if she were trained on the double wing, or  if she had the referenced certification. Plaintiff Del Valle  never alleges that these trainings (or any other) would  have enabled her to progress in her career. For this  reason, the court cannot conclude that the exclusion  from trainings qualifies as an adverse action.14 Similarly, it is not clear that the position of backup clerk  is superior in any way to Plaintiff Del Valle's current position. The simple fact that  an individual has sought but has been denied a  particular position is not, in itself, an adverse action.  There must be some affirmative indicia as to why the  denied position is more desirable, perhaps because it 14 The court notes, too, that Plaintiff Del Valle's  allegation with respect to the signs-and-markings  training appears to be that she was excluded from the  training because she was on light duty at the time,  which she claims was an example of disability  discrimination. But, as discussed previously, the  disability [*24]  claims have been dismissed. 16 has better pay or better hours. See Beyer v. Cnty. of  Nassau, 524 F.3d 160, 164 (2d Cir. 2008) (""A denial of a  transfer may also constitute an adverse employment  action, but we require a plaintiff to proffer objective  indicia of material disadvantage; 'subjective, personal  disappointment[ ]' is not enough."") (quoting Galabya v.  N.Y. City Bd. of Educ., 202 F.3d 636, 640 (2d Cir.2000))  (alteration in original). But here again, Plaintiff Del Valle  fails to offer any specifics as to the backup clerk  position. Consequently, the court cannot find that the  failure to make her the backup clerk qualifies as an  adverse action for the purposes of her discrimination  claim. Plaintiff Del Valle also asserts that she has been denied  certain perquisites and has been made to perform more  arduous tasks than others. But, here, too, there are  insufficient facts from which the court can find an  adverse action. With respect to perquisites, she alleges  that one white coworker is permitted to wear shoes that  do not have steel toes and may ""go where[]ever she  wants."" ECF No. 1 ¶ 21. In the first instance, it is not  clear what Plaintiff Del Valle is alleging when she says  this other individual may go where she wants. The court  will assume for this discussion that the allegation is that  this colleague [*25]  is permitted to be off-task without  being disciplined. Even with that assumption, though,  the court cannot find that these de minimus allowances  for other coworkers materially affects the terms and  conditions of Plaintiff Del Valle's employment. While in  some cases the inconsistent application of discipline  may qualify as an adverse action, Plaintiff Del Valle  does not allege that she was subjected to discipline for  these workplace violations. She states that she ""was not  permitted"" to wear shoes without steel toes, but it is not  clear  whether  she  was  disciplined  for  wearing  nonconforming shoes, and if so, what discipline was  meted out. The same is true for the 17 alleged allowance of a white coworker to have long  lunch breaks. Thus, even making several inferences (or  perhaps assumptions) in Plaintiff Del Valle's favor, the  court cannot find that these alleged facts show an  adverse action. And with respect to her work assignments, generally  speaking, ""[t]he assignment of tasks that are within the  description or duties of the position, even if less  desirable, do not rise to the level of an adverse  employment  action.""  Nidzon  v.  Konica  Minolta  Bus.Sols., USA, Inc., 752 F. Supp. 2d 336, 350  (S.D.N.Y. 2010). Plaintiff Del Valle does not assert that  the tasks she was asked to [*26]  perform were not  within her usual job description, and her ""subjective  dissatisfaction with her assignments is insufficient"" to  show an adverse action, even in combination with all  Plaintiff Del Valle's other allegations. Reckard v. Cnty. of Westchester, 351 F. Supp. 2d 157,  161 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). The only alleged conduct that may satisfy the ""adverse  action""  requirement  is  the  denial  of  overtime  opportunities. The allegation, though, is devoid of any  specifics. The entire assertion states, ""Consistently  throughout her employment by DOT Del Valle has been  given less overtime opportunities [sic] than employees  who are not Hispanic women."" ECF No. 1 ¶ 26. It is  difficult to ascertain from this single, unsupported  statement whether this alleged denial rises to the level  of an adverse action. But the court need not make any conclusions as to the  sufficiency of the factual allegation because it is clear  Page 9 of 12 that Plaintiff Del Valle's discrimination claim still fails at  the next element. Even if the court were to accept this  bald accusation as a plausibly-pled adverse action, the  court could not infer from that single sentence any  discriminatory animus. 18 Plaintiff Del Valle has not asserted any facts that could  show that the women who were given overtime instead  of her [*27]  were similarly situated to her. She does not  specifically identify these comparators in any way, much  less state their positions or level of experience, or even  their relevant demographic characteristics. There simply  is insufficient information from which the court could  conclude that the referenced comparators are similarly  situated to Plaintiff Del Valle. And there are no other alleged facts from which the  court could infer that the denial of overtime resulted  from discriminatory animus. Although Plaintiff Del Valle  alleges that her crew leader made disparaging  comments about women working for the Department of  Transportation and that her supervisor referred to  Hispanics as ""you people,"" this is insufficient to show  discriminatory animus as to the denied overtime. In the first instance, it is nowhere alleged that the crew  leader and supervisor had anything to do with the denial  of her overtime. And even assuming that they did  control her schedule, it is unclear whether their remarks  were sufficiently inflammatory or frequent. Stray  comments ""do not amount to the 'steady barrage of  opprobrious ... comments' sufficient to alter the conditions"" of Plaintiff  Del Valle's employment. Brennerv. City of New York  Dep't of Educ., 659 F. App'x 52, 54 (2d Cir. 2016)  (quoting [*28]  Tolbert v. Smith, 790 F.3d 427, 439 (2d  Cir. 2015)) (alteration in original). Plaintiff asserts that  her crew leader says things ""to the effect"" that women  should not be working for Defendant, but she gives no  specifics. The court therefore cannot assess the content  and context of these comments to corroborate her  conclusion. Similarly, while referring to a particular  group as ""you people"" certainly can denote a bias  relevant to a Title VII claim, the allegation in the  complaint is only that Plaintiff Del Valle's crew leader  and supervisor 19 have used this reference. Again, absent any context for  these comments, it is difficult for the court to conclude  that these comments alone can sustain her claim. It also is unclear when and how often these comments  were made. Plaintiff Del Valle alleges that she has  heard her crew leader comment about the unsuitability  of women to Defendant's work ""[f]rom the beginning of  her employment,"" but she does not allege the frequency  of these comments. And her allegation as to the use of  ""you people"" could just as easily show a single incident  as several. Accordingly, even assuming that Plaintiff Del  Valle's denied overtime opportunities constitute an  adverse employment action, she has not adequately  pled [*29]   discriminatory  animus  such  that  her  discrimination claims could survive dismissal. Accordingly, Counts One and Five are dismissed (Count  One as it relates to Plaintiff Del Valle). iii. Retaliation as to Plaintiff Del Valle15 Retaliation claims follow a similar burden-shifting  framework as discrimination claims follow. ""First, the  plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of retaliation  by showing: '(1) participation in a protected activity; (2)  that the defendant knew of the protected activity; (3) an  adverse  employment  action;  and  (4)  a  causal  connection between the protected activity and the  adverse employment action.'"" Hicks v. Baines, 593 F.3d  159, 164 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Jute v. Hamilton  Sundstrand Corp., 420 F.3d 166, 173 (2d Cir.2005).  Again, success at this step shifts the burden to  Defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory  reason for the adverse action. Id. And finally, 15 As noted supra, Defendant does not argue for  dismissal of Plaintiff Wilson's retaliation claim. 20 the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to proffer evidence  from which a factfinder reasonably could infer a  retaliatory motive for the adverse action. Id. Here, Plaintiff Del Valle complained about discrimination  in the workplace, which qualifies as protected activity for  purposes of Title VII. See Littlejohn v. City of New York,  795 F.3d 297, 319 (2d Cir. 2015) (finding [*30]  that  internal complaints of discrimination are protected  activities). And, since she complained directly to  management, Defendant certainly knew of the protected  activity. Thus, the first two elements clearly are satisfied. The third and fourth elements prove as problematic for  Plaintiff Del Valle's retaliation claim as they were for her  discrimination claim, though, despite the more lax  Page 10 of 12 standard applied to retaliation claims. ""An adverse  employment action in a retaliation case includes  conduct that is 'harmful to the point that it could well  dissuade a reasonable worker from making or  supporting a charge of discrimination.'"" Duplan v. City of  New York, 888 F.3d 612, 626-27 (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting  Shultz v. Congregation Shearith Israel, 867 F.3d 298,  309 (2d Cir. 2017)). ""This definition covers a broader  range of conduct than does the adverse-action standard  for claims of discrimination under Title VII . . . ."" Vegav.  Hempstead Union Free Sch. Dist., 801 F.3d 72, 90 (2d  Cir. 2015). ""[T]he antiretaliation provision, unlike the  substantive [discrimination] provision, is not limited to  discriminatory actions that affect the terms and  conditions of employment."" Id. (quoting Burlington N.  &Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 57 (2006))  (alterations in original). There is no bright-line test courts  employ in determining whether particular conduct  constitutes an adverse employment action. Fincher v.  Depository Tr. & Clearing Corp., 604 F.3d 712, 721 (2d  Cir. 2010). Rather, courts take a fact-intensive  approach, scrutinizing [*31]  each case to determine  whether a challenged action rises to the level required  by the statute. Id. 21 Thus, although Plaintiff Del Valle could not show an  adverse action for purposes of her discrimination claim,  the court must reassess that conduct (denial of training  and overtime, denial of appointment as backup clerk,  denial of perquisites, and assignment to more arduous  tasks) to determine whether it yet can satisfy the  requirements of her retaliation claim. The Second Circuit has held that the assignment of  more difficult tasks, see Vega, 801 F.3d at 91 (finding  that a teacher's assignment of more difficult classes  qualified as an adverse employment action), and the  denial of overtime, see Lewis v. TriboroughBridge &  Tunnel Auth., 31 F. App'x 746, 748 (2d Cir. 2002)  (affirming a jury verdict in a plaintiff's favor where the  plaintiff alleged, inter alia, denial of overtime as the  basis for her retaliation claim), may qualify as an  adverse employment actions for purposes of a Title VII  retaliation claim. But Plaintiff Del Valle clearly fails to  establish that she experienced these actions following  her January 22, 2020, complaint to management. To the  contrary, Plaintiff Del Valle clearly asserts that she has  been made to perform harder tasks and has been  denied  overtime  throughout [*32]   her  time  with  Defendant. Thus, the causal connection between this  conduct and the protected activity is absent. Similarly, without any specifics as to when the alleged  denial of perquisites and longer breaks occurred, the  court cannot find the requisite causal connection to that  conduct, even assuming it could qualify as an adverse  employment action. See Chungv. City Univ. of New  York, 605 F. App'x 20, 23 (2d Cir. 2015)(stating that  where ""timing is the only basis for a claim of retaliation,  and gradual adverse job actions began well before the  plaintiff had ever engaged in any protected activity, an  inference of retaliation 22 does not arise."") (quoting Slattery v. Swiss Reins. Am.  Corp., 248 F.3d 87, 95 (2d Cir.2001). And with respect to the denial of training opportunities  and her request to be backup clerk,16 here, again,  Plaintiff Del Valle fails to allege that these trainings had  any effect on her progression in her career, or that the  position of backup clerk was superior in any way to her  usual role. Absent some allegation that these trainings  would have led to some advantage to Plaintiff Del Valle,  the court cannot find that exclusion therefrom would  dissuade a reasonable person from asserting charges of  discrimination. See Leiferv. New York State Div. of  Parole, 391 F. App'x 32, 34 (2d Cir. 2010) (finding that  failing to provide a training to the plaintiff, inter alia, was  insufficient [*33]   to  demonstrate  an  adverse  employment action). Even if this conduct could qualify as an adverse  employment action for purposes of her retaliation claim,  there is nothing from which the court could infer  discriminatory motivation. One of the trainings she  specifically mentions (of only two) was held in  November 2021, over a year and a half after she had  made her internal complaint and over a year after she  had filed her complaint with the CHRO. Similarly, her  request to be stationed at the backup clerk position  came at some point after May 2021,17 over a year after  the internal complaint and almost a year after the CHRO  complaint. The lengthy period between the protected  activity and the allegedly retaliatory conduct attenuates  any causal connection. Thus, even taking as given that  Plaintiff Del Valle experienced an 16Again, the court acknowledges that these actions  appear to be pleaded in connection with Plaintiff Del Valle's disability discrimination claims, but the court  addresses them here nonetheless. 17While it is clear that Plaintiff Dell Valle made several  Page 11 of 12 requests for the backup clerk position, it is not clear  when she first made the request. But it appears from the  complaint that [*34]  her first request came after her on- the-job accident, since management told her she could  not be backup clerk while on light duty, and since she  was on light duty after the accident. ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 46- 49. So, because the accident occurred in May 2021, her  pleading shows that her request could not have been  before that time. 23 adverse employment action that satisfied the third  element of her prima facie case, she has not  established a causal connection between her internal  complaint and those actions that satisfies the fourth  element. However, though it is not clearly stated in the complaint  or thoroughly argued in Plaintiff Del Valle's opposition, the court finds that she  does have an actionable claim for Plaintiff Wilson's termination. Title VII's antiretaliation  provision covers a broad range of employer conduct.  Burlington, 548 U.S. at 62-63 (discussing the broader  language Congress employed in the antiretaliation  provision  as  compared  to  the  antidiscrimination  provision). Violative actions need not affect the  employee's terms of employment or employment  conditions. Id. at 63. It need only dissuade an employee  from engaging in protected activity, and actions taken  against a third party may certainly serve that  purpose. [*35]  See Thompson v. N. Am. Stainless, LP,  562 U.S. 170, 175 (2011) (""We think there is no textual  basis for making an exception to [the broad standard for  retaliatory conduct] for third-party reprisals . . . .""). And  while the Supreme Court of the United States has  declined to explicitly list those relationships that could  support a retaliation claim, this court finds that the  plaintiffs' relationship as mother and son certainly is  close enough to render adverse action against one to be  adequate deterrence for the other. Id. at 174. (""We think it obvious that a reasonable worker might be  dissuaded from engaging in protected activity if she  knew that her fiancé would be fired.""). Furthermore, the court finds that Plaintiff Del Valle has  alleged sufficient facts to support the rational inference  of a causal connection. First, Plaintiff Del Valle's  complaint (in January 2020) and Plaintiff Wilson's  termination (in April 2020) were close enough in time  that temporal proximity alone may carry the requisite  causal inference. Second, the 24 clear closeness of the plaintiffs' relationship, as  indicated by Plaintiff Del Valle's attention to her son's  employment concerns (namely, her attention to the  discrepancy in his paycheck), would indicate to others at  her job [*36]  a maternal sense of affection and  responsibility toward him.18 And finally, the threat  Plaintiff Del Valle received from her higher-ups that they  would ""get rid"" of her after her internal complaint had  been disposed of indicates a retaliatory predilection that,  though the threat postdated her son's termination, yet  could lead a factfinder to conclude that Plaintiff Wilson's  termination was a result of that predilection. Accordingly, the court finds that Plaintiff Del Valle has  stated a cognizable claim for retaliation under Title VII."

"United States v. Palms, 21 F.4th 689","                                                [*692]  McHUGH, Circuit Judge. The Government tried Appellant Ramar Palms before a  jury in the Northern District of Oklahoma and obtained  guilty verdicts on three crimes related to sex trafficking.  On appeal, Mr. Palms asks this court to reverse his  convictions and remand for a new trial for two reasons.  First, Mr. Palms argues the district court should have  suppressed the evidence obtained from his cell phone  because the warrant and the search of his cell phone  violated the Fourth Amendment. Second, he argues the  district court abused its discretion when it excluded  sexual behavior evidence under Federal Rule of  Evidence 412 because the exclusion violated the Fifth  and Sixth Amendments. As detailed below, we hold the warrant to search Mr.  Palms's cell phone was sufficiently particular and the  search was reasonable. We also hold the district court  did not abuse its discretion in excluding sexual behavior  evidence under Rule 412. Therefore, [**2]  we affirm Mr.  Palms's convictions. I. BACKGROUND A. Factual History  [*693]  1. Mr. Palms and M.W. In September 2018, Mr. Palms met M.W., a twenty- seven-year-old single mom, at a bar in Tulsa,         Page 2 of 10 Oklahoma. They began to spend time together and went  on a few dates. Eventually, Mr. Palms invited M.W. to  go on a road trip to Louisiana with him. On that road trip,  Mr. Palms told M.W. he was a pimp and that he wanted  her to make money for him. At the time, they were in the  car together ""in the middle of nowhere,"" and M.W. could  not get away from Mr. Palms. ROA Vol. III at 1022. That  night, they stopped at a hotel in Houston, Texas. There,  Mr. Palms assaulted M.W. Then, he advertised M.W.'s  services online and forced M.W. to go on her first ""date.""  Mr. Palms taught M.W. about the pimping industry and  told her she should keep her head down and not look  any man in the eyes because another pimp might steal  her from him. When they returned to Tulsa, Mr. Palms began  controlling every aspect of M.W.'s life. Mr. Palms  required M.W. to quit her two jobs and work for him full- time as a prostitute. He constantly communicated with  M.W. via text messages and phone calls and monitored  her whereabouts. Mr. Palms also [**3]  tracked who  M.W. talked to and controlled her money, car, and  phone. If M.W. did something or talked to a man he did  not approve of, he would hit or strangle her. Mr. Palms posted ads or required M.W. to post ads to  various websites offering commercial sex acts from  M.W. Mr. Palms created a template for her to follow to  ensure she would attract clients. He required M.W. to  post the ads regularly throughout the day and to go on  at least four or five ""dates"" a day. Clients paid Mr. Palms  by Cash App or paid M.W. in cash. In either case, Mr.  Palms required M.W. to give him all the money she  earned. Mr. Palms would occasionally buy M.W. food  and other items, but M.W. had to ask him for money to  support herself and her two children. M.W. could not  cover her utility bills or rent, and eventually she was  evicted. 2. Arrest On November 20, 2018, Tulsa police officer Justin  Oxford was investigating online advertisements for  suspected prostitution. Officer Oxford responded to one  of the ads and was directed to meet M.W. in room 220  at the Peoria Inn in Tulsa. When he arrived, he saw Mr.  Palms parked in a car near room 220. After M.W. let  Officer Oxford into the room, he asked for a sex act  and [**4]  put money on the nightstand. When M.W.  agreed, Officer Oxford identified himself as a police  officer and arrested her. M.W. told Officer Oxford that  she was being forced to work as a prostitute and  identified Mr. Palms as her pimp. Officer Oxford also  saw a text message from Mr. Palms on M.W.'s phone  screen. The police arrested Mr. Palms in the parking lot  and seized his cell phone. 3. Warrant and Search of Mr. Palms's Cell Phone Officer Oxford sought a warrant to search Mr. Palms's  cell phone from a Tulsa County judge. In his affidavit  supporting the warrant, Officer Oxford detailed the  events of November 20, 2018, and the information he  obtained from M.W. about  [*694]  her connection with  Mr. Palms. The judge issued a warrant to search Mr.  Palms's cell phone. The warrant said ""[p]robable cause  ha[d] been shown"" and authorized the police to search  Mr.  Palms's  cell  phone  for  ""[r]ecords,  data,  communications and information which are evidence of  Human Trafficking."" ROA Vol. I at 68. Specifically, the  warrant authorized the police to search Mr. Palms's cell  phone for evidence including, but not limited to, all digital evidence  stored on removable storage and magnetic or  electronic data contained [**5]  in the contents of  such tablet, cell phone, laptop, camera and/or  memory cards, including electronic data storage  devices, which in whole or part contain any and all  evidence related to the subscriber information from  the SIM (subscriber identification module) and/or  ownership information for the device, electronic  mail, call logs, contacts, calendars, location  services information, global positioning (GPS) data  and information, internet chat communications,  browser  cache,  auto-complete  forms,  stored  passwords,  instant  messaging,  SMS  (short  message service), MMS (multimedia message  service),  social  media  account  data  and  information, application data and information,  documents,  photographs,  images,  graphics,  pictures, videos, movies, audio or video recordings,  any associated metadata, and any recorded  documents  depicting  communications,  correspondence  or  storage  of  these  communications, files, graphics, documents, or  other data related to the crime of Human  Trafficking. Id. Officer Brian Booth, a member of the Tulsa Police  Department's intelligence unit, extracted all the data  from Mr. Palms's cell phone pursuant to the warrant.  Officer  Booth  gave  the  extracted  information,  Page 3 of 10 excluding [**6]  the cloud data, to Officer Oxford, who  searched it. B. Procedural History In July 2019, a federal grand jury charged Mr. Palms  with sex trafficking by force, fraud, and coercion in  violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(1)  (Count One); attempted obstruction of sex trafficking  enforcement in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) (Count  Two); and retaliation against a victim and causing bodily  harm in violation 18 U.S.C. § 1513(b)(2) (Count Three). 1. Motion to Suppress Prior to trial, Mr. Palms submitted a motion arguing the  evidence obtained from his cell phone should be  suppressed because the warrant and the search of his  cell phone violated the Fourth Amendment. He made  four arguments in support: (1) the document titled  ""Search Warrant"" was not actually a warrant because it  did not have a sufficient statement of probable cause,  command language, or appropriate headings; (2) the  warrant lacked the particularity required by the Fourth  Amendment because it did not limit the search to  specific materials or to a specific crime; (3) the  extraction and search of the data from  [*695]  the cell  phone was unreasonable; and (4) the good faith  exception did not apply because well-trained officers  would have understood this warrant was invalid. The district court held a limited evidentiary [**7]  hearing  on the search of the cell phone. At the hearing, the                  district court heard from Officer Booth, who extracted  the data from the cell phone, and Officer Oxford, who  searched it. Officer Booth testified that he reviewed the warrant and  extracted the data for the search. Officer Booth  explained that he first tried to perform more limited types  of extractions known as a file extraction and a logical  extraction, but they did not work on Mr. Palms's cell  phone because these extraction methods were blocked  by the phone's software or the carrier. He then resorted  to the last extraction option available on the machine he  was using, which was a broad physical extraction.  Officer Booth did not contact any other agencies to help  him limit his extraction because he believed they would  have the same options he had. The physical extraction  created a byte-for-byte copy of the cell phone with data  and metadata. Officer Booth did not limit the search to  certain types of files. He extracted all the data on the  cell phone. Officer Oxford testified about the methodology he used  to search the data. He informally limited his search to  the relevant time-period from September 2018, when  Mr. Palms met M.W., [**8]  to November 20, 2018,  when they were arrested. His methodology involved  viewing SMS messages, MMS messages, photographs,  and emails. Sometimes he used the search function to  search key words, but he also viewed the evidence in  their locations on the cell phone to determine their  context. When Officer Oxford saw something unrelated  to the crime of human trafficking, he moved on quickly.  At one point, Officer Oxford discovered privileged  attorney-client  communications,  and  he  promptly  stopped his search to contact the prosecutor. He did not  come across evidence of any crimes other than human  trafficking during the search. After the evidentiary hearing, the district court denied  Mr. Palms's motion to suppress. The district court held  the warrant satisfied the Fourth Amendment because it  was supported by probable cause, and it was            Page 4 of 10 sufficiently  particular  because  the  search  was  reasonable under United States v. Loera, 923 F.3d 907  (10th Cir. 2019). Alternatively, the district court  determined both the officers relied in good faith on the  warrant. Mr. Palms asked the district court to  reconsider, but the district court denied that motion. 2. Motion in Limine Under Federal Rule of Evidence 412, evidence of the  victim's prior sexual behavior is generally not admissible  in a civil or [**9]  criminal proceeding involving alleged  sexual misconduct. Prior to trial, the Government   [*696]  submitted a Motion in Limine, invoking Rule 412  and requesting the district court prohibit Mr. Palms from  introducing any evidence that M.W. had engaged in  commercial sex acts before she met Mr. Palms. Mr.  Palms opposed the motion on the ground that this  evidence was necessary to protect his Fifth and Sixth  Amendment rights. He also submitted a notice of sexual  behavior evidence, identifying specific sexual behavior  evidence he sought to admit. This included evidence  that M.W. had voluntarily engaged in commercial sex  before she met Mr. Palms, M.W. had an understanding  of the commercial sex business before she met Mr.  Palms,  and  M.W.  knew  how  to  post  online  advertisements for commercial sex before she met Mr.  Palms.  Mr.  Palms  argued  the  evidence  was  constitutionally required because it supported his  alternative theory that it was M.W. who recruited and  enticed Mr. Palms to join her commercial sex business.  He also said the evidence may be necessary to  impeach her credibility generally and specifically on the  elements of the crimes with which Mr. Palms was  charged. The district court ultimately prohibited Mr. Palms from  presenting [**10]  evidence about M.W.'s prior sexual  behavior under Rule 412. The district court determined  the sexual behavior evidence was generally not  admissible, but it left the final decision for trial because  the evidence may be admissible if it was directly  relevant to Mr. Palms's charges or to correct a  misleading impression created by the testimony. The  district court also ruled the evidence would not be  allowed to impugn M.W.'s credibility generally, but it left  open the possibility that Mr. Palms could use M.W.'s      prior court testimony for direct impeachment purposes. At trial, M.W. testified that prostitution was ""not  something [she] would choose to do on [her] own,"" ROA  Vol. III at 1108. To diminish her credibility, Mr. Palms  sought to introduce the evidence of her commercial sex  acts prior to meeting Mr. Palms. With this evidence, Mr.  Palms sought to dispute M.W.'s testimony about her  fear of Mr. Palms when he identified himself as a pimp  and the impression that Mr. Palms taught her how  prostitution works and how to post solicitation ads  online. The district court denied the request, stating the  evidence of prior sexual behavior was irrelevant to  whether Mr. Palms forced her to advertise and  perform [**11]  commercial sex acts in 2018. 3. Trial and Conviction In December 2019, the Government tried the charges  against Mr. Palms to a jury, but the jury could not reach  a verdict. The district court declared a mistrial, and at  the Government's request, set the case for retrial. Prior  to the second trial, the Government obtained a  superseding indictment containing all three of the  original  charges  and  two  additional  charges:  transporting an individual for prostitution in violation of  18 U.S.C. § 2421(a) (Count Four) and online promotion  and facilitation of prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. §  2421A(a) (Count Five). During the second trial, the district court granted a  motion for acquittal as to Count Five (online promotion  and facilitation of prostitution), but it sent the rest of the  charges to the jury. The jury acquitted Mr. Palms on  Count Three (retaliation against a victim and causing  bodily harm) and found him guilty on Counts One (sex  trafficking  by  force,  fraud,  and  coercion),  Two  (attempted obstruction of sex trafficking enforcement),  and Four (transporting  [*697]  an individual for  prostitution). The district court imposed a sentence of  235 months each on Counts One and Two, and 120  months on Count Four, all running concurrently. [**12]  II. DISCUSSION On appeal, Mr. Palms challenges the district court's  decisions to admit the cell phone evidence and to  exclude evidence that M.W. engaged in commercial sex  acts before she met Mr. Palms. We undertake our  analysis by first considering whether the search and  seizure of Mr. Palms's cell phone satisfied the  requirements articulated in the Fourth Amendment.  Page 5 of 10 Then, we review the district court's exclusion of the  sexual behavior evidence under Rule 412. A. Search and Seizure Mr. Palms appeals the district court's decision denying  the motion to suppress the evidence obtained from his  cell phone because (1) the warrant was invalid under  the Fourth Amendment and (2) the search was  unreasonable. When reviewing a district court's denial of  a motion to suppress, we ""view the evidence in the light  most favorable to the government and accept the district  court's  factual  findings  unless  they  are  clearly  erroneous."" United States v. Grimmett, 439 F.3d 1263,  1268 (10th Cir. 2006). But we review de novo the  ultimate question of reasonableness under the Fourth  Amendment. Loera, 923 F.3d at 915. 1. Applicable Law The Fourth Amendment provides, The right of the people to be secure in their  persons, houses, papers, and effects, against  unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be  violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon  probable cause, supported [**13]  by Oath or  affirmation, and particularly describing the place to  be searched, and the persons or things to be  seized. U.S. Const. amend. IV. In other words, the Fourth  Amendment requires warrants to be supported by  probable cause and to describe with particularity who  and what can be searched and seized. After obtaining a  warrant, the Fourth Amendment also requires officers to  conduct the search and seizure reasonably. Here, Mr.  Palms argues neither the warrant nor the subsequent  search satisfied the constitutional requirements. 2. Warrant Particularity Requirement Mr. Palms argues the warrant was not constitutionally  valid because it did not particularly describe the things  to be seized even though it was limited to evidence of  human trafficking. Thus, we must determine whether      ""the crime of human trafficking"" is a sufficiently specific  crime such that a warrant's limitation to  [*698]  search  and  seize  evidence  of  it  satisfies  the  Fourth  Amendment's particularity requirement. We hold that it  is. The Fourth Amendment's particularity requirement  ""'ensures that the search will be carefully tailored to its  justifications[] and will not take on the character of the  wide-ranging  exploratory  searches  the  Framers  intended to prohibit.'"" United States v. Otero, 563 F.3d  1127, 1131-32 (10th Cir. 2009) (quoting Maryland v.  Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 84, 107 S. Ct. 1013, 94 L. Ed. 2d  72  (1987)).  Because  computers  can  contain  enormous [**14]  amounts of information and relevant  evidence can be stored in any location, the Fourth  Amendment requires warrants for computer searches to  ""affirmatively limit the search to evidence of specific . . .  crimes or specific types of material."" Id. at 1132  (quotation marks omitted). The same standard applies  to  cell  phones  because  they  are  essentially  ""'minicomputers that also happen to have the capacity  to be used as a telephone.'"" United States v. Russian,  848 F.3d 1239, 1245 (10th Cir. 2017) (quoting Riley v.  California, 573 U.S. 373, 393, 134 S. Ct. 2473, 189 L.  Ed. 2d 430 (2014)). The guiding purpose of this standard is to establish  practical guidelines about what can be searched and  seized, leaving nothing to the discretion of the officers                                     Page 6 of 10 executing the warrant. United States v. Leary, 846 F.2d  592, 600 (10th Cir. 1988) (""A description is sufficiently  particular when it enables the searcher to reasonably  ascertain and identify the things authorized to be  seized."" (quotation marks omitted)). Thus, ""practical  accuracy rather than technical precision controls the  determination of whether a search warrant adequately  describes the place to be searched."" Otero, 563 F.3d at  1132 (quotation marks omitted). As Mr. Palms contends, the warrant was not limited to  any specific types of materials, such as text messages,  emails, or pictures. Rather, the warrant said the  information to be searched and seized ""include[d], but  [was] not [**15]  limited to, all digital evidence stored on  removable storage and magnetic or electronic data  contained in the contents of such tablet, cell phone,  laptop, camera and/or memory cards."" ROA Vol. I at 68.  Such a broad authorization is permissible under our  precedent, so long as the warrant contained some  ""limiting principle."" See Russian, 848 F.3d at 1245. The Government contends the warrant contained such a  limitation because it permitted the officers to search and  seize only evidence of ""human trafficking."" But Mr.  Palms argues ""human trafficking"" is not sufficiently  specific because the warrant did not cite a specific  criminal statute and because human trafficking is a  broad term that gave the officers ""carte blanche to  search and seize anything in the phone's contents they  believed might pertain in any way to any human  trafficking, at any time, whether for forced labor, for sex,  for drug trafficking, or anything else arguably tied to the  broad universe of 'human trafficking.'"" Aplt. Opening Br.  at 18. We disagree. To be sufficiently particular, search warrants do not  have to identify specific statutes for the crimes to which   [*699]  they are limited. See United States v. Christie,  717 F.3d 1156, 1165 (10th Cir. 2013) (holding a warrant  was particular when it was limited to information [**16]   ""'related to the murder, neglect, and abuse of'"" a child);  United States v. Brooks, 427 F.3d 1246, 1252-53 (10th  Cir. 2005) (holding a warrant satisfied the particularity  requirement when it authorized officers to search a  computer ""for evidence of child pornography""). Mr.  Palms's contrary suggestion would inject the kind of  technical precision the Fourth Amendment does not  require. Christie, 717 F.3d at 1166 (explaining the  particularity requirement has never ""been understood to  demand of a warrant technical precision or elaborate  detail but only practical limitations affording reasonable  specificity""  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted)).  Therefore, the lack of a statutory citation does not  automatically render a warrant invalid. Rather, we must  determine whether the warrant adequately limited the  scope of the search despite the absence of a statutory  reference. The warrant here is sufficiently limited. Oklahoma state  law explicitly prohibits ""human trafficking."" Okla. Stat. tit.  21, § 748(B) (""It shall be unlawful to knowingly engage  in human trafficking.""). And the definition of ""human  trafficking"" is not as unrestrained as Mr. Palms  suggests. It is defined as ""modern-day slavery that  includes, but is not limited to, extreme exploitation and  the denial of freedom or liberty of an individual for  purposes of deriving [**17]  benefit from that individual's  commercial sex act or labor."" Id. § 748(A)(4). Although Oklahoma's definition of ""human trafficking""  includes both types of human trafficking—sex trafficking  and labor trafficking—it is still a sufficiently specific,  defined crime. See, e.g., United States v. Burgess, 576  F.3d 1078, 1083, 1091 (10th Cir. 2009) (holding a  warrant was sufficiently particular when it authorized a  search for evidence of the sale of any illegal controlled  substance even though probable cause for the warrant  was based on evidence of marijuana and cocaine). It  therefore does not run afoul of our rejection of warrants  that broadly encompass ""any crime."" Cf. Otero, 563  F.3d at 1132-33 (holding a warrant was not particular  when it had ""no limiting instruction whatsoever"" and  authorized ""a wide-ranging search of [the appellant]'s  computer""); Cassady v. Goering, 567 F.3d 628, 635-36  (10th Cir. 2009) (holding a warrant was not particular  when there was only ""probable cause to search for  evidence related to marijuana cultivation, yet the  warrant authorized the seizure of all possible evidence  of any crime in any jurisdiction"").               Page 7 of 10 Because Oklahoma law labels the crime as ""human  trafficking,"" and there is no separate ""sex trafficking""  crime, it is ""difficult to imagine how the . . . warrant could  have been [**18]  phrased more specifically."" United  States v. Le, 173 F.3d 1258, 1275 (10th Cir. 1999).  Indeed, the Oklahoma state judge who issued the  warrant and the Tulsa police officers who executed it  would have understood human trafficking to be a  specific crime. And most importantly,  [*700]  the  existence of a statutory definition of ""human trafficking""  would have enabled the executing Tulsa police officers  to understand what evidence the warrant permitted  them to search and seize. Therefore, the warrant's  limitation to evidence of the crime of human trafficking  satisfied  the  Fourth  Amendment's  particularity  requirement. 3. Reasonableness of the Search and Seizure After obtaining a warrant, the officers ""must conduct  their search 'strictly within the bounds set by the  warrant.'"" Loera, 923 F.3d at 916 (quoting Bivens v. Six  Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics,  403 U.S. 388, 395 n.7, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619  (1971)). ""Determining whether a search exceeds the  scope of its authorizing warrant is, like most inquiries  under  the  Fourth  Amendment,  an  exercise  in  reasonableness assessed on a case-by-case basis."" Id.  In general, ""investigators executing a warrant can look  anywhere where evidence described in the warrant  might conceivably be located."" Id. (citing United States  v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 824, 102 S. Ct. 2157, 72 L. Ed.  2d 572 (1982)). However, that limitation can be difficult  to enforce in a computer search where relevant data  could be stored anywhere. See id. To address this problem, we have focused [**19]  on  how the computer search was conducted rather than  what was searched.See id. at 917. ""Shifting our focus             in this way is necessary in the electronic search context  because search warrants typically contain few—if any— restrictions on where within a computer or other  electronic storage device the government is permitted to  search."" Id. (emphasis in original). The reasonableness  of the search method ""depends on the particular facts of  a given case."" Id. at 920. Mr. Palms first argues the extraction of information from  his cell phone was too broad. Officer Booth testified he  could not perform a more limited file extraction or a  logical extraction on Mr. Palms's cell phone, so he  conducted a broad physical extraction of the entire  contents and metadata. And Officer Booth testified that  seeking help from other agencies would have been  pointless because he believed they had the same  extraction options as he had. He therefore extracted a  byte-for-byte copy of the contents of the cell phone and  captured a vast amount of information, including  personal information unrelated to the suspected crime. Mr. Palms also argues the search of the extracted data  should have been limited so that the officers could not  view [**20]  any information that was not related to the  suspected crime. The district court found that Officer  Oxford limited his search to the time after Mr. Palms met  M.W. The court also determined that Officer Oxford   [*701]  searched SMS messages, MMS messages,  photographs, and some emails, and that he would move  on quickly when he came across information or  communications that were not potentially relevant to the  crime of human trafficking. The district court noted that  Officer Oxford discovered some privileged attorney- client  communications  during  his  search  and  immediately stopped to consult with the prosecutor. We have previously found a similar extraction and  search to be reasonable. In United States v. Burgess,  the officers obtained a warrant to search the defendant's  property for evidence of controlled substances. 576 F.3d  at 1083. During the search, the officers found a hard  drive and searched it. To begin the search, they ""ma[d]e  a byte-for-byte copy of the hard drive."" Id. at 1084.  Although this process captured information beyond the  scope of the warrant, we did not hold the search was  unreasonable. Id. at 1095. Rather, we explained that the  broad extraction was consistent with the reality that        Page 8 of 10 evidence of the crime could be found in various file  types. [**21]  Id. at 1093. The search of the extracted  files then proceeded with the focus on files that might  contain evidence of drug trafficking. Id. at 1094-95. The  officers viewed files even if they were not obviously  labeled with titles related to the suspected crime to  confirm they had not been deceptively labeled, but if the  file did not contain relevant evidence, the officers moved  on immediately. Id. at 1094-95. In Burgess, we  concluded  the  extraction  and  the  search  were  reasonable. Id. at 1095. We reach the same conclusion here. As in Burgess, the  evidence of human trafficking in this case could have  taken many forms, such as text messages, emails,  photographs,  internet  history,  and  transaction  applications. For this reason, the warrant did not limit  the search to one type of information contained on the  cell phone. And the physical extraction of all the data  from the cell phone was reasonable. Likewise, Officer  Oxford limited his search to the time-period when Mr.  Palms knew M.W. and viewed the types of files that  were most likely to contain evidence of the crime of  human trafficking. When he came across unrelated  personal information or communications, he quickly  moved to the next thing. And when he came across  privileged attorney-client communications, [**22]  he  immediately stopped his search and contacted the  prosecutor. This search methodology was sufficiently  limited. Therefore, both the extraction and the search  methodology were reasonable. Because the warrant and the search of the cell phone  complied with the Fourth Amendment, we affirm the  district court's denial of the motion to suppress. B. Federal Rule of Evidence 412 Mr. Palms argues the district court erred by excluding  evidence of M.W.'s prior commercial sex work under  Federal Rule of Evidence 412. Specifically, Mr. Palms  appeals the decision to exclude evidence that (1) M.W.  had knowledge of how to post online advertisements for  commercial sex before she met Mr. Palms, (2)  [*702]          M.W. had voluntarily engaged in commercial sex acts  before meeting Mr. Palms, and (3) M.W. knew about  certain aspects of the commercial sex business before  she met Mr. Palms. He argues exclusion of this  evidence violated the Confrontation Clause and his  federal due process rights. ""To the extent the challenge to the exclusion of  evidence proffered by the defendant is based on a  constitutional objection . . . we review the district court's  ruling excluding that evidence de novo."" United States v.  Pablo, 696 F.3d 1280, 1297 (10th Cir. 2012). Otherwise,  a district court's ruling on the admissibility of evidence is  reviewed for abuse of discretion. United States v. A.S.,  939 F.3d 1063, 1071 (10th Cir. 2019). 1. Applicable [**23]  Law Under Federal Rule of Evidence 412, ""[e]vidence  offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual  behavior"" and ""[e]vidence offered to prove a victim's  sexual predisposition"" are ""not admissible in any civil or  criminal  proceeding  involving  alleged  sexual  misconduct."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(a). The purpose of this  rule is ""to safeguard the alleged victim against the  invasion of privacy, potential embarrassment and sexual  stereotyping."" Fed. R. Evid. 412, advisory committee  notes to 1994 amendments. However, there is an  exception in criminal cases when the exclusion of the  evidence ""would violate the defendant's constitutional  rights."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C). As relevant here, defendants have constitutional rights  to due process and to confront witnesses against them.                     Page 9 of 10 The Fifth Amendment provides, ""[n]o person shall . . . be  deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process  of the law."" U.S. Const. amend. V. This amendment  provides  individuals  with  both  substantive  and  procedural due process rights. As it relates to this  appeal, the Due Process Clause provides a defendant  with the right to a fair trial. Fero v. Kerby, 39 F.3d 1462,  1478 (10th Cir. 1994) (""A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a  basic requirement of due process."" (quoting In re  Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136, 75 S. Ct. 623, 99 L. Ed.  942 (1955))). The Sixth Amendment provides, ""[i]n all criminal  prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be  confronted with the witnesses [**24]  against him."" U.S.  Const. amend. VI. This is known as the Confrontation  Clause, and its purpose is to guarantee defendants ""'an  opportunity for effective cross-examination.'"" Delaware  v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89  L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986) (quoting Delaware v. Fensterer,  474 U.S. 15, 20, 106 S. Ct. 292, 88 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1985)  (per curiam)) (emphasis in original). However, the right  is not limitless. It does not guarantee a defendant the  right to cross-examine witnesses ""in whatever way, and  to whatever extent, the defense might wish."" Id. (quoting  Fensterer, 474 U.S. at 20). Together, the Fifth and Sixth Amendments provide  defendants with the  [*703]  ""right to present a defense.""  United States v. Oldman, 979 F.3d 1234, 1252 (10th  Cir. 2020) (quotation marks omitted). 2. Analysis Mr. Palms argues the exclusion of evidence that M.W.  understood and participated in commercial sex work  before she met him violated his constitutional rights to a  fair trial, to confront witnesses against him, and to  present a full defense. First, he argues the sexual  behavior evidence is relevant because it ""tends to  counter"" the Government's assertion that Mr. Palms  ""enticed or recruited"" M.W. to perform commercial sex  acts—an element of Count One. Aplt. Opening Br. at 28.  Second, he argues the evidence would ""impeach the  credibility of"" M.W. Id. at 30. Pursuant to the Confrontation Clause and the Due  Process Clause, sexual behavior evidence ""may be  required to be admitted . . . where relevant and  probative on a central issue of sexual offense [**25]   charges."" A.S., 939 F.3d at 1072 (quotation marks  omitted). Evidence is considered relevant if it ""has any  tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it  would be without the evidence."" Fed. R. Evid. 401.  However, relevance is not enough; the evidence must  also be probative of a central issue to be required by the  Constitution. In addition, ""the Constitution does not  mandate the admission of irrelevant or general  impeachment evidence."" A.S., 939 F.3d at 1074. Mr. Palms's first argument is not persuasive because  the sexual behavior evidence is not probative of a  central issue in this case. Evidence that a sex trafficking  victim previously engaged in prostitution is irrelevant to  whether that victim was forced or coerced into working  as a prostitute at a later date. See 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)  (prohibiting using ""means of force, threats of force,  fraud, [and] coercion"" to ""cause [a] person to engage in  a commercial sex act""). Other circuit courts have  consistently come to the same conclusion. United  States v. Rivera, 799 F.3d 180, 185 (2d Cir. 2015)  (""Evidence of victims' prior acts of commercial sex is  irrelevant to whether those victims were coerced into  working as prostitutes.""); United States v. Roy, 781 F.3d  416, 420 (8th Cir. 2015) (""The victim's participation in  prostitution either before or after the time period in the  indictment has no relevance to whether Roy [**26]  beat  her, threatened her, and took the money she made from  prostitution in order to cause her to engage in  commercial sex.""); United States v. Cephus, 684 F.3d  703, 708 (7th Cir. 2012) (explaining evidence the victim  had been a prostitute before ""would not be evidence  that she consented to be beaten and to receive no  share of the fees paid by the johns she serviced""); see  also United States v. Brown, 810 F. App'x 105, 108 (3d  Cir. 2020) (unpublished) (""[W]hether Brown's victims  engaged in prostitution before 2011 or after 2014 would  have had little if any probative value.""), cert. denied, 141  S. Ct. 443, 208 L. Ed. 2d 136 (2020); United States v.  Valenzuela, 495 F. App'x 817, 819-20 (9th Cir. Nov. 2,  2012) (per curiam) (unpublished) (""Appellants cannot  show the relevance of questions about prior prostitution  to either Appellants' knowledge of the use of force,  fraud, or coercion, or the victims' consent to work in  prostitution.""). Even if M.W. participated in commercial  sex work in 2017 and knew how to post ads for  commercial sex, that does not tend to prove Mr. Palms  did not force her to engage in prostitution during the  period charged. Indeed, this lack of probative value is  exactly why Rule 412 exists. It ""preclude[s] defendants  from arguing that because the victim previously  consented to have sex—for love or money—her claims  of coercion should not be believed."" Rivera, 799 F.3d at  185.  [*704]  As to the issue of impeachment, Mr. Palms  Page 10 of 10 argues he should [**27]  have been permitted to present  the evidence of M.W.'s prior commercial sex work when  M.W. testified prostitution is ""not something [she] would  choose to do on [her] own."" Aplt. Opening Br. at 29.  Because the sexual behavior evidence is not relevant to  or probative of the issues on trial, this is general  impeachment evidence that is not required by the  Constitution. See A.S., 939 F.3d at 1074 (holding  evidence of prior sexual behavior is not constitutionally  required if it would solely diminish the witness's general  credibility). And we cannot say the district court abused  its discretion in excluding the sexual behavior evidence  under Rule 412. Thus, we affirm the district court's ruling  excluding the evidence of M.W.'s prior commercial sex  work.   "

See Doc.  No. 16. Choice Hotels International, Inc. supplemented  its motion with a memorandum in support. See Doc. No.  17. Plaintiff Megan Lundstrom filed a response in  opposition to the motion on July 8, 2022. See Doc. No.  24. [*2]  Defendant Choice Hotels filed a reply brief on  July 22, 2022. See Doc. No. 26. For the reasons set  forth below, the Defendant's motion to dismiss (Doc. No.  16) is granted. The Plaintiff's motion for hearing (Doc.  No. 25) and motion for judgment on the pleadings (Doc.  No. 37) are denied. I. BACKGROUND  The Plaintiff brings this action for damages under the  federal  William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (""TVPRA""). The  Plaintiff claims Holiday Hospitality Franchising LLC  (""HHF"") and Choice Hotels International, Inc. (""Choice Hotels"") knew or should have known that sex trafficking  repeatedly occurs at their hotels and chose to ignore the  presence of trafficking in the name of profit and fees  from room rentals. See Doc. No. 12, p. 2. Specifically,  the Plaintiff alleges that, as a direct and proximate result  of the Defendant's refusal to address sex trafficking  issues at their hotels, she was trafficked, sexually  exploited,  and  repeatedly  victimized  at  HHF's  Candlewood Suites, Choice's Clarion Hotel Convention  Center, and Choice's Comfort Inn. HHF's Candlewood  Suites is located at 3716 6th Avenue West in Williston,  North Dakota. Id. at p. 3. The Plaintiff [*3]  alleges HHF  Candlewood Suites is an HHF brand property, and HHF  owns, supervise, manages, controls, and/or operates  the HHF Candlewood Suites. The Plaintiff claims she  was trafficked, sexually exploited, and repeatedly  victimized at Choice's Clarion Hotel Convention Center  located at 2200 Burdick Expressway East in Minot,  North Dakota. Id. at p. 6. She alleges Choice Clarion  Hotel is a Choice brand property, and Choice owns,  supervise, manages, controls, and/or operates the     Page 2 of 9 Choice Clarion Hotel. Id. at p. 7. Finally, the Plaintiff  claims she was trafficked, sexually exploited, and  repeatedly victimized at Choice's Comfort Inn located at  493 Elks Drive in Dickinson, North Dakota. Id. at p. 6.  She alleges Comfort Inn is a Choice brand property, and  Choice owns, supervise, manages, controls, and/or  operates the Comfort Inn. Id. at p. 7. Beginning in 2011 and throughout 2012, the Plaintiff  alleges she was routinely harbored for commercial sex.  Id. at p. 29. She claims that her trafficker sold her for  commercial sex throughout North Dakota under brutal  attacks, psychological torment, and sexual abuse at the  Defendants' hotels. Id. at p. 2. The Plaintiff and other  victims were allegedly flown [*4]  to North Dakota twice  each month to stay at the Defendants' hotels for a week  or more. Id. at p. 29. The traffickers would rent one  room with a single bed for the Plaintiff and co-victims to  service buyers, which could total six to twenty  customers, each, per day. Id. The Plaintiff claims she  was  forced  against  her  will,  physically  and  psychologically tortured, and sexually exploited under  such duress at the Defendant's hotels in Williston,  Minot, and Dickinson, North Dakota. Id. The Plaintiff alleges there were clear and obvious signs  that reveal the Defendants knew or should have known  that sex trafficking was occurring within their hotels,  including but not limited to: a. Requests for single bedrooms, despite multiple  occupants and/or late checkout; b. Payments for rooms in cash, daily, and/or same  day; c. The Plaintiff and other co-victims' physical  appearance (visible abuse, deterioration) and  inappropriate attire; d. Continuous traffic of men coming to and leaving  from the room, rarely whom were registered guests; e. Excessive requests for towels, sheets, cleaning  supplies, and/or room service; f. Large quantities of used condoms, lube bottles,  lingerie, sex toys, bodily fluids on the [*5]  sheets or  towels, and other sex-related items in the hotel  rooms; g. Employee encounters of the Plaintiff and co- victims in and around the Defendants' hotels; h. A specific occasion in which an altercation  ensued between a trafficker and co-victim, causing  a loud disturbance and shouts for police assistance; i. Online reviews of the Defendants' properties  which described the presence of ""working girls"" and  ""prostitutes""; and j. History of arrests and prosecution of traffickers at  the Defendant's properties. Id. at p. 26-30. In addition, the Plaintiff claims the  Defendants had actual and/or constructive notice of  illegal activity, such as prostitution and drug dealing,  prior to, during, and after the above-described incidents  due to oral or written complaints of suspicious activity  and video surveillance of the properties. Id. The Plaintiff  argues the Defendants, who she claims were aware of  the illegal activity, did nothing to prevent this behavior  from continuing and, as a result, allowed the  victimization and exploitation of the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff  claims that if ""Defendants [had] been paying attention""  or ""if Defendants anti-trafficking efforts in training,  policies, and procedures [*6]  at the brand hotels were  enforced and/or effective,"" it would have been  ""impossible"" to miss these signs of trafficking and, in  turn, the victimization of the Plaintiff. Id. at p. 31. The Plaintiff brings one claim against Choice Hotels for  violating the TVPRA. Id. at p. 43. She seeks all available  compensatory  damages,  punitive  damages,  consequential damages, and restitution, and attorney's  fees. Id. at p. 44. II. STANDARD OF REVIEW Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  requires a pleading to contain a ""short and plain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Rule 12(b)(6)  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandates the  dismissal of a claim if there has been a failure to state a  claim upon which relief can be granted. In order to  survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), ""a  complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,  accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is  plausible on its face."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,  678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). A  plaintiff must show that success on the merits is more  than a ""sheer possibility."" Id. A complaint is sufficient if  its ""factual content . . . allows the court to draw the  reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the  misconduct alleged."" Id. The court must accept all  factual allegations as true, except for legal conclusions  or ""formulaic [*7]  recitation of the elements of a cause  of action."" Id. at 681. Detailed factual allegations are not  necessary under the Rule 8 pleading standard, rather a  plaintiff must set forth grounds of its entitlement to relief  which ""requires more than labels and conclusions, and a  Page 3 of 9 formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action  will not do."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,  555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). A  complaint does not ""suffice if it tenders a naked  assertion devoid of further factual enhancement.""  Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at 678 (2009). The determination of  whether a complaint states a claim upon which relief  can be granted is ""a context-specific task that requires  the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience  and common sense."" Id. at 679. Dismissal will not be  granted unless it appears beyond doubt the plaintiff can  prove no set of facts entitling plaintiff to relief. Ulrich v.  Pop Cnty, 715 F.3d 1054, 1058 (8th Cir. 2013). III. LEGAL DISCUSSION A. WILLIAM WILBERFORCE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS  PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008  (""TVPRA"") The TVPRA, 18 U.S.C. § 1591, prohibits the sex  trafficking of children or adults by force, fraud, or  coercion. In 2008, Congress amended the TVPRA to  permit victims to sue those who facilitate trafficking  ventures as a civil cause of action. Pub. L. No. 108-193,  117 Stat. 2875 (2003). The 2008 law provides: An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may [*8]  bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) (emphasis added). To state a claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) beneficiary  theory, a plaintiff must allege facts from which it can  reasonably inferred that a defendant (1) ""knowingly  benefit[ted] financially or by receiving anything of value""  (2) from participation in a venture that defendant ""knew  or should have known has engaged in"" sex trafficking.  18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 455 F.  Supp. 3d 171, 181 (E.D. Pa. 2020). A plaintiff may  satisfy these elements in one of two ways. She may  show that the defendant's own acts, omissions, and  state of mind establish each element. Alternatively, she  may impute to the defendant the acts, omissions, and  state of mind of an agent of the defendant. The former is  referred to as ""direct liability"" and the latter as ""indirect  liability."" See A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., 484  F. Supp. 3d 921, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163412, 2020  WL 5371459, at *6 (D. Ore. Sept. 8, 2020); B.M. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *4 (N.D. Cal. July 30,  2020). The Plaintiff asserts her TVPRA claims under  both direct liability and indirect liability theories. The Plaintiff alleges the Defendant Choice [*9]  Hotels is  liable  because  they  knowingly  benefited  from  participation in a business venture that they should have  known violated 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). The allegation can  be broken down into four component parts: that the  franchisor (1) knowingly benefited (2) from participating  in a venture; (3) that venture violated the TVPRA as to  the Plaintiff; and (4) the franchisor knew or should have  known that the venture violated the TVPRA as to the  Plaintiff. B. LEGAL ANALYSIS Choice Hotels moves to dismiss the Plaintiff's claim  under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure. See Doc. No. 16. Choice Hotels presents  numerous arguments in support of its position. First,  Choice Hotels argues that the Plaintiff's claim is barred  by the doctrine of res judicata. See Doc. No. 17, p. 4.  Choice Hotels contends the Plaintiff failed to plausibly  allege that Choice ""knew or should have known"" of the  sex trafficking venture as required for direct liability  under the TVPRA. Id. at p. 5. Third, Choice Hotels  argues the Plaintiff's allegations fail to plausibly allege  indirect liability. Id. at p. 7. Finally, Choice Hotels argues  the Plaintiff's claim is barred by the statute of limitations.  The Court will address each argument in turn. 1. RES JUDICATA Choice Hotels argues [*10]  that the Plaintiffs claim is  barred by the doctrine of res judicata because the  dismissal in a prior lawsuit in Colorado. was final, on          Page 4 of 9 the merits, and based on proper jurisdiction. See Doc.  No. 17, p. 5. In addition, Choice Hotels argues, because  the present complaint involves the same parties and  factual underpinnings, that the Plaintiff could have  brought this claim in that action. Id. Conversely, the  Plaintiff contends res judicata is entirely inapplicable  because Colorado was an inappropriate jurisdiction for  the current lawsuit, the causes of action and issues are  wholly different from the prior litigation and the Plaintiff  was not given a ""full and fair opportunity"" to litigate her  claims and issues in the previous case. See Doc. No.  24, p. 5-9. The Court agrees with the Plaintiff. Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue  preclusion, four criteria must be met before a  determination is conclusive in a subsequent proceeding:  (1) the issue sought to be precluded must be the same  as that involved in the prior litigation; (2) that issue must  have been actually litigated; (3) it must have been  determined by a valid and final judgment; and (4) the  determination [*11]  must have been essential to the  judgment. Lovell v. Mixon, 719 F.2d 1373, 1376 (8th Cir.  1983). The doctrine of res judicata or claim preclusion  bars a later suit when (1) the first suit resulted in a final  judgment on the merits; (2) the first suit was based on  proper jurisdiction; (3) both suits involved the same  cause of action; and (4) both suits involved the same  parties or their privies. Id. Thus, the application of  collateral estoppel or issue preclusion is limited to those  matters previously at issue which were directly and  necessarily adjudicated. Montana v. United States, 440  U.S. 147, 153, 99 S. Ct. 970, 59 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1979). In  contrast, res judicata or claim preclusion bars the  relitigation of issues which were actually litigated, or  which could have been litigated in the first suit.  Federated Department Stores v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394,  398, 101 S. Ct. 2424, 69 L. Ed. 2d 103 (1981); Allen v.  McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S. Ct. 411, 66 L. Ed. 2d  308 (1980). However, both doctrines are applied only  when the party against whom the earlier decision is  being asserted had a ""full and fair opportunity"" to litigate  the issues in question. Kremer v. Chemical Construction  Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 481, 102 S. Ct. 1883, 72 L. Ed. 2d  262 (1982). The Court finds the Plaintiff's argument availing and  refuses to dispose of the case on res judicata grounds.  First, the District of Colorado was not the proper  jurisdiction to bring the instant case. The appropriate  court to bring a civil TVPRA hotel sex trafficking case is    within the state where the alleged sex trafficking  occurred, and [*12]  where the physical hotel properties  are located. See Order on In re: Hotel Industry Sex  Trafficking Litigation, MDL No. 2928 (J.P.M.L. Feb. 5,  2020), ECF No. 235. The Plaintiff could not, and did not,  bring the current action in federal court in Colorado  because the proper jurisdiction to bring this action is the  District of North Dakota, considering the events  surrounding the alleged trafficking and the hotels used  to harbor the Plaintiff were all located in North Dakota.  Similarly, the Colorado court did not, and could not,  render an appropriate judgment on the Plaintiff's  factually distinct North Dakota sex trafficking claims. To better understand why separate forums are  necessary in these types of circumstances, the United  States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML)  explained why they do not centralize all hotel sex  trafficking cases: ""[E]ach action involves different  alleged sex trafficking ventures, different hotel brands,  different owners and employees, different geographic  locales, different witnesses, different indicia of sex  trafficking, and different times periods. Thus, unique  issues  concerning  each  plaintiff's  sex  trafficking  allegations predominate."" Order, MDL No. 2928 at 2-3  (J.P.M.L. Feb. 5, 2020). The differences on a case-by- case basis force a very fact-specific determination of  where a sex trafficking [*13]  case will be properly  brought. The facts that orientate this case certainly vary  from those offered in the case previously presented  before the District of Colorado. The JPML makes note of  differences in ""geographic locales."" In the previous  action, the Plaintiff was sex trafficked in and around  Denver, Colorado, including throughout the Denver  Tech  area.  See  Complaint  and  Jury  Demand,  Lundstrom v. Choice Hotels International, Inc., No. 1:21- cv-619 (D. Colo., March 2, 2021), ECF No. 1, p. 2.  Specifically, she was allegedly trafficked at the Quality  Inn located at 9799 E. Geddes Ave., Centennial,  Colorado 80112, and Sleep Inn located at 12101 Grant  St, Thornton, Colorado 80241. Id. at p. 4. This rendered  the District of Colorado an appropriate jurisdiction to  bring the previous action. Whereas in this case, the  Plaintiff was allegedly trafficked at HHF's Candlewood  Suites located at 3716 6th Avenue West in Williston,  North Dakota, Choice's Clarion Hotel Convention Center  located at 2200 Burdick Expressway East in Minot,  North Dakota, and Choice's Comfort Inn located at 493  Elks Drive in Dickinson, North Dakota. See Doc. No. 12,  p. 3-6. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs action in Colorado was  properly brought in the forum in which she suffered  harm — where she was brought to be [*14]  sex  trafficked and where the hotels are located, namely  Page 5 of 9 federal court in Colorado. According to the JPML, another reason for separating  sex trafficking cases into different forums is that different  ventures occur over different periods of time. The facts  and circumstances surrounding the previous action that  was brought in the District of Colorado began in the  spring of 2009 and lasted through 2011. See Complaint  and Jury Demand, Lundstrom v. Choice Hotels  International, Inc., No. 1:21-cv-619 (D. Colo., March 2,  2021), ECF No. 1, p. 7. Specific dates of the alleged sex  trafficking  were  never  cited.  The  facts  and  circumstances surrounding the current action brought in  the District of North Dakota were alleged to have arisen  between 2011 and continued into 2012. Beyond the Court establishing that Colorado was an  inappropriate district to bring the Plaintiff's current case,  the causes of action and issues in the cases are wholly  distinct from one another. The Eighth Circuit Court of  Appeals has adopted the position of the Restatement  (Second) of Judgments in determining whether two  causes of action are the same for res judicata purposes.  Generally, under this approach a claim is barred by res  judicata if it arises out of the same nucleus of operative  facts as the prior claim. [*15]  Lane v. Peterson, 899  F.2d 737, 742 (8th Cir. 1990). This can be determined  pragmatically, giving weight to such considerations as  whether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or  motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit. Id. With the ""same nucleus of operative facts"" approach in  mind, the Court can compare the claims asserted in the  District of Colorado with those presently brought before  this forum. The Plaintiff's case contains different causes  of action and issues from those previously litigated in  Colorado. The Plaintiffs case involved different factual  underpinnings, different geographical locations, different  environmental factors, different perpetrators, different  hotels,  different  cities,  different  states,  different  modalities of trafficking, and different time frames. See  Doc. No. 24, p. 12. Specifically, the Plaintiff's current  case involves hotels located in Minot, Williston, and  Dickinson, North Dakota as opposed to the prior action  involving hotels in and around Denver, Colorado;  correspondingly, different hotel staff were involved. Id.  The two actions also involved different sex traffickers,  different means of being trafficked, and different  trafficking experiences. While being trafficked by her  first [*16]  abuser in Colorado, she was trafficked  primarily for several hours during the day, as opposed to  multiple week-long stays like she had in North Dakota.  Id. at p. 13. Finally, the time frames of trafficking, as  noted above, are entirely different in the two cases. The  sex trafficking that was occurring in Colorado was  alleged to have occurred from 2009 to 2011. Id.  Conversely, the sex trafficking that allegedly occurred in  North Dakota took place from 2011 to 2012. Id. These  are two, separate timeframes from which sex trafficking  was allegedly occurring. Applying the Restatement (Second)'s definition of ""same  claim"", the Court finds it indisputable that the case  previously brought before the federal court in the District  of Colorado and this case present different, isolated  claims for res judicata purposes. The cases involve an  independent nucleus of operative facts, including but not  limited to: different geographical locations, different  environmental factors, different perpetrators, different  hotels,  different  cities,  different  states,  different  modalities of sex trafficking, and different time frames. Finally, for res judicata to apply a ""the party whom the  earlier decision is being [*17]  asserted [must have] had  a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues in  question."" Mixon, 719 F.2d at 1376. To accomplish this,  the factual precedent must be the same as previously  litigated. Simmons v. O'Brien, 77 F.3d 1093, 1097. As  mentioned above, the two cases present a different,  separate ""nucleus of operative facts"" that have not yet  been litigated. Thus, the Plaintiff was never afforded a  ""full and fair opportunity to litigate"" her claims and  issues in the case presented to the District of Colorado.  As such, res judicata does not bar the Plaintiffs claims. 2. DIRECT LIABILITY In her complaint, the Plaintiff contends the Defendant  Choice Hotels is directly liable for their role in the sex  trafficking of the Plaintiff. See Doc. No. 12, p. 32. First,  the  Plaintiff  alleges  the  Defendants  ""knowingly  benefited"" from participation in their commercial  business ventures with their hotels. Id. at p. 34. She  further states the Defendant knowingly benefited from  the sex trafficking of the Plaintiff and other victims  because the Defendant rented rooms to sex traffickers  and developed a business model that attracts and  fosters the commercial sex market for traffickers and  buyers. Id. Second, the Plaintiff claims that despite  having actual and/or [*18]  constructive knowledge of  sex trafficking allegedly occurring at the Defendant's  hotels, the Defendant has failed to stop or adequately  address sex trafficking at their hotels. Id. at p. 33. In  addition, the Plaintiff argues the Defendants' hotels  necessarily permit and facilitate sex trafficking, by  Page 6 of 9 design, through strategic business decisions. Id. at p.  36. In the motion to dismiss, Choice Hotels argues the  Plaintiff failed to plausibly allege that Choice Hotels  ""knew or should have known"" of the sex trafficking  venture as required for direct liability under the TVPRA.  See Doc. No. 17, p. 5. Choice Hotels does not address  the ""knowingly benefit"" allegations in its motion. In  response to Choice's motion to dismiss, the Plaintiff  reiterates her position from the complaint and argues  that she sufficiently alleged the Defendants knowingly  benefited from renting rooms to the Plaintiff's traffickers.  See Doc. No. 24, p. 11. She restates Choice Hotels  knew or should have known that its hotels ""harbor,""  ""provide,"" ""advertise,"" and ""maintain"" victims of sex  trafficking through force, threats, fraud, and/or coercion.  See Doc. No. 24, p. 12. In reply, Choice maintains that  the Plaintiff cannot [*19]  accurately allege that Choice  Hotels ""knowingly benefited"" from Plaintiff's trafficking or  that Choice ""knew or should have known"" about the sex  trafficking altogether. See Doc. No. 26, p. 4, 6. To more clearly evaluate whether the Defendants are  directly liable, the Court considers (1) whether the  Defendants knowingly benefited and (2) whether the  Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that Choice Hotels  participated in a business venture that knew or should  have known engaged in sex trafficking. Choice Hotels argues the only ""benefit"" the Plaintiff  alleges Choice received is ""franchise fees and  continuous royalties on their branded hotels."" Id.  However, the complaint directly contradicts that. The  complaint alleges Choice Hotels knowingly benefited  from ""royalty payments, licensing fees, and percentages  of the gross room revenue generated by the hotel  operations,"" including rates charged through the rental  of rooms where the Plaintiff was trafficked. See Doc.  No. 12, p. 2, 8, 23. Yet, Choice Hotels argues such  allegations are insufficient. Choice Hotels insists  revenue generated from the ordinary course of business  cannot support a reasonable inference that Choice  knowingly benefitted from [*20]  alleged crimes because  the revenue was derived from all operations. Id. The  Court disagrees. As the Court explained in J.L. v. Best  Western, several other district courts have found that  similar allegations are sufficient to plead the knowingly- benefited element. 521 F. Supp. 3d 1048, 1059. See  also E.S. v. Best W. Int'l, Inc., 510 F. Supp. 3d 420,  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3065, 2021 WL 37457, at *3  (N.D. Tex. Jan. 4, 2021); M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels &  Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959, 965 (S.D. Ohio  2019) (""[T]he rental of a room constitutes a financial  benefit from a relationship with the trafficker sufficient to  meet this element of the [§] 1595(a) standard.""); A.B. v.  Marriott Int'l, Inc., 455 F. Supp. 3d 171, 191 (same); H.H  v. G6 Hosp., LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019  WL 6682152, at *2 (S.D. Ohio Dec. 6, 2019) (same);  S.Y. v. Naples Hotel Co., 476 F. Supp. 3d 1251, 1256  (M.D. Fla. 2020) (same); A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide  holdings Inc., 484 F. Supp.3d 921, 936 (""The 'knowingly  benefits financially' element of § 1595 merely requires  that Defendant knowingly receive a financial benefit[,]  and the rental of a hotel room ... constitutes a financial  benefit sufficient to meet this element."" (internal  quotations omitted)). The Court agrees with these cases  and finds that the Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the  knowingly-benefited element under her direct liability  theory against the Defendant. The second portion of establishing direct liability in this  context requires the Court to determine whether the  Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that the hotel franchisor  (Choice Hotels International, Inc.) participated in a  venture that violated the TVPRA. Specifically, the  Plaintiff must establish that the hotel [*21]  franchisor  knew or should have known of the alleged sex  trafficking venture taking place in their hotels across the  nation. The Defendant argues the Plaintiff has not met  this burden and the Court agrees. The Plaintiff did not  establish that the hotel franchisor knew or should have  known about the sex trafficking at its hotels in North  Dakota. In determining whether Choice Hotels participated in a  venture which it knew or should have known engaged in  sex trafficking, the Court considers the two cases that  represent the ends of the spectrum on TVPRA civil  liability, Ricchio v. McLean, 853 F.3d 553 (1st Cir. 2017)  and Lawson v. Rubin, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71582  (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 29, 2018). Ricchio presents the heinous  end of the spectrum with more vulgar facts that clearly  establish the ""knowing"" element of direct liability. In  Ricchio, along with the allegations of ""high-fives""  between the trafficker and hotel owner while discussing  ""getting this thing [a past business relationship between  the trafficker and hotel owner] going again,"" the plaintiff  alleged that ""in plain daylight view of the front office of  the motel,"" her trafficker ""kick[ed] her and force[d] her  back toward the rented quarters when she had tried to  escape."" Ricchio, 853 F.3d at 555. The Plaintiff's allegations do not rise to the level of  obviousness present [*22]  in Ricchio. The Plaintiff's  facts do not suggest a direct agreement between her  Page 7 of 9 sex trafficker and Choice Hotels, the franchisor.  However, the Plaintiff does not need to prove reckless  disregard under Section 1595(a). The Plaintiff need only  show that the Defendant ""should have known"" about the  nature of the venture under a negligence standard. This  does not require evidence of actual knowledge or  conspiracy between the Defendant and the sex  trafficker. On the other end of the spectrum is Hillary Lawson v.  Howard Rubin, No. 1:17-cv-6404 (BMC), 2018 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 71582, 2018 WL 2012869 (E.D.N.Y. Apr.  29, 2018). There, the Plaintiffs sued Blue Icarus, the  owner of a condo leased to a sex trafficker, Howard  Rubin. Rubin procured women who he then sexually  assaulted and abused. Lawson, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  71582, 2018 WL 2012869, at *13. The court found the  Plaintiff's allegations insufficient to hold Blue Icarus  liable under Section 1595 because Blue Icarus did not  have reason to know about the sex trafficking. Id.  (""Plaintiffs did not claim that Blue Icarus had actual  notice of the alleged activity, only that it should have  known about alleged trafficking based on its duty to  monitor the premises.""). In this case, the Plaintiff's claims fall between Ricchio  and Lawson, somewhere much closer to the claims  outlined in M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 967 (the sex  trafficker refused housekeeping services, paid in cash,  and escorted [*23]  the plaintiff in view of the front desk;  hotel staff ignored the plaintiff's cries; plaintiff's  customers would enter and exit the hotel through the  front door) and J.L., 521 F. Supp. 3d at 1057 (trafficked  in multiple hotels, plaintiff arrived without luggage, left  wearing the same clothes as arrival, physically  appeared malnourished, deteriorated, and injured at  times). The federal court in M.A. held that these  allegations  were  insufficient  to  establish  actual  knowledge because the plaintiff did not allege that any  member of the hotel staff heard and ignored her pleas  or that she alerted any staff member to her need for  help. Id. at 968. Similarly, in J.L. v. Best W. Int'l, Inc.,  521 F. Supp. 3d 1048, the court found the claims failed  to show actual knowledge of the plaintiff's sex  trafficking. The Plaintiff in this case argues the sex trafficking was  ""anything but discrete."" See Doc. No. 24, p. 12. In her  Amended Complaint, the Plaintiff alleged ""obvious  signs"" existed that would have put the hotels (the  franchisee) on notice of the sex trafficking, such as: a. Requests for single bedrooms, despite multiple  occupants and/or late checkout; b. Payments for rooms in cash, daily, and/or same  day; c. The Plaintiff and other co-victims' physical  appearance (visible abuse, deterioration) [*24]  and  inappropriate attire; d. Continuous traffic of men coming to and leaving  from the room, rarely whom were registered guests; e. Excessive requests for towels, sheets, cleaning  supplies, and/or room service; f. Large quantities of used condoms, lube bottles,  lingerie, sex toys, bodily fluids on the sheets or  towels, and other sex-related items in the hotel  rooms; g. Employee encounters of the Plaintiff and co- victims in and around Defendants' hotels; h. A specific occasion in which an altercation  ensued between a trafficker and co-victim, causing  a loud disturbance and shouts for police assistance; i. Online reviews of the Defendants' properties  which described the presence of ""working girls"" and  ""prostitutes""; and j. History of arrests and prosecution of traffickers at  the Defendant's properties. Id. at p. 26-30. When construed in the light most favorable to the  Plaintiff, the Plaintiff's allegations do not plausibly  establish that the Defendant hotel (the franchisor)  should have known about sex trafficking at one of its  hotels located throughout the country. See A.B., 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163412, 2020 WL 5371459, at *9  (emphasis added). The Plaintiff alleges the Defendant  franchisor was on notice about the prevalence of sex  trafficking generally [*25]  at its hotels for years. See  Doc. No. 12, p. 24-28. However, this is not sufficient to  show that the Defendant franchisor should have known  about what happened to this particular plaintiff. S.J., 473  F. Supp. 3d 147, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127436, 2020  WL 4059569, *5 (noting that Section 1595 ""speaks in  singular terms - 'participation in a venture which that  person . . . should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter'"" means knowledge of a general  sex trafficking problem is not sufficient and thus finding  that hotel franchisor defendants could not be held  directly liable under the TVPRA). General knowledge of  commercial sex activity occurring at hotels across the  United States is insufficient on its own to demonstrate  that the Defendant/Franchisor participated in the sex  trafficking of the plaintiff. See A.B., 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 163412, 2020 WL 5371459, at *9. Page 8 of 9 Thus, the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts as to  how the Defendant Choice Hotels, the franchisor, was  aware or should have been aware of the sex trafficking.  A.B., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163412, 2020 WL 5371459,  at *9. Accordingly, the plaintiff has not alleged facts  sufficient to state a claim for direct liability under the  TVPRA  against  the  Defendant  Choice  Hotels  International, Inc., the franchisor. 3. INDIRECT LIABILITY The Plaintiff also alleges the Defendants are vicariously  liable for their role in the sex trafficking of the Plaintiff.  See Doc. No. 12, p. 37. The Plaintiff claims the  Defendant had an actual and apparent agency  relationship with the Candlewood Suites, Clarion Hotel,  and Comfort Inn where she was allegedly trafficked. Id.  at p. 40. In opposition, Choice Hotels argues the Plaintiff  proffered nothing more than conclusory and vague  allegations, and a claim under an agency theory fails  because the complaint does not plausibly allege the  hotel is liable under Section 1595. See Doc. No. 17, p.  7-8.  The  Court  finds  Choice  Hotels'  argument  persuasive and highlights Chief Judge Brimmer's  holding regarding actual agency in this context: Plaintiff has failed to show that the hotels knew or  should have known that plaintiff was being  trafficked. The deficiencies in plaintiff's complaint  are similar to those that the Court found in J.L.,  where the plaintiff did not allege that staff noticed  her physical state, traffic in and out of her room,  and state of her room to be signs of trafficking, let  alone that defendant was aware of the facts of  these signs. The Court notes that [*27]  many of the  allegations in this case appear to be copied word- for-word from the complaint in J.L. Moreover, in  J.L., the Court contrasted the plaintiff's allegations  with those where courts have found the allegations              to be sufficient. The Court observed the plaintiff's  allegations in A.B., 455 F. Supp. 3d at 189-90,  where the plaintiff alleged that staff were aware of  ""loud altercations"" as well as ""constant"" attacks on  the plaintiff, and in H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *1, where the  plaintiff alleged that hotel staff discovered her  chained up in the bathroom and ignored her plea  for help. Plaintiff does not allege that hotel staff  ""observed her trafficker forcefully bring her to a  hotel, attack her, restrain her, or argue with her.""  See A.B., 484 F. Supp. 3d at 921; H.H., 2019 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *1  (alleging signs of trafficking such as branding,  restraints, bruises, and physical deterioration);  B.M., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL  4368214, at *6 (alleging front desk staff had  personal  relationships  with  traffickers).  While  plaintiff alleges various indicia of trafficking, for  instance, that staff noticed her check-in and check- out patterns, the frequency of her visits, that there  were used condoms in the room, she does not  allege that hotel staff actually noticed these to be  signs of trafficking. Because these allegations are  not sufficient for the Court to [*28]  conclude that  the hotels, i.e., defendant's agents, knew of  plaintiff's trafficking, as opposed to her commercial  sex activity, plaintiff necessarily has not stated a  claim that defendant could be liable under an actual  agency theory. See J.L., 521 F. Supp. 3d at 1073;  A.B., 484 F. Supp. 3d at 940-941. Lundstrom, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 228651, 2021 WL  5579117, at *9. The Plaintiff contends she is relying upon an entirely  different theory of liability, which the federal court in the  District of Colorado did not rule on. See Doc. No. 24, p.  27. She argues the Defendants' staff should have  known to recognize the signs of the Plaintiffs trafficking  at the Defendant's hotels. Id. Further, she alleges the  Defendant failed to implement and enforce anti-sex  trafficking policies, procedures, and training and, as a  result, the Defendant is directly liable under Section  1595. Id. However, the Court's unwillingness to adopt  the Plaintiff's position does not automatically render the  Colorado court's holding unusable simply because she  has a strong conviction in her argument. The Plaintiff provides a blanket statement that seeks to  connect the franchisor-franchisee relationship to actual  agency: ""Defendant Choice owned, supervised, and/or  operated the Choice Clarion Hotel and Choice Comfort  Page 9 of 9 Inn. See Doc. No. 12, p. 39. Merely alleging [*29]  ""facts  tending to show that the franchisors' involvement was  limited to uniformity and standardization of the brand""  are ""insufficient to establish complete control over the  day-to-day operations of the franchisee's business.""  H.G., 489 F. Supp. 3d at 708-709; S.J., 473 F. Supp. 3d  at 156 (holding that allegations regarding uniformity and  standardization of the brand, even if proven true, ""would  fail to sufficiently demonstrate that the franchisor  defendants exercised such complete control over the  day-to-day operations of the franchisee's business that  its purported independence may be fairly dismissed as a  fiction""). In addition, the Plaintiff has failed to show that  Choice Hotels knew or should have known that the  Plaintiff  was  being  trafficked;  therefore,  plaintiff  necessarily has not stated a claim that defendant could  be liable under an agency theory. See J.L., 521 F.  Supp. 3d at 1073; A.B., 484 F. Supp. 3d at 940-941. Choice Hotels argues the Plaintiff fails to allege facts to  support an apparent agency theory. To establish liability  based on apparent agency, the Plaintiff must show that  manifestations by the Defendant led her to believe that  the hotels were agents of the Defendant, and that  Plaintiff relied on that belief when engaging with the  hotels. Restatement (Third) of Agency § 2.03 (2006).  See also at § 2.03 cmt. c. (""Apparent authority [*30]   holds a principal accountable for the results of third- party beliefs about an actor's authority to act as an  agent when the belief is reasonable and is traceable to  a manifestation of the principal.""). Nowhere in the  amended complaint does the Plaintiff claim she relied  on any representations of the Defendant when engaging  with the branded hotels operated by franchisees.  Therefore, an apparent agency theory of liability does  not comport with the underlying facts of this case, and  the Court finds Plaintiff has failed to allege the required  elements of apparent authority. 4. Statute of Limitations The TVPRA states that ""[n]o action may be maintained .  . . unless it is commenced not later than the later of . . .  10 years after the cause of action arose."" 18 U.S.C. §  1595(c)(1). The Plaintiff alleges that she was trafficked  ""[b]eginning in 2011 and throughout 2012,"" states that  she was ""flown to North Dakota twice each month to  stay...for a week or more at a time"". See Doc. No. 12, p.  29. She also states that she and other co-victims would  ""service a constant stream of buyers totaling sex to  twenty customers, each, per day. Id. The Defendant  argues the Plaintiff's claims are time-barred, or, at the  very least, [*31]  the portions of her claim that are  alleged to have occurred prior to April 4, 2012. See Doc.  No. 12, p. 24. In response, the Plaintiff emphasizes that  she was trafficked ""throughout 2012"" and therefore  alleges trafficking well within the 10-year TVPRA statute  of limitations. Id. She also argues that her sex trafficking  was a pattern of continuing wrongful conduct and the  ""continuing violation doctrine"" applies because she was  repeatedly assaulted, abused, and raped ""hundreds  upon hundreds of times at Defendant's hotels"" over two  years and ""at least one act occurred within the statutory  filing period."" Id. The Court will not consider this  argument because the Court has found that the Plaintiff  has not plausibly alleged that the Defendant/Franchisor  violated the TVPRA. However, the Court finds that, even  if the plaintiff had plausibly alleged the elements of a  TVPRA claim, the portions of her claims resting on sex  trafficking prior to April 4, 2012 (ten years prior to the  filing of her complaint) would be time-barred. See H.G.,  489 F. Supp. 3d at 710 (finding any claims arising from  more than ten years before the filing of the complaint to  be barred); Ardolf v. Weber, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  159289, 2020 WL 5209525, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 1,  2020)  (""Accordingly,  because  [p]laintiff  failed  to  commence this [*32]  action within ten years of the  accrual of the alleged cause of action, it is barred by the  statute of limitations."").

Ct. 1955,  167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). In deciding a  Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court must accept  all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take  them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, Erickson v.  Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d  1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal conclusions without adequate  factual support are entitled to no assumption of truth,""  Mamani v. Berzaín, 654 F.3d 1148, 1153 (11th Cir.  2011) (citations omitted). Plaintiff's (second) amended complaint is brought  pursuant  to  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act (TVPRA). As previously stated, The TVPRA is a criminal statute that also provides  a civil remedy to victims of sex trafficking. Section  1591(a) of the Act imposes criminal liability for  certain sex trafficking: (a) Whoever knowingly-- Page 2 of 5 (1) in or affecting interstate or [*3]  foreign  commerce, or within the special maritime and  territorial jurisdiction of the United States, recruits,  entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains,  advertises, maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any  means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C.A. § 1591(a). In addition to a criminal  punishment, the TVPRA provides the following civil  remedy: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of [*4]  this chapter) in an appropriate  district court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Thus, the TVRPA authorizes a victim of sex  trafficking to bring a direct civil claim against the  perpetrator of the trafficking and a ""beneficiary"" civil  claim  against  ""whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of [the TVPRA]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). To  state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA, Plaintiff must plausibly allege that the  defendant ""(1) knowingly benefited (2) from  participating in a venture; (3) that venture violated  the TVPRA as to [A.D.]; and (4) [Defendants] knew  or should have known that the venture violated the  TVPRA as to [A.D.]."" Doe v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21  F.4th 714, 726 (11th Cir. 2021). A.D. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68592,  [WL] at *2. The Court will consider each of the elements  as applied to the amended pleading. II. The operative amended complaint alleges the following:  Defendant Marriott International, Inc. (Marriott) knows  and has known for years that sex trafficking and  prostitution occur at their branded hotel locations.  Defendant CHM Naples II Hotel Partners LLC's (CHM  Naples) also knows and has known for [*5]  years of  both occurring specifically at the Fairfield Inn & Suites  Naples by Marriott (Fairfield) in Naples, Florida. (Doc.  #39, ¶¶ 2-3.) This action for damages is brought by the  Plaintiff, identified by her initials A.D., a survivor of sex  trafficking under the TVPRA. (Id. at ¶ 12.) A.D. was  trafficked for commercial sex at Fairfield by Trafficker 2  through force, fraud, and coercion. (Id. at ¶ 16.) ""With knowledge of the problem, and as a direct and  proximate result of Defendants' multiple failures and  refusals to act, mandate, establish, execute, and/or  modify their anti-trafficking efforts at the Fairfield hotel,  A.D. was continuously sex trafficked, sexually exploited,  and victimized repeatedly at the Fairfield hotel."" (Id. at ¶  18.) Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a  hotel operating venture and knowingly benefited from  this venture through room rentals, profits, third party  fees, and the value of the ""good will"" of the Marriott®  brand. The venture knew or should have known that  they were profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex  trafficking of A.D., in violation of the TVPRA."" (Id. at ¶  19.) Plaintiff further alleges that Marriott participated in a  hotel [*6]  operating venture that included staff at the  Fairfield. CHM Naples owns the Fairfield Inn & Suites  pursuant to a franchise agreement entered into with  Marriott. Plaintiff alleges an agency relationship through  Marriott's ""exercise of ongoing and systemic right of  control over Fairfield hotel."" (Id. at ¶¶ 29-32.) Marriott  makes decisions that directly impact the operations and  maintenance of their branded hotels, including the  Fairfield. (Id. at ¶ 39.) CHM Naples directly offered  public lodging services at the Fairfield where A.D. was  trafficked for sex. (Id. at ¶ 49.) Defendants ""participated  in a hotel operating venture in connection with the  management and operating of the Fairfield involving risk  and potential profit."" (Id. at ¶ 52.) During at least 2008 to 2012, emails were exchanged by  employees of Marriott that related to sex trafficking in  Page 3 of 5 hotels, including Fairfield. (Id. at ¶ 57.) Marriott had  actual and/or constructive knowledge of sex trafficking,  including A.D.'s sex trafficking and victimization,  occurring on its branded property. (Id. at ¶ 60.) Despite  having access to sex trafficking indicators, Marriott  continues to permit and profit from male clientele who  rented hotel [*7]  rooms to buy sex, including those who  bought Plaintiff. (Id. at ¶ 72.) CHM Naples employees and staff openly observed  signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. CHM Naples  received revenue and a percentage was provided to  Marriott. (Id. at ¶ 102.) Through Marriott's relationship  with the staff at the Fairfield, it benefited or received  royalty payments, licensing fees, franchise fees and  dues, reservation fees, and percentages of the gross  room revenue. (Id. at ¶ 103.) Through their ""continuous  business venture of renting hotel rooms"", CHM Naples  knowingly benefited. (Id. at ¶ 105.) Plaintiff alleges that  defendants benefit from the steady stream of income  that sex traffickers bring to their hotel brands and from  their reputation for privacy, discretion, and the  facilitation of commercial sex. (Id., ¶¶ 114-115.) III. As previously stated, plaintiff must sufficiently plead that  a defendant knowingly benefited from participating in a  venture, that the venture violated the TVPRA, and that  defendants knew or should have known that the venture  violated the TVPRA. A. Knowingly Benefited To satisfy the first element of a TVPRA beneficiary  claim, plaintiff must allege that defendant ""knew [*8]  it  was receiving some value from participating in the  alleged venture."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. As the  Eleventh Circuit stated, ""Knowingly benefits"" means ""an awareness or  understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of  mind in which a person has no substantial doubt  about the existence of a fact."" Knowledge, Black's  Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). And Section  1595(a) explains that a defendant may benefit  ""financially or by receiving anything of value.""  Accordingly, a plaintiff like the Does must allege  that the defendant knew it was receiving some  value from participating in the alleged venture. Id. at 723-24. In the absence of a more stringent  statutory pleading requirement, knowledge ""may be  alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Alleging a  ""continuous business relationship"" is sufficient to show a  knowing benefit. G.G. v. Salesforce.Com, Inc., No. 22- 2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015,  at *16 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023). The Court previously  found this element could be satisfied at this stage of the  proceedings. A.D. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 68592, [WL] at *3. B. Participation in Venture - Franchisor Plaintiff must allege that the benefits received by  Marriott were from ""participation in a venture"" which  defendants knew or should have known has engaged in  an act in violation of the TVPRA. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a).  The Eleventh Circuit rejected the statutory definition of  ""participation in a venture"" found in the criminal [*9]   provision, § 1591(e)(4), which defined ""participation in a  venture""  as  ""knowingly  assisting,  supporting  or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)."" Instead, the  Eleventh Circuit held that ""participation in a venture"" in  the civil context requires that plaintiff allege that the  franchisor ""took part in a common undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit."" Red Roof  Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture and knowingly benefited from this  venture through room rentals, profits, third party fees,  and the value of the ""good will"" of the Marriott® brand.  The venture knew or should have known that they were  profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking  of A.D., in violation of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #39, ¶ 19.)  Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture"" in connection with the Fairfield for  potential profit. (Id. at ¶ 52.) Plaintiff alleges that Marriott  ""had actual and/or constructive knowledge of sex  trafficking,  including  A.D.'s  sex  trafficking  and  victimization,"" at its branded property and it ""failed to  implement and enforce any of its own policy or policies  and protect Plaintiff A.D. from being sex trafficked""  and [*10]  failed to take action to prevent trafficking so  that it could continue to profit. (Id. at ¶ 60.) Plaintiff  alleges that Marriott knew or should have known that  the Fairfield hotel was an ""area known for high  incidence of crime and prone to sex trafficking activity  on and around the hotel premises."" (Id. at ¶ 60f.)  Marriott is alleged to have demonstrated actual and/or  constructive knowledge of the ""rampant culture of sex  trafficking"" at their properties around the country,  including through news stories and online reviews. (Id.  Page 4 of 5 at ¶ 75.) These additional facts in the Second Amended  Complaint do not remedy the problem in the original  pleading as to Marriott. ""[A]s the Eleventh Circuit has  acknowledged,  the  alleged  venture  can  be  a  'commercial venture' like running or expanding a  business. G.G. v. Salesforce.Com, Inc., No. 22-2621,  2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *6  (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023) (citing Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21  F.4th at 727 (emphasis added)). However, as before,  ""[t]he 'participation' in the sex trafficking venture is  essentially that the franchisor and the hotel operator did  not fight hard enough to keep these traffickers from  using their hotel. The Complaint acknowledges that  Defendants  opposed  sex  traffickers,  but  fault  defendants for taking ineffective steps to curtail the  traffickers. This hardly sounds [*11]  like participating in  a venture."" A.D. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 68592, [WL] at *4. The Court finds that Marriott must be dismissed  because the Second Amended Complaint does not  sufficiently plead that it participated in a sex trafficking  venture beyond participation in shared revenue as part  of its normal role as a franchisor. Red Roof Inns, Inc.,  21 F.4th at 726-27 (""These allegations may suggest that  the franchisors financially benefitted from renting hotel  rooms to the Does' sex traffickers. But they do nothing  to show that the franchisors participated in a common  undertaking involving risk or profit that violated the  TVPRA—i.e., the alleged sex trafficking ventures.""). C. Participation in Venture - Franchisee ""In order to plead Defendants participated in a venture,  Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court could  reasonably infer the hotels 'could be said to have a tacit  agreement' with the trafficker. Plaintiff need not show  that  defendants  had  actual  knowledge  of  the  participation in the sex-trafficking venture."" Doe v.  Rickey Patel, LLC, No. 0:20-60683-WPD-CIV, 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (S.D.  Fla. Sept. 30, 2020) (citation omitted). In other words,  plaintiff can show a ""continuous business relationship""  to show participation. J.G. v. Northbrook Indus., Inc.,  619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1235 (N.D. Ga. 2022); S.Y. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 519 F. Supp. 3d 1069,  1081 (M.D. Fla. 2021). Plaintiff alleges that ""Defendants"" knew or should have  known that A.D. was being trafficked based on red flags  such as A.D. checking [*12]  in and paying for one night  at a time. A.D. would approach the front desk in a  drugged state and would ask for an extension of another  night. (Doc. #39, ¶ 95.) Other red flags include  excessive requests for sheets, a personal relationship  between staff and the trafficker, and direct employee  encounters at the Fairfield. (Id.) These facts at least plausibly infer that employees of the  Fairfield were participating in an enterprise involving risk  and knowingly benefiting from the risk. Red Roof Inns,  Inc., 21 F.4th at 725 (citing Ricchio v. McLean, 853 F.3d  553, 556-58 (1st Cir. 2017) (agreeing with First Circuit  that an operator's association with traffickers to serve a  business objective establishes participation in a venture  with a sex trafficker). D. Knowledge This element requires the plaintiff to allege that the  defendant had either actual or constructive knowledge  that the venture violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff.  Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Knowledge requires an  awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance,  while constructive knowledge is knowledge that one  should have 'using reasonable care or diligence'. Id.  (citing Black's Law Dictionary). The 'red flags' supporting knowledge include payments  in cash, large amounts of used condoms and bodily  fluids on the sheets and towels, A.D.'s [*13]  physical  appearance, excessive requests for sheets and cleaning  services, the personal relationship with staff and A.D.'s  trafficker, and the direct employee encounters with A.D.  and her trafficker inside the Farfield. (Doc. #39, ¶ 95.)  CHM Naples employees and staff openly observed  signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. (Id. at ¶ 102.)  CHM Naples directly benefited financially from room  rentals for rooms in which plaintiff was trafficked. (Id. at  ¶ 110.) The Court finds these facts are sufficient to plausibly  allege knowledge at this stage of the proceedings. An  overt or direct act is not required. See, e.g., K.H. v. Riti,  Inc., No. 1:22-CV-3404-MHC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  93374, 2023 WL 3644224, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 17,  2023) (collecting cases of direct association between  hotel and trafficker); J.C. v. I Shri Khodiyar, LLC, 624 F.  Supp. 3d 1307, 1318 (N.D. Ga. 2022) (Plaintiff claims  that her daughter was forced to have sex with  Defendant's employees); J.G. v. Northbrook Indus., Inc.,  619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1239 (N.D. Ga. 2022)  (employees acted as lookouts for Plaintiff's traffickers). Page 5 of 5 Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED: 1. Defendant Marriott International, Inc.'s Motion to  Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint  (Doc. #41) is GRANTED and defendant is  dismissed with prejudice. 2. Defendant CHM Naples II Hotel Partners LLC's  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended  Complaint (Doc. #42) is DENIED.

"A.D. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150386","                            OPINION AND ORDER This matter comes before the Court on defendant  Marriott International, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's  Second Amended Complaint (Doc. #41) filed on May  23, 2023, and defendant CHM Naples II Hotel Partners,  LLC's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended  Complaint (Doc. #42) filed on the same day. Plaintiff  filed a Consolidated Response in Opposition (Doc. #46)  on June 20, 2023. Both defendants filed Replies. (Docs.  ## 47, 48.) Plaintiff filed a Notice of Supplemental  Authority (Doc. #49) on August 8, 2023. I. On April 19, 2023, the Court granted defendants'  motions to dismiss [*2]  with leave to file an Amended  Complaint. A.D. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., No. 2:22-CV-645- JES-NPM, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67834, 2023 WL  2991042, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 18, 2023). On May 9,  2023, plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (Doc.  #39) and defendants have now essentially renewed  their motions to dismiss. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a  Complaint must contain a ""short and plain statement of  the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.""  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This obligation ""requires more  than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation  of the elements of a cause of action will not do."" Bell Atl.  Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955,  167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). In deciding a  Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court must accept  all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take  them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, Erickson v.  Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d  1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal conclusions without adequate  factual support are entitled to no assumption of truth,""  Mamani v. Berzaín, 654 F.3d 1148, 1153 (11th Cir.  2011) (citations omitted). Plaintiff's (second) amended complaint is brought  pursuant  to  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act (TVPRA). As previously stated, The TVPRA is a criminal statute that also provides  a civil remedy to victims of sex trafficking. Section  1591(a) of the Act imposes criminal liability for  certain sex trafficking: a) Whoever knowingly-- (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or  within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction  of the [*3]  United States, recruits, entices, harbors,  transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains,  Page 2 of 5 patronizes, or solicits by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C.A. § 1591(a). In addition to a criminal  punishment, the TVPRA provides the following civil  remedy: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover [*4]   damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Thus, the TVRPA authorizes a victim of sex  trafficking to bring a direct civil claim against the  perpetrator of the trafficking and a ""beneficiary"" civil  claim  against  ""whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of [the TVPRA]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). To  state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA, Plaintiff must plausibly allege that the  defendant ""(1) knowingly benefited (2) from  participating in a venture; (3) that venture violated  the TVPRA as to [A.D.]; and (4) [Defendants] knew  or should have known that the venture violated the  TVPRA as to [A.D.]."" Doe v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21  F.4th 714, 726 (11th Cir. 2021). A.D. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 22023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67834,  [WL] at *2. The Court will consider each of the elements  as applied to the amended pleading. II. The operative amended complaint alleges the following:  Defendant Marriott International, Inc. (Marriott) knows  and has known for years that sex trafficking and  prostitution occur at their branded hotel locations.  Defendant CHM Naples II Hotel Partners LLC's (CHM  Naples) also knows and has known for years of both  occurring specifically at the SpringHill Suites (SpringHill)  by Marriott [*5]  in Naples, Florida. (Doc. #39, ¶¶ 2-3.)  This action for damages is brought by the Plaintiff,  identified by her initials A.D., a survivor of sex trafficking  under the TVPRA. (Id. at ¶ 12.) A.D. was trafficked for  commercial sex at SpringHill by Trafficker 2 through  force, fraud, and coercion. (Id. at ¶ 16.) ""With knowledge of the problem, and as a direct and  proximate result of Defendants' multiple failures and  refusals to act, mandate, establish, execute, and/or  modify their anti-trafficking efforts at the SpringHill hotel,  A.D. was continuously sex trafficked, sexually exploited,  and victimized repeatedly at the SpringHill hotel."" (Id. at  ¶ 18.) Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a  hotel operating venture and knowingly benefited from  this venture through room rentals, profits, third party  fees, and the value of the ""good will"" of the Marriott®  brand. The venture knew or should have known that  they were profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex  trafficking of A.D., in violation of the TVPRA."" (Id. at ¶  19.) Plaintiff further alleges that Marriott participated in a  hotel operating venture that included staff at the  SpringHill.  CHM  Naples  owns  the  SpringHill  pursuant [*6]  to a franchise agreement entered into  with Marriott. Plaintiff alleges an agency relationship  through Marriott's ""exercise of ongoing and systemic  right of control over SpringHill hotel."" (Id. at ¶¶ 29-32.)  Marriott makes decisions that directly impact the  operations and maintenance of their branded hotels,  including the SpringHill. (Id. at ¶ 39.) CHM Naples  directly offered public lodging services at the SpringHill  where A.D. was trafficked for sex. (Id. at ¶ 49.)  Defendants ""participated in a hotel operating venture in  connection with the management and operating of the  SpringHill hotel involving risk and potential profit."" (Id. at  ¶ 52.) During at least 2008 to 2012, emails were exchanged by  employees of Marriott that related to sex trafficking in  hotels, including CHM Naples' hotel. (Id. at ¶ 57.)  Marriott had actual and/or constructive knowledge of  sex trafficking, including A.D.'s sex trafficking and  Page 3 of 5 victimization, occurring on its branded property. (Id. at ¶  60.) Despite having access to sex trafficking indicators,  Marriott continues to permit and profit from male  clientele who rented hotel rooms to buy sex, including  those who bought Plaintiff. (Id. at ¶ 72.) CHM Naples employees [*7]  and staff openly observed  signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. CHM Naples  received revenue and a percentage was provided to  Marriott. (Id. at ¶ 104.) Through Marriott's relationship  with the staff at the SpringHill, it benefited or received  royalty payments, licensing fees, franchise fees and  dues, reservation fees, and percentages of the gross  room revenue. (Id. at ¶ 105.) Through their ""continuous  business venture of renting hotel rooms"", CHM Naples  knowingly benefited. (Id. at ¶ 107.) Plaintiff alleges that  defendants benefit from the steady stream of income  that sex traffickers bring to their hotel brands and from  their reputation for privacy, discretion, and the  facilitation of commercial sex. (Id., ¶¶ 116-117.) III. As previously stated, plaintiff must sufficiently plead that  a defendant knowingly benefited from participating in a  venture, that the venture violated the TVPRA, and that  defendants knew or should have known that the venture  violated the TVPRA. A. Knowingly Benefited To satisfy the first element of a TVPRA beneficiary  claim, plaintiff must allege that defendant ""knew it was  receiving some value from participating in the alleged  venture."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. As the  Eleventh [*8]  Circuit stated, ""Knowingly benefits"" means ""an awareness or  understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of  mind in which a person has no substantial doubt  about the existence of a fact."" Knowledge, Black's  Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). And Section  1595(a) explains that a defendant may benefit  ""financially or by receiving anything of value.""  Accordingly, a plaintiff like the Does must allege  that the defendant knew it was receiving some  value from participating in the alleged venture. Id. at 723-24. In the absence of a more stringent  statutory pleading requirement, knowledge ""may be  alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Alleging a  ""continuous business relationship"" is sufficient to show a  knowing benefit. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22- 2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015,  at *16 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023). The Court previously  found this element could be satisfied at this stage of the  proceedings. A.D. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 67834, [WL] at *3. B. Participation in Venture - Franchisor Plaintiff must allege that the benefits received by  Marriott were from ""participation in a venture"" which  defendants knew or should have known has engaged in  an act in violation of the TVPRA. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a).  The Eleventh Circuit rejected the statutory definition of  ""participation in a venture"" found in the criminal  provision, § 1591(e)(4), which defined ""participation in a  venture"" as ""knowingly assisting, supporting [*9]  or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)."" Instead, the  Eleventh Circuit held that ""participation in a venture"" in  the civil context requires that plaintiff allege that the  franchisor ""took part in a common undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit."" Red Roof  Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture and knowingly benefited from this  venture through room rentals, profits, third party fees,  and the value of the ""good will"" of the Marriott® brand.  The venture knew or should have known that they were  profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking  of A.D., in violation of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #39, ¶ 19.)  Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture"" in connection with the SpringHill for  potential profit. (Id. at ¶ 52.) Plaintiff alleges that Marriott  ""had actual and/or constructive knowledge of sex  trafficking,  including  A.D.'s  sex  trafficking  and  victimization,"" at its branded property and it ""failed to  implement and enforce any of its own policy or policies  and protect Plaintiff A.D. from being sex trafficked"" and  failed to take action to prevent trafficking so that it could  continue to profit. (Id. at [*10]  ¶ 60.) Plaintiff alleges that  Marriott knew or should have known that SpringHill was  an ""area known for high incidence of crime and prone to  sex trafficking activity on and around the hotel  premises."" (Id. at ¶ 60f.) Marriott is alleged to have  demonstrated actual and/or constructive knowledge of  the ""rampant culture of sex trafficking"" at their properties  around the country, including through news stories and  online reviews. (Id. at ¶ 75.) These additional facts in the Second Amended  Complaint do not remedy the problem in the original  Page 4 of 5 pleading as to Marriott. ""[A]s the Eleventh Circuit has  acknowledged,  the  alleged  venture  can  be  a  'commercial venture' like running or expanding a  business. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22-2621,  2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *6  (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023) (citing Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21  F.4th at 727 (emphasis added)). However, as before,  ""[t]he 'participation' in the sex trafficking venture is  essentially that the franchisor and the hotel operator did  not fight hard enough to keep these traffickers from  using their hotel. The Complaint acknowledges that  Defendants  opposed  sex  traffickers,  but  fault  defendants for taking ineffective steps to curtail the  traffickers. This hardly sounds like participating in a  venture."" A.D. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 67834, [WL] at *4. The Court finds that Marriott must be dismissed  because the Second [*11]  Amended Complaint does  not sufficiently plead that it participated in a sex  trafficking venture beyond participation in shared  revenue as part of its normal role as a franchisor. Red  Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 726-27 (""These allegations  may suggest that the franchisors financially benefitted  from renting hotel rooms to the Does' sex traffickers. But  they do nothing to show that the franchisors participated  in a common undertaking involving risk or profit that  violated the TVPRA—i.e., the alleged sex trafficking  ventures.""). C. Participation in Venture - Franchisee ""In order to plead Defendants participated in a venture,  Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court could  reasonably infer the hotels 'could be said to have a tacit  agreement' with the trafficker. Plaintiff need not show  that  defendants  had  actual  knowledge  of  the  participation in the sex-trafficking venture."" Doe v.  Rickey Patel, LLC, No. 0:20-60683-WPD-CIV, 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (S.D.  Fla. Sept. 30, 2020) (citation omitted). In other words,  plaintiff can show a ""continuous business relationship""  to show participation. J.G. v. Northbrook Indus., Inc.,  619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1235 (N.D. Ga. 2022); S.Y. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 519 F. Supp. 3d 1069,  1081 (M.D. Fla. 2021). Plaintiff alleges that ""Defendants"" knew or should have  known that A.D. was being trafficked based on red flags  such as A.D. checking in and paying for one night at a  time. Trafficker 2 held a loud party that ran late with  visibly [*12]   underage  attendees  and  despite  complaints, hotel staff did not break it up. (Doc. #39, ¶  97.) Other red flags include excessive requests for  sheets, a personal relationship between staff and the  trafficker, and direct employee encounters at the  Fairfield. (Id.) These facts at least plausibly infer that employees of the  SpringHill were participating in an enterprise involving  risk and knowingly benefiting from the risk. Red Roof  Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 725 (citing Ricchio v. McLean, 853  F.3d 553, 556-58 (1st Cir. 2017) (agreeing with First  Circuit that an operator's association with traffickers to  serve a business objective establishes participation in a  venture with a sex trafficker). D. Knowledge This element requires the plaintiff to allege that the  defendant had either actual or constructive knowledge  that the venture violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff.  Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Knowledge requires an  awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance,  while constructive knowledge is knowledge that one  should have 'using reasonable care or diligence'. Id.  (citing Black's Law Dictionary). The 'red flags' supporting knowledge include payments  in cash, large amounts of used condoms and bodily  fluids on the sheets and towels, A.D.'s physical  appearance,  excessive  requests  for  sheets  and  cleaning [*13]  services, the personal relationship with  staff and A.D.'s trafficker, and the direct employee  encounters with A.D. and her trafficker inside the  SpringHill. (Doc. #39, ¶ 97.) CHM Naples employees  and staff openly observed signs of trafficking and did not  aid plaintiff. (Id. at ¶ 104.) CHM Naples directly  benefited financially from room rentals for rooms in  which plaintiff was trafficked. (Id. at ¶ 112.) The Court finds these facts are sufficient to plausibly  allege knowledge at this stage of the proceedings. An  overt or direct act is not required. See, e.g., K.H. v. Riti,  Inc., No. 1:22-CV-3404-MHC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  93374, 2023 WL 3644224, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 17,  2023) (collecting cases of direct association between  hotel and trafficker); J.C. v.

No. 120  (""LMot."")); (2) Hilton Domestic Operating Company  Inc.'s ""Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended  Complaint Under Rule 12(b)(6),"" in which G6 Hospitality  LLC, Interstate Management Company, LLC, and VWI  Concord LLC dba Hilton Concord have joined (see Dkt.  Nos. 123 (""HMot.""), 126 (""GJoin""), 131 (""IJoin""), 152  (""VJoin"")); (3) Marriott International, Inc. and Residence  Inn by Marriott LLC's ""Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's  Second Amended Complaint"" (see Dkt.

No. 125 (""CMot."")). Plaintiff B.J. has filed  opposition to each motion (see Dkt. Nos. 132 (""LOpp.""),  134 (""HOpp.""), 155 (""VOpp.""), 135 (""MOpp.""), 133  (""COpp."")), to which defendants have replied (see Dkt.

Having read and considered the papers  filed in support of and in opposition to the motions, the  Court rules as follows. BACKGROUND Between 2012 and 2016, plaintiff B.J. was ""trafficked for  commercial sex and suffered severe physical [*4]  and  emotional abuse under duress"" at five California hotels:  (1) Studio 6 Concord (""Studio 6""), (2) San Ramon  Marriott, (3) Residence Inn Pleasant Hill — Concord  (""Residence  Inn  Concord""),  (4)  Clarion  Hotel  Concord/Walnut Creek (""Clarion Hotel""), and (5) the  Hilton Concord (collectively, ""the hotels""). (See SAC ¶¶  5, 7.) Studio 6 is operated by defendant Concord Inn  and Suites LP (""Concord Inn""), a franchisee of  defendant G6 Hospitality, LLC (""G6""). (See SAC ¶ 12.)  The San Ramon Marriott is owned and operated by  defendant Marriott International, Inc. (""Marriott""). (See  SAC ¶ 14.) The Residence Inn Concord is operated by  defendant Residence Inn by Marriott LLC (""Residence  Inn""), a franchisee of Marriott. (See SAC ¶ 15.) The  Clarion Hotel is operated by defendant Leisure Hotel  Group LLC (""Leisure""), a franchisee of defendant  Choice Hotels International, Inc. (""Choice""). (See SAC ¶  17.) The Hilton Concord is operated by defendant VWI  Concord LLC (""VWI""), a franchisee of defendant Hilton  Domestic Operating Company, Inc. (""Hilton""), and is  managed by defendant Interstate Hotels and Resorts,  Inc. (""Interstate""). (See SAC ¶¶ 19, 20.)                    ""B.J. met her trafficker through Facebook[,]"" (see SAC  ¶ [*5]  39), and, the trafficker, ""[u]nder the guise of  seeking a romantic partnership,"" promised B.J. ""shelter,  support, and a better life."" (See SAC ¶ 39.) In particular,  after ""learn[ing] [B.J.] had been trafficked as a minor and  was in the process of being evicted from her home,""  B.J.'s trafficker ""preyed on her vulnerable position and  coerced B.J. to meet him so he could help take care of  her and her kids while they fought the eviction."" (See  SAC ¶ 40.) ""What followed were years of physical,  sexual, and psychological abuse designed to control  B.J. and prevent her escape from sexual servitude  carried out at the hotels owned, operated, supervised,  and/or branded by defendants."" (See SAC ¶ 40.) ""B.J.'s  trafficker imposed a strict and cruel 'quota' system,""  whereby ""he forced B.J. to be sold to enough buyers  that she earned his stated daily minimum which varied  from day to day."" (See SAC ¶ 41.) If B.J. failed to meet  the daily quota, ""it rolled over to the next day,"" and she  ""was not allowed to leave the hotel rooms in which she  was trafficked for any reason, including to see and look  after her children and feed herself[.]"" (See SAC ¶ 41.) B.J. alleges defendants ""ignore[d] the open and  obvious [*6]  signs and presence of commercial sex  trafficking on their properties and in the hotels[,]""  including signs of B.J.'s trafficking (see SAC ¶ 3), took  no action to ensure B.J.'s safety (see SAC ¶¶ 51, 60,  62, 67, 70, 72, 78, 82, 86, 88, 90), and instead ""profited  from the sex trafficking of B.J. and knowingly or  negligently aided and engaged with her trafficker in his  sex trafficking venture"" by ""renting rooms to B.J.'s  traffickers"" that defendants ""kn[ew], or should have  known, that [the traffickers] were using . . . to harbor sex  trafficking victims, physically assault them, and subject  them to repeated exploitation as they [were] forced into  sexual servitude"" (see SAC ¶¶ 338-39). Based on the above allegations, B.J. asserts as against  each defendant causes of action under, respectively,  the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act  (""TVPRA""), 18 U.S.C. § 1595, and the California  Trafficking Victims Protection Act (""CVPTA""), Cal. Civ.  Code § 52.5. LEGAL STANDARD     Page 3 of 10 Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of  Civil Procedure ""can be based on the lack of a  cognizable legal theory or the absence of sufficient facts  alleged under a cognizable legal theory."" See Balistreri  v. Pacifica Police Dep't, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir.  1990). Rule 8(a)(2), however, ""requires only 'a short and  plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief.'"" See Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,  550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929  (2007) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Consequently,  ""a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to  dismiss does not need detailed [*7]  factual allegations.""  See id. Nonetheless, ""a plaintiff's obligation to provide  the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more  than . . . a formulaic recitation of the elements of a  cause of action."" See id. (internal quotation, citation, and  alteration omitted). In analyzing a motion to dismiss, a district court must  accept as true all material allegations in the complaint  and construe them in the light most favorable to the  nonmoving party. See NL Indus., Inc. v. Kaplan, 792  F.2d 896, 898 (9th Cir. 1986). ""To survive a motion to  dismiss,"" however, ""a complaint must contain sufficient  factual material, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to  relief that is plausible on its face.'"" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556  U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868  (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). ""Factual  allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief  above the speculative level,"" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555,  and courts ""are not bound to accept as true a legal  conclusion couched as a factual allegation,"" see Iqbal,  556 U.S. at 678 (internal quotation and citation omitted). DISCUSSION By the instant motions, defendants seek an order  dismissing the above-titled action in its entirety, on the  asserted ground that B.J. has not stated a claim for  relief against them under either the TVPRA or the  CVPTA. A. CVTPA At the outset, plaintiff, in each of her oppositions to the  instant motions, [*8]  ""concedes"" the CVTPA claim  should be dismissed as against all moving and joining  defendants. (See LOpp. at 1 n.1, HOpp. at 1 n.2, VOpp.  at 1 n.2, MOpp. at 1 n.1, COpp. at 1 n.1.) Accordingly,  the Court turns to the question of whether B.J. has  stated a claim under the TVPRA. B. TVPRA The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act  ""creat[es] criminal offenses for forced labor and sex  trafficking[,]"" see J.C. v. Choice Hotels Intl.' Inc., 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at *3 (N.D.  Cal. Oct. 28, 2020); see also 18 U.S.C. § 1591, and, in  addition to the criminal prohibition, ""provides sex- trafficking victims with a civil cause of action,"" see Doe  #1 v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 723 (9th Cir.  2021), against both the perpetrator of the trafficking and  those who benefit therefrom, as follows: An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. See § 1595(a). To state a § 1595(a) claim under a beneficiary theory, a  plaintiff must allege facts plausibly establishing that the  defendant(s)  ""(1)  knowingly  benefitted  (2)  from  participation in a venture (3) that they knew or should  have known has engaged in trafficking the plaintiff."" See  J.M. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  190054, 2022 WL 10626493, at *2 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 18,  2022) (internal quotation and citation omitted). ""A                         Page 4 of 10 plaintiff may satisfy these elements in one of two ways.""  See H.G. v. Inter-Continental Hotels Corp., 489 F. Supp.  3d 697, 704 (E.D. Mich. 2020). Specifically, such  plaintiff may ""show that the defendant's own acts,  omissions, and state of mind establish each element[,]""  i.e., that such defendant is directly liable under the  statute, or ""impute to the defendant the acts, omissions,  and state of mind of the agent of the defendant[,]"" i.e.,  that the defendant is indirectly, or vicariously, [*10]   liable under the statute. See id. Here, B.J. advances both direct and vicarious theories  of liability under § 1595. In particular, she advances a  direct theory of liability against Marriott and the  Franchisee defendants, and vicarious theories of liability  against the Franchisor Defendants. Defendants contend  B.J. fails to allege sufficient facts to support the  elements of a TVPRA claim under any theory. The  Court first turns to B.J.'s direct beneficiary liability  claims. a. Direct Beneficiary Liability Claims Although the SAC contains allegations purporting to  establish the direct liability of every moving and joining  defendant as a beneficiary of B.J.'s trafficking, B.J., in  her oppositions to the Franchisor Defendants' motions  to dismiss, concedes her direct liability claims as to  Hilton, G6, and Choice (see HOpp. at 12:9-12, COpp. at  7:2-5) and also concedes her direct liability claim  against Marriott to the extent it acted as a franchisor of  the Residence Inn Concord (see MOpp. at 8:1-2). B.J.  maintains her direct liability claim against Marriott with  respect to the trafficking that allegedly occurred at the  San Ramon Marriott, however, because, according to  B.J., the San Ramon Marriott [*11]  was ""owned,  managed, and operated by the national corporation,  Marriott  International  .  .  .  [u]nlike  the  franchisor/franchisee relationship seen in other hotel  operations in this case[.]"" (See MOpp. at 9:26-27; see  also MOpp. at 8:1-2, SAC ¶ 56.) The Court considers  below B.J.'s remaining direct liability claims, namely,  said claim against Marriott and her claims against the  Franchisee Defendants.      1. Knowingly Benefit ""The 'knowingly benefit' element of section 1595 merely  requires that [the] [d]efendant knowingly receive a  financial benefit[,] and the rental of a room (or [the  defendant's] receipt of royalties for that rental)  constitutes a financial benefit from a relationship with  the trafficker sufficient to meet this element."" J.C., 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at *4  (internal quotation and citation omitted). Here, B.J. alleges, Marriott ""receives a percentage of  the gross room revenue for the money generated by the  operations of all Marriott hotels, including a percentage  of the rate charged for the rooms in which [B.J.] was  trafficked at the San Ramon Marriott[.]"" (See SAC ¶ 13- v; see also SAC ¶¶ 14-iv, 226, 338, 340.) B.J. makes  essentially the same allegations as to each of the  Franchisee defendants. (See SAC ¶¶ 15 iv-v, [*12]  17  iv-v, 19 vi-vii, 20 vi-vii.) The Court finds B.J.'s  allegations, at the motion to dismiss stage, sufficient to  satisfy this element. 2. Participation in a Venture ""The phrase 'participation in a venture' requires that the  [plaintiff] allege that [the defendants] took part in a  common undertaking or enterprise involving risk and  potential profit."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725; see  also J.M., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190054, 2022 WL  10626493, at *4 (same). Although plaintiffs are ""not  required to allege an overt act in furtherance of or actual  knowledge of a sex trafficking venture in order to  sufficiently plead [a] section 1595 civil liability claim[,]""  see B.M. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *3 (N.D. Cal.  July 30, 2020), they must, at the very least, ""connect the  dots between [the] alleged sex trafficking and [the]  defendants[,]"" see 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, [WL]  at *5, e.g., by a ""showing of a continuous business  relationship between the trafficker and the defendant  such that it would appear that the trafficker and the  defendant have established a pattern of conduct or  could be said to have a tacit agreement[,]"" see J.B. v.  G6 Hospitality, LLC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213,  2020 WL 4901196, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 20, 2020)  (internal quotation, citation, and alteration omitted); see  also, e.g., Ricchio v. McLean, 853 F.3d 553, 555 (1st  Cir. 2017) (finding participation sufficiently pled where  plaintiff alleged trafficker ""had prior commercial dealings  with [defendants], which the parties wished to reinstate  for profit""). Page 5 of 10 Here, B.J. alleges [*13]  Marriott and the Franchisee  Defendants each took part in a ""sex trafficking venture""  (see SAC ¶¶ 13(viii), 14(v), 15(vi), 17(vi), 19(viii),  20(viii)) or a ""venture which it [k]new or should have  known to engage in sex trafficking"" (see SAC ¶¶  13(vii)(I), 14(iii), 15(v), 17(v), 19(vii), 20(vii)). The  question thus presented is whether B.J. has plausibly  alleged that Marriott and the Franchisee Defendants  ""took part in the common undertaking of sex trafficking  with hotel employees, management, owners, and sex  traffickers."" See Red Roof, 21 F.4th at 726. The Court  finds B.J. has failed to do so. At the outset, the Court finds unpersuasive B.J.'s  attempt to frame the ""ventures"" in which Marriott and the  Franchisee  Defendants  allegedly  participated  as  ""general"" ventures, as opposed to ""sex trafficking""  ventures. (See MOpp. at 7:21-23, LOpp. at 6:16-19,  HOpp. at 8:15-18, VOpp. 7:12-15.) Although B.J., in her  oppositions, asserts said defendants each ""participated  in a general venture because they partook in a common  undertaking or enterprise . . . involving risk and potential  profit"" (see MOpp. at 7:23-24, LOpp. at 6:17-19, HOpp.  at 8:16-18, VOpp. at 7:13-15), namely, the management  and operation of the hotel properties [*14]  at which B.J.  was allegedly trafficked, such argument is at odds with  the SAC, which refers only to ""sex trafficking venture[s]""  (see, e.g., SAC ¶¶ 13(viii), 14(v), 15(vi), 17(vi), 19(viii),  20(viii)) or ventures defendants ""[k]new or should have  known to engage in sex trafficking"" (see e.g., SAC ¶¶  13(vi)(i), 13(vii)(i), 14(iii), 15(v), 17(v), 19(vii), 20(vii)). It  is well settled that B.J. may not amend the SAC through  her briefs. See Dang V. Samsung Elecs. Co., 2018 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 245196, 2018 WL 11348883, at *7 (N.D.  Cal. July 2, 2018) (holding ""it is axiomatic that the  complaint may not be amended by the briefs in  opposition to a motion to dismiss"" (internal quotation  and citation omitted)). Moreover, even if the Court were  to accept the ""general venture"" assertion articulated for  the first time in B.J.'s oppositions, such assertion would  not suffice to plead a violation of the TVPRA. See Red  Roof, 21 F.4th 725 (holding ""the third element of the  [plaintiff's] claim is that the venture in which the  defendant participated and from which it knowingly  benefited must have violated the TVPRA as to the  plaintiff""). Next, the Court finds B.J. has failed to plausibly  establish either Marriott's or the Franchisee Defendants'  participation in a sex trafficking venture. In that regard,  B.J. alleges hotel staff affirmatively [*15]  enabled her  trafficking by taking the following actions: housekeeping  staff at the at the San Ramon Marriott ""acknowledged  and aided [her] trafficking by providing additional  supplies to her trafficker"" (see SAC ¶ 61); front desk  staff at the Residence Inn Concord ""readily complied""  with her trafficker's request for an extra room key ""so he  could enter the room B.J. had locked him out o[f]"" (see  SAC ¶ 71); housekeeping staff at the Clarion Inn ""aided  B.J.'s trafficking by providing an inordinate amount of  supplies, including linens, sheets, and cleaning agents""  (see SAC ¶ 79); and front desk staff at Hilton Concord  ""informed the trafficker of B.J.'s location when she  attempted to hide from him and seek refuge from the  hotel"" (see SAC ¶ 89). Even assuming the conduct of  the above-referenced hotel staff could be imputed to  Marriott and the Franchisee Defendants as operators of  their respective hotel properties, such allegations do not  suggest hotel employees engaged in conduct outside  the scope of their ordinary responsibilities, let alone any  kind of ""tacit agreement"" with B.J.'s trafficker to engage  in the alleged sex trafficking venture. See J.B., 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213, 2020 WL 4901196, at *9. Under such circumstances, the Court [*16]  finds B.J.  has not plausibly alleged the ""participation in a venture""  element of her TVPRA claim. 3. Knew or Should Have Known the Venture was  Engaged in Trafficking To establish the knowledge element of her TVPRA  claim, B.J. need only assert facts supporting defendants'  constructive knowledge of the sex trafficking venture in  which it allegedly participated, i.e., that defendants  ""rented rooms to people they knew or should have  known were engaging in sex trafficking."" See B.M., 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214 at *5. The  Court finds B.J. has failed to make such a showing. B.J. alleges Marriott and the Franchisee Defendants  ignored various ""open and obvious signs"" of commercial  sex trafficking at their hotel properties (see, e.g., SAC  ¶¶ 3, 37), and, in support thereof, points to instances  wherein her trafficker abused her, or otherwise exhibited  evidence of her trafficking in public areas of defendants'  hotel properties (see, e.g., SAC ¶¶ 68, 74, 70, 72  (alleging B.J.'s trafficker, during stays at Residence Inn  Concord, ""collected payments from B.J.'s buyers in . . .  public areas""; ""repeatedly and conspicuously [stood]      Page 6 of 10 outside of B.J.'s window and filmed while she was  forced to perform commercial sex acts with buyers"";  ""knock[ed] [*17]  and hammer[ed] on the door for hours  on end demanding to be let in""; and, on one occasion,  ""dragged B.J. through the hotel, spat in her face, and  assaulted B.J. while she screamed""); ¶¶ 81-82 (alleging  B.J.'s trafficker, during stays at Clarion Hotel, ""often  physically attacked her in public areas of the hotel[,]""  which  assaults  were  ""coupled  with  degrading  commentary and criticism for not meeting her 'quota' of  buyers that day or meeting it too quickly[,]"" and, when  B.J. escaped her room, ""chased her in [hotel] public  space""); ¶ 90 (during stay at Hilton Concord, ""B.J.'s  trafficker grabbed B.J. . . . in the public common area of  the [hotel]"" in a manner that ""left visible, hand-shaped  bruises on B.J.'s arms"")). B.J. does not, however,  allege any hotel employees witnessed the above- described episodes, and, absent allegations to that  effect, fails to plausibly establish defendants ""should  have known"" of B.J.'s trafficking. See B.M., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214 at *5. Although the SAC does contain allegations that hotel  employees witnessed other events, those allegations,  as set forth below, likewise are insufficient to establish  defendants' actual or constructive knowledge of  trafficking. B.J. alleges, for example, that, ""[o]n [*18]  more than  one occasion, the San Ramon Marriott housekeeping  staff observed B.J.'s buyers violently attack her"" (see  SAC ¶ 62) and ""[o]n another occasion . . . witnessed a  buyer swiftly depart B.J.'s room in a state of complete  undress"" (see SAC ¶ 63); that ""housekeeping staff at  the Clarion Hotel . . . entered B.J.'s room while she was  being sold or preparing to be sold for commercial sex""  (see SAC ¶ 80); and that ""Hilton Concord's hotel  staff observed . . . B.J. being escorted into and out of  rooms by as many as eight buyers in any given day""  (see SAC ¶ 87). Such allegations, however, are equally  consistent with criminal conduct other than sex  trafficking, e.g., prostitution.          Where alleged conduct has ""two possible explanations,  only one of which can be true and only one of which  results in liability . . . [s]omething more is needed, such  as facts tending to exclude the possibility that the  alternative explanation is true."" See Petzschke v.  Century Aluminum Co. (In re Century Aluminum Co.  Sec. Litig.), 729 F.3d 1104, 1108 (9th Cir. 2013); see  also, e.g., J.B., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213, 2020 WL  4901196, at *11 (noting ""allegations that [TVPRA] victim  sought help and was seen by [hotel] employees with  physical injuries or other facts suggesting coercion allow  courts to infer that . . . hotel employees should have  known that human trafficking was [*19]  occurring, as  opposed to other criminal conduct""). Here, the  requisite  ""something  more""  is  missing,  and,  consequently, the Court finds B.J. has not plausibly  established Marriott's or the Franchisee Defendants'  actual or constructive knowledge of their participation in  a TVPRA-violating venture. Accordingly, B.J.'s direct TVPRA claims against Marriott  and the Franchisee Defendants are subject to dismissal. b. Vicarious Liability B.J. seeks to hold the Franchisor Defendants vicariously  liable for their franchisees' alleged violations of § 1595  under both actual and apparent agency theories. As to  Marriott, Choice, and Hilton, these claims necessarily  fail because, as set forth above, B.J. has failed to state  a claim for direct liability against their respective  franchisees. As discussed below, however, the Court  will afford B.J. leave to amend, and, in light thereof, the  Court next addresses the Franchisor Defendants'  arguments that they cannot be held vicariously liable                  Page 7 of 10 under the TVPRA for the conduct of their franchisees. At the outset, the Court finds unpersuasive the  contention by two of the Franchisor Defendants,  namely, Marriott and Choice, that, ""[b]ecause there is no  language in the TVPRA [*20]  extending secondary or  vicarious liability in this context, [B.J.'s] attempts to imply  vicarious liability . . . should be rejected."" (See CMot. At  14:24-26; see also MMot. at 17:28-18:5.) ""Although the  TVPRA does not explicitly address the issue of vicarious  liability, statutes are presumed not to disturb the  common law, unless the language of the statute is clear  and explicit for this purpose[,]"" see J.M., 2022 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 190054, 2022 WL 10626493, at *5 (internal  quotation and citation omitted), and where, as here, the  ""federal statute does not provide direction, the Ninth  Circuit has applied the federal common law of agency[,]""  specifically, ""agency principles from the Restatement  (Third) of Agency[,]"" see id.; see also, e.g., J.C., 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at *8  (rejecting argument that TVPRA does not provide for  agency liability; noting TVPRA's ""silen[ce] on the issue  of indirect liability . . . suggests that the federal common  law of agency should apply"" (internal quotation and  citation omitted)); A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide Holdings,  Inc., 484 F.Supp.3d 921, 939 (D. Or. 2020) (examining  ""vicarious liability [under the TVPRA] as a question of  federal common law""). The Court next addresses the Franchisor Defendants'  contention that B.J. has not pled facts showing an actual  or apparent agency relationship between the Franchisor  Defendants and their franchisees. i. Actual Agency [*21]  Relationship An  actual  agency  relationship  requires  ""(1)  a  manifestation by the principal that the agent shall act for  him; (2) that the agent has accepted the undertaking;  and (3) that there is an understanding between the  parties that the principal is to be in control of the  undertaking."" See Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Hynix  Semiconductor, Inc., 622 F. Supp. 2d 890, 899 (N.D.  Cal. 2009) (citing Restatement (Third) of Agency § 1.01  (2006)). When determining whether a principal has  sufficient authority to control the actions of an agent,  such that the principal may be held vicariously liable for  the agent's actions, the Ninth Circuit considers the  following non-exhaustive list of factors: 1) the control exerted by the employer, 2) whether  the one employed is engaged in a distinct  occupation, 3) whether the work is normally done  under the supervision of an employer, 4) the skill  required, 5) whether the employer supplies tools  and instrumentalities, 6) the length of time  employed, 7) whether payment is by time or by the  job, 8) whether the work is in the regular business  of the employer, 9) the subjective intent of the  parties, and 10) whether the employer is or is not in  business. See U.S. v. Bonds, 608 F.3d 495, 504 (9th Cir. 2010);  see also Restatement (Third) of Agency § 7.07 cmt. f  (identifying factors useful in evaluating whether principal  exercises sufficient control over agent's work to  establish [*22]  vicarious liability); Jones v. Royal Admin  Servs., Inc., 887 F.3d 443, 450 (9th Cir. 2018) (holding  ""the extent of control exercised by the principal is the  essential ingredient"" (internal quotations, citation, and  alteration omitted)). ""While a franchisor-franchisee relationship does not  necessarily create an agency relationship . . . a  franchisor may be held liable for a franchisee's actions if  the franchisor controls the franchisee's day-to-day  operations."" J.M., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190054, 2022  WL 10626493, at *5 (finding allegations in complaint  sufficient to show agency relationship where plaintiff  ""allege[d] defendants exercised control over the day-to- day operations of the hotels by hosting online bookings,  setting hotel employee wages, making employment  decisions for the hotels, providing standardized training  methods for hotel employees, and fixing hotel room rent  prices""). In particular, courts focus on the franchisor's  control over the ""instrumentality, the conduct, or the  specific aspect of the franchisee's business that caused  the alleged injury."" See Patterson v. Domino's Pizza,  LLC, 60 Cal. 4th 474, 498-499, 177 Cal. Rptr. 3d 539,  333 P.3d 723 (2014) (internal quotations and citations  omitted) (holding franchisor could not be held vicariously  liable for sexual harassment of franchisee employee  where franchisor lacked ""day-to-day authority over  matters  such  as  hiring,  firing,  direction,  supervision, [*23]  and discipline of the [harassing]  employee"" (internal quotation and citation omitted)). Here,  B.J.  alleges,  the  Franchisor  Defendants  ""exercise[] control over [their respective franchisees]  with respect to many issues regarding the day-to-day  operation of the property, but also specifically with  regard to the [franchisee's] policy on human trafficking""  (see SAC ¶¶ 257, 278, 299, 318), and, in support  thereof, states: [t]he agency relationship [between Franchisor  Page 8 of 10 Defendants and their respective franchisees] was  created through [Franchisor Defendants'] exercise  of an ongoing and systematic right of control over  [their] franchised hotels, beyond that which is  necessary  to  maintain  brand  standards,  by  [Franchisor Defendants'] operations, including the  means and methods of how [their] hotels conducted  business through one or more of the following  actions: (i) hosting online bookings on [their]  domain[s]; (ii) requiring [franchisee] hotels to use  [franchisors'] customer rewards program[s]; (iii)  setting employee wages; (iv) making employment  decisions; (v) advertising for employment; (vi)  sharing profits; (vii) standardized training methods  for employees; (viii) building and maintaining  . [*24]  . . facilit[ies] in a manner specified by the  owner; (ix) standardized or strict rules of operation;  (x) regular inspection of the facility and operation by  owner; (xi) fixing prices; or (xii) developing uniform  and consistent policies regarding the prevention of  commercial sex trafficking at brand properties,  including a risk management process to identify,  prevent, and mitigate risks for commercial sex  trafficking; and (xiii) other actions that deprive  [franchisee] hotels of independence in business  operations"" (see SAC ¶ 266; see also SAC ¶¶ 287, 306, 329). B.J.'s  ""use of the modifier 'one or more[,]'"" however, ""strips  these allegations of any force."" See H.G., 489  F.Supp.3d at 708; see also L.H. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 604  F. Supp. 3d 1346, 1362 (S.D. Fla. 2022) (same). ""While  [B.J.] lists [thirteen] ways [the Franchisor] Defendants  may exercise control,"" she ""does not say which one"" or  more of the listed forms of control the Franchisor  Defendants allegedly use, see H.G., 489 F.Supp.3d at  708 (emphases in original), and, consequently, her  allegations are ""far too uncertain and vague to plausibly  establish that [the Franchisor] Defendants controlled the  franchisees' operations to such an extent that the  franchisees were [Franchisor] Defendants' agents[,]""  see id. Similarly uncertain is the following allegation: [*25]  [The Franchisor Defendants} may exercise or could  have exercised control over [their franchisees] by:  (i) distributing information to assist employees in  identifying human trafficking; (ii) providing a  process for escalating human trafficking concerns  within the organization; (iii) requiring employees to  attend training related to human trafficking; (iv)  providing new hire orientation on human rights and  corporate responsibility; (v) providing training and  education to the local hotel through webinars,  seminars, conferences, and online portals; (vi)  developing and holding ongoing training sessions  on human trafficking; or (vii) providing checklists,  escalation protocols and information to property  management  staff;  or  tracking  performance  indicators and key metrics on human trafficking  prevention. (See SAC ¶ 265; see also SAC ¶¶ 286, 305, 325.) B.J.'s  use of ""may exercise"" or ""could have exercised"" control  again provides no meaningful description of any  Franchisor  Defendant's  involvement  in  the  daily  operations of its franchisee. Next, B.J.'s conclusory allegations that each Franchisor  Defendant ""controls the training, procedures, and  policies for its brand hotels"" (see [*26]  SAC ¶¶ 11(ii),  13(ii), 16(ii), 18(ii)) and requires franchises to comply  with its brand standards (see SAC ¶¶ 11(iii), 13(iii),  16(iii), 18(iii)) are, absent factual support, unavailing,  see Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. To the extent B.J. has  provided more detail, however (see SAC ¶¶ 284, 304,  327 (alleging franchisees are required to provide  specified services and products)), those allegations  ""tend[] to show that the franchisors' involvement was  limited to uniformity and standardization of the brand[,]""  see S.J. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 473 F. Supp. 3d  147, 156 (E.D.N.Y. 2020), which has been found  insufficient to establish the requisite degree of control  for an agency relationship. See id.; see also Cislaw v.  Southland Corp., 4 Cal.App.4th 1284, 1295, 6 Cal. Rptr.  2d 386 (1992) (holding ""[a] franchisor must be permitted  to retain such control as is necessary to protect and  maintain its trademark, trade name and good will,  without the risk of creating an agency relationship with                 Page 9 of 10 its franchisees""). Lastly, B.J.'s allegation that the Franchisor Defendants  may ""kick delinquent hotels out of [their] system[s]"" (see  SAC ¶¶ 272, 293, 312, 332) does not establish an  agency relationship, as ""[t]he right to terminate a  franchise agreement should the franchisee not follow  mandatory procedures is generally insufficient to  establish the requisite control[,]"" [*27]  see Nat'l Gear &  Piston, Inc. v. Cummins Power Sys., LLC, 975 F. Supp.  2d 392, 410 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (internal quotation and  citation omitted); see also, e.g., Taggart v. Rutledge,  657 F. Supp. 1420, 1440 (D. Mont. 1987), aff'd, 852  F.2d 1290 (9th Cir. 1988) (distinguishing franchisor's  ""right to terminate . . . franchise agreement if it  disapproves of [franchisee's] practices"" from ""evidence .  . . to support . . . claims that [franchisor] has any control  over [franchisee's] operations""); Cain v. Shell Oil Co.,  994 F. Supp. 2d 1251, 1255 (N.D. Fla. 2014) (holding  franchisor's ""right to terminate the agreement . . . in no  way  establishes  a  right  to  control  the  store's  operations""); In re Motor Fuel Temperature Sales  Practices Litig., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60879, 2012 WL  1536161, at *5 (D. Kan. Apr. 30, 2012) (holding ""rights  such as the right to enforce standards [and] the right to  terminate the agreement for failure to meet standards . .  . does not amount to sufficient control"" (internal  quotation and citation omitted)). Accordingly, to the extent B.J.'s claim against the  Franchisor Defendants is based on actual agency, such  claim is subject to dismissal. ii. Apparent Agency Relationship ""To establish liability based on apparent agency, plaintiff  must show manifestations by the [d]efendants led her to  believe that the hotels were agents of the respective               [d]efendants, and that [p]laintiff relied on that belief  when engaging with the hotels."" See A.B., 484  F.Supp.3d at 941 (citing Restatement (Third) of Agency  § 2.03 (2006)). Here, although B.J. alleges the  Franchisor Defendants hold out their franchisees to the  public [*28]  as possessing authority to act on their  behalf (see SAC ¶¶ 267, 288, 307, 330), B.J. has not  alleged she relied on any representation made by the  Franchisor Defendants. Moreover, as Marriott points  out, ""the factual core of the entire SAC—that criminals  trafficked B.J. in various hotels against her will—is  incompatible with the notion that B.J. somehow relied""  on the Franchisor Defendants' representations. (See  MRep. at 12:26-28 (internal quotation omitted)); see  also A.B., 484 F.Supp.3d at 942 (finding plaintiff ""failed  to allege the elements of apparent authority"" where  ""[p]laintiff's claim [was] premised on the notion that she  was taken to the hotels against her will to be sex  trafficked""). Accordingly, to the extent B.J.'s claim against the  Franchisor Defendants is predicated on apparent  agency, such claim is subject to dismissal.                            "
"J.G. v. Northbrook Indus., 619 F. Supp. 3d 1228","                                                  [*1231]  ORDER This case is before the Court on Defendant's Second  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint for Damages  (Doc. 37). Having carefully considered the parties'  positions and the applicable law, the Court enters the  following order. I. Background Plaintiff, proceeding anonymously as J.G., alleges that  in 2018 and 2019, she was trafficked for sex as a minor  while residing at the United Inn, a hotel owned,  operated, maintained, controlled, and managed by  Defendant Northbrook Industries, Inc. (""Northbrook"").  (Compl. ¶¶ 8-10, 20.) Plaintiff contends that while  staying at the United Inn, she exhibited numerous well- known and visible signs, characteristics, and behaviors  common to minor sex trafficking [**2]  victims, including  her age and appearance, ""physical deterioration, poor  hygiene, fatigue, sleep deprivation, injuries, a failure to  make eye contact with others . . . loitering, and soliciting  male patrons."" (Id. ¶ 23.) She allegedly stayed at the  United  [*1232]  Inn for up to two weeks at a time in the  company of various, adult men. (Id. ¶¶ 28, 31.) She  allegedly lacked ""control of or possession of money.""  (Id. ¶ 23.) Plaintiff would also allegedly interact with  United Inn staff while wearing ""little clothing"" in ""rooms  replete with evidence of sex trafficking."" (Id. ¶ 29.) Plaintiff alleges that dozens of adult men—sometimes  more than eight in one day—visited the rooms in which  Plaintiff was trafficked to purchase sex. (Id. ¶¶ 23, 25.)  These men allegedly arrived at the hotel in view of the  hotel's lobby, which had a large window facing the  parking lot. (Id. ¶ 25.) According to Plaintiff, other  women and minors were also sex trafficked at the  United Inn while Plaintiff was there. (Id. ¶ 24.) Plaintiff  Page 2 of 8 further alleges that her sex traffickers ""carried weapons  and operated openly"" on the hotel's premises, common  areas, and approaches. (Id. ¶ 20.) Throughout her stays  at the United Inn, Plaintiff [**3]  allegedly walked around  the hotel premises and common area, (again) ""often""  wearing ""little clothing,"" even during periods when  school was in session for children of Plaintiff's age. (Id.  ¶ 31.) Plaintiff's rooms at the United Inn allegedly contained  condoms, drugs, weapons, and a large number of  towels, sheets, and tissues. (Id. ¶ 26.) Plaintiff contends  that on more than one occasion, Northbrook employees  entered  Plaintiff's  room  (for  example,  when  housekeeping staff cleaned the room) and knew or  should have known that the contents of her room were  indicative of commercial sex activity. (Id. ¶ 27.) Plaintiff further alleges that the persons involved in  trafficking her for sex had previously rented rooms at the  United Inn for sex trafficking purposes. (Id. ¶ 37.)  Moreover, Plaintiff asserts that Northbrook's employees  acted as lookouts for Plaintiff's sex traffickers, alerting  them to police activity at the hotel as well as warning  about guest complaints and high visitor traffic drawing  unwanted attention. (Id. ¶ 39.) Plaintiff alleges at least  one of her sex traffickers paid Northbrook's employees  to act as lookouts. (Id. ¶ 40.) Ultimately, Plaintiff alleges  that Northbrook, which [**4]  received revenue from  room rentals, knew or should have known that she was  a victim of trafficking based on her appearance, her  behavior, and the number of adult men coming and  going from her hotel room. (Id. ¶¶ 41, 43.) II. Procedural History On December 28, 2020, Plaintiff filed this suit against  Northbrook alleging two causes of action: (1) violation of  the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act  (""TVPRA""), and (2) common law negligence. (Doc. 1.)  On February 12, 2021, Northbrook filed a motion to  dismiss Plaintiff's claims. (Doc. 15.) On July 30, 2021,  the Court stayed the case while the Eleventh Circuit  Court of Appeals considered a case with similar  allegations, Doe #1 v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714  (11th Cir. 2021). (Doc. 31.) On December 22, 2021, the  Eleventh Circuit issued its decision, and, on December  30, 2021, the Court reopened this case and directed  Northbrook  to  re-file  its  motion  to  dismiss  in  consideration of the Eleventh Circuit's decision. (Doc.  36.) Northbrook then filed its second motion to dismiss  on January 12, 2022. (Doc. 37.) Plaintiff submitted a  response (Doc. 39) to which Northbrook replied (Doc.  41). The motion is now ripe for review. III. Legal Standard In evaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of  Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the [**5]  Court ""accept[s] the  allegations in the complaint as true and constru[es]  them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff."" Traylor  v. P'ship Title Co., 491 F. App'x 988, 989 (11th Cir.  2012). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2)  [*1233]   provides that a pleading must contain ""a short and plain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief."" Although detailed factual allegations  are not required, the pleading must contain more than  ""labels and conclusions"" or a ""formulaic recitation of the  elements of a cause of action."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556  U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868  (2009). Importantly, ""a complaint must contain sufficient  factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to  relief that is plausible on its face.'"" Id. (quoting Bell Atl.  Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955,  167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). For a complaint to be  ""plausible on its face,"" the facts alleged must ""allo[w] the  court to draw the reasonable inference that the  defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged."" Wooten  v. Quicken Loans, Inc. 626 F.3d 1187, 1196 (11th Cir.  2010). While all well-pleaded facts must be accepted as  true and construed in the light most favorable to the  plaintiff, Powell v. Thomas, 643 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th  Cir. 2011), a court need not accept as true the plaintiff's  legal conclusions, including those couched as factual  allegations, Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Accordingly, evaluation of a motion to dismiss entails a  two-pronged approach: (1) a court must identify any  allegations in the pleading that are merely legal  conclusions to which the [**6]  ""assumption of truth""  should not apply, and (2) where there are remaining  well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should ""assume  their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly  give rise to an entitlement to relief."" Id. at 679. IV. Discussion In its motion, Northbrook contends that Plaintiff's  TVPRA and negligence claims fail as a matter of law  and should be dismissed. The Court addresses these  claims in turn. Page 3 of 8 A. TVPRA Claim The Trafficking Victims Protections Reauthorization Act  (""TVPRA"") offers a civil remedy to people who have  experienced certain types of human trafficking. 18  U.S.C. § 1595(a). The statute states in part: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. Under the TVRPA, therefore, a victim of sex trafficking  may bring either (a) a direct civil claim against the  perpetrator of their trafficking or (b) a ""beneficiary"" [**7]   civil  claim  against  ""whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in violation of  [the TVPRA]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). In this case, Plaintiff  is not suing the perpetrator of her trafficking; instead,  she  seeks  to  establish  beneficiary  liability  on  Northbrook, a business that she claims knowingly  benefited from sex trafficking. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, in Doe #1 v. Red  Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714 (11th Cir. 2021),  articulated the elements of a TVPRA beneficiary claim.  To state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that the  defendant:  [*1234]  (1) knowingly benefited, (2) from taking  part in a common undertaking or enterprise  involving  risk  and  potential  profit,  (3)  that  undertaking or enterprise violated the TVPRA as to  the plaintiff, and (4) the defendant had constructive  or actual knowledge that the undertaking or  enterprise violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff. Id. at 726. In order for Plaintiff's TVPRA beneficiary claim to  survive Northbrook's motion to dismiss, Plaintiff must  plausibly allege facts sufficient to satisfy each of these  four elements. For the following reasons, the Court  finds [**8]  that her complaint does so. 1. Element One: ""Knowingly Benefited"" To satisfy the first element of a TVPRA beneficiary  claim, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant ""knew it  was receiving some value from participating in the  alleged venture."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. Here,  Plaintiff's complaint alleges that Northbrook collected  revenue from the rental of the rooms in which Plaintiff  was trafficked for sex. (Compl. ¶ 36.) Specifically,  Plaintiff alleges that Northbrook, as the owner and  operator of the United Inn, knowingly received a  percentage of the revenue generated from the rate  charged and paid for the rooms in which Plaintiff was  trafficked. (Id. ¶ 75.) Several district courts, including  this one, have found that the rental of a room constitutes  a financial benefit from a relationship with the trafficker  sufficient to meet this element of the § 1595(a)  standard. A.G. v. Northbrook Indus., Inc, 2022 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 93264., 1:20-CV-05231-JPB, 2022 U.S. Dist.  Lexis 93264, 2022 WL 1644921, at *2 (N.D. Ga.) G.W.  v. Northbrook Indus., Inc., 1:20-CV-05232-JPB, 2022  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93263, 2022 WL 1644923, at *2 (N.D.  Ga.); M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F.  Supp.3d 959, 965 (S.D. Ohio 2019); S.Y. v. Naples  Hotel Co., 476 F. Supp.3d 1251, 1257 (M.D. Fla. 2020)  (collecting cases). The Court agrees that such an  allegation is sufficient to satisfy this element. Therefore,  Plaintiff plausibly alleges the first element of her TVPRA  beneficiary claim. 2. Element Two: Participation in a Venture Next, Plaintiff must allege that Northbrook ""participat[ed]  in a venture"" [**9]  under circumstances that would  violate the TVPRA. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). In the context  of a civil suit, the Eleventh Circuit has defined  ""participation in a venture"" as ""t[aking] part in a common  undertaking or enterprise involving risk and potential  profit."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Unlike in the  criminal provisions of the TVPRA, there is no scienter  requirement for civil TVPRA beneficiary claims. Id. at  724. In other words, a plaintiff need not show that the  defendant ""knowingly facilitated a violation"" under the  TVPRA. Id. To determine what conduct does and does not reach  the level of ""participation in a venture,"" the Court looks  to the Eleventh Circuit's analysis in Red Roof Inns. In  that case, the plaintiffs were sex trafficking victims who  sued the franchisors of the hotels at which they were  trafficked. Id. at 719. To show that the franchisors  participated in a sex trafficking venture with the plaintiffs'  sex traffickers, the plaintiffs alleged that the franchisors  received revenue from renting rooms to the sex  Page 4 of 8 traffickers, oversaw operations and hotel policies,  controlled the training of managers, and ""took remedial  action when revenue was down."" Id. at 726-27. The only  allegations the plaintiffs made as to the franchisors'  knowledge or participation [**10]  in the sex trafficking  venture were that ""the franchisors sent inspectors to the  hotels who would have seen signs of sex trafficking"" and  the franchisors ""received reviews mentioning sex work  occurring at the hotels.""  [*1235]  Id. at 727. The  Eleventh Circuit deemed these allegations to be  insufficient to establish the franchisors' participation in a  common undertaking or enterprise with the plaintiffs' sex  traffickers, stating that ""observing something is not the  same as participating in it."" Id. Although plaintiffs in Red Roof Inns failed plausibly to  allege facts that satisfied the second element of a  TVPRA beneficiary claim, the Eleventh Circuit in that  case provided insight into the kind of conduct that, if  alleged, would pass muster under the TVPRA. For  example, the court endorsed the holding in Ricchio v.  McLean, 853 F.3d 553 (1st Cir. 2017), a First Circuit  case in which a sex trafficking victim's suit against the  operators of the hotel where she was held hostage and  sexually abused survived a motion to dismiss. In  Ricchio, the First Circuit concluded that the plaintiff had  adequately alleged the hotel operators' association with  a sex trafficking venture because the plaintiff's abuser  ""had prior commercial dealings with the [operators],  which the [**11]  parties wished to reinstate for profit.""  Id. at 555. Further, the Ricchio plaintiff alleged that, by  renting a room to her abuser, the hotel operators were  ""associating with him in an effort to force [the plaintiff] to  serve their business objective."" Id. The Eleventh Circuit  in Red Roof Inns determined that ""these kinds of  allegations  would  establish  a  hotel  operator's  participation in a venture with a sex trafficker."" 21 F.4th  at 725-26. This Court additionally finds persuasive the concurring  opinion in Red Roof Inns, in which Judge Jordan drew a  distinction between a franchisor and a hotel operator in  the context of a TVPRA case. Id. at 729-30. Specifically,  the concurring opinion underscored that the Eleventh  Circuit's ""opinion addresses the plaintiffs' TVPRA  'beneficiary' claims against franchisors, which do not  operate or manage the hotels at which sex trafficking  allegedly occurred."" Id. at 729. But, ""similar claims  against those who own, operate, or manage the hotels  in question . . . would withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion  to dismiss."" Id. Courts in other districts have similarly grappled with the  question of what conduct constitutes a defendant's  participation in a venture under § 1595(a). In reviewing  these  cases,  the  factor  that  appears  to  differentiate [**12]  plaintiffs who adequately state  TVPRA beneficiary claims from those who do not is that  the successful plaintiffs ""connect the dots"" between the  plaintiff's particular experience as a victim of trafficking  and the specific defendant in the case. See, e.g., > G.G.  v. Salesforce.com, Inc. No. 20-cv-02335, 2022 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 87616, 2022 WL 1541408, at *12 (N.D. Ill.  May 16, 2022); B.M. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.  No. 20-cv-00656-BLF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494,  2020 WL 4368214, at *5 (N.D. Cal. July 30, 2020). One way to connect the dots is to allege a ""direct  association"" between the beneficiary and the plaintiff's  trafficker. See G.G., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, 2022  WL 1541408, at *12; J.B. v. G6 Hosp., LLC, No. 19-cv- 07848-HSG, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213, 2020 WL  4901196, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 20, 2020). Another way  is to show a ""continuous business relationship"" between  a defendant hotel and a sex trafficker where the  defendants rented rooms to people it knew or should  have known were engaged in sex trafficking. See  Northbrook, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93264, 2022 WL  1644921, at *3 (finding such conduct sufficient to show  participation in a venture); S.Y. v. Best Western Int'l,  Inc., 2:20-cv-616-JES-MRM, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  106139, 2021 WL 2315073, at *4 (M.D. Fla. June 7,  2021) (same); M.A., 425 F. Supp.3d at 971 (same); H.H.  v. G6 Hosp., LLC, No. 2:19-cv-755, 2019 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *5 (S.D. Ohio  Dec. 6, 2019) (same); Ricchio, 853 F.3d at 555 (looking  to ""prior commercial dealings . . . which the parties  wished to reinstate for profit"" as evidence of the hotel  defendant's participation in a venture).  [*1236]   Here,  Plaintiff  has  plausibly  alleged  Northbrook's participation in a venture with the persons  who were engaged in trafficking Plaintiff for sex. Unlike  in Red Roof Inns (which involved defendant hotel  franchisors), Plaintiff brings her TVPRA beneficiary  claim against the operator of the hotel [**13]  in which  she was allegedly trafficked—an operator that was  closely involved with the daily management of the hotel  and allegedly did far more than simply receive revenue  and reviews mentioning sex work. (See Compl. ¶ 10.) Further, Plaintiff has asserted facts sufficient to allege  both a ""direct association"" and a ""continuous business  relationship"" between Northbrook and her traffickers.  (See id. ¶¶ 11, 37, 39-40.) As for the ""direct  association,""  Plaintiff  alleges  that  ""Northbrook's  Page 5 of 8 employees, agents, and/or representatives"" assisted  those who trafficked Plaintiff by ""acting as lookouts for  Plaintiff's traffickers and informing the traffickers of  police activity at the hotel as well as warning Plaintiff's  traffickers about guest complaints and high visitor traffic  drawing unwanted attention."" (Id. ¶ 39.) Plaintiff further  alleges that at least one of her traffickers paid  Northbrook's employees, agents, and/or representatives  to act as lookouts and to notify the trafficker of police  activity at the hotel. (Id. ¶ 40.) These allegations directly  link specific conduct of Northbrook employees to the  advancement of the sex trafficking operation and, as  such, are sufficient to satisfy the [**14]  second element  of the TVPRA beneficiary claim. Plaintiff, however, goes further. She also alleges a  ""continuous business relationship"" akin to the one  described in Ricchio. Plaintiff alleges that her traffickers  had previously rented rooms at the United Inn to traffic  women for sex, and Northbrook should have known that  the traffickers were back again to engage in sex  trafficking with Plaintiff. (Id. ¶¶ 11, 37.) In support of the  ""continuous business relationship"" theory, Plaintiff  specifically asserts that: she and other sex trafficking  victims at the United Inn exhibited obvious signs,  characteristics, and behaviors of minor victims of sex  trafficking such as ""inappropriate"" appearance, physical  deterioration, poor hygiene, fatigue, sleep deprivation,  injuries, loitering, and soliciting male patrons (Id. ¶¶ 23- 24); her sex traffickers carried weapons and ""operated  openly"" on the hotel's premises, common areas, and  approaches (Id. ¶ 20); dozens of adult men—and  sometimes more than eight in one day—came to  Plaintiff's room ""in view of the hotel's lobby"" to purchase  sex (Id. ¶¶ 22-25); Plaintiff would interact with United Inn  staff while wearing ""little clothing"" (Id. ¶ 29); and, on  multiple [**15]  occasions, United Inn staff entered  Plaintiff's room, which contained condoms, drugs,  weapons, and a large number of towels, sheets, and  tissues (Id. ¶¶ 26-27). As in Northbrook, >S.Y., >M.A.,  >H.H., and Ricchio (cited above), these allegations are  sufficient to plausibly allege at this stage of the case that  Northbrook participated in a venture with Plaintiff's  traffickers by renting rooms to people it knew or should  have known were engaging in sex trafficking. The foregoing allegations, which are indicative of  Northbrook's  alleged  common  undertaking  with  Plaintiff's sex traffickers, distinguish this case from a  recent case in this district in which a plaintiff failed to  state a TVPRA beneficiary claim. In A.B. v. H.K. Grp. of  Co., 1:21-cv-1344-TCB, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29214,  2022 WL 467786 (N.D. Ga.), a plaintiff failed to plausibly  allege a hotel owner/manager's participation in a sex  trafficking venture. In that case, the plaintiff alleged  only that the defendants  [*1237]  observed the plaintiff's  physical appearance and the condition of her room, and  that by failing to assist her or alert authorities, the  defendants participated in a sex trafficking venture.  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29214, 2022 WL 467786, at *10- 11. The Court dismissed the plaintiff's TVPRA claim,  finding  that,  at  most,  plaintiff  alleged [**16]   ""[d]efendants  observed  and/or  had  actual  or  constructive knowledge of the illegality of sex trafficking  allegedly occurring in its hotels."" 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  29214, 2022 WL 467786, at *10-11. Here, by contrast,  Plaintiff's  allegations—namely,  that  Northbrook  employees were paid to assist Plaintiff's sex traffickers  by acting as lookouts, and that Northbrook previously  rented rooms to Plaintiff's sex traffickers and rented to  them again despite having constructive knowledge of  their intent to traffic Plaintiff—go far beyond mere  observation of potential sex trafficking. Notwithstanding these allegations, Northbrook believes  the Court should discount Plaintiff's alleged facts with  respect to the ""participation in a venture"" element for  two reasons. First, Northbrook contends that Plaintiff  makes only ""boilerplate allegations,"" and does so ""on  'information and belief,' without any factual basis."" (Doc.  37-1 at 12.) The Court is not convinced by this  argument. On the contrary, the allegations discussed  above contain specific details of Northbrook's alleged  conduct that are not mere formulaic recitations of  elements—especially when viewing all allegations in the  light most favorable to Plaintiff, as the Court [**17]  must  do on a 12(b)(6) motion. Further, as stated in a case  Northbrook cites in favor of its position, ""Twombly's  'plausibility' standard d[oes] not prevent a plaintiff from  pleading facts based upon information and belief, 'where  the facts are peculiarly within the possession and  control of the defendant.'"" Boateng v. Retirement Corp.  of Am. Partners, L.P., No. 1:12-cv-01959-JOF, 2013  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 197898, 2013 WL 12061901, at *4  (N.D. Ga. March 5, 2013) (quoting Arista Records, LLC  v. Doe 3, 604 F.3d 110, 120 (2d. Cir. 2010)). Here,  Plaintiff, a victim of underage sex trafficking, likely has  uniquely inferior access to the facts in Northbrook's  possession at this point in the litigation. Accordingly, it       Page 6 of 8 would be inconsistent with the Twombly framework to  discount Plaintiff's allegations solely on account of some  of them being based ""on information and belief."" Second, Northbrook contends that, to the extent  Northbrook employees took part in a common enterprise  with Plaintiff's sex traffickers, such conduct was outside  the scope of their employment and cannot be imputed to  Northbrook. Northbrook may ultimately be correct in this  assertion, but discovery will be necessary to elucidate  the relevant facts. It would be premature at the 12(b)(6)  stage for the Court to dismiss on these grounds. See  Johnson St. Props., LLC v. Clure, 302 Ga. 51, 805  S.E.2d 60, 66 (Ga. 2017) (""Typically, questions of the  existence and extent of an agent's authority are  generally for the triers of [**18]  fact"") (internal quotation  marks omitted); see also Amin v. Mercedes-Benz USA,  LLC, 349 F. Supp.3d 1338, 1357 (N.D. Ga. 2018). Because Plaintiff asserts specific facts as to Northbrook  taking part in a common undertaking or enterprise  involving risk or potential profit with her sex traffickers,  she has plausibly alleged the second element of her  TVPRA claim.  [*1238]  3. Element Three: The Venture Violated the  TVPRA as to Plaintiff To satisfy the third element, the plaintiff must allege that  ""the venture in which the defendant participated and  from which it knowingly benefited must have violated the  TVPRA as to the plaintiff."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at  725. The TVPRA criminalizes various acts of human  trafficking. 18 U.S.C. § 1591. In this case, Plaintiff  specifically alleges that she was trafficked in violation of  § 1591(a), which makes it a crime to ""caus[e]"" a person  under 18 years old to ""engage in a commercial sex act.""  (Compl. ¶ 8); 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Consequently,  Plaintiff must plausibly allege that the venture in which              Northbrook participated caused Plaintiff to engage in a  commercial sex act. 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a); Northbrook,  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93264, 2022 WL 1644921, at *3. The Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations are more than  sufficient to show that the venture alleged in the  complaint violated the TVPRA as to Plaintiff. Plaintiff  alleges, and Northbrook does not dispute, [**19]  that  she was sex trafficked as a minor and was caused to  engage in commercial sex acts with dozens of adult  men from 2018 to 2019. (Compl. ¶¶ 17, 25.) As a result,  Plaintiff has satisfied the third element of her TVPRA  beneficiary claim. See Northbrook, 2022 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 93264, 2022 WL 1644921, at *3 (finding  substantially similar allegations sufficient to satisfy the  third TVPRA element). 4. Element Four: Defendant Knew or Should Have  Known the Venture Violated the TVPRA as to  Plaintiff The final element of a TVPRA beneficiary claim comes  from the statutory requirement that the defendant ""knew  or should have known [that the venture] has engaged in  an act in violation of this chapter."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a).  This requires the plaintiff to allege that the defendant  had either actual or constructive knowledge that the  venture violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff. Red Roof  Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Knowledge is defined as ""a[n]  awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance.""  Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725 (quoting Knowledge,  Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019)). Constructive  knowledge, on the other hand, is ""that knowledge which  'one using reasonable care or diligence should have.'""  Id. (quoting Constructive Knowledge, Black's Law  Dictionary (11th ed. 2019)). Thus, Plaintiff must  plausibly allege that Northbrook had [**20]  at least  constructive knowledge that the venture in which it  participated and from which it benefited violated the  TVPRA as to Plaintiff. Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. The Court finds that Plaintiff has adequately alleged that  Northbrook had actual or constructive knowledge of  Plaintiff's sex trafficking at the United Inn. In Plaintiff's  complaint, she alleges that Northbrook knew or should  have known about the sex trafficking venture based on  the following: ""[Plaintiff's] age and inappropriate  appearance, physical deterioration, poor hygiene,  fatigue, sleep deprivation, injuries, a failure to make eye  contact with others, no control of or possession of  money, loitering, and soliciting male patrons."" (Compl. ¶  23.) Also relevant to this element are Plaintiff's  Page 7 of 8 allegations that she interacted with United Inn staff while  exhibiting the above signs and characteristics of  trafficking (Id. ¶ 29); dozens of adult men visited  Plaintiff's room (Id. ¶ 25); Plaintiff's sex traffickers  ""carried weapons and operated openly and brazenly on  the hotel's premises, common areas, and approaches""  (Id. ¶ 20); and Plaintiff's room,  [*1239]  which  Northbrook employees entered on more than one  occasion,  contained  condoms,  drugs,  weapons,  and [**21]  many towels, sheets, and tissues (Id. ¶¶ 26- 27). Significantly, Plaintiff also alleges that her sex  traffickers had previously trafficked victims at the United  Inn and some of Northbrook's employees acted as  lookouts for Plaintiff's traffickers. (Id. ¶¶ 37, 39.) Courts  considering similar allegations have found them  sufficient to infer at this stage of the case that a  defendant knew or should have known of the sex  trafficking venture, and this Court finds these allegations  sufficient as well. Northbrook, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  93264, 2022 WL 1644921, at *4; S.Y., 476 F. Supp.3d  at 1257 (collecting cases). As explained in the preceding paragraphs, Plaintiff has  sufficiently alleged facts to support each element of her  TVPRA beneficiary claim. B. Negligence Claim Plaintiff brings a negligence claim against Northbrook,  alleging that she was an invitee on Northbrook's  premises and that Northbrook breached its duty to her  by failing to exercise reasonable care in the operation of  the United Inn. (Compl. ¶¶ 84-111.) Northbrook  contends it owed no duty to Plaintiff and seeks to  dismiss Plaintiff's negligence claim on two grounds: (1)  Plaintiff fails to plausibly allege that she was an invitee  on Northbrook's premises, and (2) Plaintiff was not on  Northbrook's premises ""for any lawful [**22]  purpose."" 1. Whether Plaintiff Was an Invitee on Northbrook's  Premises With respect to Northbrook's invitee argument, the Court  finds at this preliminary stage of the litigation that  Plaintiff has plausibly alleged her status as an invitee on  Northbrook's premises. The duty of an owner or  occupier of land to invitees on its premises is prescribed  by O.C.G.A. § 51-3-1 which states as follows: Duty of owner or occupier of land to invitee. Where  an owner or occupier of land, by express or implied  invitation, induces or leads others to come upon his  premises for any lawful purpose, he is liable in  damages to such persons for injuries caused by his  failure to exercise ordinary care in keeping the  premises and approaches safe. O.C.G.A. § 51-3-1. The test to determine whether one is an invitee is  ""whether the party coming onto the business premises  had present business relations with the owner or  occupier which would render his presence of mutual  benefit to both, or whether his presence was for his own  convenience, or was for business with one other than  the owner or occupier."" Freeman v. Eicholz, 705 S.E.2d  919, 923 (Ga. App. 2011). The facts in this case as averred in Plaintiff's complaint  do not make for a straightforward determination of  Plaintiff's status on Northbrook's premises. [**23]  See  A.B., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29214, 2022 WL 467786, at  *5. Plaintiff alleges that, although her traffickers were  the ones who rented the rooms in which she stayed,  Northbrook owed Plaintiff a duty as an invitee on its  premises. (Compl. ¶¶ 35, 86.) There is no question that  one who rents a hotel room is an invitee on the hotel's  premises. See, e.g., Briddle v. Cornerstone Lodge of  Am., LLC, 288 Ga. App. 353, 654 S.E.2d 188, 189 (Ga.  App. 2007). However, Georgia law appears at best  unsettled as to whether a hotel invitee's guest is an  invitee, licensee, or something else. This classification is  of paramount importance because it dictates the scope  of the duty owed to the guest. See Martin v. Six Flags  Over Ga. II, L.P., 301 Ga. 323, 801 S.E.2d 24, 29 (Ga.  2017). The Court observes that in most circumstances, an  invitee's guest stands in the invitee's shoes and is  herself an invitee. See 43A C.J.S. Inns, Hotels, and  Eating  [*1240]  Places § 47 (2021) (""Persons who  respond to an invitation, either express or implied, to  visit or call on registered guests of an inn at proper  times are invitees . . . .""); Anderson v. Cooper, 214 Ga.  164, 104 S.E.2d 90 (Ga. 1958) (holding that parent- customer's infant child was an invitee because the  parent would not have been present at the business if  she could not bring her child—thus the business owner  benefitted from the child's presence); Cham v. ECI  Mgmt. Corp., 311 Ga. 170, 856 S.E.2d 267, 279 (Ga.  2021) (Peterson, J., dissenting) (noting that similar to  Anderson, where it was ""'obvious' that a store owner  would [**24]  receive a benefit from permitting an  invitee's guest to be present,"" in the case under  consideration, ""when renters are allowed to host guests,  the guests are thus implicitly invited by the landlord"");  Page 8 of 8 Ortner v. Linch, 128 So.2d 152, 153 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.  1960) (""a guest of a guest in the hotel"" has ""the status of  . . . an invitee."" (citing Steinberg v. Irwin Operating Co.,  90 So.2d 460, 461 (Fla. 1956))); Corinaldi v. Columbia  Courtyard, Inc., 162 Md. App. 207, 873 A.2d 483, 491  (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2005) (""Generally, a property owner  owes the same duty to the guest of an invitee as it owes  to the invitee himself.""); Mackey v. Allen, 396 S.W.2d  55, 58 (Ky. Ct. App. 1965) (""[B]ecause her visit to the  premises was 'for the convenience or arose out of the  necessities' of another person who definitely was in the  [business] for purposes of the possessor's business,"" ""a  business invitee's guest is also an invitee.""). Considering Georgia law and the settled law of other  jurisdictions, the Court holds that at this preliminary  stage, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that—as the  guest of an invitee—she was herself an invitee. 2. Whether Plaintiff Was Induced Onto Northbrook's  Premises ""For Any Lawful Purpose"" Northbrook argues that O.C.G.A. § 51-3-1 requires that,  in order to be an invitee entitled to a duty of care, a  person must be on the subject premises ""for any lawful  purpose."" Because Plaintiff was on Northbrook's  premises for sex trafficking (i.e., an unlawful purpose),  Northbrook [**25]  posits, Plaintiff was not entitled to the  duty of care owed to invitees. Northbrook misconstrues O.C.G.A. § 51-3-1. The  statute does not preclude those who commit—or are  victims of—unlawful acts from being invitees; rather, the  plain language of the statute applies when the ""owner or  occupier of land, by express or implied invitation,  induces or leads others to come upon his premises for  any lawful purpose."" O.C.G.A. § 51-3-1 (emphasis  added); see Stephens v. Clairmont Ctr., Inc., 230 Ga.  App. 793, 498 S.E.2d 307, 309 (Ga. App. 1998) (noting  that assailants ""posing as customers"" had ""entered the  shop as business invitees, not intruders""). Thus, the  question is not whether Plaintiff engaged in unlawful  activity while on Northbrook's property. Instead, the  relevant inquiry is whether Northbrook induced or led  Plaintiff to come upon its property for a lawful purpose. Plaintiff, in alleging her status as an invitee, suggests  Northbrook invited her onto its property for a lawful  purpose. Northbrook, however, believes that this invitee  argument is irreconcilable with Plaintiff's contention that  Northbrook participated in a venture with Plaintiff's  traffickers and ""Northbrook knew or should have known  the venture engaged in acts in violation of the TVPRA.""  (Compl. ¶ 78.) The Court acknowledges the potential  inconsistency [**26]   between  these  positions.  Nonetheless, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 provides  that, ""[a] party may state as many separate claims or  defenses as it has, regardless of consistency."" FED. R.  CIV. P. 8(d)(3); see Smith v. Haynes & Haynes P.C.,  940 F.3d 635, 647 (11th Cir. 2019) (""[W]e explicitly  permit litigants to assert  [*1241]  inconsistent positions  when pleading their case.""). As such, the Court is  unwilling to dismiss Plaintiff's negligence claim pursuant  to O.C.G.A. § 51-3-1 before the record has been  developed. Discovery will shed light on facts pertinent to  the relationships between Plaintiff, Northbrook, and  Plaintiff's traffickers, and those facts will guide the  ultimate determination of whether an invitor-invitee  relationship existed between Northbrook and Plaintiff.  The Court declines, at this early point in the litigation, to  find Plaintiff's negligence claim deficient as a matter of  law.         "
"L.H. v. Red Roof Inn, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 156293","                                    MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER This matter is before the Court on Defendant Red Roof  Inn, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint [R. 14]  and  Defendant  Wyndham  Hotels  and  Resorts,  Inc.'s [*2]  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint [R.  20]. Both motions are fully briefed. See [R. 19; R. 27;  R. 28; R. 32]. For the following reasons, Red Roof's  Motion [R. 14] will be GRANTED in part and DENIED in  part, and Wyndham's Motion [R. 20] will be GRANTED. I. Background Plaintiff L.H. filed her Complaint in this action on  November 28, 2022. [R. 1]. The Complaint describes  L.H. as ""a survivor of sex trafficking under the federal  William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008 (hereinafter 'TVPRA')."" See  id. at 2 ¶ 3. She has named Red Roof, Wyndham, and  Club NO, Inc., as Defendants and alleges that she was  abused at these hotels' properties from January 2018 to  February 2018. See id. at 1, 3-6. Through her  Complaint, L.H. seeks to hold the Defendant hotels  liable for ""ignor[ing] the open and obvious presence of  sex trafficking on their properties, [and] enjoying the  profit from rooms rented for this explicit and apparent  purpose"" in violation of the TVPRA. See id. at 1 ¶ 2. By way of background, the Complaint alleges that, in  approximately January 2018, L.H. was 16 years old and  that she ran away from a group home at which she was  residing. Id. at 28 ¶ 58. After running away and walking  for quite some time, L.H. sat down to take a break, at  which time [*3]  she was approached by an adult male  who identified himself as ""Q."" Id. at ¶ 59. Q would later  be identified as Quentin J. Burris. Id. at ¶ 60. Burris  struck up a conversation with L.H. and advised that he  had somewhere warm they could go. Id. at ¶ 59. Given  the cold temperatures and because L.H. had nowhere  else to go, she accepted Burris's offer. Id. at ¶ 61. Burris transported L.H. back to his house, where he  furnished her with marijuana and alcohol. Id. at ¶ 62. He      Page 2 of 10 then advised her that he wanted to take L.H. to his  ""homegirl's"" house, emphasizing that she ""knew how to  make money."" Id. at ¶ 63. Burris took L.H. to Abigail  Varney's home. Id. at 28 ¶ 63, 34 ¶ 113. Varney told  L.H. she could make money, but that L.H. would first  need to pose naked for photographs. Id. at 28 ¶ 64.  Varney took the photographs and then posted them to  Backpage.com, ""a website formerly known for sex  trafficking and other illicit purposes before being seized  and shut down by federal authorities in mid-2018."" Id. at  ¶ 65. Varney introduced L.H. to another associate, Nigel  Nicholas, at a Red Roof property, which, to the best of  L.H.'s recollection, was located at 4704 Preston  Highway. Id. at 29 ¶ 66. Nicholas [*4]  told L.H. that  before he would ""invest"" in her, L.H. would have to  ""show [Nicholas] what she could do."" Id. at ¶ 67. L.H.  was then forced to have sex with numerous commercial  sex buyers at the Red Roof property that night. Id. at ¶  68. Burris arrived later that evening, and L.H. alleges  that he, Varney, and Nicholas shared financial gain as a  result of the sex trafficking activity at that Red Roof  property. Id. at ¶ 69. L.H. was kept at that Red Roof property for several  days. Id. at ¶ 70. During that time, she heard Nicholas  and Varney discussing money and believes Nicholas  may have paid for L.H.'s accommodations with a credit  card. Id. at ¶ 71. While she was at this Red Roof  property, L.H. was forced to engage in commercial sex  with a least ten to twelve johns per day, which she  alleges ""creat[ed] a clear and unusually high volume of  foot traffic into and out of her room."" Id. at ¶ 72. Varney  did not have cellular service at this property, so she  used the hotel's Wi-Fi connection to continue uploading  pictures of L.H. and advertisements for commercial sex  to Backpage.com and escorts.com. Id. at ¶ 73. After a few days, Varney expressed to L.H. that the Red  Roof property [*5]  was becoming ""too hot,"" meaning  Varney felt they were starting to arouse suspicion due to  noise complaints and the smell of cigarette and  marijuana smoke. Id. at 29-30 ¶ 74. Thus, the         individuals left the Red Roof property to go to the  Louisville Manor Adult Hotel (a Club NO property)  located at 4600 Dixie Highway in Shively, Kentucky. Id.  at 25 ¶ 56(a), 30 ¶ 75. L.H. alleges that ""the Louisville  Manor Adult Hotel is notorious among the community for  prostitution and commercial sex activity"" and that the  hotel offered rooms that could be purchased by the  hour. Id. at 30 ¶ 76. Either Varney or Nicholas may have  paid for the room in cash. Id. at ¶ 77. L.H. was at the  Louisville Manor Adult Hotel for only a few hours, but  during  that  time,  she  was  forced  to  service  approximately five or six johns in her room. Id. at ¶ 79.  At one point, Varney went to the front desk to book a  room for an extra hour because she herself was  engaged in commercial sex and needed the room for an  appointment with a different john. Id. at ¶ 80. While L.H. was at the Louisville Manor Adult Hotel, she  expressed to Varney that she wanted to leave the hotel  because she did not want to continue to be forced [*6]   to service commercial sex buyers. Id. at ¶ 81. Varney  responded by physically blocking the door with her body  and getting into a loud, profane shouting argument with  L.H. Id. at ¶ 82. Soon after this loud and conspicuous  altercation, a hotel staff member approached the room  and spoke with Varney to let her know about a noise  complaint and that they would have to ""keep it down or  leave."" Id. at 30-31 ¶ 83 . During the hours L.H. was kept at the Louisville Manor  Adult Hotel, Varney used the hotel's Wi-Fi to continue  uploading  pictures  and  advertisements  to  Backpage.com and escorts.com. Id. at 31 ¶ 84.  Eventually, while Varney was engaged in commercial  sex with a john, a hotel staff member informed them that  they were making too much noise and would have to  leave. Id. at ¶ 85. After being kicked out of the Louisville  Manor Adult Hotel, L.H. was taken to a residential  property Varney had been renting from Nicholas. Id. at ¶  86. At this property, L.H. was again trafficked for  commercial sex by Varney and Nicholas. Id. She was  also taken to Goodwill to shop for new clothes to  increase her appeal to commercial sex buyers in the  advertisements her traffickers were posting online. Id. at  ¶ 87. [*7]  Varney and Nicholas then took L.H. to a Baymont Hotel       Page 3 of 10 (a Wyndham property) located at 6515 Signature Drive  in Louisville. Id. at 21 ¶ 55(a), 31 ¶ 88. L.H. believes  Nicholas paid for one night's stay with a credit card. Id.  at 31 ¶ 89. Then, Varney and Nicholas took L.H. up to  their room to take and upload more photographs and  advertisements to Backpage.com and escorts.com,  using the hotel's Wi-Fi connection. Id. at ¶ 91. At this time, L.H. again expressed a desire to leave, and  Varney again physically blocked L.H.'s exit and became  loud and confrontational with her. Id. at ¶ 91. A short  time later, a hotel employee came to the room and said  he had received a complaint about the smell of cigarette  and marijuana smoke and that they would have to leave  if another such complaint were received. Id. at ¶ 92. L.H.  was kept at the Baymont hotel for approximately five  hours. Id. at 32 ¶ 93. During that time, she was forced to  provide commercial sex to three to four johns. Id. at ¶  94. While L.H. was being trafficked, other people  entered the room and smoked marijuana while engaging  Varney in conversation. Id. at ¶ 95. About twenty  minutes later, the same hotel staff member returned and  asked [*8]  them to leave based on complaints about  the smell of marijuana use. Id. at ¶ 96. After the Baymont hotel, L.H. was taken to a second  Red Roof property, this one located at 3322 Red Roof  Inn Place in Louisville. Id. She does not know how this  room was paid for. Id. at ¶ 97. L.H. noted that used  condoms, tourniquets, and syringes were strewn  throughout the property, which she claims are  ""indicative of high amounts of illicit drug and commercial  sex activity."" Id. at ¶ 98. At check-in, towels were pre- ordered for the room, so that hotel housekeeping staff  would not need to enter the room. Id. at ¶ 99. Soon after checking in, L.H.'s traffickers posted pictures  of her on Backpage.com and escorts.com using the  hotel  Wi-Fi  connection  and  advertised  her  for  commercial sex. Id. at ¶ 100. L.H. was kept at this Red  Roof property for two to three days, during which time  she was forced to perform commercial sex acts with  approximately 30 johns, all of whom she alleges ""had to  pass through the lobby and front desk, as well as  numerous hotel rooms, in order to access Plaintiff's  room located at the back of the hotel."" Id. at ¶ 101. L.H. was tasked with collecting the payment from the  johns and then [*9]  giving all the money to her trafficker  by placing it in the hotel nightstand for the trafficker to  retrieve. Id. at ¶ 102. She was not allowed to keep any  of the funds and was never given any of the funds. Id. at  33 ¶ 103. On one occasion, a john stole his money back  while L.H. was getting dressed and left without payment,  causing L.H.'s trafficker to become enraged and berate  L.H. in a loud, profane fashion. Id. at ¶ 104. On another  occasion, a female housekeeping worker was permitted  to enter L.H.'s room and observed L.H. looking pale and  sick, prompting the worker to look at L.H. curiously. Id.  at ¶ 105. However, the worker did not inquire as to  L.H.'s wellbeing and, to L.H.'s knowledge, did not make  any type of report to anyone regarding L.H.'s condition  or activity. Id. After a few days at the second Red Roof property, L.H.'s  traffickers stated the hotel was getting ""hot,"" so they  took her to several private residences and an unknown  hotel in Indiana, where she was sexually assaulted by  one of her trafficker's friends. Id. at ¶ 106. During this  time, L.H.'s physical condition continued to worsen. Id.  at ¶ 107. One day, L.H. awoke to hotel staff knocking on  her door, telling her [*10]  she had to leave because the  rest of her party had checked out. Id. at ¶ 108. After L.H.  could not reach anyone by phone and experienced  difficulty maintaining consciousness, she called 911 and  disclosed that she was a sex trafficking victim in need of  help. Id. at ¶ 109. L.H. was transported by EMS to an unknown hospital in  Indiana, where she was treated for sepsis and  dehydration and for chemical dependency relating to her  use of marijuana and crack cocaine furnished to her by  her traffickers, ""who used the common sex trafficker  tactic of fostering chemical dependency within their  victims as a means of establishing control and  compliance."" Id. at ¶ 110. Police arrived within five to  ten minutes of L.H.'s arrival at the hospital, but she was  too sick and weak to give an interview at that time. Id. at  34 ¶ 111. Subsequently, L.H. was transferred to another unknown  hospital in Kentucky, where her condition improved  enough for her to give a statement to law enforcement.  Id. at ¶ 112. By April 2018, Burris, Nicholas, and Varney  were arrested and charged with various crimes,  including sexual abuse and sex trafficking of minors. Id.  at ¶ 113. In November 2021, they each were sentenced  to [*11]  five years in prison for their crimes. Id. at ¶ 114. L.H.'s Complaint contains three causes of action, each  alleging a respective violation of the TVPRA by Red  Roof, Wyndham, and Club NO. See id. at 36-40.  Through these causes of action, L.H. claims that the  Defendant hotels failed to take reasonable measures to  stop sex trafficking at their properties and that they  ""profited from the sex trafficking of L.H. and knowingly  Page 4 of 10 or negligently aided and engaged with her traffickers in  his sex trafficking venture"" in violation of federal law. Id.  at 34 ¶ 115. Notably, L.H. has not sued the individual hotel locations  at which she was trafficked, but the ""parent hotel  brand[s]."" See id. at 15 ¶¶ 50-51 (describing Red Roof  as owning and controlling the ""Red Roof Inn® brand,""  Wyndham as owning and controlling the ""Baymont®  brand,"" and Club NO as owning and controlling the  Louisville Manor Adult Hotel). In this regard, she alleges  that the Defendant hotels were in actual or apparent  agency relationships with their local ""hotels offering  public lodging services in the hotel."" Id. at 16 ¶ 54(f), 21- 22 ¶ 55(e), 26 ¶ 56(e). Further, she alleges that these  agency relationships were created through the [*12]   companies' ""exercise of an ongoing and systemic right  of control over"" their local hotels through certain actions,  including hosting online bookings on the Defendant  hotels' domains, requiring local hotels to use brand  loyalty programs, setting employee wages, making  employment decisions, advertising for employment,  sharing profits, standardized training methods for  employees, building and maintaining the facility in a  manner specified by the owner, standardized or strict  rules of operation, regular inspection of the facility and  operation by the owner, fixing prices, or other actions  that deprive the local hotels of independence in  business operations. See, e.g., id. Additionally, the Complaint alleges that the Defendant  hotels control the training and policies for their hotels  and that, through their relationships with staff at the  properties at which L.H. was trafficked and with the  hotel guest perpetrator, they ""knowingly benefitted, or  received something of value, from [their] facilitation of,  or participation in, a venture which [they] knew or should  have known to engage in sex trafficking."" Id. at 3 ¶  11(d), 5 ¶ 12(e), 6 ¶ 13(c). The Complaint describes the  percentage of revenue [*13]  the Defendant hotels  obtained from their properties and alleges that the  Defendant hotels have all ""been on notice of repeated  incidences of sex trafficking occurring at their hotels yet  failed to take the necessary action to prevent sex  trafficking and still persist in failing to take the necessary  action to prevent sex trafficking at their hotels."" Id. at 15  ¶ 53; see also id. at 4 ¶ 11(e), 5 ¶ 12(f), 6 ¶ 13(d)  (revenue allegations); id. at 18, 23, 27 (alleging the  Defendant hotels failed to take certain actions, including  training their employees in identifying human trafficking,  providing a process for escalating human trafficking  concerns within the organizations, and monitoring usage  of the hotels' Wi-Fi). The Complaint ascribes notice to the Defendant hotels  through various methods, including news stories about  prostitution at local hotels, customer reviews, and, in the  case of Red Roof, corporate policies that require local  hotels and staff to report signs of human trafficking.  See, e.g., id. at 18-27. Additionally, L.H. alleges that the  Defendant hotels: knew, or should have known, that L.H. was being  trafficked because L.H.'s traffickers paid for her  room using cash, refused [*14]  housekeeping  services and/or requested services to dispose of  trash filled with condoms, frequently requested  extra towels and sheets, constantly entertained an  absurd amount of foot traffic from male visitors  every day, and checked in with an underage girl;  behavior that indicated that Defendants' hotels were  being used for an illegal sex trafficking venture. Id. at 34 ¶ 117. Procedurally, the Defendants each filed separate  responsive pleadings or motions to L.H.'s Complaint.  Defendant Club NO filed an Answer [R. 10], and  Defendants Red Roof and Wyndham each filed Motions  to Dismiss [R. 14; R. 20]. The Motions to Dismiss are  fully briefed and ripe for review. II. Legal Standard Red Roof's and Wyndham's Motions to Dismiss are  based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  When ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6),  the Court ""must (1) view the complaint in the light most  favorable to the plaintiff and (2) take all well-pleaded  factual allegations as true."" Tackett v. M & G Polymers,  USA, LLC, 561 F.3d 478, 488 (6th Cir. 2009) (per  curiam). Under Rule 12(b)(6), ""a complaint must contain  sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a  claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'"" Ashcroft v.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d  868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.  544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)).  Relatedly, under Rule 8(a)(2), a complaint must contain  ""a short and plain statement of the claim showing that  the [*15]  pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P.  8(a)(2). ""A pleading that offers labels and conclusions or  a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of  action will not do. Nor does a complaint suffice if it  tenders naked assertions devoid of further factual  enhancement."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (cleaned up). Page 5 of 10 III. Analysis L.H.'s Complaint states that this action has been  brought ""pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act 18 U.S.C. §1595, against the  Defendants who enabled, harbored, held, facilitated,  and financially benefited from a sex trafficking venture in  which L.H. was trafficked for the purpose of commercial  sex, sexually exploited, and brutally victimized in  violation of 18 U.S.C. §1591(a)."" [R. 1, p. 2 ¶ 8]. As an  initial observation, there is little binding precedent to  guide the Court's consideration of L.H.'s TVPRA claims.  See J.M. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., No. 2:22-CV-00672- KJM-JDP, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190054, 2022 WL  10626493, at *1 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 18, 2022) (""[F]ederal  district courts across the country are tackling these suits  and interpreting the TVPRA on a case-by-case basis."").  Similarly, courts take widely different approaches when  deciding whether claims such as those presented in  L.H.'s Complaint can survive a motion to dismiss, even  when  presented  with  substantially  similar  facts.  Compare, e.g., id. with H.G. v. Inter-Cont'l Hotels Corp.,  489 F. Supp. 3d 697, 703-04 (E.D. Mich. 2020). ""The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act,  18 U.S.C. § 1591, prohibits the sex trafficking [*16]  of  children or adults by force, fraud, or coercion."" Doe #1 v.  Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 723 (11th Cir. 2021).  ""In addition to that criminal prohibition, the Act provides  sex-trafficking victims with a civil cause of action against  'the perpetrator (or whoever knowingly benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in violation of  this chapter).'"" Id. (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a)). In this  case, L.H. ""does not allege that Defendants are  perpetrators of sex-trafficking. Rather, she seeks relief  under the beneficiary theory."" C.T. v. Red Roof Inns,  Inc., No. 2:22-CV-834-JES-KCD, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  87727, 2023 WL 3510879, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 11,  2023); see [R. 1, p. 34 ¶ 115 (""Defendants RRI,  Wyndham, and Club NO profited from the sex trafficking  of L.H. and knowingly or negligently aided and engaged  with her traffickers in his sex trafficking venture. The  Defendants leased rooms to L.H.'s traffickers for hours  to days at a time, when they knew, or should have  known, that they were using the hotel room to imprison  L.H. and subject her to repeated exploitation by forcing  her into sexual servitude."")]. ""[T]o state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that the  defendant (1) knowingly benefited (2) from taking part in  a common undertaking [*17]  or enterprise involving risk  and potential profit, (3) that the undertaking or  enterprise violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff, and (4)  that the defendant had constructive or actual knowledge  that the undertaking or enterprise violated the TVPRA  as to the plaintiff."" Doe #1, 21 F.4th at 719; see also,  e.g., G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., ___ F.4th ___, 2023  U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *5 n.5  (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023) (""reorganiz[ing] the most  common summaries of these elements to follow a  logical sequence rather than the sequence of the  phrases in Section 1595""); H.G., 489 F. Supp. 3d at 704  (describing a claim under the financial beneficiary prong  of the TVPRA as having three elements: (1) that the  defendant knowingly benefitted, (2) from participation in  a venture, (3) which the defendant knew or should have  known has engaged in sex trafficking). A plaintiff may satisfy the elements of a TVPRA claim ""in  one of two ways."" H.G., 489 F. Supp. 3d at 704. First,  ""[s]he may show that the defendant's own acts,  omissions, and state of mind establish each element.""  Id. ""Alternatively, she may impute to the defendant the  acts, omissions, and state of mind of an agent of the  defendant."" Id. ""The former is referred to as 'direct  liability' and the latter as 'indirect liability.'"" Id.; see also  J.M., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190054, 2022 WL  10626493, at *3 (describing the former as ""direct  beneficiary liability"" and the latter as ""vicarious  beneficiary [*18]  liability""). A. Direct Beneficiary Liability Claims L.H. first alleges a theory of direct liability against Red  Roof and Wyndham. See, e.g., [R. 1, p. 2 ¶ 7 (""As a  direct and proximate result of Defendants' consistent  refusals to prevent human trafficking on their hotel  properties, L.H. was sex trafficked, sexually exploited,  and victimized repeatedly at the Red Roof Inn®,  Louisville Manor Adult Hotel, and the Baymont Hotel."")].  For this theory, L.H. highlights these Defendant hotels'  training and policies for their hotel properties, their  general knowledge that sex trafficking occurs at their  properties and in the hotel industry, and their  ""demonstrated deeply entrenched apathy to the real risk  of sex trafficking and pervasive willful blindness to the  role"" their local hotels ""play in sex trafficking."" See, e.g.,  id. 8-13 ¶¶ 20-45, 16 ¶ 54(a)-(j), 18-20 ¶ 54(j)-(n), 21 ¶  55(a)-(i). These general allegations are insufficient. As explained by the court in J.M., for a direct liability  claim, a plaintiff must ""connect the dots"" between her  Page 6 of 10 and a franchisor to satisfy the ""participation in a venture""  element and she must allege more than ""general  knowledge of sex trafficking problems in the [*19]  hotel  industry, or even at defendants' franchisee hotels"" for  the knowledge element. See J.M., 2022 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 190054, 2022 WL 10626493, at *4-5. In this  case, L.H.'s allegations are insufficient. Indeed, although  her  factual  allegations  would  sufficiently  allege  circumstances supporting direct liability against the  franchisee hotels or potentially vicarious liability claims  against the Defendant hotels, they do not support a  theory of direct liability against Red Roof or Wyndham. When courts have permitted direct liability claims to  proceed, they were presented with stronger facts  ""connecting the dots"" than those presented here. For  example, in T.P. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, the  plaintiff alleged she was trafficked at various hotel  properties in Columbus, Ohio, from 1993 to 2016. T.P.  v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., No 2:21-CV-04933,  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217315, 2022 WL 17363234, at  *1 (S.D. Ohio Dec. 1, 2022). Additionally, she alleged  behavior that hotel staff should have recognized as  clear signs of her trafficking, that the owner of two local  hotels traded free or discounted rooms to her traffickers  in exchange for sex acts from her, that one of the  properties had been declared a ""public nuisance"" by the  Columbus City Attorney for being a ""haven for  prostitution,"" and that online reviews specifically  referenced several of the local hotels as being full of  drug [*20]  dealers, pimps, and hookers. See id. On  these facts, the Southern District of Ohio found the  plaintiff had plausibly alleged each element of a direct  liability TVPRA claim against the franchisor defendants.  See 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217315, [WL] at *11; see  also M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F.  Supp. 3d 959, 971 (S.D. Ohio 2019) (finding plaintiff  sufficiently  alleged  direct  liability  claims  against  franchisor defendants). In this case, by contrast, the allegations L.H. has  presented do not sufficiently connect the actions of the  Defendant hotels to each element of her TVPRA direct  liability claims. In this regard, both the general  allegations regarding sex trafficking in the hospitality  industry and the specific allegations of L.H.'s own  trafficking fail to plausibly establish a direct liability claim       against either Red Roof or Wyndham. For instance,  although she alleges the Louisville Metro Council was  informed in February 2022 of the high percentage of  calls received by the Louisville Metro Police Department  for incidents occurring at the two Red Roof properties in  this case, those calls were from January 2020 to  January 2021, two to three years after L.H.'s trafficking  is alleged to have occurred in 2018. See [R. 1, p. 25 ¶  55(i)(iii)]. Relatedly, the limited duration of time that  L.H. [*21]  alleges she was held at the Baymont  property does not sufficiently tie Wyndham's own  actions to the elements of her direct liability TVPRA  claim. On this Complaint, the Court finds that L.H. has failed to  plausibly allege that these Defendant hotels' ""own acts,  omissions, and state of mind establish each element.""  H.G., 489 F. Supp. 3d at 704. By way of example, she  has not plausibly alleged that ""the franchisor defendants  directly rented rooms and Wi-Fi to her buyers and sex  traffickers"" or that they ignored internal reports of her  own sex-trafficking. See J.M., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  190054, 2022 WL 10626493, at *4. Therefore, to the  extent L.H. bases her TVPRA claims against Red Roof  and Wyndham on a theory of direct liability, the  Defendant hotels' Motions to Dismiss will be granted.  Still, as will be explained below, her factual allegations  support a theory of vicarious liability, at least as to Red  Roof. B. Vicarious Beneficiary Liability Claims Having disposed of L.H.'s claims against Red Roof and  Wyndham based on a theory of direct liability, the Court  considers her vicarious liability claims against these  Defendant hotels. Here, L.H. ascribes liability to the  Defendant hotels based on their actual or apparent  agency relationships with their local hotels. See  [R. [*22]  1 pp. 16-17, 21-22]. As a preliminary matter, ""[t]here is a split of authority  with respect to whether state common law or federal  common law applies to the question of whether a party  can be held indirectly liable under the TVPRA based on  an agency relationship."" H.G., 489 F. Supp. 3d at 708  n.6. Under Kentucky law, ""[a] franchisor is vicariously  liable for the tortious conduct of the franchisee when it,  in fact, has control or right of control over the daily  operation of the specific aspect of the franchisee's  business that is alleged to have caused the harm."" Papa  John's Int'l., Inc. v. McCoy, 244 S.W.3d 44, 56 (Ky.  2008). And courts, like those in the Ninth Circuit, have  Page 7 of 10 applied federal common law agency principles from the  Restatement (Third) of Agency to TVPRA claims. See  A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., 484 F. Supp. 3d  921, 940 (D. Or. 2020) (""An actual agency relationship  requires (1) a manifestation by the principal that the  agent shall act for him; (2) that the agent has accepted  the undertaking; and (3) that there is an understanding  between the parties that the principal is to be in control  of the undertaking."") (internal quotation marks omitted).  The parties in this case did not brief this split of  authority. Nonetheless, the Court finds that L.H. has plausibly  alleged an agency relationship under both sources of  law. Indeed, the Complaint contains multiple allegations  regarding [*23]  L.H.'s agency theory, including that  franchisor hotels provide their local hotels with brand  recognition, marketing organization, listing in travel  agency  databases,  an  800  number,  revenue  management tools, world-class loyalty programs, and a  website, and that, through their actions, the Defendant  hotels hold out their local hotels ""to the public as  possessing authority to act on [their] behalf."" See [R. 1,  pp. 3-4 ¶ 11, 4-5 ¶ 12, 14 ¶ 48, 15-17 ¶¶ 53-54, 20 ¶  55]. Further, the Complaint included specific allegations  regarding Red Roof's and Wyndham's control over how  their local hotels ""conduct[ed] daily business"" through  various actions, including by setting employee wages,  fixing profits, and making employment decisions. See id.  at 17 ¶ 54(f) , 22 ¶ 55(e). Notably, similar allegations ""have been found sufficient  to support a plausible inference of an agency  relationship"" by other courts. See C.T. v. Red Roof Inns,  Inc., 2:22-CV-834-JES-KCD, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  87727, 2023 WL 3510879, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 11,  2023) (collecting cases); see also J.M., 2022 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 190054, 2022 WL 10626493, at *5 (""Here, J.M.  alleges defendants exercised control over the day-to- day operations of the hotels by hosting online bookings,  setting hotel employee wages, making employment  decisions for the hotels, providing standardized training  methods for hotel employees, and [*24]  fixing hotel  room rent prices. A majority of district courts have found  nearly identical allegations sufficient to plead an agency  relationship.""). But see H.G., 489 F. Supp. 3d at 704-09  (finding plaintiff had ""not plausibly alleged that the  franchisees were agents of Defendants""). Having  concluded that L.H. has plausibly alleged an agency  relationship, the Court will consider the elements of her  vicarious liability claims against Red Roof and  Wyndham. 1. Existence of a Venture Through their Motions, Red Roof and Wyndham  primarily argue that L.H. cannot show their ""participation  in a venture."" See [R. 14, pp. 5-10; R. 20, pp. 4-10]. In  their briefing, Red Roof and Wyndham first ask the  Court to use the definition of ""venture"" found in §  1591(e)(6) (regarding criminal liability), informed by the  RICO statute, for interpreting § 1595(a) (regarding civil  liability). See [R. 14, p. 5; R. 20, pp. 4-5]. However,  courts have routinely rejected imposing definitions from  § 1591 to interpretation of § 1595. See Doe #1, 21 F.4th  at 725 (""But most district courts, like us, have rejected  the idea that a court can transpose the definition of  'participation in a venture' from the criminal section to  the civil cause of action.""). The rejection by other courts of the arguments made  by [*25]  Red Roof and Wyndham in this regard  compels the Court to follow suit. See id. at 724  (interpreting ""participation in a venture"" under § 1595  ""according to its plain meaning"" rather than the phrase  ""participation in a venture"" from § 1591(e)(4)); G.G.,  2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *10  (""We agree with the Eleventh Circuit that we should not  import [§ 1591's] definition into Section 1595.""); C.T.,  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87727, 2023 WL 3510879, at *4  (rejecting argument that definition from § 1591(e)(6)  should apply to § 1595); Doe v. Rickey Patel, LLC, No.  0:20-60683-WPD-CIV, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811,  2020 WL 6121939, at *4 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 30, 2020)  (""[T]he Court is not prepared to impose requirements to  plead a RICO claim onto Plaintiff who is here pleading a  claim for civil liability under the TVPRA.""). Instead, the  Court looks to the plain meaning of the statutory text. In  doing so, the Court observes that other courts have  interpreted ""participation in a venture"" in different ways.  See generally J.M., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190054,  2022 WL 10626493, at *3 (observing that ""district courts  are all over the map on the meaning of ['participation in  a venture']"") (quoting Doe #1, 21 F.4th at 726). In this case, the Court finds it helpful to first consider  whether L.H. has plausibly alleged a ""venture"" before  determining whether she has alleged ""participation"" in  that venture. See G.G., 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031,  2023 WL 4944015, at *5 (""The first element is the  existence of a venture which has engaged in an act in  violation of Section 1591."") (cleaned up). The Seventh  Circuit has explained that ""'venture' under [*26]  Section  1595 need not be 'specifically a sex trafficking venture,""  and that, ""[w]hile a 'venture' can certainly run the gamut  Page 8 of 10 from an isolated act of sex trafficking to an international  sex-trafficking enterprise, it can also be a business  whose primary focus is not on sex trafficking."" 2023 U.S.  App. LEXIS 20031, [WL] at *6. And in Doe #1, the  Eleventh  Circuit  determined  that  the  plaintiffs'  allegations regarding a ""sex trafficking venture"" were  insufficient to state a claim because the plaintiffs had  not ""plausibly alleged that the franchisors took part in  the common undertaking of sex trafficking with hotel  employees, management, owners, and sex traffickers.""  Doe #1, 21 F.4th at 726. However, courts have  distinguished the ""narrow"" holding of Doe #1 and  permitted claims to survive dismissal when plaintiffs  have  alleged  that  ""Defendants  participated  in  commercial ventures to operate hotels that violated the  TVPRA."" See C.T., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87727, 2023  WL 3510879, at *2. On this Complaint, the Court concludes that L.H. has  sufficiently plead a ""venture"" because she substantively  alleges a commercial business venture by the  Defendant hotels that violated the TVPRA. Indeed, the  Complaint highlights the revenues the Defendant hotels  obtained from their properties' operations, ""including a  percentage of the revenue generated [*27]  from the  rate charged for the rooms in which the Plaintiff was sex  trafficked."" [R. 1, pp. 4-5 ¶¶ 11(e), 12(f)]. Additionally,  the Complaint alleges ""[t]he Defendants leased rooms to  L.H.'s traffickers for hours to days at a time, when they  knew, or should have known, that they were using the  hotel room to imprison L.H. and subject her to repeated  exploitation by forcing her into sexual servitude,"" and it  alleges a ""relationship"" by the Defendants with the staff  at the hotel ""properties where L.H. was trafficked and  the hotel guest perpetrator who trafficked her"" at those  properties. Id. at 3 ¶ 11(d), 5 ¶ 12(e), 34 ¶ 115. These  allegations focus on the business nature of the  Defendants' actions and ""plausibly allege that the  venture in which the franchisors participated committed  [crimes prohibited by the TVPRA] against [her]."" Doe #1,  21 F.4th at 725. Although L.H. repeatedly refers to a ""sex trafficking  venture"" in her Complaint, see, e.g., [R. 1, p. 2 ¶ 8], the  Court must view the Complaint in the light most  favorable to her. In doing so, the Court finds that L.H.'s  allegations focus on the nature of the hotels' business  operations, which are sufficient at this stage of the  proceedings to satisfy the ""venture"" [*28]  element. See  generally id. at 34 ¶ 117 (referencing ""behavior that  indicated that Defendants' hotels were being used for an  illegal sex trafficking venture"") (emphasis added). 2. Participation in a Venture Next, the Court must consider whether L.H. has  plausibly alleged participation by Red Roof and  Wyndham in the venture described above. Courts,  again, phrase this element differently, with certain  standards appearing more lenient than others. For  example, the Eleventh Circuit has ""conclude[d] that the  phrase 'participation in a venture' requires that [a  plaintiff] allege that the franchisors took part in a  common undertaking or enterprise involving risk and  potential profit."" Doe #1, 21 F.4th at 725. In M.A., the Southern District of Ohio used a  (potentially) heightened standard and concluded that,  ""[i]n the absence of a direct association, [a] Plaintiff  must allege at least a showing of a continuous business  relationship between the trafficker and the hotels such  that it would appear that the trafficker and the hotels  have established a pattern of conduct or could be said  to have a tacit agreement."" M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at  970. Recently, the Seventh Circuit relied on M.A. in  finding that ""[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, all that is  necessary [*29]  is for a plaintiff to allege such a  'continuous business relationship,' which gives rise to an  inference, drawn in the plaintiff's favor, that the civil  defendant facilitated the venture's success."" See G.G.,  2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *11  (""Where the participant provides assistance, support, or  facilitation to the trafficker through such a 'continuous  business relationship,' a court or jury may infer that the  participant and trafficker have a 'tacit agreement' that is  sufficient for 'participation' under Section 1595."") (citing  M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 970-71; Ricchio v. McLean,  853 F.3d 553, 555 (1st Cir. 2017)). Although ""participation in a venture"" is not clearly  defined by legal precedent, the Court is guided by the  standard announced in M.A. Therefore, the Court  considers whether L.H. has plausibly alleged a  ""continuous business relationship"" or ""tacit agreement""  between the Defendant hotels and her traffickers. At this  point, the Court's consideration of Red Roof's and  Wyndham's Motions to Dismiss diverges. The Court will  address L.H.'s allegations against Wyndham first. Here, the Complaint alleges that L.H. was only at the  Baymont hotel for a period of five hours, that she was  forced to provide commercial sex to three to four johns  during that time, that her traffickers used hotel Wi-Fi to  upload pictures of [*30]  her to advertise her for  commercial sex, that a hotel staff member warned the  Page 9 of 10 party about the smell of cigarette and marijuana smoke,  and that the same staff member returned about twenty  minutes later and directed the party to leave because of  other individuals' complaints about the smell of  marijuana. See [R. 1, pp. 31-32 ¶¶ 86-96]. The limited  duration of L.H.'s time at the Baymont hotel coupled with  the staff member's warning and subsequent and quick  action to direct the party to leave do not show a  continuous business relationship or tacit agreement  between Wyndham and her traffickers. See M.A., 925 F.  Supp. 3d at 970; see also G.G., 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS  20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *11. Accordingly, L.H. has  failed to sufficiently plead that Wyndham ""participated in  a venture"" as required to support her vicarious TVPRA  claim against this company. Wyndham's Motion to  Dismiss will therefore be granted. L.H.'s allegations against Red Roof, however, present a  different story. Here, the Complaint alleges that L.H.'s  traffickers took her to multiple Red Roof hotels for  several days each time. Specifically, she alleges that  she was held at the first Red Roof property by her  traffickers for a ""period of a few days"" and at the second  Red Roof property for ""two to three days,"" [*31]  that her  traffickers chose to return to the second Red Roof  property after being kicked out of other hotels, that one  of her traffickers used the hotel's Wi-Fi connection to  upload pictures of L.H. to advertise her for commercial  sex, that she was forced to provide commercial sex to  dozens of johns at these properties, that the second  Red Roof property was littered with used condoms,  syringes, and tourniquets, and that a housekeeping staff  member at the second property saw her looking pale  and sick but took no action. See [R. 1, pp. 29-30, 32- 40]. The repeated interactions between L.H.'s traffickers  and the two Red Roof properties within the span of  about a month are sufficient, at the pleading stage, to  show a ""continuous business relationship"" between Red  Roof and her traffickers. See M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at  970; G.G., 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL  4944015, at *11. 3. Knowing Benefit The Court must now consider the other elements of  L.H.'s vicarious TVPRA claim against Red Roof. First,  regarding the ""knowing benefit"" element, L.H. has  sufficiently alleged that Red Roof ""knew it was receiving     some value from participating in the alleged venture,""  namely the money from the rented rooms. See Doe #1,  21 F.4th at 724; M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 965 (""M.A. has  alleged  that  Defendants  rented  rooms  to  the  trafficker, [*32]  and therefore benefited financially. This  Court finds that the rental of a room constitutes a  financial benefit from a relationship with the trafficker  sufficient to meet this element of the § 1595(a)  standard.""); see [R. 1, p. 4 ¶ 11(e) (""Upon information  and belief, RRI receives a percentage of the gross room  revenue from the money generated by the operations of  all Red Roof Inn® hotels, including a percentage of the  revenue generated from the rate charged for the rooms  in which the Plaintiff was sex trafficked."")]. 4. Knowledge of Plaintiff's Trafficking Similarly, the Court concludes L.H. has satisfied the final  element regarding whether Red Roof had ""knowledge  that the undertaking or enterprise violated the TVPRA  as to the plaintiff."" Doe #1, 21 F.4th at 719. The  knowledge element is informed by the allegations L.H.  has included in her Complaint suggesting an agency  relationship between Red Roof and its local hotels at  which she was trafficked. See [R. 1, p. 17 ¶ 54(f)]; see  also C.T., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87727, 2023 WL  3510879, at *5 (""For example, Plaintiff alleges facts that  would have put Best Western, through its agency  relationship with the hotel, on notice as to her  trafficking[.]""). In her Complaint, L.H. globally claims that the  Defendants: knew, or should [*33]  have known, that L.H. was  being trafficked because L.H.'s traffickers paid for  her room using cash, refused housekeeping  services and/or requested services to dispose of  trash filled with condoms, frequently requested  extra towels and sheets, constantly entertained an  absurd amount of foot traffic from male visitors  every day, and checked in with an underage girl;  behavior that indicated that Defendants' hotels were  being used for an illegal sex trafficking venture. See [R. 1, p. 34 ¶ 117]. And she provides further  specific facts relating to her repeated stays at the Red  Roof hotels, including: that the number of johns she was  forced to provide commercial sex to would have led to  significant foot traffic to her rooms; that her traffickers  used the local hotel's Wi-Fi connection to upload  pictures to advertise her for commercial sex; that used  condoms, tourniquets, and syringes were strewn  Page 10 of 10 throughout the second Red Roof property, which she  claims are ""indicative of high amounts of illicit drug and  commercial sex activity""; that, at check-in at the second  Red Roof location, towels were pre-ordered for the  room, so hotel housekeeping staff would not need to  enter the room; and that a housekeeping [*34]  staff saw  L.H. looking pale and sick at the second Red Roof  property, but did not inquire as to her condition. Id. at  30-31 ¶¶ 75-85, 32-34 ¶¶ 97-105. Although the Court finds these allegations insufficient to  state a claim of actual knowledge by Red Roof, it  concludes that L.H. has sufficiently plead that Red Roof  should have known about the sex trafficking venture.  M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 968. To parrot the court in  M.A., L.H. has alleged that Red Roof was on notice,  through its local hotels (i.e., its agents), about the  prevalence of sex trafficking generally at its hotels and  failed to take adequate steps to train staff in order to  prevent its occurrence. Id. But more than that, she has  alleged ""facts specific to her own sex trafficking,  including a number of signs she alleges should have  alerted staff to her situation,"" including those just  discussed about the number of johns she was forced to  provide commercial sex to and the conditions of the Red  Roof properties at which she was trafficked. Id. Courts have found similar allegations ""sufficient to  survive a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss,"" and this Court will  as well. See id.; see also C.T., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  87727, 2023 WL 3510879, at *5 (finding allegations  detailing ""many signs of human trafficking and  commercial [*35]  sex activity,"" including ""physical  deterioration, no eye contact, and duration of stay and  bottles of lubricants, boxes of condoms, used condoms  in the trash, excessive requests for towels and linens,  cash payments"" as ""sufficient to show knowledge"").  Because L.H. has sufficiently alleged each element of  her vicarious TVPRA liability claim against Red Roof,  this claim will survive Red Roof's Motion to Dismiss.                   "

"United States v. Bell, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74783","                                   OPINION & ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT  DARRICK BELL'S MOTION IN LIMINE TO ALLOW  EVIDENCE OF GOVERNMENT WITNESSES'  PARTICIPATION IN COMMERCIAL SEX WORK WITH  INDIVIDUALS NOT NAMED IN THE FIRST  SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT (Dkt. 825) Defendants Darrick Dernard Bell and Harold Lashawn  Nero are [*2]  currently on trial for crimes relating to their  alleged roles in sex and drug trafficking conspiracies at  the Victory Inn in Detroit, Michigan. This matter is before  the Court on Bell's motion in limine to allow evidence of  the Government's witnesses' participation in commercial  sex work with individuals who are not named in the first  superseding indictment (Dkt. 825). The Government  filed a response (Dkt. 838), and Bell filed a reply (Dkt.  839). As explained below, Bell's motion calls only for  relief that is derivative of the Court's earlier opinion  addressing the same subject. It is granted as set forth  below. I. BACKGROUND For criminal proceedings involving ""alleged sexual  misconduct,"" like prosecutions of sex trafficking, Federal  Rule of Evidence 412 establishes a general prohibition  against the admission of evidence offered to prove (i)  ""that a victim engaged in other sexual behavior"" or (ii) ""a  victim's sexual predisposition."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(a).  There are limited exceptions to this prohibition. See  Fed. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(A)-(C). In accordance with Rule 412(c)(1), Bell previously  moved the Court to cross-examine the alleged sex  trafficking victims about their participation in other  commercial sex work activities. 3/24/20 Mot. (Dkt. 419).  In his March 2020 motion, Bell [*3]  stated that, based  on his own team's investigation as well as the discovery                  Page 2 of 4 that the Government had provided at that point, ""[t]here  is a strong likelihood that evidence exists that at least  some of these witnesses were employed with other  potential sex traffickers prior to, during the conspiracy,  and after the conspiracy."" (Id. at 5. As for cross- examination of witnesses regarding their commercial  sex activities during the conspiracy, Bell represented  that ""the gist of this cross examination will revolve  around issues pertaining to the witnesses engaging in  prostitution activities with souteneurs who are not . . .  Bell during the time of the alleged conspiracy."" (Id. at 3.  According to Bell, ""[t]his evidence would directly counter  claims that these witnesses had worked with or for . . .  Bell during the conspiracy."" (Id. This evidence would  also give the alleged victims a motive to ""make[] a claim  against . . . Bell with the purpose to protect their actual  souteneur."" 5/18/20 Reply at 3 (Dkt. 468). The  Government opposed Bell's motion (Dkt. 458). The Court determined that ""while evidence regarding  the victims' pre-and post-indictment prostitution is  inadmissible, Bell is permitted to [*4]  question the  victims regarding the extent of their involvement in the  prostitution that is the subject of the indictment."" 5/26/21  Op. at 9 (Dkt. 630) (citing United States v. Haines, 918  F.3d 694, 698 (9th Cir. 2019)). ""Additionally, Bell may  impeach the victims through other permissible means,  such as by questioning the victims about 'their prior drug  use, their possible bias against [Bell], whether they  consented to prostitute for [Bell] during the timeframe  alleged in the indictment, and whether they were  coerced into prostitution or motivated by money.'"" (Id.  (quoting United States v. Lockhart, 844 F.3d 501, 510  (5th Cir. 2016)). Regarding impeachment, the Court  rejected Bell's theory that ""a victim's prior association  with another pimp will demonstrate that she is shielding  that pimp from prosecution by falsely accusing Bell"" as  an ""untenable stretch of logic."" (Id. at 9 (referencing  United States v. Jackson, 627 F. App'x 460, 464 (6th  Cir. 2015)). In his present motion, Bell asks the Court to ""allow the  defense to cross-examine the Government's witnesses  on the issues of whether the complaining witnesses  were actively involved in commercial sex work with  other individuals,"" i.e., individuals other than Bell and his  Co-Defendants  (namely,  the  alleged  victims'  boyfriends), ""during the time periods involved in the  alleged sex trafficking conspiracy."" Mot. [*5]  at 1  (emphasis added). Bell also appears to ask the Court to  permit defense counsel to question one alleged victim,  S.F., about her purported motives to blame Bell: (i) to  protect D.M., her true trafficker, and (ii) because D.M.  was S.F.'s alleged boyfriend and father of her child, and  he ""had issues with Bell"" (the two ""did not like each  other""). (Id. at 4. II. ANALYSIS As a threshold matter, the Government puts forth the  following two theories as to why Bell's motion should be  denied as untimely. First, Bell's motion is really a motion  for reconsideration of the Court's May 26, 2021 opinion.  Resp. at 2. Motions for reconsideration of an opinion  must be filed within 14 days of the opinion. E.D. Mich.  LR 7.1(h). Because Bell filed the motion nearly 11  months after the May 26, 2021 opinion, it is an untimely  motion for reconsideration. Resp. at 2. Second, even if  the motion is not treated as one for reconsideration,  Defendants' motions deadline has long passed, and Bell  has not made the requisite ""good cause"" showing to  consider untimely motions. (Id.; see also Fed. R. Crim.  P. 12(c)(3) (explaining that a court may consider an  untimely motion only if the movant establishes ""good  cause"" for the untimeliness). Bell appears to argue [*6]  that his delay is justified  because he was unaware of evidence suggesting that  the alleged victims of the Victory Inn operation were  trafficked  by  their  own  boyfriends  during  the  conspiracy—rather than Bell or his Co-Defendants— until law enforcement agents testified at trial, and ""it  became clear that these drug dealer boyfriends were  well known to the agents investigating the case."" Mot. at  2. But this argument is belied by Bell's own admission  that he had in his possession before trial discovery  reflecting that a boyfriend of one of the alleged victims  ""was running some sort of commercial sex worker  operation at the Victory Inn"" during the conspiracy. (Id.  at 2-3; see also Reply at 1-2 (arguing that Bell did not  have all Jencks Act material when he filed his March  2020 motion, but acknowledging that he received this  material before trial). Bell's argument is also undercut by  his statement in his March 2020 motion that, based on  his team's investigation and discovery produced by the  Government, he believed there was a ""strong likelihood  that evidence exists that at least some of these  witnesses were employed with other potential sex  traffickers . . . during the conspiracy . . . ."" 3/24/20  Mot. [*7]  at 5.    2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74783, *3 Page 3 of 4 However, the Government's timeliness argument is  misplaced, given that Bell is seeking permission to ask  questions  that  the  Court  has  already  deemed  permissible. Specifically, Bell is seeking a subset of the  relief that he previously sought in March 2020— permission to ""introduce evidence of sex work activities  that took place during the conspiracy."" Mot. at 5  (emphasis added). The Court previously held that ""Bell  is permitted to question the victims regarding the extent  of their involvement in the prostitution that is the subject  of the indictment."" 5/26/21 Op. at 9 (citing Haines, 918  F.3d at 698). Such questions clearly include questions  about whether someone other than Bell committed the  charged sex trafficking crime—i.e., whether someone  like D.M. trafficked the alleged victims at the Victory Inn  during the conspiracy. Just as the Court's May 26, 2021 opinion did, the case  law draws a line between (i) pre-and post-indictment  commercial sex activities and (ii) sex trafficking that is  the subject of the prosecution. See, e.g., Haines, 918  F.3d at 698 (excluding evidence of pre-and post- indictment prostitution but allowing defendant ""to  explore whether the Victims engaged in the prostitution  activities at issue in this case [*8]  . . . with[out] his  assistance"") (punctuation modified); Lockhart, 844 F.3d  at 510 (holding that ""evidence of the victims' pre-and  post-indictment prostitution [was] not relevant to prove  an element necessary to convict [defendants]"" but  permitting cross-examination regarding the alleged sex  trafficking that was the subject of the prosecution). This  distinction derives from the language of Rule 412, which  prohibits evidence offered to prove that a victim  engaged in ""other sexual behavior"" or has a sexual  ""predisposition,"" meaning a tendency to act in a certain  way. Fed. R. Evid. 412(a) (emphasis added); see also  Haines, 918 F.3d at 697 (holding that ""[c]onsistent with  this construction of the Rule, courts have routinely  barred evidence of a sex trafficking victim's other  prostitution activities,"" and citing as support cases in  which courts excluded evidence of pre-and post- indictment prostitution) (emphasis added). Evidence of victims' other sexual behavior or sexual  predisposition, i.e., ""the victims' pre-and post-indictment  acts of prostitution"" would ""be irrelevant to this case as it  does not make more or less probable the fact that      [Defendants] caused their victims to engage in a  commercial sex act during the time period alleged in the  indictment."" Lockhart, 844 F.3d at 510 (punctuation [*9]   modified); see also United States v. Cephus, 684 F.3d  703, 708 (7th Cir. 2012) (finding that prior prostitution  evidence is irrelevant, as ""the fact that [the victim had]  been a prostitute before does not suggest that [the  defendant] didn't beat and threaten her""); United States  v. Elbert, 561 F.3d 771, 777 (8th Cir. 2009) (finding  evidence of the victims' prior prostitution ""would only  prove other people may be guilty of similar offenses of .  . . causing the[] victims to engage in a commercial sex  act""). By contrast, evidence that someone other than  Bell caused the alleged victims to engage in commercial  sex acts at the Victory Inn during the time period alleged  in the second superseding indictment would make it less  probable that Bell committed the charged sex trafficking  acts. Such evidence is not evidence of ""other"" behavior  or a ""predisposition."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(a). Rather, it is  evidence of the exact behavior that is the subject of the  sex trafficking prosecution. The Court's May 26, 2021 opinion and the cases cited  therein also provide an answer to Bell's present request  for permission to expose through cross-examination of  S.F. her alleged motives to inculpate Bell: (i) to protect  D.M., as her true trafficker, or (ii) because D.M., her  purported boyfriend and the father of her child, did not  like Bell. [*10]  Mot. at 4. While Bell cannot question a  victim about her ""prior association with another pimp"" to  ""demonstrate that she is shielding that pimp from  prosecution by falsely accusing Bell,"" 5/26/21 Op. at 9  (referencing Jackson, 627 F. App'x at 464), Bell ""may  impeach the victims through other permissible means,                   2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74783, *7 Page 4 of 4 such as by questioning the victims about 'their possible  bias against [Bell] . . .,'"" id. (quoting Lockhart, 844 F.3d  at 510). The bias theories Bell seeks to advance are  within the scope of cross-examination that the Court  previously authorized. Jackson does not counsel a different result. Jackson  addressed the propriety of barring evidence that victims  had prostituted themselves to pimps other than the  defendant. The defendant asserted that this line of  inquiry was justified because, during the investigation,  the victims had initially denied that the defendant was  their pimp, but then did an ""about-face"" and accused the  defendant of being their pimp. Jackson, 627 F. App'x at  463. The court of appeals rejected the defense  justification that the evidence tended to show that the  victims were trying to protect their real pimp by falsely  accusing the defendant. The court of appeals reasoned  that the ""prototypical loyalty"" of sex workers to their  pimps would explain the ""about-face,"" [*11]  but that  protection of another pimp would not be the ""natural  inference"" from an initial denial that the defendant was  the actual pimp. (Id. Here, there is no victim denial that Bell engaged in the  charged conduct followed by an ""about-face"" that would  be inconsistent with protecting another pimp. Moreover,  there is some basis to believe that alleged victim S.F.  had reason to protect D.M., further distinguishing this  case from Jackson: ""S.F. wanting to protect the father of  her child/boyfriend/roommate from getting in trouble . . .  is run-of-the-mill bias and motive evidence."" Reply at 4.  The Court agrees that D.M.'s alleged status as S.F.'s  boyfriend or the father of her child and the alleged bad  blood between D.M. and Bell come within the rubric of  the ""usual form of bias."" See Jackson, 627 F. App'x at  463. Bell may cross-examine along these lines.                                   "

""This generally involves  a determination of the 'complexity of the factual and  legal issues involved.'"" Lavado, 992 F.2d at 606  (quoting Cookish v. Cunningham, 787 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.  1986)). The Court finds that the complexity of the issues in this  case does not necessitate the appointment of counsel  and a review of the documents filed by Plaintiff in this  case reveals that he is sufficiently articulate and able to  present his case to the Court. Moreover, Plaintiff does  not show how his circumstances are different than other  incarcerated plaintiffs. See, e.g., Stewart v. United  States, No. 2:13-cv-02896-STA-egb, 2017 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 31834, at *1 n.1 (W.D. Tenn. Mar. 7, 2017)  (finding appointed counsel not warranted where the  plaintiff maintain that ""the issues in the case are 'too  complex for him' and that he has 'extremely limited  access to the law library,' is 'mentally ill,' 'does not have  an education,' and has 'a limited knowledge of the law'. .  . . Nothing distinguishes this case from the numerous  other petitions filed by indigent prisoners and Petitioner  has been able to proceed proficiently on his own [*3]  at  all stages of this litigation""); Coates v. Kafczynski, No.  2:05-CV-3, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8641, at *4 (W.D.  Mich. Feb. 22, 2006) (""[T]here is nothing exceptional  concerning [a prisoner's] incarceration or poverty that  extraordinarily debilitates his ability to investigate crucial  facts. These are ordinary and routine impediments  incident to prisoner litigation.""). For these reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that  Page 2 of 6 Plaintiff's motion for the appointment of counsel (DN 4)  is DENIED. II. MOTION TO AMEND COMPLAINT Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1), a party may amend its  pleading once as a matter of course within ""(A) 21 days  after serving it, or (B) if the pleading is one to which a  responsive pleading is required, 21 days after service of  a responsive pleading or 21 days after service of a  motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f), whichever is earlier."" Because this action is before the Court for screening  pursuant to § 1915A and no Defendant has been  served, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff's motion  for leave to amend the complaint (DN 8) is GRANTED.  The Court will screen the complaint and amended  complaint below. III. MOTION TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY The Court next turns to Plaintiff's motion to proceed  anonymously (DN 10). ""As a general matter, a complaint  must state the names of all parties."" Doe v. Porter, 370  F.3d 558, 560 (6th Cir. 2004) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P.  10(a)). ""Under certain circumstances, . [*4]  . . the  district court may allow a plaintiff to proceed under a  pseudonym by granting a protective order."" D.E. v. Doe,  834 F.3d 723, 728 (6th Cir. 2016). ""The burden is on the  Plaintiff to demonstrate that the need for anonymity  substantially outweighs both the presumption that a  party's identity is public information and the risk of  unfairness to the opposing party."" Doe v. Dordoni, No.  1:16-CV-00074, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115475, at *6-7  (W.D. Ky. Aug. 29, 2016). The Sixth Circuit has held: Several  considerations  determine  whether  a  plaintiff's privacy interests substantially outweigh  the presumption of open judicial proceedings. They  include: (1) whether the plaintiffs seeking anonymity  are suing to challenge governmental activity; (2)  whether prosecution of the suit will compel the  plaintiff to disclose information ""of the utmost  intimacy""; (3) whether the litigation compels  plaintiffs to disclose an intention to violate the law,  thereby risking criminal prosecution; and (4)  whether the plaintiffs are children. Porter, 370 F.3d at 560 (quoting Doe v. Stegall, 653  F.2d 180, 185-86 (5th Cir. 1981)). Additionally, courts  ""consider whether the defendants are being forced to  proceed with insufficient information to present their  arguments against the plaintiff's case."" Citizens for a  Strong Ohio v. Marsh, 123 F. App'x 630, 636 (6th Cir.  2005). Plaintiff presents no arguments in support of his motion  to proceed anonymously, but the only potentially  pertinent factor of those [*5]  set forth above is that the  pleadings could be construed as containing information  ""of the utmost intimacy."" The Court finds that this single  factor is not sufficient to allow Plaintiff to proceed  anonymously because it does not outweigh the ""the  strong public policy in favor of public access to judicial  proceedings."" Does v. Shalushi, No. 10-11837, 2010  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77331, at *5 (E.D. Mich. Jul. 30, 2010).  Indeed, ""where a motion to proceed anonymously has  been granted, courts have generally found further  purpose for protecting the plaintiff's identity"" than this  factor alone. K.R.B. v. Elizabethtown Indep. School  Dist., No. 3:17-CV-00605, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  226548, at *3 (W.D. Ky. Dec. 7, 2017) (concluding that  although the plaintiffs allege that they were victims of a  child pornography scheme, since they had ""chosen to  file a civil complaint for [monetary] damages as adults,""  they should be required to identify themselves).  Moreover, to the extent Plaintiff's motion is based upon  a fear of retaliation, the risk must not merely be  hypothetical but based upon real evidence. ""A plaintiff  can support his fear by demonstrating the need for  anonymity to prevent retaliation, the reasonableness of  the plaintiff's fear, the severity of the threatened harm,  and the plaintiff's vulnerability."" Doe v. Snyder, No. 12- 11194, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54492, at *5 (E.D. Mich.  Apr. 18, 2012) (quoting Does v. Shalushi, 2010 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 77331, at *3). Plaintiff's motion contains no  information which speaks to any of these factors. Thus, because [*6]  Plaintiff has failed to show that his  anonymity ""substantially outweighs the presumption of  open judicial proceedings,"" IT IS HEREBY ORDERED  that his motion to proceed anonymously (DN 10) is  DENIED. IV. § 1915 SCREENING A. SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS Plaintiff is incarcerated at the Henderson County  Detention Center. Plaintiff initiated this action by filing an  18-page handwritten complaint (DN 1) and a 14-page  handwritten attachment (DN 1-1). He names as  Defendants MG Freesites, LTD, doing business as  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80842, *3 Page 3 of 6 Pornhub.com, and Mindgeek, USA, Inc. He also lists as  Defendants nine individuals as well as ""John Does"" and  ""Jane Does."" Plaintiff writes as follows in the complaint: 18 U.S.C.S. § 1595 FOSTA, Section 1595(a) Claim Defendants 1) Knowingly benefited financially or by  receiving anything of value 2) from participation in a  venture 3) it knew or should have known engaged  in sex trafficking under section 1991. . . . Also several TORT claims: 1. Negligent Infliction of  Emotional Distress 2. Invasion of Privacy 3. Gang  cyber-stalking and cyber-bullying 4. Assault and  Battery 5. Defamation by Slander and Libel 6.  Gross Negligence 7. Negligent Supervision 8.  Negligent Training 9. Civil Conspiracy Pornhub is in violation of the Trafficking Victims  Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) 18 U.S.C. § 1591 and  1595 based on Pornhub [*7]  knew or was in  reckless disregard of the fact that through  monetization  and  providing,  obtaining  and  maintaining sexual abuse material on its platform.  Should have known that it was benefiting and  supporting of facilitating violation of 1591. Pornhub exposed me [] to various diseases, shock,  pain,  and  suffering,  mental  anguish,  embarrassment, humiliation, brain damage, and  defamation. By allowing a group of sexual sadist to  post thousands of videos of my ex-wife (then  current-fiance []), who also might be going by the  alias [] for Pornhub purposes with hundreds of  different sex partners having unprotected sex. They  posted thousands of videos within a short few  weeks, Oct. 25 - Nov. 19. I first saw videos the day  before Halloween '21. This is going to sound like an episode of the  ""Twilight Zone."" My mind and my heart was preyed  upon as soon as I got out of prison Feb 28th 2021. I  was gang cyber-stalked and bullied from May to  November. If I overdosed from the ketamine they  was slipping me or committed suicide as they  planned for Halloween of '21 this would never had  been known. A lot of the videos should be titled to  humiliate me such as ""Quickie before she goes  home to her BF,"" ""F—king [*8]  my best friend wife!""  I believe she is going by [] because I looked her up  on Truthfinder and it showed she has a sister which  she does not. Also came across a KCash account  receipt that I learned to be associated with  Pornhub. I feel Pornhub is responsible for allowing  so many degrading, humiliating, videos directed to  me to posted of [] obviously being trafficked for sex.  And obviously practicing sexual sadism. Hardly any  of the videos show their faces which [should] have  been a red flag. They would allow the same people  to use different videomaker names, they would post  10-11 videos per videomaker. [] suffers from  several mental disorders such as Borderline  Personality Disorder, BiPolar Disorder, ADHD, and  Depression. I believe she is a pedophile and suffers  from sexual sadism. I don't believe she can control  her sexual urges or fantasies and I believe [certain  individual Defendants] took advantage of her  mental illness and drug addiction. Together they  devised a plan to control my mind, humiliate me,  ruin my life, and force me to commit suicide.  Pornhub should have notified authorities after  seeing her have unprotected sex with so many  different people, not showing their faces [*9]  and  she looks unconscious. Plaintiff claims that these allegations also show that  Defendants violated his rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiff then provides explicit details of the videos he  alleges his ex-wife was in on Pornhub and then names  the Defendants he alleges recorded his ex-wife and ""set  up a lot of her sex encounters."" Plaintiff alleges that  these Defendants provided her drugs in exchange for  sex. He continues: Seeing the love of my life get sexually abused in  every way possible with countless amount of dudes  including most of my friends has been devastating.  Has brought me to my knees, was such a blow to  my brain that it caused me to go into a mental  psychosis. The pain and humiliation did cause to  want to end my life and die. Pornhub failed to take adequate steps to prevent its  occurrence. . . . Pornhub allowed obvious sexual  sadism trafficking. . . . They were held to know  obvious sex trafficking was going one based on  different dudes entering and leaving the room,  amount of towels needs, and they paid in cash.  Pornhub allowed these sadistic predators to use  their platform to allow my ex-wife [] to be trafficked  for sex, spread diseases, and raped from what I  seen along ALONG with torturing [*10]  my mind,  my heart, my emotions, and my spirit. Only GOD  has kept me afloat. Pornhub has structured its website to facilitate sex  trafficking . . . . Pornhub requires verification but  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80842, *6 Page 4 of 6 allows the actors to hide their faces, wear masks  (sadism), edit out potential identifying marks. Allow  the same person to use different videomaker  names. And I also believe allow phone identification  and credentials. In Kentucky, every individual has a universal duty of  care that imposes on each person ""a duty to every  other person to exercise ordinary care in his  activities to prevent foreseeable injury."" []. This  group of sex sadists cause Intentional Infliction of  Emotional Distress. []. I was in what I thought was  monogamous relationships with [] and with []. . . .  This is the most sophisticated pure evil case of  cyber-stalking and cyber-bullying, mind control case  ever imaginable. I will provide events that  happened to drive me crazy, plant seeds, things to  humiliate me, and separately, along with titles and  videomakers on Pornhub. On TikTok and in person,  they would tell stories about a cat or they would  make ""meow"" sounds. Subliminal cat references. I  was  completely  lost  for  a  while.  I  would  stumble [*11]  around and felt like my feet had  bricks on them. Just became aware that these are  effects of Ketamine . . . . Plaintiff next alleges that his ex-fiancee and ex-wife  would ""get together and assassinate him on Roblox."" He  also alleges that they ""clowned"" him on TikTok. He  states that ""unknown to him, [] was a prostitute and  apparently heavy into BDSM."" He states that both  women were ""with the police"" including the Evansville  Sheriff's Department and a ""Fed."" He continues: There are tons of instances that she would be  wearing something on Pornhub just so I would  know it was her. They would rarely show her face  but I know it was her by her long black hair, the title,  the name of the videomaker or the outfits should  would be wearing. Also when I would have sex with  them, they would intentionally try to push their  bodily fluids back onto me. Trying to infect me with  their diseases which I still have been checked for. [Both women] had access to my email and every  other app I had. On TikTok I would [see] the most  depressing suicide promoting videos. They would  also send me clips letting me know what's been  going on the past few months leading up to  Halloween. [] was rubbing my face in her  sadism [*12]  ways, degrading me, humiliating me  and attempting to control my mind. I seen [her]  naked body showing on the reflection of [] (my best  friend) T.V. . . . They would steal my phone, record sex acts, post it  to Pornhub, then try to give it back. . . . There is a [illegible] with a video portraying me to  be a child molester, thief, woman beater, amongst  other things. There are a lot of people involved, to  what extent I don't know. It is hard to investigate  from a jail cell, which they also set up. This is just  the tip of the iceberg of the torture I endured for  better than 6 months I was out. . . . . This group of people potentially going by the name  ""Muatang gang"" devised a deviant plan to belittle,  degrade,  humiliate,  frighten,  infect  me  with  diseases, confuse me, destroy my mind, my  confidence, my trust, but their single plan of action  was to force me to commit suicide. I allege that 1) a single plan consisted 2) the  conspirators shared an objective to deprive me of  my constitutional rights 3) an overact was  committed. . . . . I would guess the damages to my brain is  extensive. The Ketamine that was unknowingly  gave to me on top of the trauma. Seeing the love of  my life in thousands of Pornhub [*13]  videos drove  me into mental psychosis which lasted for weeks. I  would love to get a CT Scan and talk to a psych  doctor. . . . This whole ordeal consumes my mind. Humiliation,  Defamation, Embarrassment, Shock, Pain and  Suffering. I will never trust another soul. I will  always feel like people are talking out me or being  subliminal. Feel like I have to figure riddles out.  Mental Anguish. Loneliness. Depression. Brain  Damage. The attachment to the complaint continues in the same  vein as the complaint with even more explicit sexual  allegations. Plaintiff then alleges that ""this group devised  a plan to have some sort of mind control over me and  they laid out a plan to destroy me and force me to  commit suicide."" In the amended complaint (DN 8), Plaintiff names a car  insurance company as a Defendant, make additional  explicit sexual allegations, and states that he would like  to add the following ""claims"" to this action — torture,  betrayal,  loathsome  disease,  forced  isolation,  outrageous  conduct,  serious  sexual  misconduct,  psychological distress, attempt forced suicide by shame,  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80842, *10 Page 5 of 6 anxiety, indignity, and trauma. B. LEGAL STANDARD Because Plaintiff is proceeding in forma pauperis, the  Court must review [*14]  this action pursuant to 28  U.S.C. § 1915(e). Upon review under § 1915(e), a  district court must dismiss a case at any time if it  determines that the action is frivolous or malicious, fails  to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or  seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune  from such relief. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B); see also  McGore v. Wrigglesworth, 114 F.3d 601, 608 (6th Cir.  1997), overruled on other grounds by Jones v. Bock,  549 U.S. 199, 127 S. Ct. 910, 166 L. Ed. 2d 798 (2007).  In order to survive dismissal for failure to state a claim,  ""a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,  accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is  plausible on its face.'"" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,  678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.  Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). Although this Court recognizes that pro se pleadings are  to be held to a less stringent standard than formal  pleadings drafted by lawyers, Haines v. Kerner, 404  U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S. Ct. 594, 30 L. Ed. 2d 652  (1972); Jourdan v. Jabe, 951 F.2d 108, 110 (6th Cir.  1991), ""[o]ur duty to be 'less stringent' with pro se  complaints does not require us to conjure up unpled  allegations."" McDonald v. Hall, 610 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir.  1979) (citation omitted). And this Court is not required to  create a claim for Plaintiff. Clark v. Nat'l Travelers Life  Ins. Co., 518 F.2d 1167, 1169 (6th Cir. 1975). To  command otherwise would require the Court ""to explore  exhaustively all potential claims of a pro se plaintiff,  [and] would also transform the district court from its  legitimate advisory role to the improper role of an  advocate seeking out the strongest arguments and most  successful strategies for a party."" Beaudett v. City of  Hampton, 775 F.2d 1274, 1278 (4th Cir. 1985). C. ANALYSIS [*15]  1. Federal Anti-Trafficking Statutes Section 1595 of The Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) ""provides trafficking  victims with a private right of action to pursue claims  against perpetrators of trafficking (""direct liability"") or  those who knowingly benefit financially from trafficking  (""beneficiary liability"")."" Doe v. Mindgeek USA Inc., No.  SACV 21-00338-CJC (ADSx), 558 F. Supp. 3d 828,  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176833, at *12 (C.D. Cal. Sept.  3, 2021) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1595). The ""Allow States to  Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act"" of 2018 (FOSTA)  exempts certain provisions of the TRVPA from the  immunity  provided  by  Section  230  of  the  Communications Decency Act which ""affords Interactive  Computer Service Providers broad immunity from  liability for content posted [to] their websites by third  parties."" Id. at *10-12 (citing 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)(A)). Upon consideration, the Court concludes that Plaintiff  has no private cause of action under these statutes  because he does not allege that he was a victim of  human trafficking. See Prunty v. Arnold & Itkin LLP, 753  F. App'x 731, 736-37 (11th Cir. 2018) (""Although 18  U.S.C. § 1595 . . . provides a civil remedy for violations  of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, Brown failed to  allege any facts suggesting that the defendants  subjected him to human trafficking, peonage, or the  like.""); Brown v. City of Phila. Off. of Human Res., 735  F. App'x 55, 56 (3d Cir. 2018) (same). Thus, Plaintiff's claims brought under these statutes will  be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which  relief may be granted. 2. 42 U.S.C. § 1983 Section 1983 creates [*16]  no substantive rights but  merely provides remedies for deprivations of rights  established elsewhere. Flint ex rel. Flint v. Ky. Dep't of  Corr., 270 F.3d 340, 351 (6th Cir. 2001). Two elements  are required to state a claim under § 1983. Gomez v.  Toledo, 446 U.S. 635, 640, 100 S. Ct. 1920, 64 L. Ed.  2d 572 (1980). ""A plaintiff must allege the violation of a  right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United  States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was  committed by a person acting under color of state law.""  West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S. Ct. 2250, 101 L.  Ed. 2d 40 (1988). ""Absent either element, a section  1983 claim will not lie."" Christy v. Randlett, 932 F.2d  502, 504 (6th Cir. 1991). Plaintiff's § 1983 claims must be dismissed for failure to  state a claim upon which relief may be granted because  he has not alleged that any constitutional violation was  committed by a person acting under color of state law. 3. State-Law Claims 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80842, *13 Page 6 of 6 As to Plaintiff's remaining state-law claims, the Court  concludes that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over  them because there is not complete diversity of  citizenship since it is evident from the complaint that  Plaintiff and at least some of the Defendants are citizens  of Kentucky. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332. Further, the Court  declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over  Plaintiff's state-law claims. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).  Thus, Plaintiff's state-law claims will be dismissed  without prejudice.                               "
"C.T. v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233795","                                                                   OPINION & ORDER This matter is before this Court on Plaintiff's [*3]  Motion  for Leave to Appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).  (ECF No. 162). For the following reasons, Plaintiff's  Motion is DENIED. In accord with this Court's February  16, 2021 Opinion and Order (ECF No. 127), this matter  is hereby TRANSFERRED to the Middle District of  Florida. I. BACKGROUND A. Factual Background Page 2 of 8 Plaintiff C.T. alleges she was trafficked for sex from  approximately 2008 to 2010 at Days Inn, Travelodge,  Best Western, La Quinta, and Red Roof Inn properties  in the Fort Myers, Florida area. (ECF No. 65, ¶ 143). At  the relevant time, these hotels were owned, supervised,  or and/or operated by Defendants Red Roof Inns, Inc.  (""Red Roof""), Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, Inc.  (""Wyndham""), Best Western International, Inc. (""BWI""),  La Quinta Holdings, Inc. (""LQH""), La Quinta Franchising,  LLC (""LQF""), and La Quinta Management, LLC (""LQM"").  (Id., ¶¶ 11-14) Plaintiff now seeks to hold these hotels  liable  under  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act (""TVPRA""), 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Plaintiff alleges that these hotel Defendants knew that  sex trafficking occurred frequently on their properties  and failed to prevent it, and that they knew or should  have known of C.T.'s trafficking. Plaintiff points to  behavior that she alleges hotel staff should have  recognized as signs of [*4]  her trafficking: physical  signs including physical deterioration, bruising, and lack  of eye contact, and common indicators of commercial  sex activity. (Id., ¶¶ 148-153). C.T. alleges that these  hotels and their parent companies did not take adequate  measures  to  prevent  human  trafficking  and  demonstrated ""actual and/or constructive knowledge of  the rampant culture of sex trafficking."" (Id., ¶¶ 135,  138(o), 139(l), 140(k), 141(l)). Plaintiff also argues that the Hotel Defendants have  been participating in an industry-wide conspiracy to  respond inadequately to sex trafficking. She alleges that  state and national trade associations, such as  Defendants Ohio Hotel Lodging Association (""OHLA"")  and American Hotel & Lodging Association (""AHLA""),  served as a forum for the alleged co-conspirators to  discuss efforts related to human trafficking and avoiding  compliance with federal trafficking laws. (Id., ¶¶ 55-56,  58). She also alleges that Defendants' employees  exchanged emails related to sex trafficking during the  relevant time period. (Id., ¶ 50). C.T. contends that the  collective failure of Defendants ""to articulate a policy,  process, or procedure that would measure the extent of  the trafficking [*5]  problem at their branded locations"" is  the result of the industry wide conspiracy. (Id., ¶ 62).  She maintains that the Hotel Defendants ""collectively  conspired and declined to implement policies that would  likely have the effect of reducing the billions of dollars in  sex trafficking profits."" (Id., ¶ 63). B. Procedural Background C.T. filed her Complaint against the Hotel Defendants  on December 8, 2019. (ECF No. 1). In early 2020, the  Hotel Defendants filed motions to dismiss the action.  (ECF Nos. 19, 23, 24, 51). C.T. then sought leave to file  an amended complaint, which the Magistrate Judge  granted. (ECF Nos. 54, 64). Plaintiff's Amended  Complaint added conspiracy allegations against the  Hotel Defendants and added OHLA and AHLA as  additional defendants. (ECF No. 65). Subsequently, the  Hotel Defendants and OHLA filed renewed motions to  dismiss the Amended Complaint and alternative Motions  to Transfer. (ECF Nos. 73, 79, 80, 103). On February 16, 2021, this Court issued its Opinion and  Order on the Motions to Dismiss, finding that it did not  have general or specific personal jurisdiction over BWI  and Wyndham, the out-of-state defendants, on the facts  alleged. (ECF No. 127 at 13). In reaching [*6]  its  holding on personal jurisdiction, this Court found that  C.T.  had  not  adequately  alleged  ""conspiracy  jurisdiction.""  (Id.  at  11-13).  Further,  this  Court  determined that the word ""extraterritorial"" in § 1596 of  the TVPRA, the provision Plaintiff argued provided  independent grounds for nationwide service of process  under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(1)(C), served  only to allow Plaintiff to bring suit for conduct occurring  outside the United States. (Id. at 7). Rather than dismiss  BWI and Wyndham as parties to the litigation, this Court  granted their motions to transfer venue to the Middle  District of Florida. (Id. at 13-15). That same day, C.T. filed a Notice of Intent to File for  Reconsideration and/or Motion for Leave to Amend the  Complaint (ECF No. 128), which she subsequently filed  on March 2, 2021 (ECF No. 129). Plaintiff specifically  sought clarification of this Court's previous opinion  insofar as it did not directly address Plaintiff's argument  that the TVPRA provides for nationwide service of  process. (ECF No. 134 at 12). This Court held in  abeyance the transfer of the case while it considered  Plaintiff's Motion. On July 1, 2021, this Court denied  Plaintiff's Motion for Clarification, Reconsideration,  and/or to Amend the Complaint [*7]  and transferred the  case to the Middle District of Florida. (ECF No. 134).  This Court disagreed with Plaintiff's argument that §  1595 of the TVPRA provided for nationwide service of  process, reasoning that such a reading directly  contradicted basic principles of statutory interpretation  because the provision actually provided for a grant of  subject-matter jurisdiction over potential perpetrators of  offenses committed extraterritorially already present in a  U.S. jurisdiction. (Id. at 18). Also, the construction of this  provision of the TVPRA was inapposite with the majority  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233795, *3 Page 3 of 8 of other federal statutes cited in which Congress  specifically provided for nationwide service of process.  (Id. at 20). The case was transferred to the Middle District of  Florida on July 1, 2021. (ECF No. 136). On July 14,  2021, Plaintiff filed a Petition for Interlocutory Appeal  concerning this Court's July 1, 2021 order. (ECF No.  149 at 3). Plaintiff filed a notice with the Middle District  of Florida that she had filed an appeal with the Sixth  Circuit (ECF No. 142), and that court stayed the matter  pending further order and notification that the appeal in  the Sixth Circuit was resolved. (ECF No. 143). On  August 3, 2021, C.T. filed [*8]  a motion for voluntary  dismissal of that appeal, which motion was granted by  the Sixth Circuit. See C.T. v. Red Roof Inns Inc. et al.,  No. 2:19-cv-5384, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132392, 2021  WL 2942483 (S.D. Ohio July 1, 2021), appeal  dismissed, No. 21-3635, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 30758,  2021 WL 4739619 (6th Cir. Aug. 4, 2021). On August 5,  2021, without informing the Middle District of Florida that  the appeal had been dismissed (ECF No. 156 at 4), C.T.  filed a Motion to Change Venue back to the Southern  District of Ohio to allow this Court to consider ""permitting  the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to review the  Nationwide Service of Process issue under the TVPRA.""  (ECF No. 149). On September 30, 2021, the Middle  District of Florida granted Plaintiff's motion to transfer  the case back to the Southern District of Ohio to allow  this Court to consider C.T.'s petition for interlocutory  appeal. (ECF No. 156). The case was transferred on  October 1, 2021. (ECF No. 157). On June 21, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Leave to  Appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) asking this  court to certify for appeal the following question:  ""Whether Section 1596 of the TVPRA authorizes  nationwide service of process."" (ECF No. 162).  Defendants BWI, Red Roof, and Wyndham responded  in opposition and Plaintiff replied. (ECF Nos. 165, 166,  167, 168). Therefore, this matter is ripe for review. II. STANDARD OF REVIEW Interlocutory appeals are generally disfavored [*9]  and  are reserved for ""exceptional cases."" In re City of  Memphis, 293 F.3d 345, 350 (6th Cir. 2002). As  ""[a]ttractive as it may be to refer difficult matters to a  higher court for advance decision, such a course of  action is contrary to our system of jurisprudence."" U.S.  ex rel. Elliott v. Brickman Group Ltd., LLC, 845 F. Supp.  2d 858, 863 (S.D. Ohio 2012) (quoting Alexander v.  Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co., 663 F. Supp. 2d 627,  639 (E.D. Tenn. 2009)). As the Sixth Circuit long has  held, the legislative history of § 1292(b) makes it ""quite  apparent"" that the statute should be ""sparingly applied,""  as it is ""not intended to open the floodgates to a vast  number of appeals from interlocutory orders in ordinary  litigation."" Kraus v. Board of County Comm'rs, 364 F.2d  919, 922 (6th Cir. 1966). A party seeking certification  ""has the burden of showing exceptional circumstances  exist warranting an interlocutory appeal."" Alexander v.  Provident Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 663 F. Supp. 2d 627, 639  (E.D. Tenn. Oct. 16, 2009). Under § 1292(b), this Court may certify an interlocutory  appeal only when three criteria are satisfied: (1) the  ""order involves a controlling question of law""; (2) ""there  is substantial ground for difference of opinion""; and (3)  ""an immediate appeal from the order may materially  advance the ultimate termination of litigation."" 28 U.S.C.  § 1292(b); Cook v. Erie Ins. Co., 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  51694, 2021 WL 1056626, at *2 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 19,  2021). If any of these factors is absent, the certification  cannot  issue.  Additionally,  ""doubts  regarding  appealability should be resolved in favor of finding that  the interlocutory order is not appealable."" In re Nat'l  Prescription Opiate Litig., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  113654, 2020 WL 3547011, at *1 (N.D. Ohio June 30,  2020) (internal quotation omitted). ""[E]ven where the statutory criteria [*10]  are met,"" the  Court still retains ""broad discretion to deny certification.""  In re Transdigm Grp., Inc. Sec.

""Ultimately, allowing certification of an interlocutory  appeal lies within the discretion of the district court.""  Lang v. Crocker Park, LLC, No. 1:09-cv-1412, 2011  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83451, 2011 WL 3297865, at *2 (N.D.  Ohio July 29, 2011) (citing Swint v. Chambers Cnty.  Comm'n, 514 U.S. 35, 47, 115 S. Ct. 1203, 131 L. Ed.  2d 60 (1995)). III. ANALYSIS Plaintiff petitions this Court for permission to ""appeal the  orders denying Plaintiff's Motion to Clarify on Motion to  Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction."" (ECF No. 162).  Specifically, C.T. certifies the following question for  appeal to the Sixth Circuit: Whether 18 U.S.C. § 1596 of the TVPRA  authorizes nationwide service of process and Sixth  Circuit precedent would allow the exercise of  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233795, *7 Page 4 of 8 personal jurisdiction when a federal statute allows  nationwide service of process, and such jurisdiction  does not offend constitutional Due Process. (Id. at 3). As detailed more fully below, Plaintiff's  argument fails to satisfy the three required criteria to  certify a legal question for interlocutory appeal under §  1292(b). A. Controlling Question of Law Movants first must show that their proposed issue for  appeal involves a controlling question of law. To be  controlling, ""an issue need not necessarily terminate an  action,"" but it must be one that ""could materially affect  the outcome of the litigation [*11]  in the district court."" In  re Baker & Getty Fin. Servs., Inc., 954 F. 2d 1169, 1172  n.8 (6th Cir. 1992) (internal quotations omitted). First, Plaintiff argues that this is a question of law  because it does not require factual analysis, but instead  ""interpretation of a federal statute and the scope it  imposes on TVPRA cases across the country."" (ECF  No. 162 at 6). Further, she maintains that the question is  controlling because it would materially affect the  outcome of the litigation in the district court. (Id. (citing  Zeneca Ltd. v. Mylan Pharms., 124 F. 3d 225 (Fed. Cir.  1997) (nonprecedential order) (permitting the appeal of  a certified question concerning district court jurisdiction  in infringement actions based on the filing of an  Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) with the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration under 35 U.S.C. §  271(e)(2)); In re Baker, 954 F. 2d at 1172 (permitting  appeal of a question on whether bankruptcy courts have  jurisdiction to conduct jury trials)). Defendants Red Roof and BWI respond that the legal  questions ""of the type envisioned in § 1292(b) . . .  generally does not include matters within the discretion  of the trial court."" (ECF Nos. 166 at 3 (citing  Montgomery City Bd. of City Comm'rs v. Cardinal  Health, No.18-OP-46326, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  174919, 2021 WL 4198171, at *1 (N.D. Ohio Sept. 15,  2021)); see also 165 at 2 (citing DRFP, LLC. v.  Republica Bolivariana De Venez., 945 F. Supp. 2d 890,  918 (S.D. Ohio 2013)). Further, Defendant BWI argues  that this Court's decision to decline to dismiss BWI and  Wyndham for lack of personal jurisdiction and to transfer  the matter to the Middle [*12]  District of Florida was  entirely unrelated to its analysis of whether the TVPRA  affords Plaintiff nationwide service of process. (ECF  Nos. 165 at 3). Because it is irrelevant to this Court's  ultimate decision, BWI maintains that it cannot be a  controlling question of law. (Id.). Defendants Red Roof  and Wyndham add that a ruling on this question would  not terminate this particular action because the case  can proceed in Florida, and this Court has indicated that  venue is proper there. (ECF Nos. 166 at 4; 167 at 3).  Plaintiff counters that Defendants are mistaken because  the whole basis for this Court's opinion (ECF No. 134)  was to determine the jurisdictional reach of the TVPRA.  (ECF No. 168 at 2). This controlling question, Plaintiff  maintains, could materially affect the outcome of the  litigation in the district court, which is sufficient to meet  the first prong of the interlocutory appeal test. (Id.). Although certification of questions for interlocutory  appeal is meant to occur sparingly, a movant simply  must show that resolution of the issue on appeal would  materially affect the outcome of the litigation in the  district court. In re Baker, 954 F. 2d at 1172 n. 8 (6th  Cir. 1992). Generally, federal courts have adopted the  position [*13]  that ""a question is controlling, even  though its disposition might not lead to reversal on  appeal, if interlocutory reversal might save time for the  district court, and time and expense for the litigants.""  Wright & Miller, § 3930 Criteria for Permissive Appeal,  16 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Juris. § 3930 (3d ed.) (citing  Sokaogon  Gaming  Enterprise  Corp.  v.  Tushie- Montgomery Associates, Inc., 86 F. 3d 656, 658-659  (7th Cir. 1996) (""A question of law may be deemed  'controlling' if its resolution is quite likely to affect the  further course of the litigation, even if not certain to do  so.""); Kuehner v. Dickinson & Co., 84 F. 3d 316, 318- 319 (9th Cir. 1996) (explaining that issues collateral to  the merits can be controlling questions if ""it could cause  the needless expense and delay of litigating an entire  case in a forum that has no power to decide the  matter"")); see also Winnett v. Caterpillar, Inc., 553 F. 3d  1000, 1008 (6th Cir. 2009) (acknowledging that the  circuit court's ruling could save the parties and the court  significant resources because to reverse the district  court would resolve the majority of claims at issue). It is well established that a question of law is controlling  if reversal of the district court's order would terminate  the action. See Bank of N.Y. Mellon v. Wolfe, 2:15-cv- 02662, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29490, 2016 WL 879999,  at *7 (Mar. 8, 2016) (finding that the question of whether  the bank was a creditor did not control the disposition of  the stay motion); Jackson Cnty v. Employees' Ret. Sys.  v. Ghosn, No. 3:18-CV-01368, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  109945, 2021 WL 2400302, at *3 (M.D. Tenn. June 11,  2021) (concluding that the district court's order  addressed a controlling question of law because the  Court would lack personal jurisdiction over one set of  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233795, *10 Page 5 of 8 Plaintiff's [*14]  claims if the circuit court decided  pendent personal jurisdiction did not apply); Phoenix  Process Equip. Co. v. Cap. Equip.& Trading Corp., 250  F. Supp. 3d 296, 304 (W.D. Ken. 2017) (explaining that  personal jurisdiction was a controlling question of law in  the matter because all claims against defendants would  be dismissed if no jurisdiction existed over them); cf. In  re Watson, 309 B.R. 652, 659 (1st Cir. BAP 2004) (""A  question of law controls the outcome of the underlying  case if no alternate theory exists on which the party  could succeed."") On the other hand, findings that a  question is not controlling are generally fact specific.  See e.g., In re Energy Conversion Devices, Inc., 638  B.R. 81, 90 (E.D. Mich. 2022) (explaining that although  standing is generally considered a controlling question  of law, the bankruptcy court did not find, as a matter of  law, that trusts have standing to pursue litigation after  termination of the trust, yet in the present matter, the  terms of the trust at issue gave the trust the authority  and responsibility to pursue adversary proceedings). The question for which Plaintiff seeks certification falls  somewhere on the middle of the aforementioned  spectrum of what does or does not constitute a  controlling question of law. A decision by the Sixth  Circuit that the TVPRA does provide nationwide service  of process would provide Plaintiff the necessary  personal jurisdiction to [*15]  maintain her claims against  Defendant Wyndham and BWI in the Southern District  of Ohio. This outcome weighs in favor of Plaintiff  because the claims against two of the defendants would  not be dismissed for want of personal jurisdiction. As  detailed more fully below, however, a favorable  appellate ruling for Plaintiff does not prevent this case  from being retransferred to Florida for the convenience  of the parties under 28 U.S.C. § 1406. A decision in  either direction, however, would not only not terminate  the action, but would only serve to prolong litigation.  While a ruling that the TVPRA provides for nationwide  service of process may have a large impact on litigation  nationwide, it is unlikely to impact substantively the  outcome of the present litigation which can continue in  another district court. This weighs against Plaintiff.  Because the issue of whether Plaintiff's question is a  controlling question of law is a close one and because  Plaintiff's Motion fails the other two required prongs to  achieve certification, however, this Court declines to find  in favor of either party. B. Substantial Grounds for Difference of Opinion Plaintiff alleges that the question of whether victims  trafficked across [*16]  numerous jurisdictions can file  their case in any federal court in the country is difficult,  novel, and one of first impression in this or any other  circuit. (ECF No. 162 at 7-8). Plaintiff argues that ""[i]n  the absence of guidance from the Sixth Circuit, adult  survivors of sex trafficking will not be able to bring their  case anywhere."" (ECF No. 168 at 3). Plaintiff alleges  that for survivors trafficked all over the country, they  would be required to file suit in each county and state  where they were trafficked which would be difficult and  impractical. (Id.). Additionally, Plaintiff maintains that  Congress intentionally wrote the TVPRA to be broad in  its legislative aims. (ECF No. 162 at 8). Because the  goals of the TVPRA represent a national priority, the  Plaintiff argues addressing this jurisdictional question is  important to avoiding multiple contradictory opinions.  (Id. at 9). Defendants counter that just because this Court  addressed an issue of first impression in its July 1, 2021  ruling (ECF No. 134) ""does nothing to demonstrate a  substantial ground for difference of opinion"" as to the  correctness of that ruling, especially where a movant's  interpretation of the statute contradicts [*17]  the plain  language of the statute's text. (ECF Nos. 165 at 4 (citing  U.S. v. Atlas Lederer Co., 174 F. Supp. 2d 666, 669  (S.D. Ohio 2001); 166 at 5; 167 at 5). Defendant Red  Roof cites this Court's prior opinion for the assertion that  Plaintiff's references to other federal statutes authorizing  nationwide service of process ""only underscore that the  TVPRA does not contain such a provision."" (ECF Nos.  166 at 5 (citing ECF No. 134 at 20-21); 167 at 6).  Therefore,  Defendants  conclude  that  this  Court  foreclosed the argument that ""a substantial difference of  opinion exists for statutory interpretation"" when it  concluded that ""Section 1596 of the TVPRA comports  with a plain, obvious, and rational meaning."" (ECF Nos.  165 at 4; 166 at 6). A difference of opinion is established where: ""(1) the  case is difficult and of first impression; (2) a difference of  opinion exists within the controlling circuit; or (3) the  circuits are split on the issue."" U.S. ex rel. Elliott, 845 F.  Supp. 2d at 866 (quoting In re Regions Morgan Keegan  ERISA Litig., 741 F. Supp. 2d 844, 849 (W.D. Tenn.  2010)). Plaintiff's argument fails to meet any of the three  required prongs. As this Court has previously articulated, whether the  TVPRA confers nationwide service of process is not a  difficult or complex issue but requires standard statutory  interpretation. (ECF No. 134 at 18-20). Section 1596 is  devoid of any reference to the concept of ""service  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233795, *13 Page 6 of 8 of [*18]  process"" let alone nationwide service of  process. (Id. at 18). The provision serves only to provide  court's jurisdiction over offenses in violation of the  TVPRA committed outside of the United States. (Id.).  Even 18 U.S.C. § 1595, which provides the procedural  rules for civil suits under the TVPRA, does not reference  service of process. This Court's interpretation of the  statutory provision at issue is ""in line with the Supreme  Court's maxim that 'the plain, obvious and rational  meaning of a statute is always to be preferred to any  curious, narrow, hidden sense that nothing but the  exigency of a hard case and the ingenuity and study of  an acute and powerful intellect would discover.'"" (ECF  No. 124 at 18-19 (quoting Chandler v. Roudebush, 425  U.S. 840, 848, 96 S. Ct. 1949, 48 L. Ed. 2d 416 (1976)).  Where nationwide service of process has been found to  have  been  authorized,  Congress  uses  plain,  unambiguous language in changing service of process  rules. See, e.g., Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt  Organizations (""RICO""), 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a) (service of  process for most RICO actions or 21 proceedings ""may  be served on any person in any judicial district in which  such person resides, is found, has an agent, or  transacts his affairs""); Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 22 (""Any  suit, action, or proceeding under the antitrust laws  against a corporation may be brought . . . in any district  wherein [*19]  it may be found or transacts business;  and all process in such cases may be served in the  district of which it is an inhabitant, or wherever it may be  found.""); Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. §  78aa (suits ""may be brought in any such district or in the  district wherein the defendant is found or is an  inhabitant or transacts business, and process in such  cases may be served in any other district of which the  defendant is an inhabitant or wherever the defendant  may be found""); Employee Retirement Income Security  Act of 1974 (""ERISA""), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(e)(2) (suits  ""may be brought in the district where the plan is  administered, where the breach took place, or where a  defendant resides or may be found, and process may  be served in any other district where a defendant  resides or may be found""); Children's Online Privacy  Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 6504(e)(2) (in civil actions,  process may be served ""in any district in which the  defendant (A) is an inhabitant; or (B) may be found"").  Unlike in the aforementioned examples, Congress  chose not to add similar language to § 1596 of the  TVPRA. Further, whether this question is an issue of first  impression does not have any bearing on how to apply  the rules of statutory interpretation. Novelty and difficulty  are not synonymous. Finally, there is no conflicting  authority on the issue within the Sixth Circuit or any  other federal circuit. Because [*20]  the weight of  authority favors a standard interpretation of this  provision as not providing for nationwide service of  process, there exist no substantial grounds for  difference of opinion, but instead points to a simple  conclusion of how § 1596 should be interpreted. C. Materially Advance Termination of the Litigation Plaintiff argues that an immediate appeal will save  judicial resources by keeping the case in Ohio because  this Court has experience litigating this issue as similar  TVPRA cases against hotel brands are currently  pending in this district. (ECF No. 162 at 10).  Additionally, Plaintiff maintains that immediate resolution  of this question by the Sixth Circuit would ""provide  greater certainty and predictability as to the boundaries  of the TVPRA for victims of sex trafficking to bring cases  across the country."" (Id. at 11; 168 at 4). Finally, Plaintiff  maintains that resolution of this issue will prevent future  litigation on jurisdictional questions. (ECF Nos. 162 at  11; 168 at 4). Defendant BWI counters Plaintiff's assertion that this  Court has experience in handling TVPRA litigation, by  citing to twenty-nine (29) pending cases over which  District Judge John E. Steel of the Middle [*21]  District  of Florida, who presided over this case upon its transfer  to Florida, currently presides. (ECF No. 165 at 5).  Therefore, Defendant BWI argues, the Middle District of  Florida is just as capable as this Court in advancing and  resolving this particular matter. (Id. at 6). Plaintiff  correctly counters, however, that the twenty-nine cases  represent only two total Plaintiffs who filed civil actions  under the TVPRA against each defendant separately.  (ECF No. 168 at 4 n. 1). Defendant BWI also argues  that a holding that the TVPRA affords nationwide  services of process ""would generate less certainty and  predictability,  as  it  would  effectively  decimate  jurisdictional boundaries."" (ECF No. 165 at 6). All defendants argue that an interlocutory appeal would  not advance the termination of this litigation but would  only serve to prolong the matter. (ECF Nos. 165 at 6-7;  166 at 6-7) Defendants reason that Plaintiff provides no  basis for the assertion that this Court could litigate the  matter more quickly than the Middle District of Florida.  (ECF No. 165 at 7; 166 at 6-7; 167 at 7). Even if Plaintiff  were to receive a favorable ruling on appeal, her case  would not terminate as Plaintiff could [*22]  continue the  litigation in Ohio or Florida, depending on this Court's  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233795, *17 Page 7 of 8 ruling upon remand. (Id.). An interlocutory appeal will ""materially advance litigation  if it will save 'substantial judicial resources and litigant  expense.'"" U.S. ex rel. Elliott, 845 F. Supp. 2d at 871  (quoting City of Memphis, 293 F. 3d at 350). As a result,  an interlocutory appeal is ""more appropriate early in the  proceedings, particularly in protracted and expensive  cases, where failure to resolve a question of law early in  the case could lead to the placement of an enormous  burden on the parties."" In re Regions, 741 F. Supp. 2d  at 849 (quoting Black & Decker, Inc. v. Smith, No. 07- 1201, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63054, 2008 WL 3850825,  at *10 (W.D. Tenn. Aug. 13, 2008). When litigation can  be conducted ""in substantially the same manner  regardless of [the court's] decision, the appeal cannot  be said to materially advance the ultimate termination of  the litigation."" In re City of Memphis, 293 F. 3d at 351  (quoting White v. Nix, 43 F. 3d 374, 377 (8th Cir. 1994)). The third factor—that an immediate appeal may  materially advance the termination of litigation—follows  from the second. Asking the Court of Appeals to weigh  in on an issue for which there is no substantial ground  for disagreement serves to prolong litigation, not to  shorten it. To grant Plaintiff's Motion would likely not act  to advance the termination of the litigation but result in  an extended litigation timeline. Regardless of Sixth  Circuit's ruling on the matter, Plaintiff's [*23]  claims  would remain to be litigated in the same manner as  before, whether in this Court or by the Middle District of  Florida. Therefore, an immediate appeal of this question  would not materially advance the ultimate termination of  the litigation. In fact, under the circumstances present  here, ""an interlocutory appeal is as likely to cause  material delay as it is to cause material advancement of  the termination of the litigation."" Waldon v. Cincinnati  Pub. Sch., 941 F. Supp. 2d 884, 892 (S.D. Ohio Apr. 24,  2013). Accordingly, the more efficient course is to move  the case forward by denying certification of this question  for interlocutory appeal. As Plaintiff has failed to meet any of the three prongs  required to certify a question for interlocutory appeal,  this Court DENIES Plaintiff's Motion. IV. VENUE TRANSFER This Court previously concluded that venue in the  Southern District of Ohio was improper because this  Court does not have personal jurisdiction over  Defendants BWI and Wyndham and Plaintiff's claim  does not meet any other requirements for proper venue  under 28 U.S.C. § 1391. (ECF No. 127 at 13-14).  Instead of dismissing the parties, however, this Court  found that venue transfer was the proper remedy. (Id. at  13). Additionally, this Court concluded that even though  venue in [*24]  the Southern District of Ohio was proper  for Defendant Red Roof, there was a strong interest in  litigating this case where the trafficking events occurred,  including access to evidence and witnesses located in  Florida. (Id. at 14). As a result, this Court concluded that  it would cause unnecessary inconvenience and expense  to both parties to litigate this case in Ohio. (Id. at 15).  This Court ordered that this matter be transferred to the  Middle District of Florida on February 16, 2021,  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1406 which allows ""[t]he district  court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in  the wrong division or district"" to ""dismiss or if it be in the  interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or  division in which it could have been brought."" (Id. at 14). It is well established that ""a transfer under section  1404(a) may not be granted when the district court does  not have personal jurisdiction over defendants."" Jackson  v. L&F Martin Landscape, 421 Fed. App'x 482, 483 (6th  Cir. 2009) (quoting Pittock v. Otis Elevator Co., 8 F. 3d  325, 329 (6th Cir. 1993)). Section 1406 and 28 U.S.C. §  1631—which states that when a court ""finds that there is  a want of jurisdiction,"" it ""shall, if it is in the interest of  justice, transfer such action . . . to any other court in  which the action . . . could have been brought""— however, provide this Court the necessary [*25]   jurisdiction to transfer this matter. See also Jackson,  421 Fed. App'x at 483 (explaining that 28 U.S.C. § 1631  expressly and specifically provides for the transfer of  cases in which the original court finds a ""want of  [personal] jurisdiction""). In evaluating a motion to  transfer venue, a court may consider factors such as  access to proof, witnesses' ability to attend trial,  enforceability  of  any  judgment  rendered,  and  ""prevent[ing] unnecessary waste of time, energy and  money and to protect witnesses and the public interest  against unnecessary inconvenience and expense."" MJR  Int'l, Inc. v. Am. Arbitration Ass'n, No. 2:06-cv-0937,  2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70436, 2007 WL 2781669, at *2  (S.D. Ohio Sept. 24, 2007) (citing Rowe v. Chrysler  Corp., 520 F. Supp 15 (E.D. Mich. 1981)). This Court's analysis of appropriate venue has not  changed. This Court lacks personal jurisdiction over  Defendants BWI and Wyndham because the Southern  District of Ohio lacks personal jurisdiction over both,  meaning venue is improper as neither can be deemed  to reside here. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c)—(d). Although  venue is proper over Defendant Red Roof in the  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233795, *22 Page 8 of 8 Southern District of Ohio, there is a strong interest in  litigating the matter in Florida where C.T. was allegedly  trafficked and evidence and witnesses can be more  easily accessed. Because the Sixth Circuit has held  that, ""[t]he decision of whether to dismiss or transfer is  within the district court's sound discretion,"" this [*26]   Court again exercises its discretion to transfer this  matter to the Middle District of Florida.

"A.D. v. Holistic Health Healing Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32258","                         OPINION AND ORDER This matter comes before the Court on review of  defendant's Amended Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's  Complaint or Motion to Strike (Doc. #15) filed on  December 8, 2022. Plaintiff filed a Response in  Opposition (Doc. #19) on December 31, 2022. I. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a  Complaint must contain a ""short and plain statement of  the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.""  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This obligation ""requires more  than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation  of the elements of a cause of action will not do."" Bell Atl.  Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955,  167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). To survive  dismissal, the factual allegations must be ""plausible""  and ""must be enough to raise a right to relief above the  speculative level."" Id. at 555. See also Edwards v. Prime  Inc., 602 F.3d 1276, 1291 (11th Cir. 2010). This requires  ""more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully- harmed-me accusation."" [*2]  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.  662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009)  (citations omitted). In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court  must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true  and take them in the light most favorable to plaintiff,  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167  L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal conclusions without  adequate factual support are entitled to no assumption  of truth,"" Mamani v. Berzaín, 654 F.3d 1148, 1153 (11th  Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). ""Threadbare recitals of the  elements of a cause of action, supported by mere  conclusory statements, do not suffice."" Iqbal, 556 U.S.  at 678. ""Factual allegations that are merely consistent  with a defendant's liability fall short of being facially  plausible."" Chaparro v. Carnival Corp., 693 F.3d 1333,  1337 (11th Cir. 2012) (citations omitted). Thus, the  Court engages in a two-step approach: ""When there are  well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume  their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly  give rise to an entitlement to relief."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at  679. II. Plaintiff filed the Complaint as a survivor of sex  trafficking pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) against Holistic Health  Healing, Inc. (Holistic) doing business as the Conty's  Motel. Plaintiff alleges that Holistic was involved with  staffing and operation of Conty's location in Naples,  Florida, and Holistic knowingly benefited or received  something of value from its facilitation [*3]  of or  participation in a venture that violated the TVPRA.  Holistic owns and operates the property and manages  Page 2 of 3 the business known as Conty's Motel. Plaintiff was allegedly trafficked in the same room at  Conty's for 10 to 14 days where she was forced to  perform sex acts. When plaintiff checked out, the  employee would check the room and would see the  used condoms, excessive amounts of dirty linens, and  plaintiff being handed an envelope with cash. Plaintiff  alleges defendant profited from the sex trafficking by  leasing a room to her trafficker and receiving a steady  stream of income. In Count One, plaintiff alleges that defendant had a  ""statutory obligation not to benefit financially from a  venture"" that violates the TVPRA and that defendant  ""breached this duty by participating in a venture which  facilitated the harboring and providing of A.D. for the  purposes of commercial sex induced by force, fraud, or  coercion, by their acts, omissions, and commissions.""  (Doc. #1, ¶ 53.) Plaintiff alleges that defendant has  financially benefited by keeping operating costs low,  maintaining loyalty of customers seeking to participate  in the sex trade, and from payments for rooms. (Id., ¶  54.) III. The TVPRA [*4]  is a criminal statute that also provides  a civil remedy to victims of sex trafficking. Section 1591  of the Act imposes criminal liability for sex trafficking,  while section 1595 provides the following civil remedy: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Thus, a sex-trafficking victim may  not only sue a sex-trafficking perpetrator for civil liability  through a private right of action but may also seek to  hold liable ""whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by  receiving anything of value from participation in a  venture which that person knew or should have known  has engaged in an act in violation of [the TVPRA]."" Id. To state a claim under a section 1595(a) beneficiary  theory, Plaintiff must allege facts which permit the Court  to plausibly infer that the defendant ""(1) knowingly  benefited (2) from participating in a venture; (3) that  venture [*5]  violated the TVPRA as to [A.D.]; and (4)  [Defendants] knew or should have known that the  venture violated the TVPRA as to [A.D.]."" Doe v. Red  Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 723 (11th Cir. 2021).  Accordingly, Section 1595(a) requires factual allegations  which permit the Court to plausibly infer that defendant  should have known that Plaintiff was being forced or  coerced to commit commercial sex acts against her will.  See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a), 1595(a). 1. Knowingly Benefited ""'Knowingly  benefits'  means  'an  awareness  or  understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of mind  in which a person has no substantial doubt about the  existence of a fact.' Knowledge, Black's Law Dictionary  (11th ed. 2019). And Section 1595(a) explains that a  defendant may benefit 'financially or by receiving  anything of value.' Accordingly, a plaintiff like [A.D.]  must allege that the defendant knew it was receiving  some value from participating in the alleged venture.""  Doe #1 v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 723-24  (11th Cir. 2021). Plaintiff generically alleges ""Defendant profited from the  sex trafficking of A.D. and knowingly or negligently  aided, enabled, and facilitated the sex trafficking of  A.D."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 38.) Plaintiff alleges that ""Defendant  profited from the sex trafficking of A.D. and knowingly or  negligently aided and participated with A.D.'s trafficker  with his criminal activity."" [*6]  (Id., ¶ 42.) Plaintiff further  alleges: 44. The Defendant all financially benefited from the  sex trafficking of A.D., and other victims like her,  and developed and maintained business models  that attract and foster the commercial sex market  for traffickers and buyers alike. 45. Defendant benefit from the steady stream of  income that sex traffickers bring to their hotel. 46. Defendant financially benefit from their ongoing  reputation for privacy, discretion, and the facilitation  of commercial sex. (Id., ¶¶ 44-46.) The Court finds that plaintiff has  generically alleged a profit, the same profit received  from all room rentals, but no facts are stated as to  Holistic's actual knowledge of sex trafficking on the  premises. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32258, *3 Page 3 of 3 2. Participation in a Venture ""The ordinary meaning of ""venture"" is an undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit"" and ""[t]he  ordinary meaning of participate or participation is to take  part in or share with others in common or in an  association."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Plaintiff alleges that defendant ""actively participated in  this illegal endeavor by knowingly or negligently  providing lodging in which to harbor A.D. while he was  trafficking her."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 41.) This is the only [*7]   allegation of active participation, and no allegations are  made that defendant did so with, or an association with,  the traffickers for a common goal of sex trafficking or to  profit from sex trafficking. The only factual allegation of  a direct interaction is an employee witnessing plaintiff  being handed an envelope. (Doc. #1, ¶ 36.) 3. Knew or Should Have Known Count One alleges that plaintiff is a victim of sex  trafficking within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a),  and that defendant knew or should have known not to  benefit from a venture engaged in violations of 18  U.S.C. § 1591(a). Under Section 1591(a), whoever  knowingly  ""recruits,  entices,  harbors,  transports,  provides, obtains, advertises, maintains, patronizes, or  solicits"" ""by any means a person"" or benefits ""from  participation in a venture which has engaged"" in such  acts knowing that ""means of force, threats of force,  fraud, coercion"" ""will be used to cause the person to  engage in a commercial sex act"" shall be punished. 18  U.S.C. § 1591(a). ""But observing something is not the  same as participating in it."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at  727. Other than observing ""well-known red flags"" such as  payments in cash, a continuous procession of men  entering and leaving A.D.'s room, there are no  allegations that defendant participated in [*8]  a violation  of the TVPRA. In paragraphs 37f and 37g, plaintiff  alleges a ""personal relationship between various hotel  staff and A.D.'s trafficker"" and ""direct employee  encounters with A.D. and her trafficker inside the  Conty's Motel Naples."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 37.) This is the only  reference with no supporting facts as to how, how often,  or when these alleged encounters occurred. IV. Defendant also seeks to strike the allegations in  paragraph one of the Complaint as immaterial and  unsupported. The Court agrees. See A.D. v. Cavalier  Mergersub LP, No. 2:22-CV-095-JES-NPM, 2022 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 169985, 2022 WL 4357989, at *2 (M.D. Fla.  Sept. 20, 2022) (citing Doe v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., Case  No. 1:19-cv-03840-WMR, 2020 WL 1872335, at *5,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67139, at *15 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 13,  2020)). Accordingly, it is now ORDERED: Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint or  Motion to Strike (Doc. #15) is GRANTED. The motion to  dismiss is granted and the Complaint is dismissed  without prejudice to filing an Amended Complaint  within FOURTEEN (14) DAYS of this Opinion and  Order. The motion to strike is also granted to the extent  that the Amended Complaint should omit paragraph  one. DONE AND ORDERED at Fort Myers, Florida, this 27th  day of February 2023. /s/ John E.

"United States v. Dexter, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111","                                              ORDER SUSAN RICHARD NELSON, United States District  Judge This matter is before the Court on Defendant Charles  William Dexter, III's Objection [Doc. No. 98] to United  States Magistrate Judge Becky Thorson's June 6, 2022  Report and Recommendation (""R&R"") [Doc. No. 96]. In  the R&R, Magistrate Judge Thorson recommends that  Dexter's Motion to Dismiss for Selective, Discriminatory,  Vindictive Prosecution [Doc. No. 44], Second Motion to  Dismiss for Vindictive Prosecution [Doc. No. 65], and  Motion to Suppress Evidence Obtained as a Result of  Searches and Seizure and for a Franks Hearing [Doc.  No. 39] be denied. For the reasons set forth below, the  Court overrules Dexter's Objection, adopts the R&R in  full, and DENIES Dexter's motions. I. BACKGROUND The factual background of this case is more fully set  forth in the R&R, which the Court incorporates by  reference. (R&R [Doc. No 96] at 2-15.) Dexter is  charged with Sex Trafficking of a Minor, Sex Trafficking  by Force, [*2]  Fraud, and Coercion, and Use of  Interstate Facility To Promote Unlawful Activity in  violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 1594(a), and 1952(a)(3).  (Superseding Indictment [Doc. No. 58] at 1-4.) Dexter moves for a hearing pursuant to Franks v.  Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d  667 (1978), arguing that five search warrant affidavits  for search warrants executed by the Government  contained deliberate falsehoods or averments in  reckless disregard for the truth. (Def.'s Mot to Suppress  [Doc. No. 39] at 2-3.) Dexter further contends that  evidence obtained during the execution of all five  Page 2 of 9 warrants should be suppressed because the affidavits  supporting the warrants failed to establish probable  cause. (Id.; Def.'s Supp. Mem. Mot. to Suppress [Doc.  No 88] at 1.) Finally, Dexter moves for dismissal of his  case based on selective and vindictive prosecution.  (Mot. Dismiss for Selective, Discriminatory, Vindictive  Prosecution [Doc. No 44] at 5; Mot. Dismiss for  Vindictive Prosecution [Doc. No. 65] at 1-2.) A. The Warrant for the Cadillac On August 14, 2020, Bloomington Police Department  Detective Kristin Boomer obtained a search warrant to  search a 2009 Cadillac. (USA Decl. [Doc. No. 73], Ex. 2  (""Cadillac Warrant"") [Doc. No 74-1].) In the warrant  affidavit, Detective Boomer averred that the [*3]   department received a tip from the United States  Marshal Service that ""an adult male who was a  Registered Predatory Offender was possibly staying at a  Bloomington hotel with a juvenile female."" (Id. at 2.)  Detective  Boomer  summarized  the  department's  investigative efforts to find the juvenile female, including  locating two online advertisements soliciting prostitution,  searching the phone number listed in one of the  advertisements, and responding to that advertisement.  (Id. at 2-3.) While responding to the advertisement,  Detective Boomer averred that officers were told, via  text message, to go to a specific room at a Courtyard  Marriott Hotel in Bloomington, Minnesota. (Id.) Upon  arriving at the hotel, officers found that the room was  unoccupied, but officers observed condoms lying in  plain view. (Id. at 2.) Officers then located two  individuals near the hotel: a 14-year-old girl, MMV, and  a 21-year-old woman, TLRB. (Id. at 3.) Detective Boomer then summarizes a discussion  officers had with MMV in which she explained that she  was ""going to have sex in exchange for money""  because ""Dexter wanted her to."" (Id. at 3.) She also  described her relationship with Dexter, including the fact  that [*4]  she ""had sex with Dexter earlier in the day,""  that Dexter coached her on how to interact with  ""clients,"" and that he drove her to the hotel in a silver  Cadillac. (Id.) MMV also mentioned that a woman  named ""Shonda"" may have created the advertisement  to which the officers responded. (Id.) The warrant  affidavit indicates that MMV was then transported to the  hospital to complete a sexual assault exam. (Id. at 4.) The warrant affidavit also describes a conversation  between officers and TLRB in which TLRB explained  that she was driven to the hotel by a man matching  Dexter's description, and a second woman nicknamed  ""Honey,"" for purposes of having sex for money. (Id. at 3- 4.) Detective Boomer than averred that officers located and  impounded an unoccupied Cadillac registered to Dexter  in the Marriott parking lot. (Id.) The warrant affidavit  notes that officers observed two boxes of condoms in  the car. (Id.) After Dexter was identified, officers put a ""probable  cause pick up alert for [him.]"" (Id. at 4.) Detective  Boomer explained that officers used Dexter's phone and  officer surveillance to locate Dexter and a woman  named L.G. (Id.) Detective Boomer averred that Dexter  then called the police [*5]  department to locate the  impounded Cadillac, went to retrieve the vehicle at the  police department, and was arrested upon his arrival.  (Id. at 4-5.) B. The Warrant for a DNA Sample On the same day, August 14, 2020, Detective Boomer  obtained a second search warrant to obtain a DNA  Sample from Dexter. (Id., Ex. 1 (""DNA Warrant"") [Doc.  No 74] at 6-7.) In the warrant affidavit, Detective  Boomer restated much of the content contained in the  warrant affidavit to search the Cadillac, but included  some additional observations. Detective Boomer averred that she went to the hospital  to speak with MMV, and that she spoke to a social  worker who confirmed that MMV had a Sexual Assault  Evidence (SAE) Kit completed during a SAE exam. (Id.)  Detective Boomer reviewed hospital paperwork, and  learned that MMV admitted to having sexual relations  with Dexter. (Id.) The warrant affidavit then requests a  DNA sample, so officers could compare it to DNA  evidence and other evidence from the SAE kit collected  from MMV. (Id.) C. Warrant for LG Smartphone On August 15, 2020, Officer Jacob Lucas of the  Bloomington Police Department obtained a third warrant  to search an LG Smartphone found in Dexter's  possession at the [*6]  time of his arrest. (Id., Ex. 3  (""Phone Warrant"") [Doc. No. 74-2] at 1.) The warrant  affidavit for the LG Smartphone contained many of the  same facts recited in the warrant affidavit for the  Cadillac. 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111, *2 Page 3 of 9 Officer Lucas also stated that he knew from his ""training  and experience, [that]electronic devices such as smart  phones are often used by sex traffickers and those  involved in prostitution to set up 'dates' and discuss  other illegal matters."" He averred that the phone may  contain ""information about the sex trafficking and  prostitution along with information about Dexter's  relationship with minor victim MMV."" (Id. at 5.) D. Warrant for Dexter's Residence and Other  Vehicles On August 19, 2020, Detective Boomer obtained a  fourth search warrant for Dexter's residence, and for two  more vehicles. (Id., Ex. 4 (""Vehicle and Residence  Warrant"") [Doc. No. 74-3].) The warrant affidavit for this  fourth search warrant contained many of the same facts  recited in warrant affidavit for the LG Smartphone. Detective Boomer also included details about the arrest  of L.G. and Dexter, and a forensic interview with MMV in  which she detailed multiple sexual assaults that  occurred in various parts of Dexter's home. [*7]  (Id. at  5-6.) Detective Boomer also described evidence  indicating the presence of guns in Dexter's home,  including information provided by Hennepin County  Child  Protection  Investigator  Jodie  Glaspie  who  interviewed Dexter's child, and photos of guns  recovered from Dexter's phone. (Id. at 6.) Additionally,  the warrant affidavit describes a phone call Dexter made  from jail asking another person to go to his home and  retrieve money. (Id. at 7.) Detective Boomer averred that ""[a]n unannounced entry  [wa]s necessary []to prevent the loss, destruction or  removal of the objects of the search and to protect the  safety of the peace officers[]."" (Id.) She knew from  previous investigations that ""individuals who are  engaged in the promotion of prostitution and sexual  assault crimes maintain methods to destroy evidence in  a rapid and expedient manner and they will sometimes  maintain weapons for their protection and the protection  of the women engaged in the prostitution."" (Id.) Further,  she averred that an unannounced entry would allow  officers to maintain an ""element of surprise"" that would  ""preserve officer safety but also the safety of other  citizens in the neighborhood and any suspects in  the [*8]  residence."" (Id.) E. Warrant for Cell Phone Records On August 24, 2020, Detective Boomer obtained a fifth  search warrant for records and data connected to two T- Mobile phone numbers associated with L.G. and  Defendant. (Id., Ex. 5, (""T-Mobile Phones Warrant"")  [Doc. No. 74-4].) The warrant affidavit for this fifth  warrant contained many of the same facts recited in the  warrant affidavit for the Cadillac. Detective Boomer also  noted that Dexter denied ever being at the Courtyard  Marriott. Detective Boomer further noted that the cell  phone data stored by T-Mobile would ""assist in  determining the location and activities of"" Dexter. (Id. at  5.) F. Indictment and Superseding Indictment On February 18, 2021, Dexter, was indicted on one  count of sex trafficking a minor. On March 20, 2022, a  Superseding Indictment charged two additional counts:  (1) sex trafficking by force, fraud, and coercion and (2)  use of an interstate facility to promote unlawful activity.  (Indictment [Doc. No. 3] at 1; Superseding Indictment at  1-4.) Dexter was offered a plea deal prior to the  Government obtaining the Superseding Indictment. (See  Gov. Mot. Frye/Lafler Hr'g [Doc. No. 51] at 2.) G. Magistrate Judge Thorson's Report [*9]  and  Recommendation The magistrate judge first found that a Franks hearing is  not warranted, as Dexter failed to make ""a substantial  preliminary showing that the affiants made intentional or  reckless false statements or that the warrant affidavit,  with  the  at-issue  statement  omitted,  would  be  insufficient to support a finding of probable cause.""  (R&R at 21.) Second, she found that the warrants at  issue were all supported by probable cause, and that,  even if not, the Leon good faith exception would apply.  (R&R at 22-29.) Finally, she found that Dexter's  allegations of selective and vindictive prosecution are  not supported by the record. (Id. at 31-36.) H. Dexter's Objection Dexter raises specific objections to: (1) the magistrate  judge's reference to TLRB as a victim; (2) her  recommendation that a Franks hearing be denied; and  (3) her finding that the warrants for the Cadillac and his  residence were supported by probable cause. (Obj.  [Doc. No. 98] at 1-4.) He also raises objections to her  denial of his motions to dismiss his claims for vindictive  and selective prosecution. (Obj. at 4-9.) 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111, *6 Page 4 of 9 II. DISCUSSION A. Standard of Review The district court reviews de novo those portions of the  R&R to which a specific [*10]  objection is made and  ""may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the  findings or recommendations made by the magistrate  judge."" 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); accord D. Minn. L.R.  72.2(b). B. Magistrate Judge's Reference to TLRB as a  Victim Dexter takes issue with the magistrate judge's reference  to TLRB as a victim, arguing that the indictment does  not identify her as such. (Obj. at 1.) The Government  responds that victims need not be specifically identified  in an indictment to be referred to as such in a court  order. (Gov. Resp. to Obj. [Doc. No 100] at 2-3, n. 1.)  This reference is neither inappropriate, nor does it  impact the Court's analysis of the Defendant's motions. C. Defendant's Motion for a Franks Hearing Dexter is entitled to a Franks hearing only if he makes  ""a substantial preliminary showing that 'the probable  cause determination relied on an affidavit containing  false statements or omissions made knowingly and  intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth."" '  U.S. v. El-Alamin, 574 F.3d 915, 924-25 (8th Cir. 2009)  (citing United States v. Snyder, 511 F.3d 813, 816 (8th  Cir.)). ""This substantiality requirement is not met lightly  and requires a defendant to offer specific allegations  along with supporting affidavits or similarly reliable  statements."" U.S. v. Mayweather, 993 F.3d 1035, 1043  (8th Cir. 2021), reh'g denied (May 19, 2021) (citing  Snyder, 511 F.3d at 816). Additionally, Dexter  must [*11]  ""show that the alleged false statement or  omission was necessary to the finding of probable  cause."" United States v. Engler, 521 F.3d 965, 969 (8th  Cir. 2008). Each of the warrant affidavits that Dexter challenges  contained information about a tip officers received from  the US Marshal Service ""that an adult male who was a  Registered Predatory Offender was possibly staying at  the Bloomington hotel with a juvenile female."" (See e.g.,  USA Decl., Ex. 2 (""Cadillac Warrant"") at 2.) Dexter does  not suggest that the Bloomington Police Department did  not receive this tip. Instead, Defendant argues that  because the Bloomington Police Department had  access to Dexter's criminal history and could have  confirmed that he was not a predatory offender, this  detail was recklessly or intentionally included in the  warrant affidavit. (Obj. at 2-3.) In response, the  Government argues that Dexter has failed to meet his  substantial burden to warrant a Franks hearing. (Gov.  Resp. to Obj. at 4.) The Court agrees that Dexter has failed to make the  requisite  preliminary  showing  that  the  officers  intentionally or recklessly included a false statement in  the warrant affidavit because Dexter fails to submit any  evidence that the agent acted deliberately or recklessly.  U.S. v. Carpenter, 422 F.3d 738, 745 (8th Cir. 2005)  (finding [*12]   no  evidence  officers  recklessly  or  intentionally omitted from a warrant affidavit the fact that  a state court had suppressed an earlier search, as  Defendant did not demonstrate the omission was  intentional as opposed to negligent). Dexter suggests  Detective Boomer ""had actual knowledge"" that Dexter  was not a registered sexual offender because she had  access to his criminal record. (Def.'s Supp. Mem. Mot.  to Suppress at 3.) However, he provides no evidence ""to  establish that [Detective Boomer] deliberately or  recklessly omitted [this] information in an attempt to  mislead the issuing judicial officer."" Engler, 521 F.3d at  970 (affirming denial of Franks hearing when defendant  had no proof officers acted recklessly or intentionally in  drafting affidavit). At most, the record suggests this  could have been a negligent mistake, ""and unintentional  errors like those involved here are not the type of errors  that require suppression under Franks."" U.S. v. Juneau,  No. 19-cr-274-WMW-KMM, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  251041, 2020 WL 9170452, at *11 n. 12 (D. Minn. Dec.  21, 2020), R&R adopted, No. 19-cr-0274 (WMW/KMM),  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39805, 2021 WL 806368 (D.  Minn. Mar. 3, 2021) (finding no evidence of reckless or  intentional misconduct when an officer erroneously  overstated the criminal history of two individuals in a  warrant affidavit). Even if the Court were to assume that Dexter met his  substantial burden of [*13]  establishing that the agent  intentionally or recklessly included a false statement in  the warrant affidavit, his argument would still fail  because the affidavits established probable cause even  absent the challenged information. Engler, 521 F.3d at  970. The affidavits describe evidence that Dexter drove  an underaged girl to a hotel, that he sexually assaulted  the girl, and that he was involved in the sex trafficking of  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111, *9 Page 5 of 9 a minor. After an independent de novo review of the  files, records and proceedings in the above-entitled  matter, the Court finds that the affidavits at issue fully  support probable cause, even without the challenged  information. In light of the above, the Court denies Defendant's  motion for a Franks hearing. D. Probable Cause: Four-Corner Review of the  Search Warrant Affidavits The Fourth Amendment requires probable cause to be  shown before a search warrant is authorized. U.S.  Const. amend. IV; United States v. Williams, 477 F.3d  554, 557 (8th Cir. 2007). Probable cause exists where  there is a ""fair probability that contraband or evidence of  a crime will be found in a particular place given the  circumstances set forth in the affidavit."" United States. v.  Tellez, 217 F.3d 547, 549 (8th Cir. 2000). When the issuing judge relies solely upon a supporting  affidavit to issue the search warrant, ""only that  information which is found within the four corners  of [*14]  the affidavit may be considered in determining  the existence of probable cause."" United States v.  O'Dell, 766 F.3d 870, 874 (8th Cir. 2014). Judges  issuing  search  warrants  may  ""draw  reasonable  inferences from the totality of the circumstances"" when  reading a warrant application to determine whether  probable cause exists. United States v. Keele, 589 F.3d  940, 944 (8th Cir. 2009). Reviewing courts afford ""great  deference"" to the issuing judge's ""initial, on-the-scene  determination  that  probable  cause  has  been  established."" United States v. Colbert, 605 F.3d 573,  576 (8th Cir. 2010). As long as the issuing judge had a  ""substantial basis"" for determining that the search would  ""uncover evidence of wrongdoing,"" the Court must  uphold the probable cause determination. United States  v. Horn, 187 F.3d 781, 785 (8th Cir. 1999). Probable  cause ""does not require evidence sufficient to support a  conviction, nor even evidence demonstrating that it is  more likely than not that the suspect committed a  crime."" U.S. v. Miller, 11 F.4th 944, 953 (8th Cir. 2021),  cert. denied, 21-7753, 142 S. Ct. 2796, 2022 WL  1914258 (June 6, 2022) (citing United States v.  Donnelly, 475 F.3d 946, 954 (8th Cir. 2007)). 1. Probable Cause for Search of 2009 Cadillac Dexter contends that there was no nexus established  between the alleged crime and the Cadillac, and he  argues that the magistrate judge's probable cause  determination erroneously relied on the tip from the  informant, and the two boxes of condoms located in  plain sight in the Cadillac. (Obj. at 5.) The Court finds that the search warrant affidavit  established [*15]  a sufficient nexus between the place  to be searched and the evidence of a crime. The  affidavit linked Dexter to suspected sex-trafficking and  sexual assault through officer observations, text  messages, and interviews with MMV and TLRB, (USA  Decl., Ex. 2 (""Cadillac Warrant"") at 3-4), and linked  Dexter to the Cadillac through the same interviews, as  well as through a public record search and a phone call  from Dexter asking after the vehicle. (Id. at 3-5.) Officers  were able to link the Cadillac to the alleged crimes  through the interviews with MMV and TLRB, as both  victims explained that they were driven to the hotel by a  man matching Dexter's description, in a Cadillac  matching the description of the vehicle that was subject  to the warrant. (Id. at 3.) Further, Officers were able to  see two boxes of condoms in plain sight in the vehicle.  (Id. at 4.) The Court notes that ""[w]hether probable cause exists to  issue a search warrant is a commonsense, practical  question  to  be  judged  from  the  totality-of-the- circumstances."" Donnelly, 475 F.3d at 954 (cleaned up)  (citation omitted). When considered together, the facts  set forth in the warrant affidavit demonstrate a ""fair  probability"" that evidence of Defendant's criminal [*16]   activity would be found in the Cadillac. Tellez, 217 F.3d  at 549. Thus, the information in the affidavit established  the requisite nexus between the Cadillac and the  alleged crime. 2. Probable Cause Existed for Search of Dexter's  Residence and Two Vehicles Dexter contends that any link between his residence  and the alleged sexual assault and sex trafficking was  highly attenuated, and that the search warrant affidavit  failed to state with any specificity ""why any of the items  sought would be in the residence at the time the warrant  was sought."" (Obj. at 6.) The Court agrees with the magistrate judge that the  affidavit in question contained sufficient detail to  establish a nexus between Dexter's residence and the  alleged crime. In the affidavit, Detective Boomer averred  that MMV described multiple sexual assaults in the  residence, and the use of multiple cars to drive her to  meet clients. (USA Decl., Ex. 4 (""Vehicle and Residence  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111, *13 Page 6 of 9 Warrant"") at 6.) These facts indicate a ""fair probability""  that evidence of Defendant's alleged criminal activity  would be found in his home and other vehicles. Tellez,  217 F.3d at 549. Additionally, the officer explained that guns are  frequently kept by individuals involved in sex trafficking  as a form of [*17]  protection for themselves and the  women they are trafficking. (Id. at 7.) The affidavit  described pictures of guns found on Dexter's phone,  and an interview with his daughter in which she  described finding a gun in a pillowcase. (Id. at 6-7.)  Because the warrant established probable cause that  Nelson unlawfully possessed firearms, probable cause  existed to search his residence for firearms, as people  ""generally keep [firearms] at home or on their persons.""  United States v. Cowling, 648 F.3d 690, 696 (8th Cir.  2011). 3. Probable Cause for Warrants for DNA, Cell  Phones, and Cell Phone Data Dexter does not assert any specific objection to the  magistrate judge's analysis of probable cause for the  warrant affidavit for Dexter's DNA. After an independent  de novo review of the files, records and proceedings in  the above-entitled matter, the Court finds that the  search warrant for Dexter's DNA was supported by  probable cause. Dexter also did not assert any specific objections to the  magistrate judge's analysis of probable cause for the  warrant affidavits for the searches of Dexter's cell phone  and for the cell data stored by T-Mobile. After an  independent de novo review of the files, records and  proceedings in the above-entitled matter, the Court  finds [*18]  that there was probable cause for those  searches. E. Good-Faith Exception Moreover, even if probable cause did not exist, the  good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule would  apply here. Although evidence obtained in violation of  the Fourth Amendment must generally be excluded, if  officers obtained the evidence pursuant to a warrant and  reasonably relied on the issuing judge's probable cause  determination, the disputed evidence will be admitted.  United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 906, 104 S. Ct.  3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984); United States v.  Hudspeth, 525 F.3d 667, 676 (8th Cir. 2008). ""[T]he fact that a neutral [judge] has issued a warrant is  the clearest indication that the officers acted in an  objectively reasonable manner, or in objective good  faith."" Messerschmidt v. Millender, 565 U.S. 535, 546,  132 S. Ct. 1235, 182 L. Ed. 2d 47 (2012) (internal  quotation omitted). There is no evidence here to  suggest that the officers' reliance on the warrants was  unreasonable or not in good faith. Accordingly, even if  probable cause was lacking with respect to the search  warrant affidavits, the evidence is admissible under the  good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule. F. No-Knock Warrant Dexter maintains that the no-knock warrant executed at  his residence violated his Fourth Amendment rights.  (Obj. at 6.) The Eighth Circuit has held that the  requirements for a valid search warrant under the  Fourth  Amendment  incorporate  the  common-law  requirement that police [*19]  officers entering a dwelling  must ""knock and announce"" their presence and purpose  before attempting forcible entry. Doran v. Eckold, 409  F.3d 958, 962-63 (8th Cir. 2005) (citing Wilson v.  Arkansas, 514 U.S. 927, 929, 115 S. Ct. 1914, 131 L.  Ed. 2d 976 (1995)); Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U.S.  385, 387, 117 S. Ct. 1416, 137 L. Ed. 2d 615 (1997).  However, the Fourth Amendment does not forbid all no- knock searches, ""[r]ather, it requires that searching  officers justify dispensing with the knock-and-announce  requirement."" U.S. v. Scroggins, 361 F.3d 1075, 1081  (8th Cir. 2004) (analyzing whether a no-knock warrant  was properly issued and executed). The showing that officers must make to obtain a no- knock warrant ""is the same showing they must make to  justify their own decision to dispense with the knock- and-announce requirement. Only the timing differs."" Id.  at 1082. A no-knock entry is justified if officers ""show  they had a reasonable suspicion that knocking and  announcing  their  presence  under  the  particular  circumstances would threaten officer safety, be futile, or  inhibit the investigation of the crime."" Id. Thus, when ""a  warrant applicant gives reasonable grounds to expect  futility or to suspect that one or another such exigency  already exists or will arise instantly upon knocking, a  magistrate judge is acting within the Constitution to  authorize a 'no-knock' entry."" U.S. v. Banks, 540 U.S.  31, 36 (2003), 124 S. Ct. 521, 157 L. Ed. 2d 343. First, to the extent that Dexter asks the Court to find that  the magistrate judge misapplied Hudson v. Michigan,  547 U.S. 586, 126 S. Ct. 2159, 165 L. Ed. 2d 56 (2006),  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111, *16 Page 7 of 9 his objection [*20]  is overruled. As the magistrate judge  explained, the proper remedy for an improper no-knock  warrant is not to exclude evidence retrieved during the  search. (R&R at 30-31.) Thus, this Court will not  suppress evidence retrieved during the execution of the  no-knock warrant. See also United States v. Gaver, 452  F.3d 1007, 1008 (8th Cir. 2006) (citing Hudson, 547  U.S. at 589-90) (""The exclusionary rule does not apply  to violations of the knock-and-announce requirement of  the Fourth Amendment.""). The Court also notes that the unannounced entry  authorized by the search warrant was appropriate given  information in the affidavit suggesting that there were  likely firearms in Dexter's residence and that others had  access to his residence, and thus those firearms. See  United States v. Stevens, 439 F.3d 983, 988-989 (8th  Cir. 2006) (finding that a no-knock search warrant was  justified based on the presence of a firearm in a  common area of the house as reported by a confidential  informant). Additionally, the affidavit contained sufficient  averments that officers were concerned that evidence  would be destroyed during the execution of the warrant.  (USA Decl., Ex. 4 (""Vehicle and Residence Warrant"") at  9 (""Your affiant knows from previous investigations that  individuals who are engaged in the promotion of  prostitution  and  sexual  assault  crimes  maintain  methods [*21]  to destroy evidence in a rapid and  expedient manner. . . . An unannounced entry presents  a higher likelihood to allow police to gain entry and  control any suspects prior to them having the  opportunity to arm themselves or destroy evidence."").)  See U.S. v. Tyler, 238 F.3d 1036, 1040 (8th Cir. 2001)  (holding a no-knock warrant was appropriate when  officers attested that a defendant was likely to destroy  evidence of his drug crimes). Accordingly, the no-knock  warrant did not violate Dexter's Fourth Amendment  rights. G. There is No Evidence of Vindictive or Selective  Prosecution Dexter objects to the magistrate judge's finding that  there is no evidence of selective or vindictive  prosecution. He alleges that he has established he is  the victim of selective prosecution based on the  disparate treatment of his co-conspirator, L.G. (Obj. at  8-9.) He further contends that the Government sought a  superseding indictment because he refused to sign a  plea agreement, which he argues establishes a  presumption of vindictive prosecution. (Id. at 9.) 1. There is No Evidence to Support a Claim Of  Selective Prosecution A defendant asserting a claim of selective prosecution  must demonstrate: ""[(1)] that he has been singled out for  prosecution while others similarly situated [*22]  have  not been prosecuted for similar conduct and [(2)] that  the government's action in thus singling him out was  based on an impermissible motive such as race,  religion, or the exercise of constitutional rights."" United  States v. Leathers, 354 F.3d 955, 963 (8th Cir. 2004)  (citation omitted). A defendant bears the burden of  proving that the government engaged in selective  prosecution. United States v. Hirsch, 360 F.3d 860, 864  (8th Cir. 2004). This ""evidentiary burden is a heavy  one."" U.S. v. Peterson, 652 F.3d 979, 981 (8th Cir.  2011) (citing Leathers, 354 F.3d at 961). Dexter has failed to show that persons similarly situated  to him were not prosecuted for similar conduct.  ""Defendants  are  similarly  situated  when  their  circumstances present no distinguishable legitimate  prosecutorial factors that might justify making different  prosecutorial decisions with respect to them."" United  States v. Heying, No. 14-cr-30 (JRT/SER), 2014 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 147499, 2014 WL 5286153, at *12 (D. Minn.  Aug. 15, 2014), report and recommendation adopted,  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147799, 2014 WL 5286155, at  *1, 7 (D. Minn. Oct. 15, 2014); see also United States v.  Smith, 231 F.3d 800, 810 (11th Cir. 2000) (holding that  individuals are similarly situated for purposes of a  selective  prosecution  claim  when,  among  other  requirements, they ""committed the same basic crime in  substantially the same manner as the defendant—so  that any prosecution of that individual would have the  same deterrence value and would be related in the  same way to the Government's enforcement priorities  and enforcement plan""). Moreover, the evidence [*23]   against the unprosecuted person must be ""as strong, or  stronger, than that against the defendant."" Smith, 231  F.3d at 810. As the magistrate judge discussed, there are marked  differences between Dexter's conduct here and L.G.'s  involvement. (R&R  at 33 (""[T]here are several  distinguishable legitimate prosecutorial factors that  justify the Government's decision to federally prosecute  Defendant and not L.G., including that, unlike the  Defendant, L.G. did not recruit the victim to perform  commercial sex acts, sexually assault the victim, or  arrange for sexual buyers from which he took half the  proceeds."").) The Court concludes that these issues are  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111, *19 Page 8 of 9 clearly ""distinguishable legitimate prosecutorial factors""  that preclude a finding that L.G. was similarly situated to  Dexter. Heying, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147499, 2014  WL 5286153, at *12. Nor has Dexter demonstrated that prosecutors acted  with discriminatory purpose. A defendant may not  simply assert that gender was a factor in a prosecutor's  decision, instead he must offer ""credible evidence"" of  impermissible motive. See Hirsch, 360 F.3d at 864.  Here, Dexter offers ""no credible evidence"" that gender  played a role in the Government's charging decisions,  Peterson, 652 F.3d at 981, and instead he offers  unsupported speculation and conjecture. Thus, Dexter  has failed to meet [*24]  the second prong. Because  Defendant has not met his burden with respect to either  element of his selective prosecution claim, his claim  fails, and his motion to dismiss based on selective  prosecution is denied. 2. There is No Evidence to Support a Claim Of  Vindictive Prosecution After offering Dexter a plea deal, which he refused, the  government sought a Superseding Indictment, charging  Dexter with two additional Counts: (1) sex trafficking by  force, fraud, and coercion and (2) use of an interstate  facility to promote unlawful activity. (Superseding  Indictment at 1-4.) Dexter contends that the decision to  seek a superseding indictment from the grand jury was  intended to punish him for refusing the plea deal. (Obj.  at 9.) ""Vindictive prosecution occurs when a prosecutor seeks  to punish a defendant solely for exercising a valid legal  right."" United States v. Williams, 793 F.3d 957, 963 (8th  Cir. 2015) (citing Leathers, 354 F.3d at 961). As the  Magistrate Judge noted, the Supreme Court has found  that due process is not violated when a prosecutor  carries out a threat made during plea negotiations to  have the accused reindicted on more serious charges if  he does not plead guilty. Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434  U.S. 357, 365, 98 S. Ct. 663, 54 L. Ed. 2d 604 (1978);  see also United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 102  S. Ct. 2485, 73 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1982) (finding no  presumption of vindictiveness where a defendant faced  additional charges [*25]  after he decided not to plead  guilty). A defendant bears a heavy burden ""to show that the  prosecution was vindictive, in light of the discretion  prosecutors are given in performing their duties."" United  States v. Robinson, 809 F.3d 991, 1000 (8th Cir. 2016).  The Court must remain ""mindful of the broad discretion  given to prosecutors in carrying out their duty to enforce  criminal statutes."" Leathers, 354 F.3d at 961 (citing  United States v. Kelley, 152 F.3d 881, 885-86 (8th Cir.  1998)). In the R&R, the magistrate judge properly observed that  charging a defendant with a more serious charge after  he declines to plead guilty to a lesser charge, without  more, does not violate due process. Bordenkircher, 434  U.S. at 363 (""[I]n the ""give-and-take"" of plea bargaining,  there is no such element of punishment or retaliation so  long as the accused is free to accept or reject the  prosecution's offer.""); Goodwin, 457 U.S. at 380 (""[J]ust  as a prosecutor may forgo legitimate charges already  brought in an effort to save the time and expense of  trial, a prosecutor may file additional charges if an initial  expectation that a defendant would plead guilty to lesser  charges proves unfounded."")). Thus, Dexter's claim for  vindictive prosecution fails. In sum, the Court fully agrees with the magistrate judge  that there is no basis to dismiss the Superseding  Indictment on grounds of vindictive prosecution. [*26]   Dexter's motion to dismiss on this basis is therefore  denied.                     "
"J.M. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84861","                                ORDER Defendant Red Roof Inns, Inc., a hotel franchisor,  moves to dismiss plaintiff J.M.'s perpetrator and direct  beneficiary  claims  under  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), 18 U.S.C. §  1595. For the reasons below, the court denies the  motion to dismiss. I. BACKGROUND The court has summarized the history of this case in a  prior order, Prior Order (Oct. 17, 2022), ECF No. 42,  and incorporates that summary by reference in this  order. As relevant here, plaintiff alleges she was [*2]   trafficked at a franchisee hotel over the span of multiple  weeks. See generally Second Am. Compl. (SAC), ECF  No. 52. She claims hotel staff not only witnessed her  being trafficked but helped her trafficker perpetrate the  crime. Id. In its prior order, the court dismissed plaintiff's  direct beneficiary liability claim with leave to amend and  allowed plaintiff to bring a perpetrator liability claim in an  amended complaint. Prior Order (Oct. 17, 2022) at 12. Plaintiff then filed a second amended complaint  containing similar facts and allegations to the first  amended complaint. Compare SAC with First Am.  Compl. (FAC), ECF No. 10. This complaint also includes  new allegations regarding defendant's relationship with  the franchisee hotel. Plaintiff claims defendant was the  primary facilitator in renting rooms at the franchisee  hotel, SAC ¶¶ 66-67; controlled data gathered from  customer Wi-Fi use, id. ¶ 68; monitored public reviews  of the hotel, id. ¶ 76; and mandated hotel employees  report criminal activity to the upper levels of defendant's  management, id. ¶¶ 80-85, 56-64. Defendant moves to  dismiss plaintiff's claims for direct beneficiary and  perpetrator liability. Notice of Mot., ECF No. [*3]  53;  Mot., ECF No. 53-1. The motion is fully briefed, Opp'n, ECF No. 61; Reply,  ECF No. 63, and the court submitted the motion on the  papers, Min. Order, ECF No. 68. II. LEGAL STANDARD A party may move to dismiss for ""failure to state a claim  upon which relief can be granted."" Fed. R. Civ. P.  12(b)(6). The motion may be granted if the complaint  lacks a ""cognizable legal theory"" or if its factual  allegations do not support a cognizable legal theory.  Godecke v. Kinetic Concepts, Inc., 937 F.3d 1201, 1208  (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting Balistreri v. Pacifica Police  Page 2 of 5 Dep't, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988)). The court  assumes all factual allegations are true and construes  ""them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving  party."" Steinle v. City of San Francisco, 919 F.3d 1154,  1160 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting Parks Sch. of Bus., Inc. v.  Symington, 51 F.3d 1480, 1484 (9th Cir. 1995)). If the  complaint's allegations do not ""plausibly give rise to an  entitlement to relief,"" the motion must be granted.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679, 129 S. Ct. 1937,  173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). A complaint need contain only a ""short and plain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief,"" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), not ""detailed  factual allegations,"" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.  544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007).  But  this  rule  demands  more  than  unadorned  accusations; ""sufficient factual matter"" must make the  claim at least plausible. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. In the  same vein, conclusory or formulaic recitations of  elements do not alone suffice. Id. (citing Twombly, 550  U.S. at 555). III. ANALYSIS The TVPRA provides both criminal and civil penalties for  sex trafficking. See 18 U.S.C. § 1591, § 1595. Section  ""1595(a) creates civil liability [*4]  for two categories of  defendants: (1) those who have themselves committed  a criminal offense under § 1591 of the TVPRA (i.e.,  perpetrator liability), and (2) those who are not  themselves subject to criminal liability but who  knowingly benefitted from participation in a venture that  they knew or should have known was committing an  offense under § 1591 of the TVPRA (i.e., beneficiary  liability)."" A.D., v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., No.  19-120, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 250759, 2020 WL  8674205, at *2 (E.D. Va. July 22, 2020) (emphasis  omitted). Plaintiffs may bring either direct or indirect  beneficiary liability claims. See J.C. v. Choice Hotels  Int'l, Inc., No. 20-00155, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073,  2020 WL 6318707, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 28, 2020). This  court previously found plaintiff pleaded a claim for  indirect, or vicarious, beneficiary liability, see Prior Order  (Oct. 17, 2022) at 8, and plaintiff again pleads this claim  again without defendant's objection. Defendant now  moves to dismiss plaintiff's claims for perpetrator and  direct beneficiary liability. A. Perpetrator Liability Civil perpetrator liability under section 1595 imputes  section 1951's elements for criminal liability. See 18  U.S.C. § 1595. Section 1951 imposes criminal sanctions  on ""whoever knowingly"" ""recruits, entices, harbors,  transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains,  patronizes, or solicits by any means a person with  knowledge that ""means of force, threats of force, fraud,  coercion described in subsection (e)(2), or any  combination of such means will be used [*5]  to cause  the person to engage in a commercial sex act."" 18  U.S.C. § 1591(a); see also Noble v. Weinstein, 335 F.  Supp. 3d 504, 514-15 (S.D.N.Y. 2018); Doe v.  FitzGerald, No. 20-10713, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  130445, 2022 WL 2784805, at *3 (C.D. Cal. May 13,  2022). As a result, plaintiffs must allege defendants  knowingly harbored or maintained a person ""with  knowledge that fraud or force would be used to cause  her to engage in a commercial sex act."" Fitzgerald, 2022  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130445, 2022 WL 2784805, at *4;  A.D., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 250759, 2020 WL 8674205,  at *2 n.1 (""Section 1591 imposes an actual knowledge  requirement""). While courts have examined civil  perpetrator liability claims, see, e.g., Fitzgerald, 2022  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130445, 2022 WL 2784805, the court  has not located any other decision interpreting the  statute's perpetrator liability provisions against a  franchisor hotel. Defendant argues plaintiff has not alleged actual  knowledge. ECF No. 55; Reply at 9. Knowledge does  not require ""certainty as to a future act"" but rather ""is a  state of mind in which the knower is familiar with a  pattern of conduct."" United States v. Todd, 627 F.3d  329, 334 (9th Cir. 2010). ""What the statute requires is  that the defendant kn[ew] in the sense of being aware of  an established modus operandi that will in the future  cause a person to engage in prostitution."" Id.; see also  Noble, 335 F. Supp. 3d at 517-18 (""Defendant enticed  Plaintiff with knowledge that means of force or fraud  would be used to cause a commercial sex act to take  place.""). Plaintiff plausibly pleads defendant's actual knowledge  of her trafficking. See Opp'n at 16. Specifically,  plaintiff [*6]  alleges franchisee hotel staff: • Took cash payments from her trafficker, SAC ¶  62;      2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84861, *3 Page 3 of 5 • Rented plaintiff and her trafficker rooms away  from other guests, id. ¶ 58; • Witnessed ""lots of male visitors coming in and out  of [her] room"" and heard ""loud noises of abuse or  other  emergency  [sic]""  including  noises  of  ""beatings, banging, crying, and screaming for help,""  id. ¶¶ 61, 62; • Witnessed ""large numbers of male visitors asking  for [her] and her trafficker at the front desk,"" id. ¶  62; • Instructed ""johns"" to ""hurry up"" as they entered  and left her room, id. ¶ 60; • Noticed ""unusual numbers of used condoms in the  garbage bins"" and signs of drug use in plaintiff's  rooms, id.¶ 62; • Saw ""visible signs of prior physical abuse"" on her  body, id.; and • Saw plaintiff solicit ""johns"" ""from the [hotel] lobby  and the parking lot,"" id. ¶ 59. These allegations make it plausible the franchisee hotel  staff knew plaintiff was being trafficked. Plaintiff says  she resided at the franchisee hotel for weeks at a time,  and the trafficking behavior was ""open and obvious to  anyone working"" there. Id. ¶¶ 37, 64. Moreover, plaintiff's allegations link the franchisee staff's  knowledge to defendant because plaintiff alleges [*7]   defendant required all employees of franchisee hotels to  report potential criminal activity or ""indices of human  trafficking"" to ""[d]efendant['s] corporate executives and  upper-level management."" Id. ¶¶ 80, 83. Based on these  allegations, the court can reasonably conclude—and  plaintiff has ""sufficiently put defendant on notice"" that  she alleges—staff followed this protocol and reported  plaintiff's trafficking to defendant. SAC ¶ 83 (""employees  . . . would have reported suspected red flags of human  trafficking to [d]efendant['s] corporate executives""); see  also Opp'n at 16; Cutera, Inc. v. Lutronic Aesthetics,  Inc., No. 2:20-00235, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153424,  2020 WL 4937129, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 24, 2020).  Taking the allegations in the light most favorable to  plaintiff and drawing reasonable inferences in her favor,  as the court must do at this early stage, plaintiff has pled  the knowledge requirement of perpetrator liability:  defendant was aware of the trafficker's ""modus  operandi,"" including the use of force, and was familiar  with the trafficker's conduct. Todd, 627 F.3d at 334. As  such, the court denies defendant's motion to dismiss  plaintiff's claim based on perpetrator liability. B. Beneficiary Liability To state a direct beneficiary claim under section 1595,  plaintiff must allege defendant (1) knowingly benefitted  (2) ""from participation in [*8]  a venture"" (3) that it ""'knew  or should have known has engaged in'"" trafficking the  plaintiff. J.C., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL  6318707, at *4 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a)). In its prior  order, the court found plaintiff plausibly alleged the first  element of this claim. Prior Order (Oct. 17, 2022) at 5-6.  The court now addresses whether plaintiff sufficiently  alleges the second and third elements. 1. Participation in a Venture In its prior order, this court applied the plain meaning of  ""participation in a venture,"" which requires plaintiffs to  ""allege that the franchisors took part in a common  undertaking or enterprise involving risk and potential  profit."" Doe #1 v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 725  (11th Cir. 2021). The court found plaintiff's complaint  contained  allegations  describing  only  a  general  franchisor-franchisee venture without allegations that  defendant directly participated in the sex-trafficking  venture, but observed plaintiff might be able to cure this  deficiency. Prior Order (Oct 17, 2022) at 7-8. Plaintiff's  operative complaint now specifically alleges defendant's  participation. See SAC ¶¶ 66-67, 80, 83; J.C., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at *7 (""She  therefore plausibly pleads that defendant[] directly  'participated in a venture' by providing lodging to people  it knew or should have known were engaged in her sex  trafficking."" (emphasis [*9]  in original)). As reviewed above, plaintiff alleges defendant required  franchisee hotels to report sex trafficking to upper-level  management, SAC ¶ 80, and hotel employees  ""witnessed the obvious signs of [her] trafficking,"" and  ""would have reported suspected red flags"" to defendant,  id. ¶ 83. Plaintiff plausibly pleads defendant's full  participation because she alleges ""defendant[] w[as] the  primary facilitator or participant in the renting of rooms.""  Id. ¶¶ 66-67. Defendant ""controlled booking and  payment processing for the renting of rooms at [its]  branded  properties""  and  ""required  [its]  branded  properties to use software operated and controlled by [it]  for room booking and reservations"" and credit card  processing. Id. ¶ 67. Defendant also ""fixed the price of  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84861, *6 Page 4 of 5 room rentals"" for its franchisees. Id. Thus, plaintiff  alleges defendant, in controlling the booking and  payment processing, was the entity directly renting  rooms to plaintiff's trafficker and has ""allege[d] at least a  showing of a continuous business relationship between  the trafficker and [defendant] such that it would appear  that the trafficker and [defendant] have established a  pattern of conduct or could be said to have [*10]  a tacit  agreement."" H.H v. G6 Hosp., LLC, No. 2:19-755, 2019  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *4 (S.D.  Ohio Dec. 6, 2019); see also M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels &  Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959, 971 (S.D. Ohio  2019). In response, defendant argues ""observing something is  not the same as participating in it,"" and suggests plaintiff  has not sufficiently alleged active participation in the  venture. See Mot. at 7 (citing Doe #1, 21 F.4th at 727).  It argues, for instance, its ownership of the booking  software is similar to that of the ""simple act of renting a  room to a trafficker without knowledge of his activity,""  Reply at 1-3, and cites cases in which courts have  refused to hold the TVPRA requires hotels to  affirmatively stop trafficking, see id. at 6-7 (collecting  cases). But plaintiff does not just claim defendant failed  to prevent her trafficking. She alleges defendant actively  participated in facilitating the operation, as explained  above. See SAC ¶¶ 66-67, 80-85. Those allegations,  taken in the light most favorable to plaintiff, show it is  plausible defendant actively participated in the operation  through its rental of rooms to her trafficker. See J.C.,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at  *7. Because plaintiff has ""connect[ed] the dots"" between  herself and defendant, she has now met the second  element of her direct beneficiary liability claim. B.M. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., No. 20-00656, 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *5 (N.D.  Cal. July 30, 2020). 2. Knew or Should Have Known Lastly, plaintiff must allege defendant knew, or should  have [*11]  known, about plaintiff's sex-trafficking;  allegations  about  sex  trafficking  generally  are  insufficient. See S.J. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 473 F.  Supp. 3d 147, 154-55 (E.D.N.Y. 2020); J.C., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at *4 (""[Plaintiff]  must allege facts to support that defendants, at the very  least, rented rooms to people they should have known  were engaging in her sex trafficking.""). While plaintiff  had previously pled sufficient facts to the effect the  franchisee hotels knew or should have known plaintiff  was being trafficked, the court found the complaint did  not allege defendant possessed this knowledge. Prior  Order (Oct. 18, 2022) at 8-9. In the amended complaint, plaintiff has added specific  allegations regarding defendant's actual knowledge, as  reviewed in section A above. J.C., 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at *5. These factual  allegations closely mirror those in J.C., in which the  court denied a motion to dismiss a TVPRA direct  beneficiary claim against hotel franchisors because the  plaintiff adequately alleged the defendants knew of the  tracking of her individually, monitored criminal activity at  franchisee hotels and implemented policies for reporting  and tracking sex trafficking, among other details. 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073, [WL] at *6. Plaintiff's allegations that defendant had exclusive  knowledge of certain information, including what  defendant knew, are [*12]  enough to satisfy the ""knew  or should have known"" prong at this stage. See Park v.  Thompson, 851 F.3d 910, 928-29 (9th Cir. 2017)  (""Because many of the relevant facts here are known  only to the defendant, . . . we conclude that [plaintiff] has  pleaded sufficient facts to state a plausible claim . . ."");  Concha v. London, 62 F.3d 1493, 1503 (9th Cir. 1995).  Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the second and third  prong of her direct beneficiary claim. The court denies  defendant's motion to dismiss.                   "
