"In re Flanders, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 37425","Page 3 of 4   Application for Leave to File a Second or Successive Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence, 28 U.S.C. §  2255(h) BY THE PANEL: Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2255(h) and 2244(b)(3)(A), Lavont Flanders, Jr., has filed an application seeking an order  authorizing the district court to consider a second or successive motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his federal  sentence, 28 U.S.C. § 2255. HN1[ ] Such authorization may be granted only if this Court certifies that the second  or successive motion contains a claim involving: (1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient  to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty  of the offense; or (2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that  was previously unavailable. 28 U.S.C. § 2255(h). ""The court of appeals may authorize the filing of a second or successive application [*2]  only  if it determines that the application makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of  this subsection."" Id. § 2244(b)(3)(C); see also Jordan v. Sec'y, Dep't of Corrs., 485 F.3d 1351, 1357-58 (11th Cir.  2007) (explaining that this Court's determination that an applicant has made a prima facie showing that the statutory  criteria have been met is simply a threshold determination). HN2[ ] Section 2244(b)(1) of Title 28, however, provides that ""a claim presented in a second or successive  habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed."" 28  U.S.C. § 2244(b)(1). A ""claim"" remains the same so long as ""[t]he basic thrust or gravamen of [the applicant's] legal  argument is the same."" In re Hill, 715 F.3d 284, 294 (11th Cir. 2013). For applications requesting authorization to  file a second or successive petition, we have consistently applied § 2244(b)(1) to prohibit the filing of a claim that is  the same as one presented in a petitioner's initial habeas petition before the district court. See In re Everett, 797  F.3d 1282, 1291 (11th Cir. 2015); In re Lambrix, 776 F.3d 789, 795-97 (11th Cir. 2015). Moreover, we have denied  an application where a state prisoner sought leave to raise a claim he ""presented in a prior petition,"" albeit with new  supporting evidence. See In re Mills, 101 F.3d 1369 (11th Cir. 1996); see also In re Baptiste, 828 F.3d 1337, 1339- 40 (11th Cir. 2016) (holding that HN3[ ] a later request of a federal prisoner who had previously filed a request for  authorization to file a second or successive [*3]  petition based on the same claim must be dismissed under §  2244(b)(1)). HN4[ ] Similarly, ""[t]he grant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or  successive application . . . shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing . . . ."" 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(E). HN5[ ] An applicant seeking leave to file a second or successive habeas petition based on newly discovered  evidence must show that the newly discovered evidence establishes that he was actually innocent of the offense. In  re Boshears, 110 F.3d 1538, 1541 (11th Cir. 1997); see also In re Sams, 830 F.3d 1234, 1241 (11th Cir. 20106).  Thus, the application must be denied if ""any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the  crime beyond a reasonable doubt."" In re Boshears, 110 F.3d at 1541. Flanders is a federal prisoner serving a total life sentence for conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking by fraud,  substantive sex trafficking by fraud, attempt to engage in sex trafficking by fraud, attempt to benefit by  participating in a venture to engage in sex trafficking by fraud, and distribution of a controlled substance. Court  records show that a federal grand jury charged Flanders with the aforementioned offenses in 2011, and a jury found  Flanders guilty of those offenses. The court sentenced him in 2012, and we affirmed his convictions and sentences. In January [*4]  2016, Flanders filed his original § 2255 motion and alleged that: (i) the statute under which he was  indicted, 18 U.S.C. § 1591, was unconstitutionally vague; (ii) his superseding indictment was defective because the  government presented false evidence that his offense conduct involved minors; (iii) the search warrants in his case  were deficient; (iv) the government failed to disclose exculpatory information; (v) he was actually innocent; and (vi)  his counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the claims mentioned above and by failing to communicate with the  Page 4 of 4   government about the possibility of a plea. The district court denied his motion with prejudice in 2017, and he did  not appeal. In his present, pro se, application, Flanders appears to raise the same claims from his original § 2255 motion. He  also wishes to raise eight additional claims, some of which overlap with the claims from his original § 2255 motion.  Specifically, Flanders wishes to raise six claims of ineffective assistance of counsel relating to his criminal and  habeas proceedings and an actual innocence claim. He states that he received ineffective assistance of counsel  when: (1) he did not have his trial counsel present at a critical stage of his criminal [*5]  proceeding; (2) trial counsel  did not compel the government to disclose all of its evidence; (3) trial counsel allowed ""the government to hold [him]  to answer [for his offenses] . . . without the indictment of a [g]rand [j]ury;"" (4) his appellate counsel failed to  investigate the indictments from his criminal proceeding; (5) his appellate counsel failed to allege ineffective  assistance of counsel for his failure to have counsel present at his initial appearance; and (6) his trial counsel failed  to argue that the government had committed fraud on the court through the use of allegedly fraudulent indictments.  Additionally, Flanders asserts that he is actually innocent of his offenses because he was indicted under a  fraudulent indictment and that prosecutors suborned perjury during his trial. Flanders asserts that all of the claims he wishes to raise rely solely on newly discovered evidence. Flanders  explains that his newly discovered evidence consists of his Freedom of Information Act (""FOIA"") requests and the  corresponding responses from the Executive Office for the United States Attorneys (""Executive Office"") and the  Federal Bureau of Investigation (""FBI""). Flanders states that he sought [*6]  to obtain copies of the indictments from  his criminal proceedings from the Executive Office to authenticate the indictments. According to Flanders, the  Executive Office responded to his FOIA requests and stated that the indictments could not be disclosed to him  because they contained the private information of child victims and witnesses, under 18 U.S.C. § 3509(d). Flanders  contends that the Executive Office's response to his FOIA requests show that his indictments were fraudulent and  that no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty of his offenses. He next explains that responses from the  FBI to his FOIA requests also show that his indictments were fraudulent and prove his innocence. We dismiss Flanders's application to the extent that he raises the same claims from his original § 2255 motion  because those claims were denied previously. See In re Everett, 797 F.3d at 1291; In re Hill, 715 F.3d at 294. HN6[ ] Although Flanders's current application attempts to argue that he has newly discovered evidence to support his  prior claims, the basic gravamen of the claims is the same, and we have held that a prisoner cannot raise claims  presented previously with new supporting evidence. In re Hill, 715 F.3d at 294; see also In re Baptiste, 828 F.3d at  1339-40. As to his remaining claims, we deny Flanders's application because he does [*7]  not rely on either a new rule of  constitutional law or newly discovered evidence. 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(2)(A), (B). Flanders admits that none of his  claims rely on any new rule of constitutional law. Moreover, Flanders's reliance on his FOIA requests and the  corresponding responses from the Executive Office and the FBI do not constitute newly discovered evidence, 28  U.S.C. § 2244(b)(2)(B), because they do not establish his actual innocence. In re Boshears, 110 F.3d at 1541.  Flanders merely contends that, because the Executive Office and FBI responses did not allow him to obtain copies  of his indictments, his indictments were all fraudulent. He does not address his substantive offense conduct or the  evidence the government presented against him at trial, however, and he also does not show that he did not  commit the acts alleged in those indictments. Thus, Flanders has failed to show that ""but for constitutional error, no  reasonable factfinder would have found [him] guilty of the underlying offense."" Id.; 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(2)(B). Accordingly, because Flanders has failed to make a prima facie showing of the existence of either of the grounds  set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 2255, his application for leave to file a second or successive motion is hereby DISMISSED  in part and DENIED in part.",1
"United States v. Woods, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 207907","MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT WOOD'S JOINT MOTION TO EXCLUDE  GOVERNMENT'S EXPERT WITNESSES THIS MATTER comes before the Court upon Defendant Wood's Joint Motion to Exclude Government's Expert  Witnesses or in the Alternative to Hold a Daubert Hearing, filed March 30, 2018 (Doc. 190). Defendant Woods  (""Defendant"" or ""Woods"") is charged with crimes related to alleged involvement in a commercial sex trafficking  ring referred to by the Government as the ""Galloway Organization."" Woods motion is granted in that the Court  conducted a Daubert hearing; however, after hearing testimony from the proposed expert witnesses and after  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 207907, *207907 Page 4 of 10   considering the oral and written arguments of counsel, the Court DENIES the motion to exclude the Government's  expert witness testimony. BACKGROUND In this Daubert [*2]  motion, Defendant seeks to exclude the testimony of several Government expert witnesses,  specifically: Kim Mehlman-Orozco and Special Agent Morgan Langer (""SA Langer""). The Government's objective  is to offer their testimony to counter Defendant's position that the victims in this case were active and willing  participants in the organization. Dr. Mehlman-Orozco is expected to testify regarding the clandestine nature of  human trafficking crimes; the trauma bond that exists between victims of human trafficking; and the complex  reactions due to trauma bonding with their offender."" SA Langer will testify regarding the various characteristics of  human traffickers based on training & experience. DISCUSSION HN1[ ] A district court's gate-keeping function involves a three-step analysis. First, the Court must determine  whether the expert is qualified by ""knowledge, skill, experience, training or education"" to render an opinion. See  Fed.R.Evid. 702. Second, if the witness is so qualified, the Court must determine whether the expert's opinions are  ""reliable"" under the principles set forth under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., and Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v.  Carmichael. 509 U.S. 579, 597, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993) and 526 U.S. 137, 119 S. Ct. 1167, 143  L. Ed. 2d 238 (1999); see also Ralston v. Smith & Nephew Richards, Inc. 275 F.3d 965 (10th Cir. 2001). Third, Rule  702 further requires that the evidence or testimony ""assist the trier of fact to understand [*3]  the evidence or to  determine a fact in issue."" This condition goes primarily to relevance. Daubert, 509 U.S. at 591 ("". . . Rule 702's  ""helpfulness"" standard requires a valid scientific connection to the pertinent inquiry as a precondition to  admissibility""). Qualifications: Defendant's objections to the Government's experts focus on reliability and relevance. Defendant  does not offer any challenge to the qualifications of either expert, but the Court will quickly review these  qualifications for the record. Reliability: HN2[ ] The district court must ensure that any expert testimony admitted rests on a reliable foundation  and is relevant to the task at hand. Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 597, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125  L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993). The burden of proof is on the proponent of the expert, in this case the Government. See U.S.  v. Baines, 573 F.3d 979, 985 (10th Cir. 2009) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 702). In Daubert, the Supreme Court set out a  non-exhaustive set of factors that trial courts may consider in determining whether proposed expert testimony is  based on reliable methods and principles: (1) whether the particular theory can be and has been tested; (2) whether  the theory has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) the known or potential rate of error; (4) the  existence and maintenance of standards controlling the techniques operation; and (5) whether [*4]  the technique  has achieved general acceptance in the relevant scientific or expert community. 509 U.S. at 593-94. HN3[ ]  Daubert itself was limited to scientific evidence, see U.S. v. Baines, 573 F.3d 979, 985 (10th Cir. 2009), but in  Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 119 S. Ct. 1167, 143 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1999), the Supreme Court made  clear that the gatekeeping obligation of the district courts described in Daubert applies, not just to scientific  testimony, but to all expert testimony. Id. at 141. While a district court may consider the Daubert factors in  determining the admissibility of non-scientific expert testimony to the extent they are relevant, id. at 150, the test of  reliability is flexible, and Daubert's list of specific factors neither necessarily nor exclusively applies to all experts or  in every case. The law grants a district court the same broad latitude when it decides how to determine reliability as  it enjoys in respect to its ultimate reliability determination. Id. at 141-42; see Witherspoon v. Navajo Ref. Co., LP,  2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46149, 2005 WL 5988649 at *3 (D.N.M., July 18, 2005) (citing Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522  U.S. 136, 146, 118 S. Ct. 512, 139 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1997)).  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 207907, *1 Page 5 of 10   Relevance: HN4[ ] To be relevant, proposed expert testimony must logically advance a material aspect of the  case,"" Norris v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 397 F.3d 878, 884 n. 2 (10th Cir. 2005), and be ""sufficiently tied to the  facts of the case that it will aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute,"" Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509  U.S. 579, 591, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469(1993). (quotation omitted). In assessing whether testimony will  assist the trier of fact, district courts consider several factors, including whether [*5]  the testimony ""is within the  juror's common knowledge and experience,"" and ""whether it will usurp the juror's role of evaluating a witness's  credibility."" United States v. Rodriguez-Felix, 450 F.3d 1117, 1123 (10th Cir. 2006) (footnote omitted). Pursuant to  Rule 702, courts must conduct a ""common-sense inquiry"" into whether a juror would be able to understand certain  evidence without specialized knowledge. United States v. Becker, 230 F.3d 1224, 1231 (10th Cir.2000). I. Dr. Mehlman-Orozco A. Qualifications Dr. Mehlman-Orozco considers herself a leading expert in cases on sex trafficking and the Court agrees with that  self-description. She has participated extensively and been a speaker at conferences on the issue; has conducted  training for law enforcement personnel in recognizing and dealing with sex trafficking cases; has written numerous  articles, including a book which is used as a training manual for law enforcement. Dr. Mehlman-Orozco is the only  human trafficking expert qualified on the Los Angeles Superior Court panel of experts, and has testified mostly in  state court, but has also testified in federal court. Defendant raises no specific issue regarding her qualifications and  the Court finds that she satisfies Daubert's requirements. B. Reliability of Opinion Testimony Dr. Mehlman-Orozco described how her training [*6]  guides her approach in developing an opinion in the area of  sex trafficking: • She is trained in survey methodology as well as the collection and analysis of data and uses these methods  in approaching the subject matter on which she provides opinions; • Dr. Mehlman-Orozco has kept current on research methods, although she noted that it is difficult in this area  to identify sex trafficking cases; • She uses quantitative data to focus on prevalence/prediction/causation and quantitative studies rather than  relying solely on qualitative information based on interviews. However, her books focus more on qualitative  information. Dr. Mehlman-Orozco pointed out that because human trafficking involves human relationships,  this is an area where quantitative information is more difficult to come by. • Dr. Mehlman-Orozco uses the Michigan Law Center Human Trafficking data base to set up interviews with  victims as well as numerous interviews with about a half dozen people convicted of sex trafficking in order to  understand how they recruit/control their victims. These interviews corroborated other studies that were done  and were included in her publications: (1) a 2017 scholarly, peer-reviewed publication [*7]  entitled ""Projected Heroes and Self-Perceived  Manipulators: Understanding the Duplicitous Identities of Human Traffickers"" that was published in Trends  in Organized Crime. Doc. 201-1. That article was the end product of Dr. Mehlman-Orozco's qualitative  research that delved into portrayed and self-identities of sex traffickers. This peer-reviewed article was  also recently accepted for presentation at the 2018 American Society of Criminology academic conference  in Atlanta, Georgia; (2) In 2015, Dr. Mehlman-Orozco's peer-reviewed, scholarly article ""Safe Harbor Legislation for Juvenile  Victims of Sex Trafficking: A Myopic View of Improvements in Practice,"" was published in the Journal of  Social Inclusion, which was guest edited by Siddharth Kara, author of Sex Trafficking: Inside the  Business of Modern Slavery and Director of the Program on Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery at  the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and is attached hereto as Exhibit 2. For this  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 207907, *4 Page 6 of 10   article, Dr. Mehlman-Orozco analyzed yearly court data on juvenile prostitution arrests aggregated at the  state level to explore the criminalization of commercial sexually exploited children post safe harbor  policy [*8]  implementation; and (3) in the fall of 2017, Dr. Mehlman-Orozco published Hidden in Plain Sight: America's Slaves of the New  Millennium, a book that examines trends in sex and labor trafficking in the United States, and is used as  a manual to train law enforcement. • Dr. Mehlman-Orozco has also conducted an extensive review of available case law, relying on what she  referred to as a ""triangulating data source"" by looking at what information is available and then filling in gaps by  interviewing people convicted of sex trafficking and understanding how they recruit/control their victims. Much  of her content analysis focused on Michigan state case law, which Dr. Mehlman-Orozco stated had a ""robust  collection"" of case law pertaining to sex trafficking. Despite Dr. Mehlman-Orozco's description of the methodological approach, Defendant characterizes her work as  anecdotal, but this characterization is unfounded based on the testimony given at the hearing. Dr. Mehlman- Orozco's expertise may have been derived to a large degree from qualitative studies, but her expertise is  undeniably based on scholarly and peer-reviewed work regarding how the sex trafficking industry works. She has  published peer-reviewed [*9]  journal articles and research papers; has appeared on TV discussing trafficking and  trends; and served as a peer reviewer for journals and grant applications. Dr. Mehlman-Orozco stated that in  developing her research, she does not rely on any one journal, but rather focuses on specific researchers who have  published on human trafficking issues in various journals, such as the Journal of Human Trafficking and criminal  article journals. The basis for Dr. Mehlman-Orozco's opinion testimony is hardly premised on mere ""observation,"" as Defendant  contends. Rather, the Court finds that (1) these numerous publications contain the intellectual rigor to meet  Daubert's vigorous peer-review standards; (2) that Dr. Mehlman-Orozco's opinion testimony is tied scientifically to  qualitative experience through interviews with victims, traffickers and sex workers; and (3) that it includes some  quantitative methodology based on her own research and her studies related to published research by colleagues  in the field and through her participation in conferences on the subject. Defendant also questions the reliability of Dr. Mehlman-Orozco's methodology by claiming that her opinion is based  on her own ""interpretation"" [*10]  of the case law, and that in identifying whether conduct qualifies as sex  trafficking, Dr. Mehlman-Orozco simply keys off the legal elements of the federal sex trafficking statute, 18  U.S.C. §1591 as a benchmark (using force, threats of force, fraud or coercion to cause a person to cause the  person to engage in a commercial sex act, or causing a person under 18 years of age to engage in a commercial  sex act). The Court soundly rejects this challenge as well, finding that Dr. Mehlman-Orozco's opinion testimony is not merely  a ""gloss"" on the federal statutory elements, nor is her review of cases premised on her own ""interpretation"" of the  law. Dr. Mehlman-Orozco testified that she approaches case law by conducting a systematic qualitative review from  the viewpoint of a researcher, not as a lawyer and reviews cases looking for what occurs commonly across these  cases as well as what does not occur. She stated that she does not apply or interpret the law. As a researcher she  does not use anecdote to form her opinions, nor does she use an a priori opinion as a starting point. Rather, she  studies the case law to determine whether the elements contained in the cases are consistent with her research  experience [*11]  and with the work she has done independently. The Court does not consider any part of this  approach to constitute a ""gloss"" on the federal sex trafficking statute nor on the relevant case law. The Court therefore finds that the opinion testimony offered by Dr. Mehlman-Orozco satisfies the reliability  requirements set forth under Daubert. C. Relevance The next question is whether Dr. Mehlman-Orozco's testimony will be relevant in that it will assist the jury. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 207907, *7 Page 7 of 10   At the hearing, Dr. Mehlman-Orozco described the topics on which she would offer testimony, beginning with her  observation that depictions of sex trafficking by the mainstream media are misinformed. For example, she noted  that so-called ""experts"" are skeptical that a child can be engaged in sex work, when the erroneous criminalization of  victims is more the reality, where children are quite often criminalized and arrested for prostitution. Another  misconception is encouraged through the mainstream media's glamorization of pimping—which involves consenting  relationships, are victimless and is a concept distinct from sex trafficking. Still another misconception is that  trafficking works through physical force, discounting the element [*12]  of coercion through a formed relationship  or through trauma bonding. In sex trafficking trauma bonding, the victim develops a positive affinity and emotional  bond, with the trafficker making it difficult for victims to leave or to cooperate with law enforcement. Dr. Mehlman- Orozco also noted that while a victim can have trauma bonds with various people in the trafficking organization,  they are not usually developed with the trafficker's ""enforcer"" who assists in gaining compliance from the victim. Dr. Mehlman-Orozco described the different methods used by traffickers to sustain their hold over victims, such as  debt bondage and rewards (clothing, jewelry, treatment—which in turn increases the trafficker's profit margin in  making the victim more attractive as an asset), and which keep the victim returning to the trafficker. Victims become  compliant to the particular brand of exploitation, and traffickers themselves fall into different categories showing  different psychologies and approaches to recruitment and control methods, for example: (1) the ""Romeo-style""  approach; (2) the ""heavy-handed guerilla"" approach utilizing physical abuse where traffickers have sex with victims  showing dominance [*13]  by raping and traumatizing them; and the use of other women as well as other victims to  recruit—which often leads to victims becoming traffickers themselves). Dr. Mehlman-Orozco's opinion testimony will also include a description of the factors that render an individual at a  higher risk and more inclined to victimization (a need for some kind of basic need such as housing or food; love and  belonging; and even self-esteem) and which create a void that a trafficker seeks to fill. For example, victims with  violent traffickers will often present with domestic violence issues that become part of that trauma bond. Age can  play into recruitment, as younger victims are easier to target and control, and parents can themselves allow  trafficking to happen. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Dr. Mehlman-Orozco to distinguish between sex trafficking and  consensual pimping, referring to domestic violence situations as an example. Dr. Mehlman-Orozco responded that  in making a determination whether a situation was sex trafficking or a consensual relationship, one could not  make this conclusion based on any one or two specific factors (such as how many times one slapped a domestic  partner or [*14]  how the individuals involves split the profits from commercial sex). Rather, one could only draw  conclusions after considering whether certain elements are consistent with trauma bonding which has been  determined to exist in other cases, such as: Did the victim return to the offender? Is the victim cooperating with law  enforcement? Does the victim wish to disclose the abuse? Dr. Mehlman-Orozco's testimony will touch on topics of consent, the existence of trauma bonds and characteristics  of victims and sex traffickers. All of these are relevant to providing the jury with the information necessary to  determine the issues to be tried in this case. In light of the misrepresentations fostered by the mainstream media  about sex trafficking versus consensual commercial sex, her testimony becomes all the more critical in ensuring  that the jury is well-informed. Nevertheless, Defendant seeks to limit Dr. Mehlman-Orozco's opinion testimony to that of a general principles  expert. Specifically, defense counsel requests that the Court bar her from using hypotheticals that might allude to  the facts of this cases and from describing the characteristics of sex trafficking. The Court denies [*15]  the  request. The Court notes that Dr. Mehlman-Orozco was not provided and did not review, any records in this case.  As she explained, the purpose of her testimony was to describe the different facets of sex trafficking and trauma  bonding, but in the end the jury would have to decide whether and how it has any connection to the instant case.     2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 207907, *11 Page 8 of 10   Limiting the testimony as defense counsel suggests serves no useful purpose and in fact will hamper the ability of  Dr. Mehlman-Orozco to provide helpful information to the jury which she is well-qualified to give. The information offered by Dr. Mehlman-Orozco is not within the common knowledge of laypersons. In fact, the very  questions asked by defense counsel on cross-examination demonstrate the lack of common misperceptions  misinformation laypersons might bring with them to deliberate on these matters. The Court therefore finds that Dr.  Mehlman-Orozco's testimony will help the jury decide the issues that remain to be tried in this case and will not  usurp the jury's function in assessing credibility. D. Rule 403 Balancing HN5[ ] Under Fed.R.Evid. 403, the court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially  outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: [*16]  unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the  jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence. Defendant does not explicitly argue that Dr. Mehlman-Orozco's testimony would violate Rule 403, but the Court has  considered this as a possible reason behind defense counsel's request to limit the scope of that testimony.  However, the Court finds that none of Rule 403's balancing factors are at risk if Dr. Mehlman-Orozco's testimony is  allowed. While some of the testimony may hit close to home in this case, none of the testimony to be given is  unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403. Accordingly, the Court finds that Dr. Mehlman-Orozco meets all the pertinent Daubert qualifications as an expert. II. Special Agent Morgan Langer (""SA Langer"") A. Qualifications SA Langer is a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations (""HSI"") and has investigated sex trafficking  cases since 2012. He has a Masters Degree in Criminal Justice and offers training to other law enforcement  officers, prosecutors, judges, health professionals, teachers and politicians, as well as those who provide services  to victims of sex trafficking. Other law enforcement agencies also contact him because they have [*17]  less  experience in sex trafficking cases, such as Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (""ATF""), Drug Enforcement  Administration (""DEA"") and other non-governmental and non-profit organizations (""NGO""). He explained that  teachers or health care providers need training in this subject area because they might come into contact with  victims of abuse or who have sexually transmitted disease and their familiarity with sex trafficking could prevent  these victims from slipping between the cracks. Also, knowing more about sex trafficking could encourage these  providers to contact HSI when they see ""red flags"" that could be signs of sex trafficking victims. SA Langer has  investigated over 500 sex trafficking cases, has interviewed hundreds of victims (with minors accounting for under  5%). Defendant does not challenge SA Langer's qualifications, and based on the above information, the Court finds SA  Langer to be qualified as an expert under Daubert standards. B. Reliability of Opinion Testimony SA Langer will testify regarding the various characteristics of human trafficking based on his training and  experience and will describe how the sex trafficking industry works, beginning with advertising for  commercial [*18]  sex on certain websites such as Backpage.com. Identifying sex trafficking websites is not an  exact science, but he is familiar with certain indicia of sex trafficking websites, such as the use of exploitive photos  of women of very young individuals. Customers do not consider that websites that advertise for commercial sex  could be part of a sex trafficking ring.  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 207907, *15 Page 9 of 10   SA Langer is also familiar with how the commercial sex operations are run and with the terminology that is used in  sex trafficking. For example, sex traffickers know that customers don't like to talk to a male on the phone when  setting up calls since a male voice signifies a ""red flag,"" and so women usually answer the phone in these  operations and do the talking. Also, the trafficker is generally not present in the room where the transaction is  carried out, but rather in the background as an observer. SA Langer will testify, based on his experience and  training, about the methods used by traffickers to control victims which vary according to the particular  characteristics of the traffickers and about the characteristics of victims, who are reluctant to disclose information  about the experience and who see law enforcement as [*19]  the enemy. Some victims have been coached not to trust by traffickers who describe threats of ""detox"" in jail. SA Langer noted  that these victim characteristics affect how interviews are conducted since SA Langer is a law enforcement officer.  Victims are as a result, often hostile, introverted and closed off and it sometimes requires four or five  encounters/interviews with the victims before any information can be obtained. He stated that he makes it clear to  the victims during the interviews that he is not there to arrest them and offers them services. Defendant challenges the reliability of SA Langer's opinion testimony because it is not based on a scientific method  in determining whether an advertisement or website is actually connected to sex trafficking. The Court rejects this  argument because opinion testimony does not have to be ""scientific"" in order to meet Daubert standards. As  mentioned previously, HN6[ ] while Daubert itself was limited to scientific evidence, in Kumho Tire Co., the  Supreme Court made clear that the gatekeeping obligation of the district courts described in Daubert applies, not  just to scientific testimony, but to all expert testimony. 526 U.S. 137, 141, 119 S. Ct. 1167, 143 L. Ed. 2d 238  (1999); United States v. Baines, 573 F.3d 979, 985 (10th Cir. 2009). Thus, the test of reliability [*20]  is flexible, and  Daubert's list of specific factors neither necessarily nor exclusively applies to all experts or in every case. Rather,  the law grants a district court the same broad latitude when it decides how to determine reliability as it enjoys in  respect to its ultimate reliability determination. Id. at 141-42. SA Langer's testimony is clearly not based on scientific evidence but rather on SA Langer's training and experience  which is extensive on the subject of sex trafficking. See United States v. Monteiro, 407 F.Supp.2d 351, 357 (D.  Mass. 2006) (compiling cases) (noting that many courts have recognized that the list of factors the Supreme Court  outlined in Daubert ""may not perfectly fit every type of expert testimony, particularly technical testimony based  primarily on the training and experience of the expert.""). Based on the proffered testimony of SA Langer, as well as  his experience and training, the Court finds that this expert meets Daubert's reliability requirements. C. Relevance Defendant contends that SA Langer's testimony will not be helpful to the jury because the information SA Langer  offers is within the grasp of any lay person. Counsel distinguished this case from drug trafficking cases where an  expert would be helpful to testify as to drug amounts that constitute non-personal use. HN7[ ] Pursuant to Rule 702, courts must conduct a ""common-sense inquiry"" into whether a juror would be able to  understand certain evidence without specialized knowledge. United States v. Becker, 230 F.3d 1224, 1231 (10th  Cir.2000). The Court disagrees with Defendant's assessment of SA Langer's testimony and finds that the testimony            2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 207907, *18 Page 10 of 10   will both assist the [*22]  jury and not usurp the jury's function in assessing credibility. First, sex trafficking is not  within a layperson's common knowledge and experience. Most laypersons obtain information about the subject  from the mainstream media which itself depicts many misconceptions about sex trafficking—particularly in how it  affects younger individuals. Second, sex trafficking differs with geographic locations, and SA Langer is  knowledgeable regarding local sex trafficking operations. Third, while aspects of SA Langer's testimony potentially  overlap somewhat with Dr. Mehlman-Orozco's testimony, their opinions are helpful in different ways. Dr. Mehlman- Orozco offers a scientific and scholarly perspective on how sex trafficking affects victims: why victims react the  way they do and the methods traffickers use to get victims to comply. SA Langer brings a local, ""on the ground,"" law  enforcement view to the subject: how sex trafficking advertises for customers, how it actually operates—much like  DEA experts. SA Langer can testify on matters through in his experience that Dr. Mehlman-Orozco cannot do from  her research and interviews. Laypersons are not familiar with such matters and the Court finds that [*23]  SA  Langer's testimony meets Daubert's relevance criteria. D. Rule 403 Balancing Again, Defendant does not explicitly argue that SA Langer's testimony violates Rule 403, and the Court find that no  reason to exclude this testimony for reasons of unfair prejudice, confusion, misleading the issues or needlessly  presenting cumulative evidence. As the Court has just discussed, Dr. Mehlman-Orozco and SA Langer offer  different viewpoints and information on sex trafficking. THEREFORE, Defendant Wood's Joint Motion to Exclude Government's Expert Witnesses or in the Alternative to Hold a Daubert  Hearing (Doc. 190), is GRANTED in that the Court held an evidentiary Daubert hearing, but Defendant Woods'  request to exclude the testimony of Dr. Mehlman-Orozco and SA Langer is DENIED for reasons described in this  Memorandum Opinion and Order. /s/ William P.

"Davis v. McKenzie, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183519","REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION TO DISTRICT JUDGE I. INTRODUCTION This matter is before the Court upon the cross-motions for summary judgment filed by Defendant Public  Broadcasting Service (""PBS"") and by Plaintiff Corey Davis (""Davis""): Public Broadcasting Service's Motion and  Memorandum in Support of Summary Judgment Pursuant to Section 768.295, Florida Statutes (Anti-Slapp Statute)  (DE 40) (""PBS's Motion""); and Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (DE 57) (""Davis's Motion""). The  District Court has referred this cause to the undersigned for ""appropriate disposition or Report and  Recommendation of all matters"" (DE 36). Corey Davis is currently serving consecutive 293-month and 60-month terms of imprisonment for sex trafficking of  a 12-year old girl and for assault of a fellow inmate resulting in serious bodily injury. While incarcerated, Davis filed  Page 2 of 18   claims for ""libel/libel per se"" and ""defamation/defamation per se"" against PBS [*2]  for broadcasting allegations by  Shamere McKenzie that she had been physically and sexually abused by her ""trafficker."" Although McKenzie's  statements do not identify her ""trafficker"" by name, Davis maintains that her statements are nonetheless defamatory  as ""court records and other information in the public domain"" link the two of them ""inextricably and the inference to  [him] is blatant."" Id. ¶ 30. The undersigned recommends that Davis's claims against PBS — Claim 20 and Claim 21  of the Complaint — be dismissed with prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915 (e)(2)(B)(i),(ii) and (g) as they ""fail[] to  state a claim on which relief may be granted"" and/or are ""frivolous or malicious."" II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY On October 24, 2016, Davis filed a 21-count Complaint in this Court against Defendants Shamere McKenzie  (""McKenzie""), Sun Gate Foundation (""Sun Gate""), Hannah Terry (""Terry""), and PBS (DE 1). On February 28, 2017,  the District Court entered an order granting Davis's request to proceed in forma pauperis. Order at 5 (DE 18). The  Court in that same order stated that ""[u]pon review of [Davis's] submissions, including the Response [to the order to  show cause], the Court determines that the Complaint states a plausible claim for relief, [*3]  and that this matter  should proceed."" Order at 4 (DE 18). In making this threshold screening, the Court noted that ""[p]ro se pleadings  are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.""  Id. (internal quotations and citations omitted). On April 26, 2017, the Court dismissed the case with respect to Defendant Terry for failure to make timely service  as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) (DE 27). Defendant McKenzie and Defendant Sun Gate have not yet been  served. However, in a Report and Recommendation being filed contemporaneously herewith, the undersigned  recommends that all claims against McKenzie, Sun Gate, and Terry also be dismissed with prejudice, pursuant to  28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(i),(ii) and (g), for failure to state a claim and/or as ""frivolous or malicious."" On June 20, 2017, PBS filed its Motion and Memorandum in Support of Summary Judgment (DE 40). After being  granted several extensions of time, Davis filed his response and a Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment on  September 19, 2017 (DE 57). The motions are now ripe for review. III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS Before setting forth the 21 claims, the Complaint provides background information concerning Corey Davis and  Shamere [*4]  McKenzie. The Complaint states that Davis and McKenzie were arrested in December 2006 and  indicted on sex trafficking charges. According to the Superseding Indictment, ""McKenzie was Davis's 'bottom,' the  pimp's most trusted prostitute, who facilitated transportation of the females who were prostituted to various adult  strip clubs, collected cash proceeds generated from the prostitution, informed them of the 'rules,' and maintained  control over the females who were prostituted when Davis was not present"" (DE 40-2, ¶ 2). Davis subsequently  pled guilty to one count of sex trafficking. Complaint ¶¶ 13, 18 (DE 1). The Complaint asserts that Davis and  McKenzie are ""inextricably"" linked ""by way of court records and other information in the public domain."" Id. ¶ 30.             2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183519, *1 Page 3 of 18   Among the public information referenced in the Complaint is an internet posting of a Loyola University speech by  McKenzie, in which she stated that her ""trafficker"" — by implication, Davis — had ""raped,"" ""sodomized,"" and  ""tortured"" her. Complaint ¶¶ 22, 24, 26, 28 (DE 1). The Complaint also references a story about McKenzie written  by Terry and appearing on Sun Gate's website. According to the Complaint, the Terry article states [*5]  that  McKenzie's trafficker had: forced her into the commercial sex industry for 18 months, id. ¶ 42; forced her to work 7  nights per week, id. ¶ 43; severely beaten, raped, and sodomized her, id. ¶ 44; threatened to kill her or her family if  she ran away, id. ¶ 47; and put a gun in her mouth, pulled the trigger (but it was not loaded), and then beat her with  the gun, id. ¶ 49. At issue in the present motions are the two claims against PBS — Claim 20 and Claim 21 of the Complaint — for  ""libel/libel per se"" and ""defamation/defamation per se."" Complaint ¶¶ 96, 97 (DE 1). The Complaint describes an  April 24, 2016 interview that McKenzie gave to John Bersia, host of the PBS television show ""Global Perspectives.""  Id. ¶ 57. According to the Complaint, McKenzie falsely alleged in that interview that her ""trafficker"" — by implication,  Davis — had subjected her to a variety of physical and sexual abuse: he had put a gun in her mouth and pulled the  trigger, but the gun was not loaded, id. ¶ 58; he had sodomized her as punishment for trying to leave him, id. ¶ 60;  he had enslaved and tortured her for 18 months, id. at ¶ 62; he had threatened to kill her family if she ever ran away  from him, id. [*6]  ¶ 64; and he had choked her on one occasion for trying to escape, resulting in her passing out  and later waking up in her own urine, id. ¶ 66. The Complaint further alleges that family members and friends of  Davis, as well as those of other inmates, had viewed this PBS interview and that as a result thereof Davis has been  ""subjected to hatred, distrust, contempt and or disgrace."" Id. ¶¶ 69, 70, 75. Davis alleges that PBS was negligent for failing to conduct any investigation to determine the truth of McKenzie's  statements, for failing to verify her allegations, for failing to provide Davis an opportunity to rebut her statements,  and (impliedly) for failing to retract the statements. Id. ¶¶ 72, 73, 76. The Complaint asserts that ""PBS is therefore  vicariously libel for the content of their program and vicariously libel for the false allegations of Defendant  McKenzie."" Id. ¶ 74. IV. THE CROSS-MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT A. THE PBS MOTION PBS seeks summary judgment pursuant to Section 768.295, Florida Statutes (anti-Slapp Statute) (DE 40). The  Florida anti-Slapp statute grants an ""expeditious resolution"" of defamation cases in certain instances. PBS argues  that Florida's anti-SLAPP statute should govern disposition of this [*7]  diversity action. The propriety of applying  the anti-SLAPP statute in this action depends, in turn, on whether the provision is deemed to be substantive or  procedural. See Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 465, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8 (1965) (stating that federal                2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183519, *4 Page 4 of 18   courts apply state substantive law and federal procedural law). However, such a decision need not be reached  here. Even if Florida's anti-SLAPP statute were deemed [*8]  substantive (rather than procedural), it would merely  supplement — not substitute for — the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Godin, 629 F.3d at 88 (stating that  ""Maine has not created a substitute to the federal rules, but instead created a supplemental and substantive rule to  provide added protections, beyond those in Rules 12 and 56, to defendants who are named as parties because of  constitutional petitioning activities""); Newsham, 190 F.3d at 971-73 (holding that California's anti-SLAPP statute did  not conflict with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure). In this instance, the undersigned need not draw upon the  supplemental remedies of the Florida anti-SLAPP statute as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure — Rule 12 and  Rule 56 — provide an adequate framework for expeditiously resolving the issues raised by Davis's Complaint. PBS argues that the Complaint should be dismissed because Davis's reputation cannot suffer further damage: Given the horrific nature of the sex-trafficking crimes committed by Corey Davis, his guilty plea, and the wide  dissemination of the details of his activities published in multiple court opinions, the news media, and  throughout the internet, it is simply not possible for Davis to suffer any further damage to his reputation.  His [*9]  own misconduct permanently destroyed his reputation long before the Global Perspectives interview  was aired on PBS-Online. PBS Motion at 12 (DE 40). In its Reply, PBS further argues that Davis' guilty plea (to trafficking a minor) renders  the veracity of McKenzie's interview immaterial: It matters not whether McKenzie was telling the truth or not in her interview with John Bersia; Davis's case falls  because he pled guilty to conduct (enslaving, pimping, beating) nearly identical to that McKenzie claims she  also suffered at his hands. His character and reputation are indelibly established in stone by his guilty plea and  the massive press coverage associated with his arrest, indictment, guilty plea, and sentencing. His quibble  about whether McKenzie was a victim or a co-conspirator to the very same conduct for which he pled guilty has  no effect on his reputation. PBS Reply at 3-4 (DE 68). Given the thorough, if not complete, destruction of Davis's reputation resulting from his  well-publicized — and admitted -- physical and sexual abuse of a minor, PBS argues that he is libel-proof and,  therefore, that he is not able to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. B. THE DAVIS MOTION Corey [*10]  Davis has filed Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (DE 57) pursuant to Rule 56(a). In the  one-paragraph motion, he requests that the Court enter judgment in his favor based on the pleadings and  supporting documents. Along with the motion, Davis has filed a memorandum of law (DE 58), a response to PBS's  statement of material facts (DE 60), voluminous exhibits (DE 61), and several declarations and affidavits (DE 62,  DE 63, DE 64, DE 65, DE 66). Davis maintains that McKenzie's actions were voluntary, that her allegations of  physical and sexual abuse are false, and that those allegations have damaged his reputation among his family,  friends, and fellow inmates. V. UNDISPUTED FACTS          2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183519, *7 Page 5 of 18   The facts relevant to the current motions are not in dispute. The parties, however, do dispute the legal impact of  McKenzie's physical and sexual abuse allegations on Davis's reputation. This dispute requires that the undersigned  first assess the state of Davis's reputation, particularly as concerns violence and physical and sexual abuse, prior to  the McKenzie allegations. In making this assessment, the undersigned has considered the evidence submitted by  each party and not disputed by the other, as well as the [*11]  adjudicative facts of which it may take judicial notice. A. Judicial Notice Construing the PBS Motion as one to dismiss under Rule 12, the undersigned may consider not only the allegations  in the Complaint, Halmos v. Bomardier Aerospace Corp., 404 Fed. Appx. 376, 377 (11th Cir. 2010) (citations  omitted), and documents incorporated into the Complaint by reference, but also matters of which it may take judicial  notice, Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, 713 F.3d 1066, 1075 n.9 (11th Cir. 2013) (citing Long v. Slaton, 508 F.3d  576, 578 n.3 (11th Cir. 2007) (noting the court is not always limited to the four corners of the complaint at the Rule  12(b)(6) stage and taking judicial notice of undisputed facts contained in a report from a state agency)). In its  Motion, PBS asks this Court to take judicial notice of Davis's criminal history and the publicity attendant to his  arrest, conviction, and sentencing. PBS Motion at 8-12 (DE 40). The Federal Rules of Evidence provide that a court may take judicial notice of adjudicative facts, more particularly,  facts that are ""not subject to reasonable dispute"" because they ""can be accurately and readily determined from  sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned."" Fed. R. Ev. 201. In particular, a court may take judicial  notice of prior judicial proceedings. See United States ex rel. Osheroff v. Humana. Inc., 776 F.3d 805, 811 n.4 (11th  Cir. 2015) (""Courts may take judicial notice of publicly filed documents, such as those in state court litigation, at the  Rule 12(b)(6) stage.""); [*12]  5C Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1364 (3d  ed. 2004) (stating that ""judicial notice may be taken of prior pleadings and proceedings""). A court may also take  judicial notice of newspapers and other publications for the limited purpose of determining what statements the  documents contain. See Osheroff, 776 F.3d at 811 n.4 (""And courts may take judicial notice of documents such as  the newspaper articles at issue here for the limited purpose of determining which statements the documents contain  (but not for determining the truth of those statements).""). As Davis himself has acknowledged, the information pertinent to both McKenzie and him is readily accessible ""by  way of court records and other information in the public domain."" Complaint ¶ 30. The undersigned has taken  judicial notice of the publicly available transcripts and other filings from Davis's criminal proceedings. Moreover,  PBS has filed a Statement of Material Facts detailing the core elements of Davis's criminal history and its attendant  publicity (DE 41 ¶¶ 5-10), and Davis has not contested the accuracy of those representations. Indeed, in his  Response to PBS' Statement of Material Facts, Davis has stated that he ""agrees"" [*13]  with the ""assertions in  Defendant PBS' Statement of Material Facts"" concerning his criminal history and media publicity (DE 60 ¶¶ 5-8,  10). B. Davis's Criminal History and the Attendant Publicity As the Complaint references, and as court records establish, on August 23, 2007, a federal grand jury in  Connecticut returned a 15-count Superseding Indictment charging Corey Davis with a variety of crimes including  sex-trafficking, kidnapping, forced labor, and transportation of minors across state lines for immoral purposes (DE  40-2). The Superseding Indictment alleged that Davis was the organizer and leader of a venture that forced not  only adult females, but also minor females as young as age 12, age 15, and age 17 to work as exotic dancers and  to prostitute themselves, some for months at a time. According to the indictment, after luring these females to his  operation, Davis forced them to work a grueling schedule each day that entailed their dancing and performing sex  acts at various strip clubs, after which he confiscated their earnings. The indictment further alleged that Davis beat      2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183519, *10 Page 6 of 18   many of the adult and minor females to force them to continue working for him and to punish them for  violating [*14]  the stringent rules he had imposed. By way of example, not only did Davis allegedly punch, kick,  slap, and even cut one of the adult victims, identified as victim #4, but he also allegedly struck a minor victim,  identified as minor victim #2, with a firearm and then inserted the firearm into this minor's mouth (DE 40-3). On March 14, 2008, Davis pled guilty to Count Six of the Superseding Indictment (DE 40-2), which charged sex- trafficking of a minor (MV #1): 44. The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 31 and 33 through 35 of Count One are re-alleged and  incorporated as if fully set forth herein. 45. Beginning in or about April or early May 2005 and continuing through in or about May 2005, both dates  being approximate and inclusive, within the District of Connecticut and elsewhere, COREY DAVIS, a.k.a.  ""Magnificent,"" the defendant herein, did knowingly, in and affecting interstate commerce, recruit, entice, harbor,  transport, provide and obtain a person, that is, MV#1, and did knowingly benefit financially and receive a thing  of value from MV#1's participation in a venture which engaged in these acts, knowing that MV#1 had not  attained eighteen (18) years of age and knowing [*15]  that force, fraud, and coercion would be used to cause  MV#1 to engage in a commercial sex act. All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591(a)(1), 1591(a)(2), 1591(b)(1), and 2. (DE 40-2, ¶¶ 44-45). Count 6 incorporated by reference several paragraphs that detailed Davis's actions with respect MV #1: 3. One minor victim 1 (""MV#1""), whose true identity is known to the Grand Jury, is a girl who at the time of the  commission of the offenses was twelve-years-old. . . . 13. Beginning in or about April or early May 2005 and continuing to in or about May 2005, both dates being  approximate and inclusive, within the District of Connecticut and elsewhere, MV#1 was required to make  money for DAVIS by dancing and engaging in sexual acts at strip clubs where he directed her to work, to  engage in sexual acts at private parties where he directed her to work, and by requiring her to engage in sexual  acts at an area called the ""Track"" in Queens, New York that is known for prostitution. DAVIS drove MV#1  from New York to Connecticut for the purpose of dancing and engaging in sexual acts in exchange for money.  While in Connecticut, MV#1 primarily worked at Bishop's Corner Cafe, located in Bridgeport, Connecticut,  where it was not unusual for her to work [*16]  approximately 12 hours per day and where DAVIS often  required her to earn approximately $1,000 per day through dancing and/or engaging in unlawful sexual acts for  money. Both DAVIS and McKenzie directed MV#1 to engage in sexual activity and McKenzie told MV#1 how  much to charge for various sex acts at the various clubs. DAVIS also obtained hotel rooms for MV#1 and the  other females when they stayed in the same location for more than one day. McKenzie collected the money  from MV#1 and the other females if DAVIS was not present. MV#1 was directed to turn over all the money she  made to DAVIS and/or McKenzie. 14. In order to ensure MV#1's obedience, and to prevent her from leaving, DAVIS: (a) beat her by punching,  kicking, and slapping her; (b) humiliated and degraded MV#1 and the other females; (c) threatened MV#1 with  serious physical harm; (d) beat, humiliated, and degraded the other females in front of MV#1; and (e)  threatened the other females with serious physical harm in front of MV#1. DAVIS retained control of MV#1 by,  among other things, at various times confining her to the Queens residence. 15. In or about May 2005, MV#1 ran away from DAVIS. (DE 40-2, ¶¶ 3, 13-15). As part of his [*17]  guilty plea, Davis entered into an agreement with the Government that was filed in the court  record. See Letter Confirming Plea Agreement, Case No. 3:07-CR-00011-JCH (DE 158) (D. Ct. 2007) (available on  PACER). Pursuant to the Agreement, Davis stipulated, inter alia, to the following offense conduct: In or about May 2005, the defendant, while operating as a pimp, knowingly and unlawfully recruited, enticed,  harbored, transported, provided, and obtained a person, identified as MV #1, for purposes of causing MV #1 to  2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183519, *13 Page 7 of 18   engage in commercial sex acts. At this time, the defendant knew that MV #1 was under 18 years of age and  was a vulnerable victim. He knowingly used force, fraud, and coercion, including threats of serious harm and  physical restraint, to compel MV #1 to engage in commercial sex acts. He knowingly benefitted financially and  received things of value, including money, from the participation in a venture that engaged in recruiting,  enticing, harboring, transporting, providing, and obtaining MV #1 for purposes of engaging in commercial sex  acts. Plea Agreement at 14. As part of his plea agreement, Davis also agreed to forfeit cash and assets, including the  Queens (New York) residence [*18]  in which he had allegedly confined several of his victims, and to pay $50,000  in restitution, not only to MV #1, but to all of his victims. See Plea Agreement. In its Statement of Material Facts, PBS asserts — and, in his Response to PBS' Statement of Material Facts, Davis  does not dispute — that various media outlets with far-ranging audiences published stories about the criminal case,  including, but not limited to, the following: •  Edmund  Mahony,  Pimp  Gets  Plea  Deal  in  Sex  Case,  Hartford  Courant,  March  15,  2008,  http://articles.courant.com/2008-03-15/news/0803140674_1_women-and-girls-district-court-guilty • Queens Man Pleads Guilty to Federal Child Prostitution Charges, The Hour, March 15, 2008,  http://www.thehour.com/norwalk/article/Queens-man-pleads-guilty-to-federal-child-8251406.php • The Associated Press, Pimps Mom Loses Queens Home, N.Y.

These media accounts, which were widely disseminated, described in stark terms the nature and extent of the  abuse with which Davis was charged and made plain the impact of this criminal behavior on his reputation. An excerpt from the Hartford Courant provides insight into the coverage of one regional publication [*19]  and its  implications for Davis's reputation: A New York man accused of kidnapping young women and girls - including a 12-year old - and forcing them to  perform sex acts on street corners, at private parties and in seedy barrooms, agreed to a plea deal with federal  prosecutors in Connecticut that will send him to prison for nearly 25 years. Corey Davis, a pimp who was wearing $110,000 in jewelry when he was arrested two days after Christmas in  2006, was charged with beating the girls into submission, torturing them mentally and physically, making them  work in the sex trade 12 hours a day and taking everything they earned. . . . The indictment accused Davis, who lived in Queens, of virtually enslaving girls aged 12, 15, 17 and 18 and  forcing them to work as dancers and prostitutes in Connecticut, New York and Texas. He pleaded guilty to  criminal conduct involving the 12-year-old. According to information presented to the court, he housed the 12-year old and the others in Queens and  transported them to areas where he wanted them to work. The 12-year old told federal authorities that Davis  routinely forced her to work 12-hour days. http://articles.courant.com/2008-03-15/news/0803140674_1_women-and-girls-district-court-guilty (DE 40-4 at 2). 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183519, *17 Page 8 of 18   An excerpt from The Hour provides additional [*20]  insight into the impact of the media coverage on Davis's  reputation: A New York man pleaded guilty Friday to federal charges that he brought a 12-year-old girl into Connecticut to  work as a prostitute at a strip club. Prosecutors allege that Corey Davis, 35, of Queens forced several underage girls into prostitution in 2005  under threats of rapes, beatings and forced confinement. Davis faces at least 23 years in prison at his sentencing on June 2. According to the indictment, the 12-year-old worked primarily at the Bishop's Corner Cafe and was required to  earn $1,000 a day. The girls worked as long as 12 hours a day and were forced to telephone Davis for permission to take breaks  or eat, according to the indictment.

And an excerpt from The New York Times, a publication with an international audience, shed yet additional light on  the alleged abuse and, by implication, its impact on Davis's reputation: What sort of person subjects children as young as 12 to beatings and a life of prostitution? An evidence list . .  . submitted in the case of Corey Davis, a Queens man who billed himself as [*21]  ""Magnificent,"" might provide  some insight. Mr. Davis, 36, is facing a minimum of 23 years in prison after pleading guilty in March to a federal  charge of sex trafficking involving a 12-year-old runaway. . . . . The evidence list, which records the books found in Mr. Davis's car the day of his arrest, as well as other  personal effects, provides some clues. There is his T-shirt with the logo: ""The Beatings Will Continue."" A $91,000 designer watch. And some  Timberland boots, which prosecutors say he wore when he felt the need to stomp on underlings to make his  point. But one curiosity is the eclectic mix of things Mr. Davis was apparently reading when he was not, as authorities  contend, locking up women and girls in his mother's house in Queens, driving them to strip clubs in  Connecticut or doling out beatings. (One underage recruit told the police that Mr. Davis once put a gun in her  mouth to scare her.) His tastes apparently ran from a book on racial injustice to a book on the sex trade. Alison  Cowan,  What  a  Pimp  Reads,  N.Y.  Times,  July  18,  2008,  https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/what-a-pimp-reads/comment-page-2/(DE 40-4 at 5). PBS further asserts — and, again, it is not disputed — that the FBI included Corey Davis in its 2011 publication of  notorious sex trafficking [*22]  cases: ""In December 2008, Corey Davis, the ringleader of a sex-trafficking ring  that spanned at least three states, was sentenced in federal court in Bridgeport, Connecticut, on federal civil rights  charges for organizing and leading the sex-trafficking operation that exploited as many as 20 females, including  minors. . . . Davis admitted that he recruited a minor to engage in prostitution; that he was the organizer of a sex- trafficking venture; and that he used force, fraud, and coercion to compel the victim to commit commercial sex  acts from which he obtained the proceeds"" (DE 40-5 at 5). Eight months after entering his guilty plea, Davis moved to withdraw the plea. In a reported opinion, the court  denied the motion, concluding that the plea had been freely and voluntarily given. See United States v. Davis, 2008  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99802, 2008 WL 5191814 (Nov. 26, 2008 D. Ct). In doing so, the court reiterated the stipulated  offense conduct attached to the plea agreement, thereby re-publicizing the previously publicized details of Davis's  physical and sexual abuse, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99802, [WL] at *2-3. 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183519, *19 Page 9 of 18   In advance of the sentencing, the Government filed a Sentencing Memorandum that further illuminated the physical  and sexual abuse and its impact on Davis's reputation. According to the Memorandum, [*23]  Davis stands  ""accused of essentially enslaving children and young women and forcing them into a hellish existence of extreme  brutality and prostitution."" Sentencing Memorandum, Case No. 3:07-CR-00011-JCH (DE 179 at 1) (D. Ct. 2007)  (available on PACER). The Memorandum detailed the abuse Davis inflicted on the victims referenced in the  indictment, and it was accompanied by impact statements from two of the victims. One statement, written by a  minor victim, recounts how Davis pimped her for his own profit, how he deprived her of food (causing her to drop  from 184 pounds to 123 pounds in a month and a half), how he berated, beat, and stomped on her, and how he  confined her in a basement. This victim concluded: ""This traumatic experience has scar[r]ed me for life emotionally,  physically and mentally...."" Id. MV#2's Victim Impact Statement (attached to Sentencing Memorandum). On December 19, 2008, Davis appeared for the sentencing hearing. The judge first heard from the parents of two  minor victims (MV #1 and MV #4) both of whom told the judge that Davis had traumatized and psychologically  damaged their daughters. Sentencing Transcript, Case No. 3:07-CR-00011-JCH, at 96-98 (D. Ct. 2007) (DE 242)  (available on Pacer). Additionally, [*24]  the attorney for one of the adult victims (victim #4) read a letter written by  his client in which she stated that even after turning over to Davis $1,000 each day from her prostitution earnings,  Davis would nonetheless inflict physical abuse by punching her. Id. at 102. The district judge then addressed the stipulated facts as to the minor victim in Count 6. In open court, the judge  stated that Davis had ""subjected a 12-year-old child to sexual abuse,"" which the judge characterized as ""slavery ...  by another name."" Id. at 118-19. The judge elaborated: ""[Davis] has admitted that he used force, fraud and  coercion including threats of serious harm and physical restraint to compel the Minor Victim 1 to do what he  wanted her to do and what he wanted her to do was to engage in sex acts, sex dancing what else. All of which  would benefit Mr. Davis financially."" Id. at 119. She continued: ""As I said, he has stipulated that he knew she was a  minor and that he knew she was a vulnerable victim. She was as a matter of fact 12 years old."" Id. at 120. The judge then turned to Davis's criminal record and employment history. She noted that he was previously  convicted ""of very serious gun running charges"" involving the illegal transport of ""more [*25]  than 150 firearms."" Id.  at 121. And she noted that Davis ""has apparently engaged in no lawful line of work."" Id. at 123. Based upon this record, the judge imposed a sentence of 293 months' imprisonment followed by a period of  supervised release for life, a fine of $200,000, restitution to all of Davis's victims (not only the victim of the offense  of conviction), and a special assessment. A specific condition of Davis's supervised release is his registering as a  sex offender in any state in which he resides or is employed and his participating in sex offender treatment. Id. at  130. Davis subsequently filed an appeal with the Second Circuit, which was dismissed. United States v. Davis, Case No.  09-0145-CR (2d Cir. January 4, 2011). He then filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court, which  was denied. (Case No. 10-11145). Davis v. United States, 565 U.S. 933, 132 S. Ct. 377, 181 L. Ed. 2d 238 (2011). One year later, Davis collaterally attacked his conviction and guilty plea, claiming that Shamere McKenzie's grand  jury testimony was ""rife with perjury"" and that the Government had obtained the original indictment by knowingly  offering perjured testimony. Davis v. United States, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35391, 2015 WL 1277011, at **7, 9  (March 20, 2015 D. Ct). The same district judge who presided over his change of plea and sentencing wrote an  extensive opinion [*26]  denying relief, in which she described the violent and abusive conduct set forth in the plea  agreement. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35391, [WL] at *1. The judge additionally noted that had Davis elected to  proceed to trial, the Government's evidence against him would have been ""overwhelming""; it would have ""included  sworn testimony from all of the victims identified in the Superseding Indictment, two of whom were minor victims,""  and ""[m]oreover, Davis' co-conspirator agreed to cooperate with the government."" 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35391,  [WL] at *14. In sum, the evidentiary details of Davis's sex trafficking activities have been widely disseminated, not  only through media outlets with regional and international audiences, but also in several publically available court  orders and opinions. 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183519, *22 Page 10 of 18   Davis was charged with another criminal offense following a May 2009 incident at the Metropolitan Detention  Center in Brooklyn, New York, wherein he was accused of striking a fellow inmate four times in the face and  breaking his jaw. Davis was convicted of assault resulting in serious bodily injury and sentenced to a 60-month term  of imprisonment, to be served consecutively to his 293-month term of imprisonment for sex-trafficking of a minor.  Thereafter, the Second Circuit (in two opinions) affirmed [*27]  the judgment, and the Supreme Court denied  certiorari. See United States v. Davis, 531 Fed. Appx. 65, 726 F.3d 357 (2d Cir. 2013), cert. denied 135 S. Ct. 48,  190 L. Ed. 2d 53 (2014). C. Davis's Non-Criminal History Among the documents that Davis submitted with his Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment is a declaration that sets  forth his background (DE 62). In his youth, he excelled in sports and was captain of his schools' basketball and  football teams. He wrote for his high school newspaper and organized protests against racial discrimination.  Following high school, he attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, where he became involved in several  campus activities, including tutoring children and coaching sports. He eventually left school because he could not  afford the tuition. He returned to New York and worked as an audience coordinator for a television show and as a  freelance production coordinator. D. Davis's Relationship with McKenzie Davis declares that McKenzie was never a victim, but a business partner who benefitted greatly from her activities.  According to Davis, Mckenzie had been involved in prostitution before she met him, and she continued to be  involved in prostitution after he ended their association. Davis asserts that the broadcast allegations that  McKenzie was raped, sodomized, [*28]  menaced with a firearm, and threatened into prostitution by her pimp (by  implication, Davis) are false. Davis maintains that McKenzie's false allegations damaged his reputation among his  family, friends, and fellow inmates. E. Findings of Fact On this record, the undersigned finds that Davis thoroughly destroyed whatever favorable reputation he may have  once enjoyed when he adopted a criminal lifestyle that incorporated repeated acts of violence and physical and  sexual abuse, not only of adults but of minors as well. It is against this reputational status that the undersigned  assesses the impact of the additional allegations of violence and physical and sexual abuse raised by another  individual, an adult (McKenzie), involved in Davis's sex trafficking operation. VI. DISCUSSION A. Law of Defamation Davis claims that he was libeled and defamed by the PBS broadcast of the McKenzie interview in which she  (falsely) alleged that her trafficker or pimp — by implication, Davis — had physically and sexually abused her.  Complaint ¶¶ 57-76, 96- 97 (DE 1). As Davis has invoked this Court's diversity jurisdiction, Florida law governs his  libel and defamation claims. And ""[i]n Florida, defamation encompasses [*29]  both libel and slander ...."" IBP, Inc. v.  Hady Enters., Inc., 267 F. Supp. 2d 1148, 1163 (N.D. Fla. 2002) (citation omitted). Under Florida law, ""[d]efamation has the following five elements: (1) publication; (2) falsity: (3) actor must act with  knowledge or reckless disregard as to the falsity on a matter concerning a public official, or at least negligently on a  matter concerning a private person; (4) actual damages; and (5) statement must be defamatory."" Jews for Jesus,  Inc. v. Rapp, 997 So. 2d 1098, 1106 (Fla. 2008) (emphasis added).                2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183519, *26 Page 11 of 18   A ""defamatory statement"" is defined as ""one that tends to harm the reputation of another by lowering him or her in  the estimation of the community or, more broadly stated, one that exposes a plaintiff to hatred, ridicule, or contempt  or injures his business or reputation or occupation."" Id. at 1108-09 (emphasis added). According to the Florida  Supreme Court, reputation is the fundamental interest protected by the law of defamation: ""a defamation plaintiff  must prove injury to his or her reputation in the community."" Id. at 1109 (stating that ""in defamation cases the  interest sought to be protected is the objective one of reputation"" (emphasis in original) (internal quotations and  citation omitted)). Furthermore, the Florida Supreme Court has adopted a ""community"" standard for defamation  claims: to be defamatory, a communication [*30]  must prejudice a plaintiff in the eyes of a ""substantial and  respectable"" minority of the community. Id. at 1114-15. At issue here is Davis's ability to establish both the second and the fifth elements of the defamation claim — ""falsity""  and ""defamatory."" Although these elements are conceptually distinct, they are both grounded on the reputational  impact of the allegedly defamatory statement. B. Failure to State a Claim — Inability to Establish ""Falsity"" Element of Claims Although ""[a] false statement of fact is the sine qua non for recovery in a defamation action,"" Byrd v. Hustler  Magazine, Inc., 433 So.2d 593, 595 (Fla. 4th DCA 1983), ""[u]nder the substantial truth doctrine, a statement does  not have to be perfectly accurate if the 'gist' or the 'sting' of the statement is true,"" Smith v. Cuban Am. Nat'l Found.,  731 So. 2d 702, 706-07 (Fla. 3d DCA 1999) (explaining falsity only exists where ""the publication is substantially and  materially false, not just if it is technically false""). Moreover, ""[a] statement is not considered false unless it would  have a different effect on the mind of the reader from that which the pleaded truth would have produced."" Id. at 706  (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, 501 U.S. 496, 517, 111 S. Ct. 2419,  115 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1991) (other citations omitted)); see also Nelson v. Associated Press, Inc., 667 F. Supp. 1468,  1480 (S.D. Fla.1987). Although Davis never disclosed either the filing or the dismissal to this Court, PBS disclosed (in its Reply) [*31]  not  only that Davis had filed a nearly identical defamation action in the Northern District of Illinois (""the Illinois Action"")  but also that the Illinois Action was subsequently dismissed with prejudice for failing to state a claim (under Florida  law) pursuant to § 1915(e)(2), (g) (DE 68-1 at 7). See Order (DE 20), Davis v. McKenzie, et. al, Case No.  16cv10240, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 185447 (N.D. III. 2017) (DE 20) (attached to PBS Reply as DE 68-1). In the  Illinois Action, Davis had sued Shamere McKenzie, Sun Gate Foundation, and Hannah Terry (but not PBS) based  on the same Loyola University speech and the same Hannah Terry website article for which he sued the same  three defendants in this Court (""the Florida Action""). Indeed, not only were both suits against the three defendants  based on the same cause of action but most of the claims were identical. Compare Amended Complaint (DE 18),  Davis v. McKenzie, et. al, Case No. 16cv10240 (N.D. III. 2016) with Complaint (DE 1), Davis v. McKenzie, et. al,  Case No. 16cv62499 (S.D. Fla. 2016). Significantly, upon his initial screening of the Illinois Action, District Judge Manish Shah relied upon the ""substantial  truth"" doctrine and Florida law to conclude that Davis could not establish [*32]  the ""falsity"" element of his  defamation claims (DE 68-1). According to Judge Shah, whether or not McKenzie was an additional victim, her  allegations were ""substantially true"" because they produced no different effect on the mind of the reader as far as  Davis's reputation was concerned than that produced by his own admission in his guilty plea; her allegations,           2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183519, *29 Page 12 of 18   therefore, did not cause any incremental damage to Davis's reputation (DE 68-1 at 5-6). Judge Shah's reasoning is  instructive: Here the Loyola speech and website article are both substantially true because their ""gist"" or ""sting"" with  respect to Plaintiff's reputation is the same as that of his guilty plea. As set forth above, Plaintiff pleaded guilty  to sex trafficking, thereby publicly admitting to coercing a minor victim to engage in commercial sex acts,  including through threats of serious harm and physical restraint. Whether McKenzie was an additional victim of  the sex trafficking operation or not, neither the Loyola speech nor the website article did any additional  incremental damage to Plaintiff's reputation above that caused by the guilty plea. The number of victims in a  criminal scheme is not a detail that affects substantial [*33]  truth, one Florida court has recently concluded: Here, regardless of whether K.J. was alleged by the police to have bullied ""dozens"" of victims or ""at least  one"" victim, the statement communicates the same ""gist"" to the audience.... The exact number of victims  alleged to have been personally bullied by the four accused teens is a detail that does not affect the  substantial truth of the statement or the ""gist"" conveyed to the audience. It therefore cannot state a claim  for defamation. Jeter [v. McKeithen], No. 5:14-CV-00189-RS-EMT, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142857, 2014 WL 4996247 at *3  [(N.D. Fla. Oct. 7, 2014)]; see also Haynes v. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 8 F.3d 1222, 1228 (7th Cir. 1993) (""The rule  of substantial truth is based on a recognition that falsehoods which do no incremental damage to the plaintiff's  reputation do not injure the only interest that the law of defamation protects. A news report that contains a false  statement is actionable only when significantly greater opprobrium results from the report containing the  falsehood than would result from the report without the falsehood."") (emphasis in original) (internal citations  and quotations omitted). The Loyola speech and website article detailing McKenzie's alleged victimization  produce no ""different effect on the mind of the reader"" as far as Plaintiff's reputation is concerned [*34]  than  that produced by his own admission in his guilty Plea. Klayman [v. Judicial Watch, Inc.], 22 F. Supp. 3d [1240]  at 1253-54 [(S.D. Fla. 2014)]. Thus, neither the speech nor article supports a defamation claim. The  defamation/slander/libel per se claims are all dismissed. (DE 68-1 at 5-6) (emphasis added). In sum, McKenzie's claim that she too was physically and sexually abused  could not cause any incremental damage to Davis's reputation above that previously caused by his admitted sex  trafficking of a minor and the physical and sexual abuse attendant thereto. Judge Shah's reasoning applies fully to McKenzie's PBS interview at issue here. The abuse alleged by McKenzie in  the Loyola speech and in the Terry article at issue in the Illinois Action is either identical, or very similar, to the  abuse she alleged in the PBS interview. Compare Amended Complaint ¶¶ 23, 25, 27, 43-50, and 53 (DE 18), Davis  v. McKenzie, et. al, Case No. 16cv10240 (N.D. III. 2016) with Complaint ¶¶ 58, 60, 62, 64, and 66 (DE 1), Davis v.  McKenzie, et. al, Case No. 16cv62499 (S.D. Fla. 2016). As Judge Shah had concluded with respect to the Loyola  speech and Terry website article, the PBS interview is also substantially true because its ""gist"" or ""sting"" with  respect to Davis's reputation [*35]  is the same as that of his guilty plea. And like the Loyola speech and Terry  article, the PBS interview ""detailing McKenzie's alleged victimization produce[s] no different effect on the mind of  the reader as far as [Davis's] reputation is concerned than that produced by his own admission in his guilty plea""  (DE 68-1 at 6). Furthermore, although Judge Shah predicated his conclusion solely upon Davis's guilty plea to sex  trafficking of a minor, the undersigned has additionally considered Davis's media coverage resulting from the sex  trafficking prosecution and his conviction for assault resulting in serious bodily injury. These considerations only  reinforce the conclusion that the additional allegations of violence and abuse raised by another participant  (McKenzie) in Davis's sex trafficking operation did not — indeed, could not — cause any incremental damage to  what remained of his reputation. See Jeter, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142857, 2014 WL 4996247, at * 3 (stating that  ""[t]he exact number of victims alleged to have been personally bullied ... is a detail that does not affect the  substantial truth of the statement""). In sum, whether or not McKenzie was actually an additional victim of Davis's sex trafficking operation, her  allegations of violence and abuse [*36]  broadcast by PBS are ""substantially true"" as a matter of law because they  2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183519, *32 Page 13 of 18   produce no different effect on the mind of the listener or reader as far as Davis's reputation is concerned than that  produced by his admitted sex trafficking of a minor and the accompanying publicity, as well as by his additional  conviction for assault resulting in serious bodily injury. Because Davis cannot establish the ""falsity"" element of his  defamation and libel claims, he cannot state a claim on which relief may be granted and his claims against PBS —  Claim 20 and Claim 21 — should be dismissed with prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and (g). C. Failure to State a Claim — Inability to Establish ""Defamatory"" Element of Claims Whereas Judge Shah relied on the ""substantial truth"" doctrine to conclude that Davis cannot establish the ""falsity""  element of his claims, PBS relies on a related doctrine, the ""libel-proof plaintiff"" doctrine, to effectively argue that  Davis cannot establish the ""defamatory"" element of his claims. See Kevin L. Kite, Incremental Identities: Libel-Proof  Plaintiffs, Substantial Truth, and the Future of the Incremental Harm Doctrine, 73 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 529, 538 (1998) (""If  the substantial truth doctrine may be viewed as crippling the [*37]  falsehood prong of the plaintiff's claim, the libel- proof plaintiff doctrine may be viewed as crippling the defamation prong.""). Because both doctrines are grounded on  the reputational impact of the allegedly defamatory statement, the analyses are substantially similar. 1. Law Succinctly stated, ""The libel proof plaintiff doctrine prohibits a plaintiff from recovering for libelous statements where  the plaintiff's reputation in the community was so tarnished before the publication that no further harm could have  occurred."" Schiavone Const. Co. v. Time, Inc., 847 F.2d 1069, 1079 (3d Cir. 1988) (citations and internal quotations  omitted). The Second Circuit is regarded as the pioneer of the libel-proof plaintiff doctrine. In 1975, it wrote that a  habitual criminal serving a 21-year sentence for assorted federal felonies was, as a matter of law, libel-proof: ""[W]e  consider as a matter of law that appellant is, for purposes of this case, libel-proof, i.e., so unlikely by virtue of his life  as a habitual criminal to be able to recover anything other than nominal damages as to warrant dismissal of the  case."" Cardillo v. Doubleday & Co., 518 F.2d 638, 639 (2d Cir. 1975). Although ""criminal convictions were the  principal basis for the low reputation of the libel-proof plaintiff in Cardillo, the doctrine is not limited to plaintiffs [*38]   with criminal records."" Guccione v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 800 F.2d 298, 303, 304 (2d Cir. 1986) (opining that  newspaper and magazine articles, even articles published years earlier, may be considered in assessing a plaintiff's  reputation). The libel-proof plaintiff doctrine has often been invoked in circumstances quite similar to the instant case, that is,  where a prison inmate has brought a defamation action against a media entity that has reported on his crimes. In  one such instance, an inmate serving three life sentences for murder and kidnapping had brought a claim against a  newspaper reporter who had written two articles about his criminal history. Lamb v. Rizzo, 391 F.3d 1133 (10th Cir.  2004). The district court had granted the reporter's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and the Tenth  Circuit affirmed, stating that the libel-proof plaintiff doctrine bars actions by plaintiffs whose reputations are  incapable of sustaining further harm. Id. at 1135. In a more recent case, the Fifth Circuit affirmed a district court's  dismissal of defamation claims brought by an inmate serving a life term after pleading guilty to two counts of first  degree murder; the inmate had sued ""Dateline NBC,"" alleging that a television report on the investigation,  prosecution, and conviction for murder contained false [*39]  statements and inaccuracies. Lavergne v. Dateline  NBC, 597 Fed. Appx. 760, 761 (5th Cir. 2015). The magistrate judge had recommended that the plaintiff's  defamation claims be dismissed because they were not actionable as a matter of law under the libel-proof plaintiff  doctrine. See id. at 762. The district court agreed, stating that ""[t]he complained of defamatory statements could  not, as a matter of law, damage Lavergne's reputation so as to lower Lavergne in the estimation of the community,  deter others from associating or dealing with Lavergne, or otherwise expose Lavergne to contempt or ridicule any  more than he has already been lowered, outcast, held in contempt and ridiculed as a result of his double murder  conviction."" 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32210, at *19. 2. Analysis a. The Florida Supreme Court 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183519, *36 Page 14 of 18   Although multiple jurisdictions have adopted the libel-proof plaintiff doctrine, the Florida Supreme Court has yet to  consider its adoption. Sitting in diversity, the undersigned is therefore tasked with determining whether the Florida  Supreme Court would adopt the doctrine were it presented the opportunity to do so. Where the Florida Supreme  Court has yet to decide a matter of state substantive law, and where such a decision would govern a diversity  action in the federal court, the Eleventh Circuit [*40]  has provided the following guidance: [Where] the Florida Supreme Court has not spoken definitively on the issues before us ... we look to relevant  decisions of Florida's intermediate appellate courts In the absence of precedents from Florida's intermediate  appellate courts, however, we may consider the case law of other jurisdictions that have examined similar  policy provisions. Our objective is to determine issues of state law as we believe the Florida Supreme Court  would, therefore a federal court attempting to forecast state law must consider whatever might lend it insight,  including relevant state precedents, analogous decisions, considered dicta, scholarly works, and any other  reliable data tending convincingly to show how the highest court in the state would decide the issue at hand. Guideone Elite Ins. Co. v. Old Cutler Presbyterian Church Inc., 420 F.3d 1317, 1326 n. 5 (11th Cir. 2005) (citations  and internal quotations omitted); accord Attorney's Title Insurance Fund, Inc. v. Regions Bank, 491 F. Supp. 2d  1087, 1093 n. 2 (S.D. Fla. 2007). Here, PBS has provided cogent argument as to why the Florida Supreme Court would adopt the libel-proof plaintiff  doctrine. PBS asserts that ""the overwhelming majority of courts to address the doctrine in similar circumstances  have adopted"" it for the reasons articulated by the court in Lavergne: [T]he doctrine logically recognizes that without [*41]  damage to reputation, there is no actionable defamation.  Accordingly, the doctrine has [] most often been applied to plaintiffs with felony criminal convictions who are  notorious for their past criminal acts, because the plaintiff's reputation is so poor that he is unlikely, as a matter  of law, to recover more than nominal damages for an allegedly defamatory publication. PBS Motion at 14-15 (DE 40) (quoting Lavergne, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32210, at *13 (emphasis added)). As PBS  observes, ""courts adopting the doctrine recognize that the central interest to be considered is the reputation of the  plaintiff."" Id. at 15 (DE 40). PBS further observes that ""[o]n this point, it is clear that the Florida Supreme Court is in  full accord with this focus."" Id. Indeed, Florida juries are instructed that a ""defamatory statement"" is ""one that tends  to harm the reputation of another ... or injures his business or reputation or occupation. Standard Jury Instructions- Civil Cases (No. 00-1), 795 So. 2d at 55."" Jews for Jesus, 997 So. 2d at 1108-09 (emphasis added). PBS  concludes that between Florida and those jurisdictions that have adopted the libel-proof plaintiff doctrine, there  exists a near identical focus on reputational injury. The undersigned's own research has not uncovered any cases in which the Florida Supreme [*42]  Court has  considered the libel-proof plaintiff doctrine; however, it has uncovered a case (arising on opposite facts) in which it  recognized the principle that only nominal damages may be awarded where a publication has not resulted in any  additional harm to a (good) reputation. In Miami Herald Co. v. Brown, 66 So. 2d 679 (Fla. 1953), the plaintiff brought  an action for libel per se against a newspaper for incorrectly publishing his picture over the name of an alleged  (illegal) lottery operator. The Florida Supreme Court held, inter alia, that because the plaintiff had enjoyed a good  reputation before the publication and because his reputation remained unimpaired thereafter, he was entitled to no  more than nominal damages. Id. at 681 (asking, ""How can it be said that his reputation suffered when the witnesses  of his choice swore it was good before and afterward?""). The principle that in the absence of reputational harm a  plaintiff cannot recover more than nominal damages would logically apply not only where the plaintiff's reputation  (before and after the publication) is good but also where it is poor.      2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183519, *39 Page 15 of 18   The undersigned further notes that the declared policy of the State of Florida, as enunciated by the Legislature, is to  spare individuals and entities [*43]  the burden and expense of defending meritless defamation claims, particularly  as concerns issues of public interest. This policy is not only consistent with, but would fully support, the Florida  Supreme Court's adopting the libel-proof plaintiff doctrine. More specifically, in the preamble to Florida's anti-SLAPP  statute, the Legislature made clear that lawsuits ""without merit"" filed against citizens who have exercised their  constitutional rights on matters of public policy are ""[abusing] the judicial process"" by putting defendants through  ""great expense""; it added that efforts to control these ""lawsuits will make a major contribution to lawsuit reform."" Fla.  Stat. § 768.295, Historical and Statutory Notes, Preamble. And in the text of the statute itself, the Florida Legislature  made clear that ""prohibiti[ng] such lawsuits"" preserves a ""fundamental state policy."" Fla. Stat. § 768.295(1). Indeed,  a Texas appellate court cited such policy interests in support of the libel-proof plaintiff doctrine. Finklea v.  Jacksonville Daily Progress, 742 S.W.2d 512, 517-18 (Tex. App. 1987) (stating that ""the imposition upon the  defendants of the difficulty and expense of a further defense would . . . place upon them a burden inimical to 'the  vigorous exercise of First Amendment freedoms'""). In sum, given the focus of Florida defamation law on reputational [*44]  interests, given the view of courts in other  jurisdictions confronting similar facts, and given Florida's declared policy of sparing individuals and entities the  burden and expense of defending against meritless defamation claims (particularly on matters of public concern),  the undersigned agrees that the Florida Supreme Court would, on the present facts, adopt the libel-proof plaintiff  doctrine. b. Davis's Reputation PBS argues that McKenzie's broadcast allegations of physical and sexual abuse could not further damage Davis's  reputation given the devastating impact of his criminal history and the attendant media publicity. Davis counters that  McKenzie's allegations of physical and sexual abuse have damaged his reputation among his family, friends, and  fellow inmates to a greater extent than did the allegations to which he pled guilty. ""To justify appl[ication] [of] the ['libel-proof plaintiff'] doctrine, ... the record must [demonstrate] not only that the  plaintiff [has] engaged in criminal or antisocial behavior in the past, but also that his activities were widely reported  to the public, . . . [and that his] reputation could not [therefore] have suffered [any more] from the publication of the  false [*45]  and libelous statement."" Thomas v. Telegraph Publ'g, Co., 155 N.H. 314, 929 A.2d 991, 1005 (N.H.  2007) (citation omitted). Corey Davis satisfies these criteria. As detailed above, see supra at 10-20, Davis's documented history of violence and of physical and sexual abuse,  coupled with the widespread media accounts of his alleged abuse of several adult and minor females, have so  thoroughly damaged his reputation that as a matter of law he cannot recover more than nominal damages as a  result of the PBS broadcast. Davis, therefore, is libel-proof with respect to the additional allegations of physical and  sexual abuse made by another participant, an adult (McKenzie), involved in his sex trafficking operation and  broadcast by PBS. In this respect, Davis is similarly situated to another libel-proof plaintiff, Robert Cardillo — an  individual serving a 21-year sentence for assorted federal felonies, who denied involvement in the additional crimes  that had been set forth in a book — of whom the Second Circuit wrote: ""With Cardillo himself having a record . . .  like th[is], we cannot envisage any jury awarding, or court sustaining, an award under any circumstances for more  than a few cents' damages, even if Cardillo were to prevail on the difficult legal issues with which he would be  faced."" [*46]  Cardillo, 518 F.2d at 640; accord Thomas, 929 A.2d at 1004 (""The issue-specific version [of the libel- proof plaintiff doctrine] is typically applied to justify dismissal of defamation actions where the substantial criminal  record of a libel plaintiff shows as a matter of law that he would be unable to recover other than nominal damages."")  (internal quotations and citations omitted). Indeed, the sex-trafficking (of a minor) conviction that Davis referenced  in his Complaint, standing alone, would render him libel-proof as to McKenzie's allegations that she too had been  physically and sexually abused by Davis. For these reasons, the undersigned concludes that Davis is unable to satisfy not only the ""falsity"" element, but also  the ""defamatory"" element of his claims. On either or both of these grounds, therefore, Claim 20 and Claim 21  should be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and (g) for failure to state a claim on which relief may  be granted. 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183519, *42 Page 16 of 18   D. Summary Judgment — No Genuine Dispute of Material Fact To the extent that the undersigned's reliance on documents outside the four corners of the Complaint may be  construed as having converted the instant analysis into one for summary judgment, the libel and defamation claims  fail nonetheless. In this matter, [*47]  there exists no genuine dispute as to any material fact, and PBS is entitled to  judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (""The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant  shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of  law.""). PBS and Davis have each moved for summary judgment, PBS under Florida's anti-SLAPP statute and Davis under  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Although it is not clear whether Florida's anti-SLAPP statute, which includes a provision for  expedited review, applies in federal diversity actions, see discussion supra at 5-7, it is clear that the Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure do apply and, moreover, in appropriate cases provide their own vehicle for expedited review.  More specifically, Rule 56(b) expressly provides that ""a party may move for summary judgment at any time until 30  days after the close of all discovery."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(b) (emphasis added). Significantly, the Federal Rules do  not require a defendant to have first answered a complaint before a court may consider a motion for summary  judgment. See, e.g., Jones v. United States Dept. Of Justice, 601 F. Supp. 2d 297, 302 (D.D.C. 2009) (""A  defendant, however, is not required to respond in the form of an answer before making a motion for summary  judgment, which may be made by a defending party [*48]  'at any time.'""); 11 J. Moore et al., Moore's Federal  Practice, p. 11-56 at § 56.60[1]-[2][a] (2011) (""Rule 56 does not limit how early a party may move for summary  judgment. ... No party has to wait for a responsive pleading before filing a summary judgment motion.""). Nor do the  Federal Rules require that discovery be had before summary judgment is rendered; in appropriate circumstances,  summary judgment may be granted prior to discovery. See, e.g., Waterloo Furniture Components, Ltd. v. Haworth,  Inc., 467 F.3d 641, 648 (7th Cir. 2011) (the fact that discovery not complete or even begun need not defeat motion  for summary judgment); Alholm v. Am. Steamship Co., 144 F.3d 1172, 1177 (8th Cir. 1998) (""A defendant may  move for summary judgment 'at any time,' and the rules do not require that discovery be completed before the  motion is heard.""); Washington v. Allstate Ins. Co., 901 F.2d 1281, 1285 (5th Cir. 1990) (""Rule 56 does not require  that any discovery take place before summary judgment can be granted.""). Indeed, although its general rule is to  first permit an opportunity for discovery, the Eleventh Circuit has repeatedly declined to adopt a blanket prohibition  on the granting of summary judgment before discovery. See Garmley v. Cochran, 651 Fed. Appx. 933, 936 (11th  Cir. 2016); Reflectone, Inc. v. Farrand Optical Company, Inc., 862 F.2d 841, 843 (11th Cir. 1989). Preliminarily, the undersigned notes that PBS and Davis have each affirmatively moved this Court for summary  judgment. Therefore, to the extent either party may have had any objection to the Court's considering [*49]   summary judgment at this stage of the litigation, those objections have been waived. Furthermore, as each party  has attached to its respective motion voluminous exhibits, neither can claim prejudice by the Court's consideration  of such exhibits. See Lamb, 391 F.3d at 1136-37 (stating that plaintiff could not claim prejudice from the court's  consideration of exhibits attached to motion and noting that he had even filed his own exhibits in response). Indeed,  in his Response to PBS' Statement of Material Facts (DE 60), Davis did not deny (but agreed to) PBS's statements  regarding his indictment, guilty plea, and attendant media publicity, which it supported with attached exhibits. Nor  can Davis reasonably object to the Court judicially noticing the publicly available records of his own criminal  proceedings, particularly after he invited this examination by asserting that he and McKenzie are linked ""by way of  court records and other information in the public domain."" Complaint ¶ 30. Moreover, even had the parties not waived any objection to the early consideration of summary judgment, the facts  here would warrant the Court mitigating the burden, the time, and the expense of litigation by resolving the case in  advance [*50]  of discovery. In this matter, discovery would serve no legitimate purpose, as none of the material  facts are in dispute: Davis was accused of physical and sexual abuse by several adult and minor females; Davis  was indicted for sex trafficking, kidnapping, forced labor, and transporting a minor for immoral purposes; Davis's  media publicity was widely disseminated and included victim accounts detailing the alleged abuse; Davis pled guilty  to sex trafficking of a minor; Davis's sentencing judge characterized his abuse of this minor victim, who she noted  was only 12 years' old, as ""slavery ... by another name""; Davis received a sentence of 293 months' imprisonment  on the sex trafficking of a minor charge; Davis's judge wrote that had he proceeded to trial the evidence against  2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183519, *46 Page 17 of 18   him, including the ""sworn testimony from all of the victims ... two of whom were minor victims,"" would have been  ""overwhelming""; and Davis was subsequently convicted of assault resulting in serious bodily injury and sentenced  to a consecutive 60 months' imprisonment. These facts are dispositive of Davis's defamation claims and entitle PBS  to a judgment as a matter of law. They make plain that Davis's reputation had [*51]  been so thoroughly damaged  by his repeated acts of violence and physical and sexual abuse that the additional abuse allegations raised by  McKenzie did not result in any incremental harm to his reputation and did not allow for his recovering any more than  nominal damages. Indeed, given Davis's convictions for assault resulting in serious bodily injury and sex- trafficking of a minor, coupled with the well-publicized allegations of his physically and sexually abusing several  females, including some as young as ages 17, 15, and 12, the notion that the physical and sexual abuse allegations  of another individual, an adult (McKenzie), has caused his reputation to suffer harm is frivolous. Accordingly, the  claims against PBS additionally warrant dismissal as ""frivolous or malicious"" pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §  1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (g). Moreover, Davis's criminal history and attendant publicity render his very invocation of this Court's diversity  jurisdiction frivolous. Davis's memorandum in support of his Motion asserts, summarily, that he ""has sued for  damages in excess of $75,000, thus satisfying the § 1332 sum controversy requirements"" and, further, that ""there is  no genuine dispute as to whether this action is properly brought [*52]  and heard in the Southern District of Florida.""  Davis's Memorandum at 18 (DE 58). The undersigned agrees that there is no genuine dispute as to whether Davis  can prove damages in excess of $75,000, but concludes that on the undisputed facts in this record he cannot do so. It is well-settled that a district court may examine pleadings and make ""reasonable deductions"" in assessing the  amount in controversy: Eleventh Circuit precedent permits district courts to make reasonable deductions, reasonable inferences, or  other reasonable extrapolations from the pleadings to determine whether it is facially apparent that [jurisdiction  exists]. Put simply, a district court need not suspend reality or shelve common sense in determining whether  the face of a complaint . . . establishes the jurisdictional amount. Roe v. Michelin N. Am., Inc., 613 F.3d 1058, 1061-62 (11th Cir. 2010) (citations and internal quotations omitted). On the present facts, this Court ""need not suspend reality or shelve common sense"" to determine that Davis is  incapable of satisfying the $75,000 jurisdictional threshold. See Roe, 613 F.3d at 1061-62. Given Davis's  documented history of violence and abuse, including the sex trafficking conviction apparent from the face of the  Complaint, this Court can draw the reasonable [*53]  inference that he cannot not prove damages in excess of  $75,000 as a result of McKenzie's additional allegations of abuse. See Lavergne, 597 Fed. Appx. at 762  (concluding, in the alternative, that the requisite amount in controversy was lacking in light of plaintiff's libel-proof  status, which permitted an award of, at most, nominal damages). In sum, whether it is judged by the face of the  Complaint or by the undisputed evidence in the record, Davis's invocation of this Court's diversity jurisdiction is itself  frivolous and constitutes an additional basis for dismissing the claims as ""frivolous or malicious"" under 28 U.S.C. §  1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (g).",1
"United States v. Cutler, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 32169","KOBES, Circuit Judge. Jordan Cutler pleaded guilty to distributing child  pornography, 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2). The district court  varied up from a Guidelines range of 108 to 135 months  and sentenced him to 180 months in prison. Cutler  argues that the court procedurally erred in calculating  the Guidelines range and that his sentence is  substantively unreasonable. We affirm. I. Cutler says that the district court erred by assessing one  criminal history point under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(c) for a set  of uncounseled Arkansas misdemeanors from 2010.  See United States v. Luscombe, 950 F.3d 1021, 1031  (8th Cir. 2020) (HN1[ ] ""[Significant procedural] errors  include . . . incorrectly calculating[] the Guidelines range  . . . .""). ""In reviewing a sentence for significant  procedural error, we review the district court's factual  findings for clear error and application of the [*2]   Guidelines de novo."" Id. (cleaned up) (citation omitted).  And ""we may affirm on any ground supported by the  record."" United States v. Garrido, 995 F.2d 808, 813  (8th Cir. 1993). The 2010 misdemeanors included one count of criminal  trespass, two counts of criminal mischief, and one count  of theft of property. Cutler was ordered to pay fines and  costs for each count, and he received a 30-day    Page 3 of 4 suspended prison sentence. Cutler testified that he  never received counsel and never waived his right to it.  Though the district court believed him, it still gave him  the point. That point made the difference between a  criminal history category of I and II, raising his  Guidelines range from 97-121 months to 108-135  months. HN2[ ]  The  Sixth  Amendment  guarantees  a  misdemeanor defendant's right to counsel where he  receives a suspended prison sentence. Alabama v.  Shelton, 535 U.S. 654, 662, 674, 122 S. Ct. 1764, 152  L. Ed. 2d 888 (2002). All agree on appeal that Cutler  had this right, did not waive it, and was not represented.  But the parties disagree about the consequences of the  constitutional deprivation. Cutler says that it tainted the  convictions, so the court could not use any of them to  assess a criminal history point. The Government argues  that it only invalidated the unconstitutional sentence; the  convictions with associated fines survive and support a  criminal [*3]  history point. Our precedent is clear: the constitutional deprivation  invalidates only Cutler's suspended prison sentence.  United States v. White, 529 F.2d 1390, 1394 (8th Cir.  1976) (vacating invalid suspended prison sentence for  an  uncounseled  misdemeanor  but  affirming  the  conviction  with  associated  fines).  The  2010  misdemeanor convictions remain intact with the  associated fines. Cf. Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367, 373- 74, 99 S. Ct. 1158, 59 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1979) (holding a  penalty of fines with no prison term imposed for an  uncounseled misdemeanor does not implicate the Sixth  Amendment right to counsel). HN3[ ] And uncounseled  misdemeanor convictions with fines, ""valid under Scott  because no prison term was imposed, [are] also valid  when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent  conviction."" Nichols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738, 748- 49, 114 S. Ct. 1921, 128 L. Ed. 2d 745 (1994). Although the district court could not consider Cutler's  invalid suspended prison sentence in its criminal history  calculation, it could consider the constitutionally valid  fines that he received for his criminal mischief and theft         of property convictions. See United States v. Long, No.  97-1440, 1997 WL 375191, at *1 (8th Cir. July 9, 1997)  (per  curiam)  (assuming  without  deciding  that  misdemeanor defendant's conviction resulting in a  suspended prison sentence was uncounseled and  concluding  that  his  ""probationary  sentence  and  monetary fine provided a basis for assessing the  criminal history point""); United States v. Acuna-Reyna,  677 F.3d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir. 2012) (affirming use of  ""constitutionally [*4]  valid portion of a sentence"" in  calculating criminal history); United States v. Jackson,  493 F.3d 1179, 1183 (10th Cir. 2007) (Gorsuch, J.)  (same); United States v. Ortega, 94 F.3d 764, 769 (2d  Cir. 1996) (same). These sentences support the district  court's  one-point  assessment  for  Cutler's  2010  misdemeanors, so we find no procedural error. II. HN4[ ]  Cutler  also  challenges  the  substantive  reasonableness of his above-Guidelines sentence,  which we review under a ""deferential abuse-of- discretion standard."" United States v. Feemster, 572  F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir. 2009) (en banc) (citation  omitted). A district court abuses its discretion if it ""fails to  consider a relevant factor that should have received  significant weight, gives significant weight to an  improper or irrelevant factor, or considers only  appropriate factors but nevertheless commits a clear  error of judgment by arriving at a sentence that lies  outside the limited range of choice dictated by the facts  of the case."" United States v. Fiorito, 640 F.3d 338, 352  (8th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). It is ""the unusual case  when we reverse a district court sentence—whether  within, above, or below the applicable Guidelines  range—as substantively unreasonable."" Feemster, 572  F.3d at 464. Cutler argues that the district court abused its discretion  by focusing on offense conduct that the Guidelines  already  captured  in  his  offense  characteristic  enhancements. See U.S.S.G. § 2G2.1(b). But the court  found that the Guidelines [*5]  did not reflect the           Page 4 of 4 ""heinous"" nature of Cutler's offense. They did not  capture Cutler's threats to kidnap, rape, torture, and kill  young girls—including a five-year-old. Nor did they show  that he conditioned those threats on his victims  documenting sex acts on themselves and other minors.  Cutler's sentencing enhancements told a story, just not  the whole one. The court was free to consider the whole  story in weighing the § 3553(a) factors and varying up.  See Fiorito, 640 F.3d at 352 (HN5[ ] ""[A] district court  may impose an upward variance based on facts already  included in the advisory sentencing guidelines where  the advisory guidelines do not fully account for those  facts.""). Cutler also says that the district court abused its  discretion by considering its reputation and public  perception, which he says is an improper factor. The  court posed a hypothetical: ""If I'm sitting in the barber  shop talking to the fellows, and I tell them somebody  went into Court and here's all of the stuff he did and he  got ten years, what would the average guy sitting on the  park bench in the barbershop say? They would say,  there is no justice in this world."" Cutler claims that this  comment shows that the court succumbed to ""peer  pressure"" when [*6]  it varied up. We don't think so. The  court was wrestling with ""the need for the sentence  imposed . . . to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to  promote respect for the law, and to provide just  punishment for the offense."" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A).  It found that no one—not the court, the public (that  ""average guy"" in the barbershop), nor even Cutler— would find the Guidelines reasonable in this case. This  was not an abuse of discretion. III. The district court's judgment is affirmed.",0
"Lewis v. Senior Lifestyle, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217659","[*1] MEMORANDUM OPINION THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendant Senior  Lifestyle's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 11). The Motion  is ripe for disposition, and no hearing is necessary. See  Local Rule 105.6 (D.Md. 2023). For the reasons set  forth below, the Court will grant the Motion in part and  deny it in part. I. BACKGROUND A. Factual Background1 Self-represented Plaintiff Takia Lewis, a self-identified  African American woman, began working for Senior Lifestyle in human resources  in the Atrium Village on November 15, 2020. (Compl. at  9, ECF No. 1). 2 She alleges that Senior Lifestyle  discriminated against her on the basis of race, and that  she was fired in retaliation for her complaints of  disparate treatment. (See id. at 7). 1 Unless otherwise noted, the Court takes the following  facts from the Complaint (ECF No. 1) and accepts them  as true. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). 2 Citations to page numbers refer to the pagination  assigned by the Court's Case Management/Electronic  Case Files (""CM/ECF"") system. On January 4, 2021, Todd Kalkstein, Senior Lifestyle's  Kitchen Director, had a ""rude[] outburst"" at Lewis for delays in the onboarding  process for new employees. (Id. at 9). He allegedly insulted Lewis by calling her slow. (Id.).  On January [*2]  13, 2021, Lewis became aware that Kalkstein and Molly Hall, the  Program Director, were ""spreading [r]umors about employees being covid positive"" and  identifying those employees. (Id.). Lewis wrote them up because their actions violated the  employee handbook and HIPPA. (Id.). After issuing the write up, Lewis was invited to a  zoom call with Kalkstein; Hall; Beth Ber, the Vice President of Senior Lifestyle; and  Denise Bucholz, 3 Lewis' supervisor. (Id.). Lewis was the only African American person on  the call. (Id.). Ber raised her voice and told Lewis she was disrespectful and she should not  have issued the write ups. (Id.). Bucholz later messaged Lewis to say that she agreed  Page 2 of 7 that Kalkstein and Hall were out of line but directed her to remove the write ups from  Kalkstein and Hall's files. (Id.). Kalkstein then allegedly told another employee to not trust Lewis.  (Id. at 10). On February 2, 2021, Stacy Buckley 4 told Lewis to call  employees to ask about their vaccination status, although Lewis had already done so  the previous day. (Id.). When Lewis 3 In her Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, Lewis  states that ""the [p]roper defendant to this action is  Senior Lifestyle, ('Denise Buchholz['])"". (Pl.'s [*3]  Mem.  Supp. Resp. Mot. Dismiss [""Opp'n""] at 1, ECF No. 19).  To the extent Lewis attempts to add Bucholz as a  defendant, she did not file a motion to amend her  Complaint, and she may not properly add a defendant in  a responsive briefing. Regardless, Lewis asserts Title  VII claims, and the only proper defendant in a Title VII  case is the employer, Senior Lifestyle, not its individual  employees. See Bradley v. Balt. Police Dep't , No. JKB- 11-1799, 2012 WL 4321738, at *2 (D.Md. Sept. 19,  2012) (""Supervisors sued in their individual capacities  may not be held liable under Title VII."") (citing Lissau v.  S. Food Serv., Inc., 159 F.3d 177, 181 (4th Cir. 1998)). 4 In the Complaint, Lewis refers to Buckley as ""Stacy""  and she only lists her full name in her Opposition. (See  Opp'n at 2). While the Complaint must ordinarily stand  alone, 2 informed her that she already made the calls, Buckley  loudly said ""do what I said now."" (Id.). In a different  meeting, Buckley ""got smart"" towards Lewis and said  that as the boss, she ran the meetings. (Id.). On February 3, 2021, Lewis and other employees  moved their offices to a different floor. (Id.). Kalkstein  helped white employees to set up their wifi and  equipment, but he did not help Lewis. (Id.). On February  8, 2021, Kalkstein pushed past Lewis after a meeting  without  acknowledging  her  or  excusing  himself.  (Id. [*4] ). Lewis informed Buckley, who said she would  handle it. (Id.). Lewis and other employees also  observed Kalkstein digging into food meant for residents  with his bare hands. (Id.). Lewis reported him to  Buckley, but nothing was done about it. (Id.). On February 13, 2021, Lewis received a complaint from  an African American employee about her white  supervisor. (Id. at 11). Buckley would not allow Lewis to  attend a meeting with the employee after the complaint,  and the situation was never addressed appropriately.  (Id.). On February 17, 2021, Lewis learned that Senior  Lifestyle held a management meeting but only invited  white managers. (Id.). On February 19, 2021, Kalkstein yelled at an African  American supervisor, Helen Lambert, for working from  home during a weather emergency. (Id.). Lewis reported  this to Buckley and asked why Senior Lifestyle had not  held Kalkstein accountable. (Id.). Buckley yelled at  Lewis to ""stay out of it."" (Id.). and the Court cannot permit Lewis to amend her  Complaint with facts contained in the Opposition, the  Court will refer to Buckley by her last name for  consistency. 3 On February 22, 2021, Lewis heard Kalkstein ""cussing  at an employee,"" who told Lewis that Kalkstein had  disrespected her and made her cry on previous  occasions. (Id.). This situation was never handled. (Id.).  On February 25, 2021, Lewis learned that an African  American employee [*5]  had quit because of Kalkstein  and his disrespectful behavior and that a white server  left her job because she did not want to take directions  from Lambert, who is an African American woman. (Id.  at 12). Lewis reported this information to Buckley, who  told her to ""stop supporting Black employees before  [you] end up in the hot seat."" (Id.). Lewis said that she  did not understand, and Buckley replied ""oh[,] you will.""  (Id.). Lewis told her that she needed to treat all  employees equally. (Id.). On March 2, 2021, Lambert told Lewis that Kalkstein  sent a text to a group chat of Senior Lifestyle employees  in which he blamed Lambert for a mistake that a white  employee had made. (Id.). Lewis submitted a statement  to Buckley, who told Lambert that she was Kalkstein's  boss and to ""stop putting energy in the situation."" (Id.).  That same day, Buckley told Lewis that her position was  being eliminated and that her last day of work would be  March 16, 2021. (Id.). On March 3 and 4, 2021, after Lewis had gone home,  Kalkstein and Buckley broke into her office and took her  office keys and several write ups, including the one she  wrote for Kalkstein and Hall. (Id. at 13). From March 5- 16, 2021, Lewis was [*6]  denied access to payroll, and  she was told to sit at her desk all day and not speak to  Page 3 of 7 employees. (Id.). B. Procedural History Lewis filed an administrative complaint on March 2,  2021, and she received a Right to Sue Letter on October 11, 2022. (See id. at 8). On  January 9, 2023, she filed her 4 Complaint, in which she claims racial discrimination and  retaliation under Title VII. (Id. at 7). Senior Lifestyle filed  the instant Motion to Dismiss on May 16, 2023. (ECF  No. 11). Lewis filed an Opposition on June 12, 2023,  (ECF No. 19), and Senior Lifestyle filed a Reply on June  26, 2023, (ECF No. 21). II. DISCUSSION A. Standard of Review The purpose of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is to ""test[] the  sufficiency of a complaint,"" not to ""resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits  of a claim, or the applicability of defenses."" King v.  Rubenstein, 825 F.3d 206, 214 (4th Cir. 2016) (quoting  Edwards v. Cityof Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 243 (4th  Cir. 1999)). A complaint fails to state a claim if it does  not contain ""a short and plain statement of the claim  showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,""  Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2), or does not ""state a claim to relief  that is plausible on its face,"" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.  662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v.Twombly, 550  U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). A claim is facially plausible  ""when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the  court to draw the reasonable inference that the  defendant [*7]  is liable for the misconduct alleged."" Id.  (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). ""Threadbare recitals  of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere  conclusory statements, do not suffice."" Id. (citing  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). Though the plaintiff is not  required to forecast evidence to prove the elements of  the claim, the complaint must allege sufficient facts to  establish each element. Goss v. Bank of Am., N.A., 917  F.Supp.2d 445, 449 (D.Md. 2013) (quoting Walters v.  McMahen, 684 F.3d 435, 439 (4th Cir. 2012)), aff'd, 546  F.App'x 165 (4th Cir. 2013). 5 In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court must  examine the complaint as a whole, consider the factual  allegations in the complaint as true, and construe the  factual allegations in the light most favorable to the  plaintiff. Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 268 (1994);  Lambeth v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 407 F.3d 266, 268 (4th Cir.  2005) (citing Scheuer v.Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236  (1974)). Complaints drafted by self-represented plaintiffs  are held to a less stringent standard than those drafted  by attorneys, and courts must liberally construe these  complaints. See Johnson v. Silver, 742 F.2d 823, 825  (4th Cir. 1984). But the court need not accept  unsupported or conclusory factual allegations devoid of  any reference to actual events, United Black Firefighters  v. Hirst, 604 F.2d 844, 847 (4th Cir. 1979), or legal  conclusions couched as factual allegations, Iqbal, 556  U.S. at 678. C. Analysis 1. Discrimination Senior Lifestyle argues Lewis has failed to state a  plausible claim for discrimination due to her race or  color. (Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss [""Mot.""] at 1,  ECF No. 11-2). Title VII prohibits an employer from  discriminating [*8]  against employees due to race,  color, religion, sex, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. §  2000e-2(a). A plaintiff may establish a Title VII claim  ""either 'through direct and indirect evidence of retaliatory  [or discriminatory] animus,' or through a burden-shifting  'pretext' framework."" Netter v. Barnes, 908 F.3d 932,  938 (4th Cir. 2018) (quoting Foster v. Univ. of Md.-E.  Shore, 787 F.3d 243, 249 (4th Cir. 2015)). The Complaint does not include allegations of direct  evidence of discrimination. See Cole v. Fam. Dollar  Stores of Md., Inc., 811 F.App'x 168, 175 (4th Cir. 2020)  (""Direct 6 evidence is 'evidence of conduct or statements that both  reflect directly the alleged discriminatory attitude and that bear directly on the  contested employment decision.'"" (quoting Taylor v. Va. Union Univ., 193 F.3d 219, 232  (4th Cir. 1999))). 5 Accordingly, the Court will evaluate Lewis' claim under the burden- shifting framework first articulated by Page 4 of 7 the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.  Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). To establish a discrimination or retaliation claim under  the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, Lewis must eventually put  forth a prima facie case by establishing that: (1) she belongs to a protected class; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; (3) at the time of the adverse action, she was  performing her job at a level that met her employer's  legitimate expectations . . . ; and (4)  she  was  rejected  [or  terminated]  under  circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful  discrimination. See Adams v. Trs. of the Univ. of N.C.-Wilmington, 640  F.3d 550, 558 (4th Cir. 2011). The precise formulation of [*9]  the required prima facie  showing will vary in ""differing factual situations,"" McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802 n.13,  and the elements were ""never intended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic,'""  Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U.S. 506, 512 (2002) (quoting Furnco Constr. Corp. v.  Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577 (1978)). If Lewis succeeds in establishing a prima facie case, the  burden shifts to the employer to 5 In her Complaint, Lewis alleges that Senior Lifestyle  discriminated against her directly by excluding her from  meetings and taking away job responsibilities. (Compl.  at 5). The Court finds that these actions could show  indirect discrimination in some circumstances, but alone  they do not evince a ""discriminatory attitude"" towards  Lewis based on her race. See Cole, 811 F.App'x at 175.  Thus, the Court finds that Lewis presents no evidence of  direct discrimination. 7 ""present a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its  employment action."" Mackey v.Shalala, 360 F.3d 463,  468 (4th Cir. 2004). If the employer does so, ""the burden  shifts back to the employee to show that the given  reason was just a pretext for discrimination."" Id. The Court is mindful that a Title VII plaintiff need not  satisfy all the elements set forth above to survive a  motion to dismiss. See Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 510  (""The prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas,  however, is an evidentiary standard, [*10]  not a  pleading requirement.""); accord Parker v. Child.'s Nat'l  Med. Ctr., Inc., No. ELH-20-3523, 2021 WL 5840949, at  *9 (D.Md. Dec. 9, 2021) (""At the motion to dismiss  stage, a plaintiff need not establish a prima facie case of  discrimination.""). Instead, at the motion to dismiss stage,  a plaintiff need only ""allege[] facts that plausibly state a  violation of Title VII 'above a speculative level.'"" Bing v.  Brivo Sys., LLC, 959 F.3d 605, 617 (4th Cir. 2020)  (quoting Coleman v. Md. Ct. of Appeals, 626 F.3d 187,  190 (4th Cir. 2010)), cert. denied, 141 S.Ct. 1376  (2021). Thus, the plaintiff must generally show that the  employer took adverse action against the plaintiff ""under  circumstances which give rise to an inference of  unlawful discrimination."" Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v.  Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981); Adams, 640 F.3d at  558. This requirement can be met by showing that  ""similarly-situated employees outside the protected  class received more favorable treatment."" White v.  BFIWaste Servs., LLC, 375 F.3d 288, 295 (4th Cir.  2004). The Court considers the ""totality of the circumstances""  in determining whether Lewis has adequately alleged  discrimination. See Strothers v. City of Laurel, 895 F.3d  317, 330-31 (4th Cir. 2018) (""[T]he connection between  animus and conduct may be inferred from the totality of  the circumstances.""); see also Woods v. City of  Greensboro, 855 F.3d 8 639, 649 (4th Cir. 2017) (concluding that a court ""may  infer discriminatory intent from evidence of a general  pattern of . . . discrimination in the practices of a  defendant""); Guirkin v. CMH Physician Servs., LLC, No.  3:20CV59, 2020 WL 6829769, at *7 n.13 (E.D.Va. Nov.  20, 2020) (""Although [plaintiff's] individual allegations do  not by themselves prove discriminatory [*11]  animus,  the totality of circumstances surrounding his termination  gives rise to the inference that [plaintiff] was fired, at  least in part, because of his [protected status].""). Senior Lifestyle argues that Lewis' allegations do not  support a reasonable inference that she was terminated  Page 5 of 7 due to unlawful discrimination. (See Mot. at 6). The  Court agrees. Lewis alleges that managers treated her  with hostility, excluded her from meetings, took away job  responsibilities, belittled her, and ignored her efforts to  resolve employee complaints. (See Compl. at 5-13).  Even taking these allegations as true and construing  them in the light most favorable to Lewis, the Court  cannot  infer  that  Senior  Lifestyle  acted  with  discriminatory animus due to Lewis' race or color. Lewis argues that she has stated a claim for  discrimination by showing Senior Lifestyle's disparate  treatment of employees outside her protected class.  (See Opp'n at 4). Specifically, Lewis alleges that  Kalkstein helped other white employees to set up their  offices and equipment, but that he did not help her.  (Compl. at 10). To the extent they intend to rely on comparator  evidence,  plaintiffs  in  the  Fourth  Circuit  must  demonstrate that [*12]  they are similarly situated with a  comparator ""by showing that they both (1) 'dealt with the  same supervisor,' and (2) were 'subject to the same  standards and . . . engaged in the same conduct without  such differentiating or mitigating 9 circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or  the employer's treatment of them for it.'"" Tinsley v. City  of Charlotte, 854 F.App'x 495, 500-01 (4th Cir. 2021)  (quoting Haynesv. Waste Connections, Inc., 922 F.3d  219, 223-24 (4th Cir. 2019)). This Court has previously  dismissed Title VII complaints in which the only  allegations  of  discriminatory  intent  come  from  insufficient comparator evidence. See Chatelle v.  Maryland, No. GLR-21-1734, 2022 WL 2953042, at *8  (D.Md. July 25, 2022) (dismissing complaint when  comparator evidence fails to establish discriminatory  intent or causation); Price v. HowardCnty. Pub. Sch.  Sys., No. GLR-22-541, 2023 WL 170425, at *10 (D.Md.  Jan. 11, 2023) (same). Here, Lewis has failed to show either of the two  elements set forth above, and thus she cannot state a  claim for discrimination based on comparator evidence.  Accordingly,  Lewis'  discrimination  claim  will  be  dismissed. 2. Retaliation Lewis alleges that Senior Lifestyle terminated her in  retaliation for her advocacy regarding African American  employees and discrimination in the workplace. (Compl.  at 11-13). Specifically, Lewis reported several different  employee complaints to Buckley between February 13,  2021 and March 2, 2021: • On February 13, 2021, Lewis reported a concern  from [*13]  an African American employee regarding  their white supervisor, (id. at 11); • On February 18 and 19, 2021, Lewis reported that  Kalkstein yelled at and demeaned Lambert, an African  American employee. Buckley told Lewis to ""stay out of  it,"" (id.); • On February 22, 2021, Lewis reported that Kalkstein  had cursed at an employee, (id.); 10 • On February 25, 2021, Lewis reported that a Black  employee had quit because Kalkstein and another  supervisor had demeaned her with ""slurs"" and asked  her if she could read. She also told Buckley that a  former white employee quit because she did not want to  take direction from an African American supervisor. In  response, Buckley told her ""stop supporting Black  employees before [you] end up in the hot seat."" Lewis  said that she did not understand, and Buckley replied  ""oh[,] you will."" Lewis informed her that ""you need to  treat all your employees the same,"" (id. at 12); • On March 1, 2021, Lewis reported that Kalkstein  assumed that Lambert, an African American supervisor,  made a mistake, and he reprimanded her on a group  text, even though a white supervisor made the mistake,  (id.). Also on March 2, 2021, Buckley informed Lewis that her  position was being eliminated, [*14]  and Lewis' last day  would be March 16, 2021. (Id.). On March 5, 2021,  management confined Lewis to her desk and would not  allow her to access payroll or to answer employee  questions. (Id. at 13). Senior Lifestyle argues the retaliation claim must be  dismissed because Lewis did not engage in protected  activity and even if she did, there is no causal  connection between the activity and her termination.  (Mot. at 7-8). At bottom, the Court finds Lewis has  alleged sufficient facts to plead a prima facie case of  retaliation. Title VII prohibits an employer from retaliating against  an employee who exercises her Title VII rights. Hart v.  Lew, 973 F.Supp.2d 561, 582 (D.Md. 2013). In order to  establish a prima facie claim of retaliation under Title  Page 6 of 7 VII, Lewis ""must show that she engaged in protected  activity, that her employer took adverse action against  her, and that a causal relationship existed between the  protected activity and the adverse employment activity.""  Id. (cleaned up). If she succeeds in establishing a prima  facie case, the McDonnellDouglas framework applies,  just as it does for a discrimination claim: ""If a plaintiff  puts 11 forth sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case  of  retaliation  and  a  defendant  offers  a  non- discriminatory [*15]  explanation for the adverse action,  the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that the  employer's proffered explanation is pretext."" Id. (cleaned  up). Regarding the first element, Title VII makes it unlawful  for ""an employer to discriminate against any of [its]  employees . . . because [s]he has opposed any practice  made an unlawful practice by this subchapter, or  because [s]he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or  participated in any manner in an investigation,  proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter."" 42  U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). Protected activity, ""therefore, can  take the form of either opposing a practice prohibited  under Title VII ([under] the opposition clause) or making  a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in an  investigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII  ([under] the participation clause)."" Pitter v. Cmty.  ImagingPartners, Inc., 735 F.Supp.2d 379, 395 (D.Md.  2010). ""The opposition clause has been held to  encompass  informal  protests,  such  as  voicing  complaints to employers or using an employer's  grievance procedures."" Id. at 396. Senior Lifestyle argues that Lewis' reports to Buckley do  not constitute protected activity because ""there are no  facts to suggest that Mr. Kalkstein's behavior was in any  way discriminatory or on the basis of a protected [*16]   characteristic."" (Reply Supp. Def.'s Mot. Dismiss  [""Reply""] at 4, ECF No. 21). The Court agrees that some  of Lewis' reports, such as the February 13, 2021 report  of a concern regarding a white director and an African  American employee, are too vague and do not indicate  any discriminatory animus. Nevertheless, the Court  must consider the totality of the circumstances and view  the facts in the light most favorable to Lewis. Albright,  510 U.S. at 268. In doing so, the Court finds 12 that Lewis reported a pattern of Kalkstein singling out  African American employees for discipline. The Court further finds that even if these reports were,  by themselves, insufficient to show protected activity,  Lewis' conversation with Buckley on February 25, 2021,  establishes the first element of her claim. In that  conversation, Buckley told Lewis to ""stop supporting  Black employees,"" indicating that Lewis' reports were  based upon a protected characteristic. (Compl. at 12).  Further, when Lewis told her that she did not  understand, Buckley said ""oh[,] you will,"" and Lewis  informed her that ""you need to treat all your employees  the same."" (Id.). Lewis' plea that Buckley ""treat all []  employees the same"" can be construed as a  request [*17]  for Senior Lifestyle to address alleged  discriminatory conduct. Because protected activity  ""encompass[es] informal protests, such as voicing  complaints to employers or using an employer's  grievance procedures,"" Pitter, 735 F.Supp.2d at 396, the  Court finds that Lewis participated in protected activity. Senior Lifestyle does not contest that it took an adverse  action against Lewis, and thus the Court moves to the  third element-whether a causal relationship existed  between the protected activity and the adverse  employment activity. To satisfy this element, a plaintiff  must show that ""the employer [took] the adverse  employment action because the plaintiff engaged in a  protected activity."" Dowe v. Total Action Against Poverty  inRoanoke Valley, 145 F.3d 653, 657 (4th Cir.1998)  (emphasis in original). The Fourth Circuit ""has held that  evidence that the alleged adverse action occurred  shortly after the employer became aware of the  protected activity is sufficient to 'satisf[y] the less  onerous burden of making a prima facie case of  causa[tion].'"" Id. (quoting Williams v. Cerberonics, 13 Inc., 871 F.2d 452, 457 (4th Cir.1989)) (emphasis and  alterations in Dowe). Conversely, ""the opposite [is]  equally true,"" so that ""[a] lengthy time lapse between the  employer becoming aware of the protected activity and  the alleged adverse employment action . . . [*18]  negates any inference that a causal connection exists  between the two."" Dowe, 145 F.3d at 657 (finding a  period of time exceeding three years too lengthy to give  rise to the inference of a causal connection); Clarke v.  DynCorp Int'l LLC, 962 F.Supp.2d 781, 790 (D.Md.  2013) (""[A] lapse of as little as two months between the  protected activity and an adverse employment action is  sufficiently long so as to weaken significantly the  inference of causation."") (citation omitted); Pascual v.  Page 7 of 7 Lowe's Home Centers, Inc., 193 F.App'x 229, 233 (4th  Cir. 2006) (two to four month period between protected  activity and termination was ""too long to establish a  causal connection by temporal proximity alone.""). Lewis is a self-represented litigant, and she does not  directly discuss causation in her Opposition or  Complaint. Regardless, plaintiffs are not required to  plead a formulaic recitation of the elements, see  E.E.O.C. v. Performance Food Grp., Inc., 16 F.Supp.3d  584, 588 (D.Md. 2014), and the Court finds that her  alleged timeline establishes causation by temporal  proximity. Lewis participated in protected activity on  February 25, 2021 when she made a report of racial  discrimination to Buckley and asked that Buckley ""treat  all [] employees the same."" (Compl. at 12). Buckley told  her to stop advocating for Black employees, and when  Lewis said she did not understand, Buckley said ""oh[,]  you will."" (Id.). Just five days later on March [*19]  2,  2021, Buckley told Lewis that her position was being  eliminated. (Id.). On March 5, 2021, Senior Lifestyle  took away key job responsibilities, and Lewis' last day  was March 16, 2021. (Id. at 13). Accordingly, Lewis has  established 14 causation because the adverse action occurred ""shortly""  after Senior Lifestyle became aware of the protected  activity. See Dowe, 145 F.3d at 657. Lewis has plead of prima facie case of retaliation  because she has established all three elements. See  Hart, 973 F.Supp.2d at 582. Under the McDonnell- Douglas framework, the burden then shifts to Senior  Lifestyle to offer a non-discriminatory explanation for the  adverse action. See id. Senior Lifestyle offers no  explanation for why it eliminated Lewis' position and  took away key job responsibilities, and thus its Motion  will be denied as to the retaliation claim.",1
"United States v. Baker, 349 F. Supp. 3d 1113","[*1115]  MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER THIS MATTER comes before the Court on the Defendant's Appeal of Detention Order, filed March 5, 2018 (Doc.  51)(""Appeal""). The Court held a hearing on March 19, 2018. The primary issue is whether Defendant Adonis Baker  presents a flight risk or is a danger to the community, and should therefore remain in custody pending trial, or  whether the Court can furnish conditions of release that can reduce those risks to acceptable levels. The United  States of America has shown, by clear-and-convincing evidence, that Baker is a danger to the community, and has  shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Baker is a flight risk. The Court denies Baker's Appeal, thereby  affirming the Honorable Laura Fashing, United States Magistrate Judge for the United States District Court for the  District of New Mexico's Order [**2]  of Detention Pending Trial, see Order, filed September 29, 2017 (Doc.  15)(""Order of Detention""), and Magistrate Judge Fashing's Order Denying Motion to Release Defendant From  Custody, filed January 2,  [*1116]  2018 (Doc. 46)(""Order Denying Motion to Release""). Page 2 of 18   FACTUAL BACKGROUND The Court sets forth the facts as the United States alleges them in its Indictment, filed September 21, 2017 (Doc.  1)(""Indictment""), and as the United States Probation Office describes them in the Bail Report (disclosed October 13,  2017)(Doc. 24)(""Bail Report""), bearing in mind that Baker is presumed innocent of all charges, see Estelle v.  Williams, 425 U.S. 501, 503, 96 S. Ct. 1691, 48 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1976)(""The presumption of innocence, although not  articulated in the Constitution, is a basic component of a fair trial under our system of criminal justice."" (citing Coffin  v. United States, 156 U.S. 432, 453, 15 S. Ct. 394, 39 L. Ed. 481 (1895))). The Court recites the United States'  version of the facts because the high burden of proof placed on the United States necessitates that it has a cogent,  internally consistent version of events, and not out of any predisposition to believe the United States' side of the  story. See In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 365, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970)(""[W]e explicitly hold that the  Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of  every fact necessary to constitute [**3]  the crime with which he is charged.""). The Bail Report indicates that Baker was born in Alabama and has lived in the Albuquerque, New Mexico area for  the last four years. See Bail Report at 1-2. Baker has a father and a sister, who both reside in Birmingham,  Alabama. See Bail Report at 2. Baker has daily contact with his sister and weekly contact with his parents. See Bail  Report at 2. His mother is believed to reside in Indiana. See Bail Report at 2. Baker advises that he has been in a  relationship for the past two years and that he has no children. See Bail Report at 2. Baker has been unemployed since 2013 and could not provide the name of his last employer. See Bail Report at 2.  Baker does not have a United States of America passport and has never traveled outside of the United States. See  Bail Report at 2. Baker has a 2013 conviction for a drug-related offense. See Bail Report at 3. He has a certificate of completion from  the State of Alabama Department of Corrections Substance Abuse Program, granted on October 27, 2006. See Bail  Report at 3. The Bail Report also references other documentation admitting past drug addiction. See Bail Report at  3. No evidence [**4]  suggests Baker has current or past mental health conditions. See Bail Report at 3. Since 2003, Baker has been charged with criminal conduct five times, not including the current charges. See Bail  Report at 5-6. From 2003 to the present, Baker was charged with the following: (i) theft of property (April 2003); (ii)  robbery (May 2003); (iii) assault/reckless endangerment (March 2005)(Baker's only charge for violent behavior); (iv)  possession of marijuana less than two ounces and possession of a controlled substance less than twenty-eight  grams (August 2012); and (v) improper use of evidence of registration, improper display of registration plate, and no  driver's license (November 2015). See Bail  [*1117]  Report at 5-6. Baker was convicted of the theft of property, the  robbery, the misdemeanor possession of marijuana, and of improper display of his registration plate. See Bail  Report at 5-6. At the hearing on the Appeal, on March 19, 2018, see Transcript of Detention Hearing (taken March 19,  2018)(Court)(""March 19 Tr.""), the Court elicited details of Baker's past convictions from his counsel. See March 19  Tr. at 4:8-9 (Court). Baker alleges that his theft of property conviction was a petty theft, [**5]  involving shoplifting  from Walmart. See March 19 Tr. at 4:19-22 (Court). Baker also alleges that his robbery conviction was a purse  snatching, committed by another individual while Baker drove the car involved in the crime. See March 19 Tr. at  4:23-5:2 (Baiz). Baker asserts that the circumstances of his assault/reckless endangerment charge are that he ran         349 F. Supp. 3d 1113, *1116; 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173951, **2 Page 3 of 18   a few red lights, and then an officer stopped to investigate him and see whether the car he was driving was stolen.  See March 19 Tr. at 5:10-13 (Baiz). There is no disposition for that charge mentioned in the Bail Report. See March  19 Tr. at 5:6-9 (Court). After Baker's robbery conviction, he was placed on probation and then his probation was  revoked, because he had a dirty urine test due to cocaine use. See March 19 Tr. at 5:16-20 (Baiz). Baker asserts  that his traffic-related offenses are that he was found to have a newly-purchased car that had not been registered  with the DMV. See March 19 Tr. at 6:19-21 (Baiz). Baker has previously violated probation, and has had an active  warrant since April 28, 2014, extraditable in Texas only, for a probation violation related to the possession of  marijuana charge. See Bail Report at 5-6. Baker [**6]  has also failed to appear, and in December 2015, the County  of Bernalillo, New Mexico, issued a failure to appear bench warrant for Baker on his traffic-related offenses. See  Bail Report at 6. Bernalillo County canceled the warrant in May, 2017, when he was convicted of improper display  of his registration plate and ordered to pay fines and fees. See Bail Report at 6. Baker contends that, because he is a felon, he does not possess a firearm. See Transcript of Hearing at 3:20-21  (taken September 29, 2017)(Baiz)(""Sept. 29 Tr.""). At the September 29, 2017, detention hearing, however,  Homeland Security Investigations Agent Morgan Langer testified that almost every alleged victim interviewed stated  that Baker ""was armed at all times."" Sept. 29 Tr. at 9:10-11 (Langer). Langer also testified that he found ""some  handgun ammunition"" in Baker's apartment, although he did not find a firearm. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 9:21-10:1  (Langer, Court). Langer relayed what he had learned through his investigation of Baker: that Baker ""targeted  women that were often homeless, often drug-addicted, vulnerable women, and would use that to recruit them  through force, coercion, threats, violence, into a life of prostitution [**7]  where the proceeds from their  prostitution activities would be turned over to Mr. Baker and some of his associates."" See Sept. 29 Tr. at 8:12-18  (Langer). Langer testified that there were reports of women who were drugged and awoke in different cities,  including cities outside of New Mexico. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 8:23-25 (Langer). At least one victim reported Baker  holding a gun to her head. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 11:2-4 (Simms, Langer). Another reported Baker holding her head  under water. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 11:5-7 (Simms, Langer). Of the six named victims, three reported that Baker had  committed acts of violence  [*1118]  against them, and a fourth reported that Baker had threatened her with  violence. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 15:2-4 (Langer). Langer testified that Baker used ""physical violence, beatings with his  hands . . . threats with a firearm . . . sexual violence"" and rape against the victims. Sept. 29 Tr. at 10:19-11:1  (Simms, Langer). Langer reported that Baker lured the juvenile victim identified in the Indictment, a runaway from  Phoenix, Arizona, into his car with drugs. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 22:7-11 (Langer). Langer alleges that, once the  juvenile was in Baker's car, she noticed it had disabled [**8]  locks. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 22:12-13 (Langer). Langer  then asserts that Baker drove the juvenile from Phoenix to Albuquerque for the purpose of engaging in  prostitution, but that Baker released her after she refused to engage in prostitution. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 22:13-16  (Langer). Langer testified that other victims reported that they were too afraid of Baker to cooperate in the  investigation. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 23:5-12 (Simms, Langer). The twelve-count Indictment charges Baker with sex trafficking by means of force, threats, fraud, and coercion;  coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution; transportation for prostitution; sex trafficking of a child; and  transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. See Indictment at 1-6. The United States  asserts that the penalties Baker faces on at least four of the twelve counts in the original Indictment are a  mandatory fifteen years in prison, that may run consecutively. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 26:9-12 (Simms). The United States Probation Office (""USPO"") recommends that Baker remain in custody, as it appears there ""is no  condition or combination of conditions that will reasonably assure the appearance of the [**9]  defendant as  required and the safety of the community."" Bail Report at 4. In support of its recommendation, the USPO alleges  ten factors which indicate that Baker poses a danger to the community: (i) Nature of Instant Offense; (ii) Prior  Arrests and Convictions; (iii) Substance Abuse History; (iv) Violent Behavior History; (v) Pretrial, Probation, Parole,       349 F. Supp. 3d 1113, *1117; 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173951, **5 Page 4 of 18   or Supervised Release Status and Compliance; (vi) Criminal Activity While Under Supervision; (vii) History/Charge  Involving a Child; (viii) History/Charge involving Sex Offense/Abuse; (viv) Safety Concerns for the Community or a  Specific Individual; and (x) Criminal History. See Bail Report at 4. In the Addendum to the Bail Report, filed March  16, 2018 (Doc. 57)(""Addendum""), the USPO also cites the fact that three of the victims have not been located. See  Addendum at 1. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND On September 21, 2017, a federal grand jury returned the twelve-count Indictment in United States v. Baker, No.  CR 17-2556 JB (D.N.M.)(Browning, J.). Magistrate Judge Fashing held a detention hearing on September 29, 2017.  See Sept. 29 Tr. at 1. After the September 29, 2017, detention hearing, Magistrate Judge Fashing concluded that a  rebuttable presumption [**10]  arises under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3) that no  [*1119]  condition or combination of  conditions will reasonably assure Baker's appearance as required and the safety of the community, because there  is probable cause to believe that Baker committed an offense involving a minor victim. See Order of Detention at 2.  According to Magistrate Judge Fashing, Baker did not introduce sufficient evidence to rebut this presumption. See  Order of Detention at 2. Additionally, weighing the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) and the information  presented at the detention hearing, Magistrate Judge Fashing concluded that the United States proved by clear- and-convincing evidence that Baker is a danger to the community, and by a preponderance of the evidence that  Baker is a flight risk. See Order of Detention at 2. Magistrate Judge Fashing noted Baker's previous failure to  appear in court as ordered, his lack of stable employment, his history of violence or use of weapons, the lengthy  period of incarceration which he will face if he is convicted of the present charges, and the weight of the evidence  against him, in supporting her conclusions that Baker is a flight risk and a danger to the community. See Order of  Detention at 2-3. Following the Order [**11]  of Detention, Baker filed a Motion to Release Defendant from Custody, filed December  20, 2017 (Doc. 42)(""Motion to Release""). In the Motion to Release, Baker asserts that he has a minimal criminal  history, family members in Birmingham who are willing to serve as third-party custodians, and that he has an  employment history pre-dating 2013. See Motion to Release at 3. Baker requests that ""he be allowed to live and  work in Birmingham and reside with his father and grandmother as he is not either a danger to the community or a  flight risk."" Motion to Release at 3. The United States filed a response to the Motion to Release. See United States' Response to Defendants' Motion to  Release Defendant from Custody, filed December 28, 2017 (Doc. 45)(""Response to Motion to Release""). In the  Response to Motion to Release, the United States argues that a rebuttable presumption arises under 18 U.S.C. §  3142(e)(3) that there is no condition or set of conditions that will reasonably assure Baker's appearance as required  and the safety of the community, because there is probable cause to believe Baker violated 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591 and  2423, both offenses involving minor victims. See Response to Motion to Release at 1-2. Specifically, the United  States [**12]  asserts that Baker ""is alleged to have lured a minor into his vehicle in Arizona, and drove her to New  Mexico while she was passed out under the influence of drugs, so that she could work as a prostitute for him.""  Response to Motion to Release at 1-2. The United States argues that Baker did not put forth sufficient information  in his Motion to Release to overcome the presumption in his case. See Response to Motion to Release at 2. The  United States argues that Baker's proposed living arrangements in Alabama do not overcome the rebuttable  presumption against release, because the nature of the charges against Baker indicate ""he will drive hundreds of  miles from city to city to victimize women by forcing them into prostitution."" Response to Motion to Release at 2.  The United States asserts that Baker failed to advance any reason why his proposed living arrangement would  overcome the presumption in favor of detention in his case. See Response to Motion to Release at 2. The United States argues that Baker is a flight risk, because he has minimal ties to New Mexico, a history of failure  to appear, and an outstanding misdemeanor warrant in Texas (demonstrating his unwillingness to appear in [**13]     349 F. Supp. 3d 1113, *1118; 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173951, **9 Page 5 of 18   court), and is facing a mandatory minimum of fifteen years' incarceration on multiple charges. See Response to  Motion to Release at 2.  [*1120]  The United States also argues that Baker is a danger both to the community and to the victims, because,  the United States alleges, Baker regularly possessed a firearm, used physical violence, threats, and drugs to  control women, and trafficked women -- including a minor -- using force, fraud, and coercion. See Response to  Motion to Release at 2-3. Finally, the United States argues that, because Baker is facing a long period of  incarceration, he has an interest in finding and silencing his victims. See Response to Motion to Release at 2-3. First, although Magistrate Judge Fashing stated that Baker's criminal history is not significant, she asserted that it  does not demonstrate that he is not a flight risk or a danger to the community, and it is not sufficient to rebut the  presumption in favor of detention. See Order Denying Motion to Release at 2-3. In support, Magistrate Judge  Fashing highlighted that Baker's criminal history includes a probation revocation on his robbery conviction from  May, 2006, a probation violation with an active warrant from 2012, [**14]  and a failure to appear on a misdemeanor  charge in December 2015. Second, Magistrate Judge Fashing cited to the victims' reports of violence and threats of violence testified to at the  detention hearing by Langer. See Order Denying Motion to Release at 3. Magistrate Judge Fashing noted that  Counts 1 and 2 of the Indictment allege that Baker engaged in the conduct testified to at the hearing, as far back as  2012. See Order Denying Motion to Release at 4. According to Langer's testimony, Baker has been unemployed  since 2013, and has an apartment in Albuquerque, a residence in Phoenix, and traveled to Phoenix, Colorado  Springs, Las Vegas, and elsewhere during the investigation. See Order Denying Motion to Release at 4. Magistrate  Judge Fashing also notes that the United States represented at the hearing that at least four of Baker's charged  offenses carry a minimum sentence of fifteen years of incarceration. See Order Denying Motion to Release at 4. Magistrate Judge Fashing denied the Motion to Release, concluding that, considering the testimony that Langer  provided at the detention hearing, the fact that Baker has family members in Alabama who may be willing to serve as third-party custodians, [**15]  and that he has  an employment history prior to 2013, has no material bearing on whether Baker is a flight risk or a danger to  the community. This information is also insufficient to overcome the presumption that Baker is both a flight risk  and a danger. Order Denying Motion to Release at 4. Accordingly, Magistrate Judge Fashing declined to reopen the detention  hearing and denied Baker's request for release. See Order Denying Motion to Release at 4. 1. Baker's Appeal. Baker appeals the Order of Detention and the Order Denying Motion to Release. See Appeal of Detention Order,  filed March 5, 2018 (Doc. 51)(""Appeal""). Baker argues that circumstances in his case are such that the rebuttable  presumption under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e) ""is overcome and the Court should release Baker from custody."" Appeal at  2. Baker first cites to his minimal criminal history, the willingness of his father and grandmother to serve as third  party custodians, and his employment history before 2013. See Appeal at 4. As Magistrate Judge Fashing stated in  the Order Denying Motion to Release: All the reasons that Baker gives for his release -- that he ""has a minimal criminal history,"" that he is from  Birmingham, Alabama and has family members [**16]  there who are willing to serve as third  [*1121]  party  custodians, and that he has a history of employment before 2013, Doc. 42 at 2-3 -- were known to Baker on  September 29, 2017 (the day of his detention hearing), and he could have presented this information to the  Court then. Indeed, the Court considered Baker's criminal history at the detention hearing, and although that  history is not significant, it was not sufficient to rebut the presumption that he is both a flight risk and a danger  to the community. Order Denying Motion to Release at 2. 349 F. Supp. 3d 1113, *1119; 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173951, **13 Page 6 of 18   Baker argues that the facts of the Indictment alleging that he was involved in allegations in 2012 are false. See  Appeal at 5. Baker asserts he was living in Beaumont, Texas and working at Subway Sandwiches, until at least  2013, and therefore could not have been involved in the ""acts in the indictment between June 2012 and June  2013."" Appeal at 5. Baker also asserts that the alleged victim ""principally"" responsible for the allegations of violence  against women, V.A., never stated during her interview with Baker's defense team that she was afraid of Baker.  Appeal at 5. Baker further asserts only one audio recording of an interview with a government witness [**17]  has  been disclosed to him thus far in discovery. See Appeal at 5. In that recording, ""Jessica,"" one of the victims,  repeatedly stated to a police officer, despite being prompted to say that she felt coerced, that she was ""not afraid of  Baker and that she was engaging as a sex worker because she wanted to, not because she was forced. She also  stated that Baker would not do anything violent because he was a 'caring person.'"" Appeal at 5. Finally, Baker asserts that he is not a danger, and argues that the ""clear and convincing evidence"" standard that the  United States must meet requires ""proof that the particular defendant actually poses a danger to the community, not  that the defendant in theory poses a danger."" Appeal at 6 (citing United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d 789, 792 (1st  Cir. 1991)). Because Baker asserts that the allegations that witnesses are afraid of him are false, Baker contends  that he does not actually pose a danger to the community, and therefore that the United States has not established  dangerousness by clear-and-convincing evidence as required to support his pretrial detention. See Appeal at 6. Alleging that, based on a consideration of the § 3142(g) factors, he ""does not pose a risk of danger to the  community, nor is he at risk of non-appearance"" [**18]  such as could not be managed by the imposition of  reasonable conditions, Baker requests that he ""be allowed to live at La Pasada Halfway House"" pending trial.  Appeal at 6. In conclusion, Baker requests that the Court ""set this matter for a hearing as soon as possible; reverse  the Magistrate Judge's order of detention in this cause [sic]; enter an order setting reasonable conditions of release;  and provide for such other and further relief to which the Court may find Baker to be justly entitled."" Appeal at 8. 2. The United States' Response. The United States requests that the Court deny Baker's Appeal, as he ""did not introduce sufficient evidence to rebut  the presumption of detention, and has offered no new evidence that circumstances have since changed."" Response  at 1. The United States argues that there ""are no conditions that will reasonably assure Defendant's presence at  future hearings, or assure the safety of the community."" Response at 1. The United States first asserts that the information Baker presents in his Appeal regarding his criminal history,  family ties, and employment background is not new. See Response at 3-4. The ""Magistrate found such information  does not have a material [**19]  bearing on whether the Defendant is a flight risk or a danger to the  [*1122]   community. Not only is this information not new, but it was considered by the Magistrate upon the Defendants [sic]  Motion for Release."" Response at 4 (citing Order Denying Motion for Release at 3-4). The United States notes that, when Baker refers to the acts in the Indictment between June 2012 and June 2013,  he is referring to ""Counts 1 and 2, which actually allege a period from June 2012 through June 3, 2015."" Response  at 4. The United States maintains that, even if Baker was living and working in Texas until 2013, he could still be  found guilty of these counts, because they allege a period until 2015. See Response at 4. The United States takes the position that it is untrue that V.A. never said that she was afraid of Baker during her  interview with Baker's defense team, and furthermore, the United States argues that this fact is ""irrelevant to the  weight of the evidence."" Response at 4. The United States argues that whether a victim is currently scared of a  defendant is not necessarily probative of whether the defendant ever used force, fraud, or coercion to compel  victims to work as prostitutes. See Response at [**20]  4-5. Moreover, the United States relays that, upon V.A.'s  information and belief, she was specifically asked ""whether Defendant Adonis Baker really held her head under  water, and whether she was really beaten at a local hotel,"" and she confirmed both allegations. Response at 5. The United States next relays a new development, that since the interview with V.A., V.A. ""has received a 'friend  request' from an individual . . . [who is] Facebook friends with the Defendant"" and whose motto on his Facebook  349 F. Supp. 3d 1113, *1121; 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173951, **16 Page 7 of 18   page reads: ""I will not go to jail."" Response at 5. This individual, who goes by Facebook identity ""Jimmie Choo"" from  Fairfield, Alabama, contacted V.A. and requested that she give him a call. See Response at 5. The United States  asserts that, while it cannot prove Baker was complicit in this individual contacting V.A., ""it is extremely coincidental  that this person, who V.A. does not know, contacted her from very near Birmingham, Alabama, and is Facebook  friends with Adonis Baker."" See Response at 5. The United States argues that this incident supports the United  States' request for a protective order. See Response at 5. The United States argues that the Court should not hold an evidentiary [**21]  hearing, because no new information  or change in circumstances bearing on release has been presented, allowing the Court to simply review the record  in evaluating Baker's requests. See Response at 5. The United States alleges that Magistrate Judge Fashing's  findings, appropriately grounded in the live testimony at Baker's detention hearing, should stand. See Response at  5 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(2)(A judicial officer may reopen a detention hearing only if he ""finds that information  exists that was not known to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue  whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and  the safety of any other person in the community.""). The United States argues that a rebuttable presumption of detention arises under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E),  because Baker is charged with an offense involving a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. § 1591. See Response at 6.  The United States notes that Magistrate Judge Fashing found that the presumption arose, and that Baker did not  introduce sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption. See Response at 6-7 (citing Sept. 29 Tr. at 29:14 (Court)).  The United States also notes that Magistrate Judge [**22]  Fashing found that there is clear-and-convincing  evidence that Baker is a danger to the community, based on the  [*1123]  testimony at the detention hearing, and  that Magistrate Judge Fashing found by a preponderance of the evidence that Baker is a flight risk, based on his  lack of stable employment, the severe sentence he will face if convicted, and his failures to appear and then- outstanding warrant. See Response at 6-7. Since Magistrate Judge Fashing's determination, the United States  asserts that the only potential change in circumstances is that Baker's family members are willing to serve as third- party custodians, but the United States alleges that Baker could have raised this information at the initial detention  hearing and did not. See Appeal at 7. Because there is no new information for the Court to consider, the United  States asks the Court to deny Baker's Motion to Release without an evidentiary hearing. See Appeal at 7. The United States argues that the four statutory factors listed in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) all weigh in favor of detaining  Baker. See Response at 7. These four factors are: (i) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (ii) the weight of  evidence against the defendant; (iii) the defendant's [**23]  history and characteristics; and (iv) the nature and  seriousness of the danger to the community or a specific individual that the defendant's release would pose. See  Response at 7 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)). First, the United States argues that the nature and circumstances of the charged offenses support detention,  because Baker has been accused of serious, forceful, and violent offenses against women. See Response at 7-8.  Citing to the testimony provided at the detention hearing, the United States asserts that Baker ""threatened victims  with a gun,"" ""held a victim's head under water,"" ""picked up women he had not met before and immediately drove  them to another town for the purpose of selling their bodies for sex,"" drugged women, beat them with his hands,  and used sexual violence against them. Response at 8. The United States asserts that hotel and Backpage.com  records corroborate the allegation that Baker traveled between states with his victims, and that there are at least six  victims, one of whom was a juvenile. See Response at 8. The United States concludes that the nature and  circumstances of the charged offenses are serious, because Baker and his co-Defendants ""made money by forcing  women to sell [**24]  their bodies, and used violence to accomplish this objective."" Appeal at 7. Second, the United States asserts that the weight of the evidence against Baker supports his detention pending  trial. See Response at 8. The United States asserts that Baker's contact information was linked to advertisements  selling the victims via Backpage.com, and that hotel records, Backpage.com advertisements and forensic phone  examinations all corroborate the victims' accounts of Baker's involvement. See Response at 8. The United States  alleges that ""[s]ix different women, most of whom do not know each other, give accounts of how they were  trafficked by Adonis Baker."" Response at 9. The United States notes that Magistrate Judge Fashing, in her Order  349 F. Supp. 3d 1113, *1122; 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173951, **20 Page 8 of 18   Denying Motion for Release, highlighted that the testimony at the detention hearing suggested that ""three of the six  named victims stated that the Defendant had committed acts of violence against them, to include beatings and  rape."" Response at 9. Most victims, including those not named, ""stated the Defendant usually possessed a gun.""  Response at 9. The United States further notes that, based on the testimony at the detention hearing, Langer  received information [**25]  from victims that Baker ""targeted homeless or drug-addicted women, lured them into  his control by offering them drugs, and then forced them to work as prostitutes and give him their earnings.""  Response at 9. The United States asserts that the juvenile victim was lured into Baker's car using  [*1124]  drugs  and transported across state lines. See Response at 9. Finally, the United States notes that Langer testified several  women were too afraid of Baker to cooperate with the investigation. See Response at 9. Based on the testimony at  the detention hearing, the United States concludes that the weight of the evidence against Baker is significant, and  that this factor weighs in favor of pretrial detention. See Response at 9. Third, the United States maintains that, while Baker's criminal history is not ""the most extensive,"" it is ""not minimal.""  Response at 9. The United States asserts that Baker was convicted of theft on May 14, 2003, in Alabama, and  arrested the very next day for robbery. See Response at 9 (citing Bail Report at 5). The United States then notes  that, after Baker was convicted of the robbery offense in July 2004, he was sentenced to three years confinement,  one year suspended, and [**26]  two years of probation, and that his probation was revoked in May 2006, after  which he was sentenced to prison. See Response at 9-10 (citing Bail Report at 5-6). The United States also argues  that Baker failed to appear on a misdemeanor charge and that, therefore, ""this Court should have no illusion that  the Defendant will appear on serious federal felonies."" Response at 10. Fourth, the United States argues that Baker has honed his ""ability to identify and exploit the most vulnerable women  in society to sell their bodies for profit"" through his involvement in sex trafficking. Response at 10. The United  States alleges that Baker would literally pick up women on the side of the road and drive them to other states, away from their homes, away  from their resources, with no one to rely on except for him. Once he had them where he wanted them, he  forced them to work as prostitutes while his associate guarded them in their rooms. He then took all of their  money to ensure they maintained limited options. Response at 10. The United States further argues that human trafficking, the offense of which Baker is accused, ""overlaps with the  sort of dangers that are more familiar to the community: drug [**27]  use, drug sales, physical abuse, child abuse,  and rape,"" making human trafficking extremely dangerous. Response at 10. Baker's release, contends the United  States, will place his victims at risk, because he knows who they are and how to find him, and because the United  States believes one of Baker's associates has already tried to contact an alleged victim. See Response at 11. In conclusion, the United States asserts that Baker is a flight risk and a danger to the community. Because the  weight of the evidence against him is strong and the nature and circumstances of his case are severe, Baker, the  United States alleges, is a ""member of the small, identifiable group of particularly dangerous defendants whose  continued pattern of criminal activity shows that they pose a significant risk of recidivism or violent behavior, and  should be detained pending trial. See United States v. Williams, 753 F.2d 329, 333 (4th Cir. 1985)."" Response at  11. Asserting a fear that Baker will commit more crimes if released, the United States asks the Court to deny  Baker's Appeal and to detain him until the resolution of this matter. See Response at 11. 3. The Hearing. The Court held a hearing on March 19, 2018. See Transcript of Detention Hearing (taken March 19,  2018)(Court)(""March [**28]  19 Tr.""). Baker began the hearing by asserting that it was not known at the time of the  initial detention hearing that his relatives could be third-party custodians. See March 19 Tr. at 1:13-18 (Baiz). Baker  requested  [*1125]  that the Court consider his request to reside at La Pasada Halfway House, given his short  criminal history and the statement by one alleged victim, ""Jessica,"" that Baker was a caring person and not a violent  individual. See March 19 Tr. at 2:1-3:5 (Baiz). Baker went on to assert that the Facebook contact between ""Jimmie  349 F. Supp. 3d 1113, *1123; 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173951, **24 Page 9 of 18   Choo"" and V.A. did not contain any threats, and that there is no evidence Baker was involved in that  communication. See March 19 Tr. at 3:12-22 (Baiz). Turning to Baker's criminal history, the Court asked him about the circumstances of his property theft conviction and  robbery conviction. See March 19 Tr. at 4:11-13 (Court). Baker responded that the theft involved shoplifting, and the  robbery was a purse-snatching committed by someone else, and Baker drove the robber. See March 19 Tr. at 4:19- 5:2 (Court, Baiz). The Court then asked about the assault/reckless endangerment charge, and Baker responded  that he ran a few red lights, and so an officer stopped [**29]  and investigated him to determine if the car he was  driving was stolen. See March 19 Tr. at 5:5-13 (Court, Baiz). Baker admitted that after his robbery conviction, the Court did revoke his probation and reinstate his imprisonment  because he submitted a urine test that was positive for cocaine. See March 19 Tr. at 5:14-20 (Baiz). Baker told the  Court that after reincarceration, he was granted probation again and completed it successfully, and did not use  cocaine again. See March 19 Tr. at 5:21-24 (Baiz). The Court asked Baker about the probation violation bench warrant currently active against him, and Baker  responded that he was convicted of a misdemeanor possession of marijuana and moved out of state and missed a  court proceeding, but that the court which issued the warrant would not act on it. See March 19 Tr. at 5:25-6:13  (Court, Baiz). The Court then asked about a 2015 failure to appear bench warrant that Bernalillo County issued, and  then canceled in 2017, and Baker responded that the warrant related to a traffic offense, and he had moved out of  town, so could not promptly resolve it, but resolved it once he returned to Albuquerque. See March 19 Tr. at 6:14-25  (Court, Baiz). Regarding [**30]  Baker's criminal history while under supervision, the Court clarified that the USPO is referring to  the fact that Baker violated the terms of his probation in Texas. See March 19 Tr. at 7:11-16 (Court). When asked what the United States feared would occur upon Baker's release, the United States cited fears that  Baker would contact or harass victims, or make them feel unsafe, and that he would engage in further human  trafficking or drug sales. See March 19 Tr. at 7:22-9:9 (Court, Simms). The Court asked the United States what in  Baker's criminal history gave it cause for concern, and the United States responded that his criminal history reveals  a track record of crimes focused on vulnerable women, as evidenced by his purse-snatching conviction, and of not  complying with the ""things that you have to do when you're a defendant in a criminal case,"" such as showing up to  hearings, even on ""insignificant charges."" March 19 Tr. at 11:3, 11:11-14 (Simms). The United States also cited to  his reckless endangerment charge and asserted that running red lights is ""dangerous to the community for no good  reason."" See March 9 Tr. at 11:1 (Simms). The Court then asked the probation officer what factors [**31]  led the USPO to believe Baker would be a flight risk,  and the probation officer cited to the fact that Baker did not report a change of address when he was on probation in  Texas and then moved to New Mexico, the fact that he has been unemployed since 2013, and the fact  [*1126]   that there are victims still missing in this case. See March 19 Tr. at 12:24-13:11 (Probation Officer). The Court ultimately agreed with Magistrate Judge Fashing that Baker is a flight risk. See March 19 Tr. at 16:7-12  (Court). The Court also agreed with Magistrate Judge Fashing that Baker poses a danger to the community, and  that the United States showed that by clear-and-convincing evidence. See March 19 Tr. at 15:4-7 (Court). The  Court noted that the case against Baker appears to be strong and that there appears to be considerable evidence  against him. See March 19 Tr. at 15:12-16 (Court). The Court stated that Baker does not have a significant violent  history, and that his substance abuse may be under control, but expressed its concern that Baker faces serious  charges and has not ""done well on probation or parole or supervised release."" See March 19 Tr. at 15:17-16:6  (Court). Given the seriousness of the charges against [**32]  him, and his history of poor compliance, the Court  determined it would not be possible to fashion a condition or set of conditions that would reasonably assure his  appearance at future proceedings, and because Baker might flee, the Court could not assure the safety of the  community. See March 19 Tr. at 15:24-16:15 (Court). In conclusion, the Court agreed with Magistrate Judge  Fashing's determination that Baker should continue to be detained. See March 19 Tr. at 16:18-20 (Court). 349 F. Supp. 3d 1113, *1125; 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173951, **28 Page 10 of 18   LAW REGARDING PRETRIAL DETENTION Pursuant to the Bail Reform Act of 1984, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141-3150, a court may detain a defendant pending trial only  after a hearing, held pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f), and upon a finding ""that no condition or combination of  conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and  the community."" 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e). At such a hearing, the United States bears the burden of proving risk of flight  by a preponderance of the evidence, and the burden of proving dangerousness by clear-and-convincing evidence.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f); United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 610, 616 (10th Cir. 2003). ""The rules concerning the  admissibility of evidence in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and consideration of information at the  [detention] hearing."" 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f). To [**33]  determine whether pretrial detention is warranted, the judicial  officer must consider the statutory factors that 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) lists: (g) Factors to be considered. -- The judicial officer shall, in determining whether there are conditions of  release that will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other  person and the community, take into account the available information concerning (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of  violence, a violation of section 1591, a Federal crime of terrorism, or involves a minor victim or a controlled  substance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and characteristics of the person, including (A) the person's character, physical and mental condition, family ties, employment, financial  resources, length of residence in the community, community ties, past conduct, history relating to drug  or alcohol abuse, criminal history, and record concerning appearance at court proceedings; and  [*1127]  (B) whether, at the time of the current offense or arrest, the person was on probation, on  parole, or on other release pending trial, [**34]  sentencing, appeal, or completion of sentence for an  offense under Federal, State, or local law; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that would be posed by the  person's release. In considering the conditions of release described in subsection (c)(1)(B)(xi) or  (c)(1)(B)(xii) of this section, the judicial officer may upon his own motion, or shall upon the motion of the  Government, conduct an inquiry into the source of the property to be designated for potential forfeiture or  offered as collateral to secure a bond, and shall decline to accept the designation, or the use as collateral,  of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as  required. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g). When a defendant is charged with certain crimes, however, a presumption arises that the defendant is a flight risk  and a danger to the community. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3); United States v. Villapudua-Quintero, 308 F. App'x  272, 273 (10th Cir. 2009)(unpublished) (per curiam)(recognizing that 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e) establishes a rebuttable           349 F.

To determine whether there are conditions that will reasonably assure the defendant's appearance and the  community's safety, a court must consider: (i) the nature and circumstances of the crime charged; (ii) the weight of  the evidence against the defendant; (iii) the defendant's history and characteristics, including family  [*1128]  ties,  employment, financial resources, community ties, drug or alcohol abuse history, and past conduct; and (iv) the  nature and seriousness of the danger to the community or to an individual that release would pose. See 18 U.S.C. §  3142(g). ""Should the defendant [**36]  satisfy his or her burden of production under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f), the United  States must then show by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight, or by clear- and-convincing evidence that the defendant presents a danger to the community.""

April 17, 2018)(Browning, J.)(""Conducting a de novo review, the Court agrees . . . that Castanon-Perez is a  flight risk . . . .""). ANALYSIS Baker's pretrial release is not warranted, because the United States has demonstrated, by a preponderance of the  evidence, that he is a flight risk and, by clear-and-convincing evidence, that he is a danger to the community. The  evidence against Baker is weighty, and he faces a severe sentence if convicted, which provides an incentive for him  to flee. Baker's proposed conditions of release -- that he be released to the custody of the La Pasada Halfway  House -- cannot adequately mitigate his tendency to do poorly on parole and release and thwart his temptation to  flee. Additionally, the likelihood that Baker will pose a danger to the community and specifically to his victims by  349 F. Supp. 3d 1113, *1127; 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173951, **34 Page 12 of 18   contacting or harassing them, is high, as the evidence suggests one of Baker's associates has already contacted  an alleged victim. The Court, therefore, denies the Appeal. I. THE BURDEN IS ON BAKER TO PRODUCE SOME EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT HE IS NOT A [**38]  FLIGHT  RISK OR A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY. Baker concedes in his Appeal that ""there is a presumption that no condition  [*1129]  or combination of conditions  of release can be fashioned in [his] case."" Appeal at 2. Statutory section 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E) provides that a  presumption of detention arises when ""there is probable cause to believe that the person committed"" certain  offenses involving minor victims, specifically including ""an offense involving a minor victim under section . . . 1591 . .  . [or] 2423 . . . ."" 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E). See United States v. Johnson, 660 F. App'x 663, 665 (10th Cir.  2016)(unpublished)(recognizing that 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e) establishes a rebuttable presumption favoring detention in  the case of certain alleged sex traffickers of minor children). The grand jury indictment is ""sufficient to establish the  finding of probable cause"" that a defendant committed the charged offenses. United States v. Holguin, 791 F. Supp.  2d at 1088. See United States v. Silva, 7 F.3d at 1046 (""The grand jury indictment is sufficient to establish the  finding of probable cause . . . .""); United States v. Stone, 608 F.3d 939, 945 (6th Cir. 2010)(""A grand jury indictment,  by itself, establishes probable cause to believe that a defendant committed the crime with which he is  charged.""(citations omitted)); United States v. Cruz, 23 F.3d 395, at *1 [published in full-text format at 1994 U.S.  App. LEXIS 10103] (6th Cir. 1999) (1st Cir. 1994)(""The grand jury indictment . . . gave the district court probable  cause to believe that appellant had committed a crime of violence . . . . This, in turn, triggered the [**39]  rebuttable  presumption contained in § 3142(e).""(citations omitted)); United States v. Williams, 903 F.2d 844, 1990 U.S. App.  LEXIS 8946,*2 (D.C. Cir. 1990)(""Courts of appeals . . . have uniformly held that a judicial officer may rely on a  grand jury indictment to establish probable cause for the purposes of triggering the rebuttable presumption of  section 3142(e).""(citations omitted)). The grand jury charged Baker in Count 11 of the Indictment [**40]  with a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1) and  Count 12 of the Indictment charges Baker with a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a). See Indictment at 1. The grand  jury revised Count 12 in the Superseding Indictment to encompass charged violations of both 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a)  and 18 U.S.C. § 2423(e). See Superseding Indictment at 1. Baker does not reference Count 11, but Magistrate  Judge Fashing found that the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3) presumption arises because both Counts 11 and 12 of the  Indictment involve a minor victim. See Order of Detention at 1. Statutory section 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E) provides  that offenses involving a minor victim under either § 1591 or § 2423 suffice to invoke the rebuttable presumption of  detention. Both Counts 11 and 12, therefore, form a basis for the rebuttable presumption of detention to arise.  Baker concedes in his Appeal that ""there is a presumption that no condition or combination of conditions of release  can be fashioned in [his] case."" Appeal at 2. The grand jury's Indictment and Superseding  [*1130]  Indictment              349 F. Supp. 3d 1113, *1128; 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173951, **37 Page 13 of 18   suffice to establish the finding of probable cause that Baker committed the charged offenses in Counts 11 and 12 of  the Indictment and Superseding Indictment. Because there is probable cause that Baker committed the charged  offenses, the rebuttable presumption in favor of detention arises. [**41]  Once the presumption in favor of detention is established, Baker must present some evidence that he is not a flight  risk or a danger to the community. ""Once the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the  defendant."" United States v. Holguin, 791 F. Supp. 2d at 1087 (quoting United States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d at 1354- 55). See United States v. Villapudua-Quintero, 308 F. App'x at 273 (""The defendant's burden of production is not  heavy, but some evidence must be produced."" (quoting United States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d at 1355)). ""Should the defendant satisfy his or her burden of production under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f), the United States must  then show by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight, or by clear-and- convincing evidence that the defendant presents a danger to the community.""

App'x at 273 (internal quotation marks omitted)(quoting United States v. Stricklin, 932  F.2d at 1355). See [**42]  United States v. Martinez, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114193, 2009 WL 5171853, at *7  (D.N.M. Oct. 28, 2009)(Browning, J.)(finding the defendant's burden of production satisfied where the only evidence  presented in support of his release was his brother's testimony, which the Court found to be weak). See also United  States v. Crisman, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133469, 2011 WL 5822731, at *15 (D.N.M. Nov. 15, 2011)(Browning,  J.)(finding the defendant's burden of production satisfied where the only evidence presented in support of his  release was his therapist's testimony, which the Court found not overwhelming). Baker presented some facts of  which the Court might take judicial notice, such as the fifteen-year temporal gap since Baker's most recent prior  conviction, that Texas will not extradite Baker based on his warrant for less than two ounces of marijuana, and that  the traffic-violation-related warrant was resolved by conviction on May 24, 2017. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 24:24-25  (Baiz); Motion to Release at 2. Baker did not present any testimony in support of his release at the September 29,  2018, hearing. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 24:18-21 (Court, Baiz). In the Appeal, Baker adds an argument that the 2012  allegations against him in the Indictment are necessarily false, because he was in Beaumont at the time they  occurred. See Appeal at 5. Counts 1 and 2 of the indictment allege a period from June 2012, [**43]  through June 3,  2015. See Indictment at 1-2. The United States, therefore, is correct that, even if Baker was living and working in  Texas until 2013, he  [*1131]  could still be found guilty of these counts. See Response at 4. Baker alleges that the victims are not scared of him, and accordingly, he is not a danger to the community. See  Appeal at 6. In support, Baker notes that V.A. never stated in her interview with Baker's defense team that she was  afraid of Baker. See Appeal at 6. There are many plausible reasons why victims of sex trafficking might not speak  out against a perpetrator. Without suggesting that the same circumstances or motivations exist here, the Court  notes, by way of illustration, some of the reasons trafficking victims in other cases have been reticent in interviews  with authorities. In United States v. Bell, 761 F.3d 900 (8th Cir. 2014), for instance, a sex trafficking victim did not  tell authorities about her trafficker, because he had threatened retribution against her, and another victim testified  that she performed commercial sex acts, because she ""would rather work for [her trafficker] than put [her] family in  danger."" United States v. Bell, 761 F.3d at 905-06. Baker also presents his interpretation of the United States'  recording of its interview with ""Jessica,"" [**44]  suggesting that 349 F. Supp. 3d 1113, *1130; 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173951, **40 Page 14 of 18   [i]n spite of much prompting by the police officer to say that she felt coerced, Jessica repeatedly said she was  not afraid of Mr. Baker and that she was engaging as a sex worker because she wanted to, not because she  was forced. She also stated that Mr. Baker would not do anything violent because he was a ""caring person."" Appeal at 5. As the United States correctly notes, Baker may still pose a danger to victims even if they state in interviews that  they are not afraid of him. See Response at 4-5. Furthermore, even if the Court accepts the notion that ""Jessica""  was engaging in sex work of her own volition -- and the evidence suggests otherwise -- the allegations and the  evidence presented at the detention hearing indicate that ""Jessica"" and the other victims did not want to engage in  sex work for Baker's pecuniary gain. Nevertheless, Baker's points constitute sufficient evidence to meet his  obligation to produce evidence to rebut the presumption in favor of detention. While he meets his burden of  production, Baker's evidence does not overwhelm the United States' other evidence. Baker states in conclusory  fashion that he is not a danger to any other person or the community, [**45]  see Appeal at 6, but he does not put  forward any argument to this effect. Finally, there are six named victims in this case, and Baker refers only to two of  them -- one who stated that she was not afraid of Baker, but the other who merely did not state that she was afraid  of Baker. See Appeal at 6. The United States also argues that there is a significant risk of victim harassment and  therefore also of witness tampering if Baker is released. See March 19 Tr. at 7:22-9:9 (Court, Simms). The United  States specifically notes evidence discovered since the September 29, 2017, hearing that one of Baker's associates  has already attempted to contact a victim over Facebook. See Response at 5. The Court applies a lenient standard in determining what evidence is sufficient to satisfy the defendant's burden of  production, and Baker has carried this light burden to produce evidence showing he is not a flight risk and is not a  danger to the community. Magistrate Judge Fashing concluded that Baker ""has not introduced sufficient evidence  to rebut the presumption,"" Sept. 29 Tr. at 27:14-15 (Court), but the Court concludes that there is enough evidence  for Baker to meet his burden of production. Magistrate [**46]  Judge Fashing also concluded, that, even if Baker  has presented sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption, she would still order his  [*1132]  detention, because  she concludes that the United States has presented clear-and-convincing evidence that Baker is a danger to the  community, and that, by a preponderance of the evidence, Baker is a flight risk. See Tr. at 27:15-28:5 (Court). With  respect to Magistrate Judge Fashing's other holdings, this Court agrees. III. THE COURT CONCLUDES THAT BAKER IS, BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE, A FLIGHT  RISK, AND BY CLEAR-AND-CONVINCING EVIDENCE, A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY. Although a presumption of detention arises in cases like Baker's, with charges involving a minor victim under §§  1591 and 2423, the United States still carries the burden of proving that Baker is a flight risk and/or a danger to the  community. See United States v. Villapudua-Quintero, 308 F. App'x at 273 (""The burden of persuasion regarding  risk-of-flight and danger to the community always remains with the government."" (quoting United States v. Stricklin,  932 F.2d at 1354-55)). See also United States v. Martinez, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114193, 2009 WL 5171853, at *3  (""The United States bears the burden of showing that the defendant is either a flight risk or a danger to the  community.""). To determine whether there are conditions that will reasonably assure the defendant's  appearance [**47]  and the community's safety, a court shall consider: (i) the charged crime's nature and  circumstances; (ii) the evidence's weight against the defendant; (iii) the defendant's history and characteristics,  including family ties, employment, financial resources, community ties, drug or alcohol abuse history, and past  conduct; and (iv) the nature and seriousness of the danger to the community, or to an individual that release would  pose. See United States v. Laneham, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118975, 2016 WL 5376318 (D.N.M. 2016)(Browning,  J.)(citing 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)). Considering these factors, the Court agrees with Magistrate Judge Fashing's  determination that there is clear-and-convincing evidence that Baker is a danger to the community, and, by a  preponderance of the evidence, Baker is a flight risk. A. BAKER IS A FLIGHT RISK. 349 F. Supp. 3d 1113, *1131; 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173951, **44 Page 15 of 18   Magistrate Judge Fashing, in considering Baker's lack of stable employment, the fact that he will face a severe  sentence if he is convicted of the charged offenses, and his history of failures to appear and probation violations  related to past offenses, found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there is no condition or combination of  conditions that will reasonably assure Baker's appearance as required. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 28:1-11 (Court). The  Court agrees with [**48]  Magistrate Judge Fashing's determination, and concludes that, considering the statutory  factors, the United States has met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that no conditions  could reasonably assure Baker's appearance in court. The Court concludes that, were Baker released before his  trial, it is more likely than not that he would flee. The first factor from 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g), the nature and circumstances of the charged offenses, weighs in favor of  finding Baker to be a flight risk. Baker faces a lengthy period of incarceration if he is convicted of the charged  offenses. On at least four of the counts in the Superseding Indictment, Baker faces, if convicted, a mandatory fifteen  years of incarceration on each. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 26:9-11 (Simms). Given the severe sentence he faces if  convicted of the charged offenses, and his poor performance when he has been on some form of supervised  release, the Court recognizes that Baker has a strong incentive to flee if released before trial and is unlikely to  comply with the  [*1133]  statutory conditions of release that the Court would impose. The second statutory factor, the weight of the United States' evidence against Baker, also favors finding [**49]   Baker to be a flight risk. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)(2). The evidence against Baker, if admissible, supports a finding  of guilt. The weight of the evidence is thus against Baker. At the detention hearing, in addition to the many reports  from victims describing Baker's conduct, Langer testified about Backpage.com advertisements that advertised  Baker's victims, and that also included telephone numbers, email addresses, and names of associates all known to  be connected to Baker. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 10:9-16 (Langer). Langer conceded that there are currently no video or  audio recordings of the alleged beatings which Baker inflicted on victims. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 13:3-9 (Baiz, Langer).  Langer also conceded that, while there are interviews with the witnesses, not all the witnesses have prepared  written statements. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 13:10-14 (Baiz, Langer). Langer testified, however, that there are hotel  records from Arizona and Colorado linked to Baker, corroborating the Backpage.com records from Arizona and  Colorado also linked to Baker. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 15:5-22 (Baiz, Langer). The United States argues that, based on the testimony provided at the detention hearing and the linking of Baker's  contact information [**50]  to advertisements selling women on Backpage.com, the evidence against him is strong,  and that the United States can prove that Baker is involved in human trafficking. See Response at 8-9. Baker  states that only one individual, V.A., is responsible for most of the allegations he faces of violence against women  and that V.A. stated in her interview with Baker's defense team that she was not frightened of Baker. See Appeal at  5. Baker also asserts that most interviews with witnesses are not recorded and that the only audio recording thus  far disclosed in discovery is of an individual named ""Jessica,"" who also states that she is not afraid of Baker and  finds him to be a caring person. See Appeal at 5. In its response, the United States asserted -- and it is correct --  that whether victims are currently afraid of defendants is not dispositive of whether the Defendants induced them to  engage in prostitution by means of force, threats, fraud, or coercion. See Response at 4-5. Considering the corroborating Backpage.com and hotel records linked to Baker, in combination with the reports  from various victims, the Court concludes the evidence against Baker, if admissible, supports a finding of [**51]   guilt. The Court concludes, therefore, that the weight of evidence against Baker is significant enough to create a  strong incentive for Baker to flee if released before trial, and that his poor performance on other forms of release  suggests that he will not do well under the restrictive conditions that the Court could impose. The third factor points in conflicting directions, but ultimately weighs in favor of finding Baker to be a flight risk. The  relevant sub-factors evaluating Baker's personal history and characteristics, the third factor under 18 U.S.C. §  3142(g), are: [C]haracter, physical and mental condition, family ties . . . length of residence in the community, community  ties, past conduct, history relating to drug or alcohol abuse, criminal history, [] record concerning appearance at  court proceedings; and whether, at the time of the current offense or arrest, [Baker] was on probation, on  parole, or on other release pending trial sentencing, appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under  Federal, State, or local law. 349 F. Supp. 3d 1113, *1132; 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173951, **47 Page 16 of 18   18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)(3)(A-B). Some of Baker's personal characteristics weigh in favor of release. There is no  [*1134]  evidence to suggest that  Baker has current or past mental health conditions. See Bail Report [**52]  at 3. Baker does not have a long  criminal history. See Appeal at 4. Baker admits to past drug addiction and has a 2013 conviction for a drug related  offense. See Appeal at 4. Baker indicated, through his counsel, that he no longer has a drug problem. See March  19 Tr. at 5:17-24 (Baiz). On the other hand, Baker's community ties are outside of New Mexico. See Appeal at 4. Baker was born in  Alabama, has a father, sister, and grandmother all in Alabama, and has only resided in New Mexico for the past  four years. See Appeal at 4. The Court also notes that Baker does not have a good record concerning appearance  at required court proceedings. See March 19 Tr. at 15:24-16:15 (Court). The Addendum to the Bail Report notes  that Baker has a history of ""non-compliance with past terms under community supervision."" Addendum at 1. At the  detention hearing, Magistrate Judge Fashing commented on the fact that Baker's record includes a 2015 failure to  appear on a low-level offense, an active warrant from Texas on a 2012 probation violation, and a 2006 probation  violation on a robbery conviction, indicating a history of poor performance on probation, parole, or supervised  release. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 28:6-11 (Court). [**53]  Baker's record indicates that he has fled in the face of much  less substantial charges than those he currently faces. Further, Baker has no strong ties to New Mexico, and his  closest family resides out of state. While an electronic bracelet may somewhat mitigate the risk of flight, realistically,  a defendant can take off long before the USPO and the United States Marshals realize that he has fled, putting  great distance between the defendant and the police. The severe sentence that Baker faces if convicted and the significant weight of the evidence against him suggest  that Baker has strong incentives to flee if released before trial. His lack of strong ties to New Mexico, and his history  of poor compliance on supervised release suggest that he is likely to and able to flee. The Court therefore finds, by  a preponderance of the evidence, that Baker is a flight risk. The Court also concludes there are no conditions of  release that will reasonably assure the appearance of Baker as required. B. BAKER IS A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY. The fourth statutory factor -- the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that Baker's  release poses -- weighs in favor of detention. [**54]  The United States has presented evidence of the nature and  seriousness of the danger to victims and to the community that Baker's release poses, and the Court concludes that  the evidence is clear and convincing. The Court is concerned that Baker would not do well on release and would  then try to contact alleged victims. In requiring courts to consider available information concerning the charged offenses' nature and circumstances  when determining whether to release a defendant from pretrial detention, 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)(1) specifically  requires courts to consider whether the charged offenses fall into certain categories. Namely, courts should  consider: (i) ""whether the [charged] offense is a crime of violence""; (ii) whether the charged offense is in ""violation of  section 1591,"" which concerns sex trafficking of children or by force, fraud, or coercion; (iii) whether the charged  offense is ""a Federal crime of terrorism""; and (iv) whether the charged offense ""involves [either] a minor victim . . .  controlled substance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device."" 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)(1). See 18 U.S.C. § 1591. A  grand jury has  [*1135]  indicted Baker for seven counts of violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. See Superseding  Indictment at 1. Additionally, two of the Counts in the Indictment [**55]  and Superseding Indictment involve a minor  victim. See Indictment at 1; Superseding Indictment at 1. Baker's charged offenses are the kind of offenses of which  18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)(1) specifically requires the Court to take notice. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)(1). According to Langer's testimony at the detention hearing, Baker allegedly targeted ""homeless, often drug addicted,  vulnerable women,"" and recruited them to prostitution by way of ""force, coercion, threats, violence."" See Sept. 29  Tr. at 8:12-16 (Langer). Langer testified to reports that Baker drugged women and transported them to other cities  and states. See Sept. 29 Tr. at 8:23-25 (Langer). Langer testified to allegations of sexual violence and rape, see  Sept. 29 Tr. at 10:24-25 (Langer), and allegations that Baker put a gun to one victim's head and held another  349 F. Supp. 3d 1113, *1133; 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173951, **51 Page 17 of 18   victim's head underwater, see Sept. 29 Tr. at 11:2-7 (Simms, Langer). The allegations that Baker specifically  targets vulnerable women and, in one instance, a minor, and uses drugs and physical force to compel them to  undertake acts in which they are not willing participants, are particularly troubling to the Court. The possibility that  Baker could target another vulnerable victim persuades the Court that Baker would [**56]  be a danger to society if  released. In addition to Langer's testimony, the United States presented evidence indicating that one of Baker's associates  has already attempted to contact an alleged victim, V.A., who stated in an interview that Baker held her head  underwater, and that Baker or one of his associates beat her. See Response at 5. The United States alleges that,  since Baker's defense team interviewed V.A. -- an interview which was ""unannounced and unscheduled"" -- V.A.  received a ""friend request"" on Facebook from an individual who is Facebook friends with Baker and is from  Alabama. Response at 5. The United States concedes that it cannot prove Baker was complicit in this contact, but it  asserts that ""it is extremely coincidental that this person, who V.A. does not know, contacted her from very near  Birmingham, Alabama, and is Facebook friends with Adonis Baker."" Response at 5. At the March 19, 2018,  hearing, the United States argued that the only reasonable inference from these facts is that Baker had something  to do with the Facebook contact. See March 19 Tr. at 9:23-24 (Simms). The United States argued that Baker may  already have made efforts to contact the victims to ""retaliate [**57]  against them or scare them to the point where  they're no longer cooperating with this investigation."" March 19 Tr. at 10:3-6 (Simms). This information was not  available at the time of the September 29, 2017, detention hearing before Magistrate Judge Fashing. See  Response at 5. Although the Court is not predisposed to believe the United States' side of the story, if the  allegations presented are true, the Court has no assurance that Baker will not harass, contact, or retaliate against  victims and potential witnesses if released. Placing Baker at La Pasada Halfway House does not appear to address  the danger concern or decrease the risk that Baker could retaliate against victims, because it appears that Baker  can do so through his associates and/or through virtual contact if he gains access to someone's cellular phone or  computer at the La Pasada Halfway House or has a visitor to which he can pass on threats. This risk is particularly  significant, the Court notes, because several of the victims are planned witnesses for the United States and  because three victims have not yet been located. As the United States asserts, ""because the penalties in this case  are so severe, the motivation [**58]  to find these women and silence them is  [*1136]  high."" Response at 11.  While putting Baker on lockdown at La Pasada, with GPS monitoring, certainly reduces the risks of fleeing and  danger, these conditions would not reduce those risks to zero, and if Baker walked off, the alleged victims and the  United States' case would be in danger. That is a risk, however minimized or mitigated, which is too high to be  tolerated. Because the United States has presented probable cause supporting Baker's federal charges, the statutory  presumption that Baker poses a danger to the community is triggered. While Baker has met his burden of  production in response to the statutory presumption favoring detention, the presumption remains a factor for the  Court to consider in making its ultimate determination regarding detention. See United States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d  at 1355 (""Even if a defendant's burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for consideration by  the district court in determining whether to release or detain.""). Baker is charged with sex trafficking by means of  force, threats, fraud and coercion; coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution; transportation for  prostitution; sex trafficking of a child; and transportation [**59]  of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual  activity. See Indictment at 1. Langer's testimony at the detention hearing suggests that there are many victims  presenting allegations connecting Baker to a well-organized, multi-state sex trafficking operation, fueled by drugs,  coercion, threats of force, and physical force against vulnerable women and, in at least one instance, a minor  victim. Evidence that Baker's contact information and his associates are linked to Backpage.com pages advertising  women and to hotel records, which is consistent with the information that the Backpage.com pages reveal,  corroborates the victims' reports. Additionally, there is some indication that one of Baker's associates has, since the  September 29, 2017, detention hearing, attempted to contact V.A., one of the alleged victims and state's witnesses.  Consequently, the Court finds that, by clear-and-convincing evidence, Baker is a danger to the community. If  released, the temptation to harass and silence his alleged victims to avoid the severe sentences which he faces  would be great. In the end, the Court is convinced that the temptation will be too great. 349 F. Supp. 3d 1113, *1135; 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173951, **55 Page 18 of 18   IV. THE COURT BELIEVES IT CANNOT REDUCE BAKER'S [**60]  RISK OF NONAPPEARANCE TO AN  ACCEPTABLE LEVEL EVEN WITH RESTRICTIVE CONDITIONS. Baker proposes that the Court place him at La Pasada Halfway House to help mitigate his risk of nonappearance  and danger to the community. The Court is not convinced that this restriction, even in combination with some of the  restrictions which the Court has applied in the past, would mitigate these risks to an acceptable level to reasonably  assure his appearance and to reasonably assure that he will not be a danger to the community. In the past, the  Court has considered: ""(i) house arrest with RF monitoring; (ii) GPS monitoring; (iii) substantial restrictions on  outside visitors; and (iv) significant restrictions on telephone use."" United States v. Varela, 2012 WL 13081272, at  *9-10 (D.N.M. Feb. 21, 2012)(Browning, J.). While these conditions would mitigate the risk of Baker's  nonappearance and the danger his release poses to the community, the Court concludes that the temptation for  Baker to walk away from the facility is too great, given the weight of the evidence against him and the severity of the  sentence he faces if convicted. The Court concludes that the United States has shown by clear-and-convincing  evidence that he would pose a danger to the state's witnesses -- the [**61]  alleged victims in this case -- [*1137]   and that the risk that he might harass or otherwise attempt to silence them could not be managed if Baker were to  leave the facility, which the Court finds more likely than not he would do. Concluding that a presumption in favor of detention arises in this case because Baker's charged offenses include  an offense involving a minor victim under § 1591, the Court also concludes that Baker has presented sufficient  evidence to meet his burden of production. Even though Baker has presented sufficient evidence to meet his  burden of production here, the Court concludes that, considering the statutory factors in § 3142(g) and the evidence  presented, the United States has shown by clear-and-convincing evidence that Baker is a danger to the community  and by a preponderance of the evidence that Baker is a flight risk. Finally, concluding that the Court cannot reduce  Baker's risk of nonappearance and danger to the community to acceptable levels through the imposition of any  condition or combination of conditions, the Court will order that Baker be detained pending trial. IT IS ORDERED that: (i) the Defendant's Appeal of Detention Order, filed March 5, 2018 (Doc. 51), is denied;  (ii) [**62]  the Order of Detention Pending Trial, filed September 29, 2017 (Doc. 15), is affirmed, and (iii) the Order  Denying Motion to Release Defendant from Custody, filed January 2, 2018 (Doc. 46) is affirmed. /s/ James O.

C.S. v. Choice Hotels,"OPINION AND ORDER This matter comes before the Court on review of  defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc.'s Motion to  Dismiss Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint with  Prejudice (Doc. #20) filed on October 8, 2020, and  defendant Robert Vocisano's Motion to Dismiss with  Prejudice  Plaintiff's  Complaint  and  Incorporated  Memorandum of Law (Doc. #22) filed [*2]  on October  13, 2020. Plaintiff filed an Opposition (Doc. #37) and a  Memorandum in Opposition (Doc. #38) on November 5,  2020, to which the defendants each filed a Reply (Doc.  #44; Doc. #45) on November 19, 2020. For the reasons  set forth below, the motions are denied. I. The origins of this case began on October 30, 2019,  when plaintiff and another alleged victim of sex  trafficking filed a case in the Circuit Court of the  Twentieth Judicial Circuit in and for Collier County,  Florida. See S.Y. et al v. Naples Hotel Co. et al, Case  No. 2:20-cv-118 (Doc. #1, p. 3). On December 31, 2019,  the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint which  asserted ten claims against over forty defendants. Id. at  (Doc. #1, pp. 2-4). The case was removed to federal  court in February 2020. Id. at (Doc. #1). On April 15,  2020, the plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint.  Id. at (Doc. #85). On August 5, 2020, the undersigned  denied various motions to dismiss, but determined  severance of the parties was appropriate. S.Y. v. Naples  Page 2 of 15 Hotel Co., 476 F. Supp. 3d 1251, 1258-59 (M.D. Fla.  2020). Following the Court's severance order, plaintiff  and the other alleged victim filed nearly thirty new  actions against various defendants, including this case. The Complaint (Doc. #1) in this case [*3]  was filed on  August 19, 2020, and alleges that plaintiff C.S., a  resident of Collier County, Florida, was a victim of  continuous sex trafficking at a certain Quality Inn &  Suites Golf Resort (the Quality Inn Hotel) in Naples,  Florida between 2014 and February 2016. (Id. ¶¶ 2, 13,  22-24.) The Complaint alleges that during this time  period the Quality Inn Hotel was owned and operated by  defendant Robert Vocisano (Vocisano) as a franchisee  of defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc. (Choice).  (Id. ¶¶ 25-28, 44-45, 50.) The Complaint alleges the following six claims: (1)  violation  of  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), 18 U.S.C. §  1595; (2) violation of the Florida RICO statute, §  772.104, Florida Statutes; (3) premise liability; (4)  negligent hiring, supervision, and retention; (5) negligent  rescue; and (6) aiding and abetting, harboring,  confining, coercion, and criminal enterprise. (Id. pp. 33- 49.) Counts One through Four are asserted against  each defendant, while Counts Five and Six are asserted  against Vocisano. (Id.) II. The motions to dismiss raise numerous arguments as to  why the Complaint as whole, and each individual claim,  should be dismissed. The Court will address each of  these arguments in turn. A. Shotgun Pleading The Complaint identifies the defendants [*4]  collectively  as the ""Quality Inn Defendants."" (Doc. #1, p. 1  introductory paragraph.) Both motions argue that  because the Complaint groups them together, it should  be dismissed as a shotgun pleading. (Doc. #20, pp. 12- 13; Doc. #22, p. 5.) One way in which a complaint may constitute an      impermissible shotgun pleading is if it ""assert[s] multiple  claims against multiple defendants without specifying  which of the defendants are responsible for which acts  or omissions, or which of the defendants the claim is  brought against."" Weiland v. Palm Beach Cty. Sheriff's  Office, 792 F.3d 1313, 1323 (11th Cir. 2015); see also  Barmapov v. Amuial, 986 F.3d 1321, 1324-25 (11th Cir.  2021). Such a pleading fails ""to give the defendants  adequate notice of the claims against them and the  grounds upon which each claim rests,"" Weiland, 792  F.3d at 1323, and violates the requirement that a  plaintiff provide ""a short and plain statement of the  claim,"" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The Complaint does indeed repeatedly refer to the  defendants collectively as the ""Quality Inn Defendants.""  The failure to specify a particular defendant is not fatal,  however, when ""[t]he complaint can be fairly read to  aver that all defendants are responsible for the alleged  conduct."" Kyle K. v. Chapman, 208 F.3d 940, 944 (11th  Cir. 2000). The Complaint typically (but not always)  alleges that ""each and every"" such defendant was  involved in the activity described in the particular [*5]   paragraph of the Complaint. A fair reading of the  Complaint is that each of these defendants was involved  in the identified conduct attributed to the ""Quality Inn  Defendants."" While defendants may disagree that such  allegations are accurate, that dispute is for another day.  The group allegations do not fail to state a claim, Auto.  Alignment & Body Serv., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co., 953 F.3d 707, 732-33 (11th Cir. 2020), and the  Complaint does not constitute a shotgun pleading. B. Failure to State a Claim                      2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *2 Page 3 of 15 The motions argue certain claims should be dismissed  due to plaintiff's failure to state a claim upon which relief  may be granted. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2)  requires that a complaint contain a ""short and plain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This obligation  ""requires more than labels and conclusions, and a  formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action  will not do."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,  555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation  omitted). To survive dismissal, the factual allegations  must be ""plausible"" and ""must be enough to raise a right  to relief above the speculative level."" Id. at 555; see also  Edwards v. Prime Inc., 602 F.3d 1276, 1291 (11th Cir.  2010). This requires ""more than an unadorned, the- defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation."" Ashcroft  v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed.  2d 868 (2009) (citations omitted). In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court  must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as [*6]   true and take them in the light most favorable to the  plaintiff, Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct.  2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal  conclusions without adequate factual support are  entitled to no assumption of truth,"" Mamani v. Berzaín,  654 F.3d 1148, 1153 (11th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted).  ""Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of  action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do  not suffice."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Factual allegations  that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability fall  short of being facially plausible. Chaparro v. Carnival  Corp., 693 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir. 2012) (citations  omitted). Thus, the Court engages in a two-step  approach: ""When there are well-pleaded factual  allegations, a court should assume their veracity and  then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an  entitlement to relief."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. (1) Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization  Act Both motions challenge the one federal claim, the  alleged violation of the TVPRA set forth in Count One.  (Doc. #20, pp. 14-28; Doc. #22, pp. 6-12.) The TVPRA  provides a civil remedy to victims of certain types of  human trafficking. The civil remedy portion of the Act  provides: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation [*7]  in a venture which that person  knew or should have known has engaged in an act  in violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). The phrase ""a violation of this  chapter"" refers to Chapter 77 of Title 18 of the United  States Code. The only violation of Chapter 77 relevant  to this case is contained in 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a), which  provides in relevant part: (a) Whoever knowingly - (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign  commerce . . . recruits, entices, harbors,  transports,  provides,  obtains,  advertises,  maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any means  a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything  of value, from participation in a venture which  has engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as [*8]  provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). To state a section 1595(a) claim in  this case, plaintiff must plausibly allege that she was a  victim of a criminal offense under section 1591(a), and  then must plausibly allege that defendant (1)""knowingly  benefit[ted] financially or by receiving anything of value,""  (2) from participation in a venture, (3) which defendant  ""knew or should have known has engaged in"" sex  trafficking under section 1591(a). S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d  at 1255-56 (citing A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 455 F. Supp.  3d 171, 181 (E.D. Pa. 2020)). (a) Plausible Allegations Re: § 1591 Violation Choice first argues that plaintiff fails to allege an  underlying section 1591 violation by failing ""to set out  any  facts  describing  any  criminal  investigation,  indictment, prosecution, or conviction."" (Doc. #20, p.  15.) The Complaint alleges: 84. From approximately 2014 through February  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *5 Page 4 of 15 2016, Plaintiff C.S. was recruited to, enticed to,  solicited to, held at, harbored as captive at and/or  transported to various hotels in Naples, Florida by  her sex traffickers to engage in commercial sex  acts at these hotels on a regular, consistent and/or  repeated basis, from approximately 2014 to  February 2016, Plaintiff C.S. was trafficked by  Gregory Hines (aka Bowlegs), Keith Lewis and  others at the Quality Inn Hotel. (Doc. #1, ¶ 84.) There is no requirement that the sex  trafficker have been [*9]  convicted criminally to support  a civil claim against defendants for knowingly financially  benefitting from the sex trafficking, and Choice  provides no legal support for this argument. Choice also argues that plaintiff has not alleged  coercion giving rise to an underlying violation of section  1591, asserting that plaintiff was free to meet the ""John""  in the lobby, and she could walk the hallways without  confinement. (Doc. #20, pp. 16-17.) For purposes of § 1591, ""coercion"" is defined as (1)  ""threats of serious harm to or physical restraint  against any person;"" (2) ""any scheme, plan, or  pattern intended to cause a person to believe that  failure to perform an act would result in serious  harm to or physical restraint against any person""; or  (3) ""the abuse or threatened abuse of law or the  legal process."" Id. § 1591(e)(2). ""Serious harm,"" in  turn, is ""any harm, whether physical or nonphysical,  including psychological, financial, or reputational  harm, that is sufficiently serious, under all the  surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable  person of the same background and in the same  circumstances to perform or to continue performing  commercial sexual activity in order to avoid  incurring that harm."" Id. § 1591(e)(4). United States v. Williams, 714 F. App'x 917, 918 (11th  Cir. 2017). The allegations [*10]  in the Complaint are  more than conclusory with regard to the threats of  serious harm or physical restraint, and do not only  allege sexual abuse and prostitution. (Doc. #20, pp. 16- 17.) Some of the relevant allegations are as follows: 58. At all material times, each and every Quality Inn       Defendant,  as  owners,  operators,  managers,  supervisors, controllers and/or entities otherwise  responsible for hotels, including the Quality Inn  Hotel, knew or should have known that traffickers  were harboring, raping and assaulting victims at  their hotels, including the Quality Inn Hotel, and  were forcing them to engage in ""in call"" services,  wherein buyers (""Johns"") would come to the hotels  solely to purchase sex from these victims, as well  as ""out call"" services, wherein the buyer would rent  a hotel room and the trafficker would deliver the  victim to the buyer's room to complete the sordid  transaction. . . . 69. Each and every Quality Inn Defendant,  individually and by and through their actual or  apparent agents, servants, franchisees, employees  and/or staff, were aware of and/or should have  been aware of a number of warning signs at their  hotels, including the Quality Inn Hotel, that  indicated the presence [*11]  of human trafficking,  including but not limited to: a. persons showing signs of malnourishment,  poor  hygiene,  fatigue,  sleep  deprivation,  untreated illness, injuries, and/or unusual  behavior; b. persons lacking freedom of movement or  being constantly monitored; c.  persons  having  no  control  over  or  possession of money or ID; d. persons dressing inappropriately for their  age or having lower quality clothing compared  to others in their party; e. persons requesting room or housekeeping  services (additional towels, new linens, etc.),  but denying hotel staff entry into the room; f. the presence of multiple computers, cell  phones, pagers, credit card swipers, or other  technology in the room; g. persons extending stay with few or no  personal possessions in the room; h. excessive amounts of sex paraphernalia in  rooms (condoms, lubricant, lotion); i. the same person reserving multiple rooms; j. a room being rented hourly, less than a day,  or for an atypical extended stay; k. attempts of persons to sell items to or beg  from patrons or staff; l. cars in the parking lot regularly parked  backward, so the license plates are not visible; m. loitering and solicitation of male patrons; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *8 Page 5 of 15 n. individuals waiting at a [*12]  table or bar  and then being picked up by a male (trafficker  or customer); o. persons asking staff or patrons for food or  money; and p. persons taking cash or receipts left on  tables. . . . 135. Plaintiff C.S. was a hotel guest at the Quality  Inn  Hotel  and  Plaintiff  was  seriously  and  permanently injured as a direct result of each and  every Quality Inn Defendants' acts and omissions,  in that each and every Quality Inn Defendant  permitted, harbored and facilitated illegal sex  trafficking ventures to take place at the Quality Inn  Hotel whereby the Plaintiff C.S. was routinely and  continuously abused, battered, falsely imprisoned,  raped, beaten, starved, forcibly injected with drugs  and enslaved. 136. More specifically, at all material times, in  the quest for profits, the acts and omissions of  each  and  every  Quality  Inn  Defendant  regarding the Quality Inn Hotel caused the  Plaintiff to suffer: a. Forced labor; b. Forced confinement without safe means  of escape; c. Assault and fear; d. Sickness, dizziness and headaches; e. Cuts, lacerations, abrasions and other  physical harm; f. Mental anguish, humiliation, exploitation,  degradation and mental distress; g. Suffocation, battery and rape; h. Shock, fright [*13]  and post-traumatic  stress; i. Overdose and drug-induced dangers (the  Plaintiff suffered drug overdoses, drug-induced  actions which caused harm to themselves [sic],  physical deformities and scarfing [sic] from  actions of the ""Johns"" and drug usage); and j. Invasion of privacy and wrongful entry of  ""Johns."" (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 58, 69, 135-36.) The allegations are not  ""simply a regurgitation of the statutes' wording woven  together with conclusory statements and a generous  use of 'and/or.'"" Kelsey v. Goldstar Est. Buyers Corp.,  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37361, 2014 WL 1155253, at *6  (D. Or. Mar. 21, 2014). The motion will be denied as  plaintiff has stated plausible facts in support of a section  1591 violation. (b) ""Participation"" in a ""Venture"" The defendants argue that the Complaint lacks well-pled  allegations that it participated in a ""venture,"" as required  by section 1595(a). (Doc. #20, p. 23; Doc. #22, pp. 6-9.)  Drawing on the definition of ""venture"" used in the  criminal portion of the statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(6) ,  Vocisano asserts that a ""venture"" requires two or more  individuals ""associated in fact."" (Doc. #22, p. 6.)  Borrowing  from  the  federal  RICO  definition  of  ""enterprise,"" the defendants argue that ""associated in  fact"" requires that persons must operate as a  ""continuing unit that functions with a common purpose.""  (Doc. #20, p. 23; Doc. #22, pp. [*14]  6-7.) Vocisano  continues that in the context of a TVPRA claim against a  hotel operator, the Complaint must ""at least"" allege a  ""continuous business relationship between the trafficker  and the hotels such that it would appear that the  trafficker and the hotels have established a pattern of  conduct or could be said to have a tacit agreement.""  (Doc. #22, p. 7) (citing M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels &  Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959, 970 (S.D. Ohio  2019)); see also Doe v. Rickey Patel, LLC, 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (S.D. Fla.  Sept. 30, 2020) (""In order to plead Defendants  participated in a venture, Plaintiff must allege facts from  which the Court could reasonably infer the hotels could  be said to have a tacit agreement with the trafficker.""  (marks  omitted)).  Vocisano  concludes  that  ""a  commercial transaction,"" such as the rental of a hotel  room, ""does not give rise to a reasonable inference that  the participants in such a transaction shared any  common purpose or otherwise 'associated in fact.'""  (Doc. #22, p. 7.) Similarly, Choice asserts that plaintiff  has failed to allege it associated in fact with the non- party traffickers. (Doc. #20, p. 23.) Here, the Complaint alleges the defendants participated  in a venture ""by engaging in a pattern of acts and  omissions that were intended to support, facilitate,  harbor, and otherwise further the traffickers' [*15]  sale  and victimization of the Plaintiff C.S. for commercial  sexual exploitation by repeatedly renting rooms at  Quality Inn Hotel to people"" the defendants ""knew or  should have known were engaged in sex trafficking.""  (Doc. #1, ¶ 159.) The Complaint also alleges why the     2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *11 Page 6 of 15 defendants should have been on notice of the sex  trafficking and how it failed to prevent it. (Id. at ¶¶ 4-16,  56-83, 117.) The Court finds the allegations in the  Complaint sufficient to allege participation in a venture  under section 1595(a). See Doe, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (""The Court finds it  sufficient  for  Plaintiff  to  plead  that  Defendants  participated in a venture by renting rooms to individuals  that knew or should have known were involved in a sex- trafficking  venture,  including  the  sex-trafficking  victim.""); M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 971 (""This Court finds  Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to show Defendants  'participated in a venture' under § 1595 by alleging that  Defendants rented rooms to people it knew or should  have known where [sic] engaged in sex trafficking.""). Choice and Vocisano also argue that ""participation"" in a  venture requires an allegation of an overt act in  furtherance of the venture, and that failure to prevent  sex trafficking is insufficient. (Doc. #20, pp. 18- 19; [*16]  Doc. #22, pp. 7-8.) The Court is not  convinced. S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1256 (""In the  absence of any controlling authority, the Court  concludes  that  actual  'participation  in  the  sex  trafficking act itself' is not required to state a claim  under section 1595. Accordingly, plaintiffs' failure to  allege such actual participation is not fatal to its section  1595 claim under the TVPRA.""). The defendants have  not identified any controlling authority to the contrary. (c) Knowingly Benefited From Participating in  Venture The motions next argue that the Complaint insufficiently  alleges the defendants knowingly benefitted from  participating in a venture that committed TVPRA crimes,  with knowledge of the causal relationship. (Doc. #20,  pp. 17-23; Doc. #22, p. 9.) Vocisano argues that the  allegation that he benefited generally from the operation  of the hotel is insufficient for TVPRA liability. (Doc. #22,  p. 9.) The Complaint alleges the defendants knowingly  benefited from the sex trafficking of plaintiff ""by  receiving payment for the rooms rented for Plaintiff C.S.  and her traffickers at the Quality Inn Hotel,"" and by  receiving ""other financial benefits in the form of food and      beverage sales and ATM fees from those persons who  were engaging in sex [*17]  trafficking."" (Doc. #1, ¶  157.) As to Choice, as franchisor, the Complaint alleges  it ""received a significant franchise fee and continuous  royalties on the Quality Inn Hotel's gross revenue,"" while  also exercising ""ongoing and systematic control over  operations at the Quality Inn Hotel."" (Id. ¶¶ 44, 114.)  The Court finds such allegations sufficient to satisfy the  ""knowingly benefitted"" element. S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at  1257; Doe S.W. v. Lorain-Elyria Motel, Inc., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192, at *5 (S.D. Ohio  Mar. 16, 2020); H.H. v. G6 Hosp., LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *2 (S.D. Ohio  Dec. 6, 2019); M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 965. (d) Knew or Should Have Known that Venture was  Committing Sex Trafficking Crimes Both motions argue the Complaint fails to plausibly  allege the defendants knew or should have known that  the ""venture"" was engaging in sex-trafficking crimes,  i.e., that the defendants knew or should have known  that an adult plaintiff was caused to engage in  commercial sex by force, threats of force, fraud, or  coercion. (Doc. #20, pp. 23-26; Doc. #22, pp. 10-12.)  Choice argues that ""[a]t most,"" the Plaintiff's allegations  speak to constructive knowledge of Choice's general  knowledge that prostitution and sex trafficking occurs  around the world at all hotels,"" but not the sex  trafficking of plaintiff. (Doc. #20, p. 25.) Similarly,  Vocisano  argues  the  Complaint  lacks  plausible  allegations that it ""knew or should [*18]  have known"" of  any venture that trafficked plaintiff. (Doc. #22, p. 12.) The Court disagrees with this argument. First of all,  ""knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind  may be alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b); see Sun  Life Assurance Co. of Can. v. Imperial Premium Fin.,  LLC, 904 F.3d 1197, 1215 (11th Cir. 2018). Pleading  ""generally"" is not without limits, and a complaint must  still comply with ""the less rigid—though still operative— strictures of Rule 8."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 686-87. The  Complaint clearly satisfies this notice pleading standard. Plaintiff has alleged that the following was ""routine  conduct taking place at the Quality Inn Hotel as a result  of the human sex trafficking enterprise"": a. Plaintiff's sex traffickers frequently rented rooms  at the hotel close to each other; b. Plaintiff's sex traffickers paid cash for the rooms  at the Quality Inn Hotel where the Plaintiff engaged  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *15 Page 7 of 15 in commercial sex acts; c. Plaintiff's sex traffickers booked extended stays  at the Quality Inn Hotel for themselves and for the  Plaintiff on a routine basis and on a rotating basis  frequently throughout the year; d. Plaintiff and her sex traffickers would have few or  no luggage or personal possessions for these  extended stays; e. Plaintiff was confined in the rooms at the Quality  Inn Hotel for long periods of time; f. Plaintiff's rooms [*19]  and her sex traffickers'  rooms consistently displayed ""Do Not Disturb"" signs  on the doors to the room where the Plaintiff was  engaged in commercial sex acts; g. Men (""Johns"") frequently entered and left the  rooms at the Quality Inn Hotel where the Plaintiff  was engaged in illegal commercial sex acts at all  times of day and night; h. The staff and customers at the Quality Inn Hotel  that was owned, operated, managed, supervised,  controlled and/or otherwise held responsible by  each and every Quality Inn Defendant saw and/or  reported to the Quality Inn Hotel's respective  administration that the rooms where the Plaintiff  engaged in commercial sex acts were messy, and  contained sex and drug paraphernalia and had an  unclean smell; i. The rooms at the Quality Inn Hotel were often  stained with Plaintiff's blood and that of other  trafficking victims after they were beaten or  violently raped; j. Plaintiff's sex traffickers consistently refused  housekeeping  services  and  otherwise  would  prohibit staff from entering their rooms and the  Plaintiff's rooms; k. Plaintiff would frequently request clean towels  and linens; l. Plaintiff dressed in a sexually explicit manner and  would walk the hallways of the [*20]  Quality Inn  Hotel in inappropriate attire; m. Excessively loud noises would consistently  come from Plaintiff's rooms; n. During nighttime hours, Plaintiff and her ""Johns""  and drug clients would create noise in the public  area of the Quality Inn Hotel and, upon information  and belief, would be a disturbance to other guests  using the hotel for their intended purposes; o. Plaintiff would sleep during the day and the staff  members  of  the  Quality  Inn  Hotel  would  consistently see the Plaintiff wearing lounge or  sleep type clothing during the day; p. While at the hotel and at the hotel pool, the  Plaintiff displayed clear signs of physical abuse,  diminished personal hygiene, submissiveness and  inappropriate attire; and q. While at the Quality Inn Hotel, Plaintiff C.S. was  forced to earn money for her trafficker by openly  soliciting other hotel guests at the Quality Inn Hotel  bar. (Doc. #1, ¶ 98.) Further, the Complaint alleges the  defendants ""knew or should have known about the  nature of the sex trafficking venture at the Quality Inn  Hotel, including as they related to Plaintiff C.S."" due to  the following: a. Requests by the traffickers to rent rooms in the  tower to the left of the front entrance; [*21]  b. Cash payments for the rooms by the sex  traffickers; c. Refusal of housekeeping services by those  persons engaged in sex trafficking; d. Excessive used condoms located in the rooms  used for sex trafficking; e. Excessive requests for towels and linens in the  rooms used for sex trafficking; f. Hotel staff observing Plaintiff C.S. and her  traffickers in the hotel; g. Plaintiff C.S. being escorted by traffickers in and  around the hotel; h. Operation of sex trafficking ventures out of the  same hotel room for multiple days or weeks in  succession; i. Multiple men per day coming and going from the  same  rooms  without  luggage  or  personal  possessions; j. Knowledge of police and EMS activity at the  Quality Inn Hotel and at other locations near the  Quality Inn Hotel that was related to commercial  sex work; and k. Knowledge that Plaintiff C.S. and other sex  trafficking victims were forced by their traffickers to  solicit other hotel guests at the bar on the Quality  Inn Hotel's premises. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *18 Page 8 of 15 (Id. ¶ 158.) The  Court  finds  these  allegations  sufficient  to  reasonably infer the defendants knew or should have  known of the sex trafficking venture. S.Y., 476 F.  Supp. 3d at 1257; A.B., 455 F. Supp. 3d at 193-94; Doe  S.W., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192,  at *5-6; H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL  6682152, at *3; M.A., 425 F. Supp 3d at 967-68. (e) Vicarious Liability Finally, Choice argues the TVPRA claim should [*22]   be dismissed because ""[t]here is no vicarious liability  under the plain meaning of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #20, p.  26.) The Court disagrees. See S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at  1257-58 (finding plaintiff made sufficient allegations that  franchisor was vicariously liable under section 1595 of  the TVPRA to survive dismissal); see also J.C. v.  Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073,  2020 WL 6318707, at *10 (N.D. Ca. Oct. 28, 2020)  (finding plaintiff's vicarious liability claim had ""alleged  sufficient facts to support a plausible claim that  [defendants] received financial benefits from a venture  they vicariously participate in (through their franchisees)  that the franchises should have known was engaged in  sex trafficking.""). Choice also argues that even if it could be held  vicariously liable under the TVPRA, plaintiff's allegations  are insufficient to establish an agency relationship  between Choice and its franchisee. (Doc. #20, p. 27.)  Having reviewed the allegations at issue, the Court finds  them sufficient to create a plausible inference of an  agency relationship. ""It is well-established that a franchise relationship does  not by itself create an agency relationship between the  franchisor and franchisee."" Cain v. Shell Oil Co., 994 F.  Supp. 2d 1251, 1252 (N.D. Fla. 2014). However,  ""[f]ranchisors may well enter into an agency relationship  with a franchisee if, by contract or action or  representation, the franchisor [*23]  has directly or  apparently participated in some substantial way in  directing or managing acts of the franchisee, beyond the  mere fact of providing contractual franchise support  activities."" Mobil Oil Corp. v. Bransford, 648 So. 2d 119,  120 (Fla. 1995). Here, the Complaint alleges Choice was in an agency  relationship with Vocisano during the relevant time  period. (Doc. #1, ¶ 116.) The Complaint further asserts  that in a variety of ways Choice exercised control over  the means and methods of how Vocisano conducted  business, such as by profit sharing, standardized  training, standardized rules of operation, regular  inspection, and price fixing. (Id. at ¶ 115.) The Court  finds such allegations sufficient to support a plausible  inference of an agency relationship. See S.Y., 476 F.  Supp. 3d at 1258; A.B., 455 F. Supp. 3d at 195-97; Doe  S.W., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192,  at *7; H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL  6682152, at *6; M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 972. Because the allegations in the Complaint are sufficient  to state a claim under section 1595 of the TVPRA, the  Court denies the motions for dismissal pursuant to Rule  12(b)(6). (2) Florida RICO Violation Count Two of the Complaint asserts a claim against  both defendants under Florida's civil RICO statute,  section 772.104, Florida Statutes. (Doc. #1, ¶ 161.) To  state a claim under the statute, plaintiff must allege  plausible facts showing ""(1) conduct or participation in  an enterprise through (2) a pattern of [criminal] activity.""  Horace-Manasse v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 521 F.  App'x 782, 784 (11th Cir. 2013) (quoting Lugo v. State,                            2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *21 Page 9 of 15 845 So. 2d 74, 97 (Fla. 2003)). The defendants [*24]  argue that plaintiff lacks standing  because personal injuries cannot be remedied by RICO.  (Doc. #20, p. 28; Doc. #22, p. 16.) There is some  authority to suggest the Florida RICO statute, unlike the  federal equivalent, does not ""expressly limit recovery"" to  persons who have suffered injury to their business or  property, and that recovery for personal injuries may be  allowed. Berber v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 2018 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 234385, 2018 WL 10436236, at *3 (S.D.  Fla. May 24, 2018) (collecting cases). The motion will be  denied on this basis. Plaintiff's RICO claim is asserted under sections  772.104(1) and (2), which provide civil remedies for  violations of section 772.103, Florida Statutes. (Doc. #1,  ¶ 161.) Section 772.103 contains four subsections of  prohibited activities. § 772.103, Fla. Stat. Vocisano  argues that because plaintiff fails ""to specify the  particular subsection of Section 772.103 giving rise to a  Florida RICO claim,"" the claim is defective. (Doc. #22,  pp. 12-13.) Plaintiff fails to address this argument in her  response. See (Doc. #37.) This court has previously stated that a RICO claim's  failure to identify which subsection of section 772.103 is  implicated is sufficient to warrant dismissal. Lennon v.  Marriott Ownership Resorts, Inc., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  55004, 2019 WL 1440092, at *10 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 31,  2019); Signeo Int'l Ltd. v. Wade, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  203002, 2013 WL 12153590, at *6 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 1,  2013). However, the Court finds dismissal unnecessary  in this case because it is apparent which subsection  plaintiff is relying upon. Section 772.103(3) makes it  unlawful for any person associated with any enterprise  to conduct [*25]  or participate in such enterprise  through a pattern of criminal activity. In the Complaint,  plaintiff  alleges  the  defendants  ""conducted  or  participated in . . . the affairs of their respective RICO  Enterprises through a pattern of numerous acts of  racketeering activity . . . in violation of Fla. Stat. §  772.103."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 165.) Because this allegation  tracks the language of subsection three, the Court finds          it provides sufficient notice of the applicable provision.  Accordingly, the Court denies Vocisano's request for  dismissal on this basis. Each of the motions also argue plaintiff has insufficiently  pled the enterprise element of her claim. (Doc. #20, pp.  28-31; Doc. #22, pp. 13-15.) Florida's RICO statute  defines enterprise to include a ""group of individuals  associated in fact although not a legal entity."" §  772.102(3), Fla. Stat. ""[A]n association-in-fact enterprise  is simply a continuing unit that functions with a common  purpose."" Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 948,  129 S. Ct. 2237, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1265 (2009). To  sufficiently plead such an enterprise, ""a plaintiff must  allege that a group of persons shares three structural  features: (1) a purpose, (2) relationships among those  associated with the enterprise, and (3) longevity  sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the  enterprise's purpose."" [*26]  Cisneros v. Petland, Inc.,  972 F.3d 1204, 1211 (11th Cir. 2020) (marks and  citations omitted). ""The purpose prong contemplates 'a common purpose  of engaging in a course of conduct' among the  enterprise's alleged participants."" Cisneros, 972 F.3d at  1211 (quoting United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576,  583, 101 S. Ct. 2524, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1981)). ""An  abstract common purpose, such as a generally shared  interest in making money, will not suffice. Rather, where  the participants' ultimate purpose is to make money for  themselves, a RICO plaintiff must plausibly allege that  the participants shared the purpose of enriching  themselves through a particular criminal course of  conduct."" Id. (citations omitted). Here, the Complaint alleges the defendants ""associated  with each other and/or the Plaintiff C.S.'s sex traffickers  for the common purpose of profiting off an established  sex trafficking scheme."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 164.) Plaintiff  asserts  this  ""association-in-fact""  constitutes  an  ""enterprise"" under Florida's RICO statute, and that the  defendants conducted or participated in their enterprises  through a pattern of criminal activity, ""related by their  common purpose to profit off an institutionalized sex  trafficking scheme."" (Id. at ¶¶ 165-66.) The Court finds  these allegations sufficient to allege the defendants  ""shared the purpose of enriching themselves through  a [*27]  particular criminal course of conduct."" Cisneros,  972 F.3d at 1211; see also United States v. Church, 955  F.2d 688, 697-98 (11th Cir. 1992) (noting that ""an  association's devotion to 'making money from repeated  criminal activity' . . . demonstrates an enterprise's  'common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct'""  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *23 Page 10 of 15 (citations omitted)); Burgese v. Starwood Hotels &  Resorts Worldwide, Inc., 101 F. Supp. 3d 414, 424 (D.  N.J. 2015) (on motion to dismiss Florida RICO claim,  court found that ""Plaintiff's Amended Complaint can be  read to allege a 'common purpose' of furthering an  institutionalized prostitution scheme to increase profits  for the participants,"" and that ""[t]hese allegations,  though thin, are sufficient for purposes of this motion.""). Next, Vocisano argues plaintiff has failed to plead the  claim with the heightened level of specificity required for  RICO claims. (Doc. #22, pp. 15-16.) Plaintiff responds  that because the RICO claim is based on non-fraudulent  predicate acts, the heightened pleading requirement is  not applicable. (Doc. #37, p. 22.) The Court agrees with  plaintiff. While the Eleventh Circuit has described RICO claims  as ""essentially a certain breed of fraud claims"" that  ""must be pled with an increased level of specificity""  consistent with Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure, Arthur v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA, 569  F. App'x 669, 681 (11th Cir. 2014), such a standard  applies only when the RICO claim is based on fraud or  mistake, see D. Penguin Bros. Ltd. v. City Nat'l Bank,  587 F. App'x 663, 666 (2d Cir. 2014) (""In the RICO  context, [*28]  a plaintiff must plead predicate acts  sounding in fraud or mistake according to the  particularity requirement of Rule 9(b); for other elements  of a RICO claim—such as non-fraud predicate acts or . .  . the existence of an 'enterprise'—a plaintiff's complaint  need satisfy only the 'short and plain statement'  standard of Rule 8(a).""); Cardenas v. Toyota Motor  Corp., 418 F. Supp. 3d 1090, 1098 (S.D. Fla. 2019)  (""[B]ecause particularity pleading under Rule 9(b) is  limited to circumstances constituting fraud, the non- fraud elements of a RICO claim can be alleged under  Rule 8(a) standards."" (citations and marks omitted)). As  the predicate acts in plaintiff's RICO claim are not based  in fraud, the Court finds Rule 9 is not applicable. See  Magnifico v. Villanueva, 783 F. Supp. 2d 1217, 1229,  1229 n.9 (S.D. Fla. 2011) (in addressing RICO  allegations, court applied Rule 9(b) to ""fraud-related  predicate acts,"" such as mail, wire, and immigration  document fraud, and Rule 8 to ""non-fraud predicate  acts,"" such as human trafficking). Choice next argues the RICO claim fails to plausibly  allege plaintiff's harm was caused by Choice. (Doc.     #20, pp. 31-32.) Under the Florida RICO statute, a  plaintiff must demonstrate that their injuries were  proximately caused by the RICO violations. See Bortell  v. White Mountains Ins. Grp., Ltd., 2 So. 3d 1041, 1047  (Fla. 4th DCA 2009). ""A wrongful act is a proximate  cause if it is a substantive factor in the sequence of  responsible causation."" Green Leaf Nursery v. E.I.  DuPont De Nemours & Co., 341 F.3d 1292, 1307 (11th  Cir.  2003)  (marks  and [*29]   citation  omitted).  Furthermore, a plaintiff ""must show a 'direct relation  between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct  alleged.'"" Id. (quoting Holmes v. Sec. Inv'r Prot. Corp.,  503 U.S. 258, 268, 112 S. Ct. 1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532  (1992)). ""Indirect harm is insufficient to sustain a cause  of action under the RICO statutes."" Bortell, 2 So. 3d at  1047; see also O'Malley, 599 So. 2d at 1000 (""[I]ndirect  injuries, that is, injuries sustained not as a direct result  of predicate acts . . . will not allow recovery under  Florida RICO.""). Choice argues that plaintiff has not alleged a direct  relation between her injuries and Choice's purported  violation of the RICO statute, and that the conduct  responsible for plaintiff's alleged harm was the actions  of the traffickers and ""Johns."" (Doc. #20, pp. 31-32.)  Plaintiff responds that she has sufficiently pled  proximate cause and losses as a direct result of the sex  trafficking enterprise by alleging she ""was at the  Quality Inn as part of the sexual trafficking scheme and  her injuries were caused by and in furtherance of the  sexual trafficking scheme."" (Doc. #38, p. 34.) Having  reviewed the allegations in the Complaint, the Court  agrees with plaintiff. The Complaint alleges each of defendants ""was on  notice of repeated incidences of sex trafficking  occurring on their hotel premises,"" [*30]  and yet ""failed  to take the necessary actions to prevent sex trafficking  from taking place."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 60.) The Complaint also  alleges numerous ways in which the defendants could  have identified and prevented the sex trafficking from  occurring. (Id. at ¶¶ 62-77.) Finally, the Complaint  alleges the ""acts and omissions of the Quality Inn  Defendants served to support, facilitate, harbor, and  otherwise further the traffickers' sale and victimization""  of plaintiff ""for commercial sexual exploitation by  repeatedly renting rooms to people they knew or should  have known were engaged in sex trafficking."" (Id. at ¶  128.) ""[B]y knowingly, or with reckless disregard,  repeatedly allowing sex trafficking to occur on their  premises between 2014 and 2016,"" the defendants'  ""acts have yielded consistent results and caused  economic, physical, and psychological injuries"" to  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *27 Page 11 of 15 plaintiff. (Id. at ¶¶ 167, 170.) The Court finds these allegations sufficient to plead a  ""direct relation between the injury asserted and the  injurious conduct alleged,"" Holmes, 503 U.S. at 268,  and  therefore  the  Complaint  adequately  pleads  proximate cause. See Burgese, 101 F. Supp. 3d at 422  (finding allegations of physical injury and mental  anguish ""cognizable under the Florida RICO [*31]  Act""  and sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss); cf. Berber,  2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 234385, 2018 WL 10436236, at  *5 (""Because Plaintiffs' asserted injuries arise from a set  of actions entirely distinct form [sic] the alleged  predicate RICO violations, proximate cause is lacking as  a matter of law.""). Accordingly, the Court finds the Complaint's Florida  RICO claim sufficiently plead and therefore will deny the  motions to dismiss the claim. (3) Premise Liability Count Three of the Complaint asserts a claim of  premise liability against each defendant. (Doc. #1, ¶  176.) A premise liability claim is a form of negligence  action. ""The elements for negligence are duty, breach,  harm, and proximate cause; the additional elements for  a claim of premises liability include the defendant's  possession or control of the premises and notice of the  dangerous condition."" Lisanti v. City of Port Richey, 787  So. 2d 36, 37 (Fla. 2d DCA 2001). Plaintiff alleges the  defendants owed her a variety of duties, that they  breached these duties, and that as a direct and  proximate result, she suffered bodily injury. (Doc. #1, ¶¶  180-94.) Plaintiff also alleges the defendants had actual  or constructive knowledge of sex trafficking occurring  on the premises, that they knew or should have known  the risk of such criminal conduct taking place  would [*32]  be unreasonably high without appropriate  precautions, and that they had actual or constructive  knowledge of the dangerous conditions plaintiff was in.  (Id. at ¶¶ 185-87.)        (a) Statute of Limitations The motions argue the premise liability claim should be  dismissed because it is barred by the relevant statute of  limitations. (Doc. #20, p. 33; Doc. #22, p. 17.) Under  Florida law, the statute of limitations for negligence  claims is four years. § 95.11(3)(a), Fla. Stat. A statute of limitations bar is ""an affirmative defense,  and . . . plaintiff[s] [are] not required to negate an  affirmative defense in [their] complaint."" La Grasta v.  First Union Sec., Inc., 358 F.3d 840, 845 (11th Cir.  2004) (citation omitted). ""A dismissal for failure to state  a claim on statute of limitations grounds is appropriate  only if it is apparent from the face of the complaint that  the claim is time-barred."" United States ex rel. Hunt v.  Cochise Consultancy, Inc., 887 F.3d 1081, 1085 (11th  Cir. 2018) (marks and citation omitted). Plaintiff alleges the sex trafficking occurred at the  Quality Inn Hotel ""from approximately 2014 and  continuing through approximately February of 2016.""  (Doc. #1, ¶ 13.) Both defendants argue that because  plaintiff did not file her lawsuit until December 2019, her  premise liability claim is at least partially time barred.  (Doc. #20, p. 33; Doc. #22, p. 17.) ""Under Florida law, [*33]  the statute of limitations  begins to run when the cause of action accrues.""  Carnival Corp. v. Rolls-Royce PLC, 2009 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 107141, 2009 WL 3861482, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Nov.  17, 2009) (citing § 95.031, Fla. Stat.). ""A cause of action  accrues when the last element constituting the cause of  action occurs."" § 95.031(1), Fla. Stat. ""Under the  continuing tort doctrine, the cause of action accrues  when the tortious conduct ceases."" Effs v. Sony Pictures  Home Entm't, Inc., 197 So. 3d 1243, 1244 (Fla. 3d DCA  2016) (emphasis and citation omitted). ""A continuing tort  is established by continual tortious acts, not by continual  harmful effects from an original, completed act."" Id. at  1245 (marks, emphasis, and citation omitted). Here, plaintiff alleges she was a repeat victim of sex  trafficking at the Quality Inn Hotel between 2014 and  February 2016. The Court finds such allegations  sufficient to invoke the continuing tort doctrine. See Nat'l  Sourcing, Inc. v. Bracciale, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  199436, 2018 WL 6172430, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 26,  2018) (finding allegation that a defendant's actions  ""continued to this day"" inferred continuous tortious  conduct, thereby making it plausible for the plaintiffs to  assert the continuing tort doctrine as a basis to toll the  statute of limitations). Accordingly, the Court finds that  plaintiff's premise liability claim did not accrue until  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *30 Page 12 of 15 February 2016, and therefore she had until February  2020 to file a complaint asserting premises liability. (1) Choice Plaintiff  met  this  deadline  by  filing  her  First  Amended [*34]  Complaint against Choice on December  31, 2019. S.Y. et al v. Naples Hotel Co. et al, Case No.  2:20-cv-118 (Doc. #3). While the Court determined  severance of the parties was appropriate in the original  action, S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1259, and this  Complaint was filed in August 2020, it appears that the  December 2019 date is applicable for statute of  limitations purposes under the relation-back provisions  of Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Relation back is a legal fiction employed to salvage  claims that would otherwise be unjustly barred by a  limitations provision. See McCurdy v. United States,  264 U.S. 484, 487, 44 S.Ct. 345, 346, 68 L.Ed. 801  (1924); Moore v. Baker, 989 F.2d 1129, 1131 (11th  Cir. 1993). Under Rule 15, a claim in an amended  complaint relates back to the filing date of the  original complaint if it ""asserts a claim or defense  that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or  occurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in  the original pleading."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B).  When the facts in the original complaint do not put  the defendant ""on notice that the new claims of  negligence might be asserted,"" but the new claims  instead ""involve[ ] separate and distinct conduct,""  such that the plaintiff would have to prove  ""completely different facts"" than required to recover  on the claims in the original complaint, the new  claims do not relate back. Moore, 989 F.2d at 1132. Caron v. NCL (Bahamas), Ltd., 910 F.3d 1359, 1368  (11th Cir. 2018). Accordingly, since it is not apparent  from the [*35]  face of the Complaint that the claim is  time-barred, dismissal based upon the statute of  limitations affirmative defense is not appropriate. For the same reasons, the Court rejects the argument  that plaintiff's negligent hiring, supervision, and retention  claim against Choice is also barred by the four-year  statute of limitations. (Doc. #20, p. 33.) (2) Vocisano Vocisano was not named in the December 2019 First  Amended Complaint. Rather, it was first added as a  defendant in April 2020. S.Y. et al v. Naples Hotel Co. et  al, Case No. 2:20-cv-118 (Doc. #85.) Nonetheless, the  Court declines to dismiss based on the statute of  limitations. As noted, plaintiff is not required to negate  an affirmative defense in her complaint. La Grasta, 358  F.3d at 845. It is not apparent from the face of the  Complaint that the claim is time-barred because the  Court cannot determine that plaintiff's premise liability  claim does not relate back to the First Amended  Complaint or is not subject to statutory or equitable  tolling. Therefore, the motion to dismiss is denied at  this stage of the proceedings. To the extent Vocisano seeks dismissal of the other  negligent claims on the same grounds (Doc. #22, p. 17),  the Court's ruling [*36]  applies to those claims as  well. (b) Failure to State a Claim Both defendants argue the premise liability claim is  insufficiently pled. Choice argues the claim fails  because the Complaint does not plausibly allege that  Choice possessed or controlled the Quality Inn Hotel.  (Doc. #20, pp. 37-38.) The Court disagrees. As noted, a  premise liability claim requires a defendant possess or  control the premises at issue. Lisanti, 787 So. 2d at 37.  Here, the Complaint alleges the defendants were the  ""owners, operators, managers, supervisors, controllers  and innkeepers"" of the Quality Inn Hotel, and that  Choice exercised control over the means and methods  of how Vocisano conducted business at the hotel.                     2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *33 Page 13 of 15 (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 29, 115.) While Choice may dispute these  allegations, the Court must accept them as true at this  stage of the proceedings and finds them sufficient to  allege Choice had sufficient control of the Quality Inn  Hotel for premise liability purposes. Vocisano argues there could be no duty to protect  plaintiff from the criminal conduct of third parties  because such conduct was not foreseeable. (Doc. #22,  pp. 17-18.) The Court disagrees with this argument as  well. ""Under Florida law, a business [*37]  owes invitees a  duty to use due care to maintain its premises in a  reasonably safe condition. This includes the duty to  protect customers from criminal attacks that are  reasonably foreseeable."" Banosmoreno v. Walgreen  Co., 299 F. App'x 912, 913 (11th Cir. 2008) (citations  omitted). Foreseeability can be shown by two alternative  means. First, a plaintiff may demonstrate that a  proprietor knew or should have known of a  dangerous condition on his premises that was likely  to cause harm to a patron. Second, a plaintiff can  show that a proprietor knew or should have known  of the dangerous propensities of a particular patron. Id. (marks, citations, and footnote omitted). Such  knowledge must only be pled generally. Fed. R. Civ. P.  9(b). The Complaint contains sufficient allegations that sex  trafficking was occurring at the Quality Inn Hotel and  that the defendants knew or should have known of it.  (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 55-61, 99-109, 158.) The Complaint also  contains sufficient allegations to support a claim of an  agency relationship between Choice and Vocisano, and  any factual challenge to such a relationship is  premature. See Cain, 994 F. Supp. 2d at 1253; Mobil Oil                 Corp., 648 So. 2d at 120. Accordingly, the Court finds  the allegations in the Complaint are sufficient to satisfy  the notice pleading requirements. (4) Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and [*38]   Retention Count Four of the Complaint asserts a claim of negligent  hiring,  supervision,  and  retention  against  the  defendants. (Doc. #1, ¶ 195.) The motions seek  dismissal of the claim based on pleading deficiencies.  Both defendants first argue plaintiff has improperly  lumped multiple claims together. (Doc. #20, pp. 33-34;  Doc. #22, p. 18.) ""A party may set out 2 or more  statements of a claim or defense alternatively or  hypothetically, either in a single count or defense or in  separate ones. If a party makes alternative statements,  the pleading is sufficient if any one of them is sufficient.""  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(2). The Court finds that the claims  are properly set forth in a single count. To state a claim for negligent hiring, plaintiff must allege  facts showing that (1) the employer was required to make an  appropriate investigation of the employee and failed  to do so; (2) an appropriate investigation would  have revealed the unsuitability of the employee for  the particular duty to be performed or for  employment  in  general;  and  (3)  it  was  unreasonable for the employer to hire the employee  in light of the information he knew or should have  known. Groover v. Polk Cty. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs, 460 F. Supp.  3d 1242, 1251 (M.D. Fla. 2020) (quoting Malicki v. Doe,  814 So. 2d 347, 362 (Fla. 2002)). ""Different from  negligent hiring, '[n]egligent retention [*39]  occurs  when, during the course of employment, the employer  becomes aware or should have become aware of  problems with an employee that indicated his unfitness,  and the employer fails to take further action such as  investigating, discharge, or reassignment.'"" Id. (quoting  Degitz v. S. Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 996 F. Supp. 1451,  1461 (M.D. Fla. 1998)). ""Florida law also holds  employers liable for reasonably foreseeable damages  resulting from the negligent training of its employees  and agents."" Clary v. Armor Corr. Health Servs., Inc.,  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15633, 2014 WL 505126, at *4  (M.D. Fla. Feb. 7, 2014) (citing Lewis v. City of St.  Petersburg, 260 F.3d 1260, 1265 (11th Cir. 2001)). ""For  an employer to owe a plaintiff a duty, the plaintiff must  be in the zone of risk that was reasonably foreseeable  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *36 Page 14 of 15 to the employer."" Id. (citation omitted). Accordingly, to state a claim, the plaintiff must  allege facts that would establish a nexus between  the plaintiff and the tortfeasor's employment from  which a legal duty would flow from the defendant- employer to the plaintiff. The plaintiff must then  establish that the defendant-employer breached  that duty and that the breach caused him damage. Id. (citations omitted). The Complaint alleges each defendant was in control of  the  hiring,  instructing,  training,  supervising,  and  terminating of the hotel employees, and that each  defendant had a duty to make an appropriate  investigation of the employees. (Doc. #1, [*40]  ¶¶ 201- 02.) The Complaint further alleges that the defendants  knew or should have known that hotel employees were  ""allowing criminals to rent rooms for prostitution and  drug dealing,"" ""failing to either identify and/or report the  human sex trafficking and foreseeable harm"" of  plaintiff, and ""failing to refuse continued lodging services  to human sex traffickers."" (Id. at ¶¶ 204-06.) The  Complaint concludes that the defendants were negligent  in their hiring, employment, supervision, and termination  decisions regarding the employees, and that the sex  trafficking of plaintiff was a foreseeable and direct  result. (Id. at ¶¶ 207-11.) The Court finds these  allegations sufficient to state plausible claims for  negligent hiring, and negligent supervision/retention. Both motions further argue the claim should be  dismissed because the Complaint does not identify the  alleged employees at issue. (Doc. #20, pp. 34-35; Doc.  #22, p. 19.) The Complaint alleges ""[e]ach and every""  defendant ""was in control of the hiring"" of hotel  employees, and responsible for ""instructing, training and  supervising,"" yet employees failed ""to refuse continued  lodging services to human sex traffickers"" and failed ""to  either [*41]  identify and/or report the human sex  trafficking."" (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 201, 205-06.) The Court is  required to accept all factual allegations as true,  Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94, and ""[i]n adjudicating a motion  to dismiss, the district court may not resolve factual  disputes,"" Page v. Postmaster Gen. & Chief Exec.  Officer of U.S. Postal Serv., 493 F. App'x 994, 995 (11th  Cir. 2012). The Court finds that specific employees are  not required to be named. Accordingly, the Court  denies the request to dismiss the negligent hiring,     supervision, and retention claim. (5) Negligent Rescue Count Five of the Complaint asserts a claim of negligent  rescue against Vocisano. (Doc. #1, ¶ 212.) The  Complaint alleges Vocisano, as the owner and operator  of the Quality Inn Hotel, had a duty to keep the premises  safe and prevent foreseeable criminal activity, as well as  a duty ""to make safe a dangerous condition at the  Quality Inn Hotel and to rescue their [sic] hotel guests,  specifically Plaintiff C.S., from the peril they [sic]  created."" (Id. at ¶¶ 214, 217, 223.) The Complaint  alleges that by various acts and omissions, Vocisano  breached these duties and that the continuous sex  trafficking of plaintiff was the direct and foreseeable  result. (Id. at ¶¶ 219-21, 223-26, 228.) Vocisano argues  the negligent rescue claim should be dismissed  because [*42]  it is insufficiently pled. (Doc. #22, p. 20.) There is no common law duty to rescue a stranger.  Estate of Ferguson v. Mascara, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  157824, 2010 WL 11558195, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 7,  2010) (citing Bradberry v. Pinellas Cty., 789 F.2d 1513,  1516 (11th Cir. 1986)). ""A well-established exception to  this rule, however, provides that an innkeeper is 'under  an ordinary duty of care to [a guest] after he knows or  has reason to know the [guest] is ill or injured.'"" De La  Flor v. Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co., L.L.C., 2013 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 5403, 2013 WL 148401, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 14,  2013) (quoting L.A. Fitness, Int'l, LLC v. Mayer, 980 So.  2d 550, 557 (Fla. 4th DCA 2008)); see also Abramson v.  Ritz Carlton Hotel Co., LLC, 480 F. App'x 158, 161 (3d  Cir. 2012) (""Generally, there is no duty to affirmatively  assist an injured person unless a special relationship,  such as that between an innkeeper and its guests,  exists between the parties."" (citation omitted)). Vocisano argues that hotels only have a limited duty to  render aid to a guest it knew or should have known was  ill or injured, and that the Complaint contains no  plausible facts to suggest Vocisano knew plaintiff was in  need of aid. (Doc. #22, p. 20.) However, the Court finds  the Complaint contains sufficient allegations to satisfy  this requirement. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 99, 100, 224.) (6) Aiding and Abetting, Harboring, Confining,  Coercion and Criminal Enterprise Finally, Count Six of the Complaint asserts a claim of  aiding and abetting against Vocisano. (Doc. #1, ¶ 229.)  The Complaint accuses Vocisano of ""aiding and  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *39 Page 15 of 15 abetting  unlawful  activity  including  unlawful  confinement, [*43]  imprisonment, assault and battery  by [plaintiff's] sex traffickers and 'Johns.'"" (Id.) Vocisano  argues that the claim must be dismissed because it is  overly  vague,  fails  to  articulate  a  cognizable,  independent cause of action, and lacks well-pled factual  allegations. (Doc. #22, p. 21.) The Court disagrees. Florida courts have recognized aiding and abetting the  commission of a tort as a standalone claim. See Gilison  v. Flagler Bank, 303 So. 3d 999, 1002 (Fla. 4th DCA  2020) (aiding and abetting fraud); MP, LLC v. Sterling  Holding, LLC, 231 So. 3d 517, 527 (Fla. 3d DCA 2017)  (aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty). This Court  has previously listed the following elements that must be  alleged ""to state a claim for aiding and abetting a  common law tort"" under Florida law: ""(1) an underlying  violation on the part of the primary wrongdoer; (2)  knowledge of the underlying violation by the alleged  aider and abetter [sic]; and (3) the rendering of  substantial assistance in committing the wrongdoing by  the alleged aider and abettor."" Angell v. Allergan Sales,  LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142768, 2019 WL 3958262,  at *8 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 22, 2019); see also Lawrence v.  Bank of Am., N.A., 455 F. App'x 904, 906 (11th Cir.  2012) (applying the above elements to three Florida tort  claims). These cases demonstrate Florida recognizes a  common-law claim of aiding and abetting tortious  conduct. The  Court  finds  plaintiff's  allegations  are  not  impermissibly vague and, to the extent they allege  actual knowledge, are [*44]  sufficient to state a claim.  Therefore, the Court denies Vocisano's request for  dismissal. C. Anonymity Finally, Choice argues that plaintiff is not entitled to  proceed anonymously as a matter of right, and that  plaintiff must be required to file a formal motion to do so.  (Doc. #20, p. 39.) On February 24, 2021, plaintiff filed a  Motion to Proceed Anonymously and for Entry of a  Protective Order. (Doc. #57.) Therefore, this issue is  moot.          Accordingly, it is now ORDERED: 1. Defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc.'s  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Third Amended  Complaint With Prejudice (Doc. #20) is DENIED. 2. Defendant Robert Vocisano's Motion to Dismiss  With  Prejudice  Plaintiff's  Complaint  and  Incorporated Memorandum of Law (Doc. #22) is  DENIED. DONE AND ORDERED at Fort Myers, Florida, this 17th  day of May, 2021. /s/ John E. Steele JOHN E. STEELE SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *42",1

STANDARDS A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim may be granted only when [*3]  there is no cognizable legal theory to  support the claim or when the complaint lacks sufficient factual allegations to state a facially plausible claim for  relief. Shroyer v. New Cingular Wireless Servs., Inc., 622 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir. 2010). In evaluating the  sufficiency of a complaint's factual allegations, the court must accept as true all well-pleaded material facts alleged  in the complaint and construe them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Daniels-Hall v. Nat'l  Educ. Ass'n, 629 F.3d 992, 998 (9th Cir. 2010). To be entitled to a presumption of truth, allegations in a complaint  ""may not simply recite the elements of a cause of action, but must contain sufficient allegations of underlying facts  to give fair notice and to enable the opposing party to defend itself effectively."" Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1216  (9th Cir. 2011). The court must draw all reasonable inferences from the factual allegations in favor of the plaintiff.  Newcal Indus., Inc. v. Ikon Office Sol., 513 F.3d 1038, 1043 n.2 (9th Cir. 2008). The court need not, however, credit  the plaintiff's legal conclusions that are couched as factual allegations. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678-79, 129  S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009).

When applying  state law, a federal court is bound by the decisions of the state's highest court. Ticknor v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc.,  265 F.3d 931, 939 (9th Cir. 2001).

BACKGROUND      2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *2 Page 3 of 14 In February of 2019, Plaintiff was trafficked for approximately one week at a Studio 6 motel property in Portland,  Oregon. ECF 1-1 at ¶¶ 1-3, 52. Plaintiff exhibited [*5]  many indicators of vulnerability for recruitment into sex  trafficking: she was on disability and was financially vulnerable, did not have stable housing, was raised in foster  care, lacked family and social support, suffered from mental health diagnoses, and was a recovering addict. Id. at ¶  49. Originally, Plaintiff agreed to meet the ""recruiter,"" believing the meeting to be a date. Id. at ¶ 45. Instead, the  recruiter brought her to Studio 6, where the two partied with two people who ultimately became Plaintiff's traffickers.  Id. Soon, the recruiter left, and the male trafficker told Plaintiff that she was not free to leave and had to engage in  sex for money. Id. at ¶ 46. The traffickers also informed Plaintiff that she had to follow their rules and threatened  violent consequences if she did not. Id. In the Studio 6 room, the female trafficker took photos of Plaintiff and  uploaded them in an online advertisement for commercial sex. Id. at ¶ 47. The trafficker also told Plaintiff that she  would be required to ""walk the track"" on NE 82nd Avenue to solicit customers when there were no online  customers. Id. Over the course of nearly a week, Plaintiff was trafficked through fraud, coercion, [*6]  and threats of force and  engaged in multiple commercial sexual transactions per day against her will. Id. at ¶¶ 2-4, 52. Plaintiff was not  allowed to leave the room without her traffickers, unless it was to smoke a cigarette within view of the room. Id. at ¶  50. If Plaintiff failed to earn enough money, the traffickers deprived Plaintiff of food. Id. at ¶ 51. At the time of  Plaintiff's trafficking, Defendant John Doe 1 worked the front desk of Studio 6. Id. at ¶ 37. Defendant John Doe 1  paid for sex with the female trafficker. Id. Defendant John Doe 1 also spoke with Plaintiff and implied that she  should engage in a three-way sexual relationship with him and his girlfriend. Id. at ¶ 39. Defendant John Doe 1 did  not report suspected human trafficking to his General Manager. Id. At the first possible moment when Plaintiff was  not being watched closely by her traffickers, Plaintiff called the police and fled. Id. at ¶ 52. The motel property where Plaintiff was trafficked, Studio 6-Portland (""Studio 6""), is located on NE 82nd Avenue in  Portland, Oregon. Id. at ¶ 1. Defendant IE Hotel Group, LLC, a California corporation doing business as Studio 6- Portland, owns and operates Studio 6 as [*7]  a franchisee of one or more G6 Defendants. Id. at ¶ 12. G6  Defendants are Delaware companies in the motel business that build, operate, and manage motels—including  Studio 6—through franchises. Id. at ¶¶ 13-15. Under the franchise agreement, G6 Defendants require Defendant IE  to follow corporate policies regarding the following: bookings, reservations, room rates, websites, rewards  programs, revenue management tools, profit sharing terms, hiring procedures, employment policies, training,  decisions, and wages, building and design standards, rules of operation, facilities and operations inspections,  security policies and procedures, and human trafficking practices and programs. Id. at ¶ 70. G6 Defendants also  receive a share of each room rental payment at Studio 6. Id. at ¶ 44. There are reported incidents dating back to 2003 of a male trafficker using a G6 Hospitality property for sex  trafficking involving extreme violence, rape, drug use, and minor victims. Id. at ¶ 25. G6 Hospitality properties have  been connected to sex trafficking reports predating Plaintiff's trafficking in at least twenty-six different states. Id. at ¶  26. Sex trafficking crimes have been reported at G6 Hospitality [*8]  properties in Portland, including an arrest in  2012 of a male trafficker ultimately resulting in a conviction. Id. at ¶ 27, n.2. That incident involved two victims,  including a sixteen-year-old who was advertised online for sex, made to ""walk the track"" on 82nd Avenue, forced to  abide by strict rules, and deprived of food if she did not earn enough money. Id. at ¶ 27. In a separate incident, a  male and female pair of traffickers were convicted of multiple felonies for trafficking a seventeen-year-old girl at a  different G6 Hospitality property in Portland in 2017. Id. at ¶ 28. The Studio 6 property where Plaintiff was trafficked is located on 82nd Avenue, an area placed into a ""prostitution  free zone"" to support efforts to eliminate sex trafficking and prostitution. Id. at ¶ 29. Over the five years before  Plaintiff brought this suit, multiple online reviews of Studio 6 mention or allude to sex trafficking. Id. at ¶ 30. In a Trip  Advisor review of the property in May of 2016, a reviewer wrote: ""I have stayed in hundreds of motels. So I feel  confident in saying this place should be shut down! It's awful! Hookers, in the parking garage, working! Drug  dealers, pimps and gang members!""  [*9] Id. at ¶ 31. That same month, another Trip Advisor reviewer wrote: ""The  people staying long term here are scary, look like drug dealers and prostitutes."" Id. Less than nine months before  Plaintiff's trafficking, a Yelp reviewer wrote: ""Great place if you are able are willing to deal... with the sex trafficking  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *4 Page 4 of 14 network that chooses to stay here there are safes places in [t]he same neighborhood Along the same street."" Id. at  ¶ 32. In 2018, the year before Plaintiff was trafficked, G6 Hospitality announced it was increasing its commitment to  preventing sex trafficking: Our commitment to anti-trafficking efforts is made clear through our comprehensive awareness, training and  response program. In 2018, G6 overhauled its training materials and program to ensure it was relevant for  Motel 6 and Studio 6 team members and contained updated information on our anti trafficking efforts, including  how to spot the signs of and help prevent human trafficking. Motel 6 and Studio 6 trains all staff — from the  General Manager through the most junior housekeepers — to be the ""eyes and ears"" and to alert the property's  General Manager, local police, and the Motel 6/Studio 6 Hotline upon observing any signs [*10]  of suspected  human trafficking or prostitution. Id. at ¶ 35. G6 Hospitality acknowledged in its anti-trafficking policy statement that its efforts to prevent trafficking  require comprehensive awareness and training, including overhauled training materials on how to spot the signs of  trafficking. Id. at ¶ 43. Widely-known indicators and red flags of trafficking include: customers paying with cash  daily, with no credit card registered at sign-in, frequent male visitors to a room for short periods of time, male  visitors arriving at unusual times, guests showing signs of fear, anxiety, tension, submission, and/or nervousness,  guests showing signs of physical abuse, restraint, and/or confinement, guests showing signs of malnourishment,  guests lacking freedom of movement or being constantly monitored, and guests having no money, no luggage, and  few or no personal items. Id. DISCUSSION A. Anonymity Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(a) This Court first addresses Plaintiff's ""Motion to Designate Known Party Using Pseudonym."" ECF 1-1 at 2-3. Due to  Plaintiff's status as a victim of sex trafficking and the ""sensitive nature"" of sexual abuse cases, Plaintiff seeks leave  of this Court to proceed under the pseudonym ""D.B.."" Id. [*11]  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(a), a  complaint must ""name all the parties."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(a). ""In this circuit, we allow parties to use pseudonyms in  the 'unusual case' when nondisclosure of the party's identity is necessary . . . to protect a person from harassment,  injury, ridicule or personal embarrassment."" Does I thru XXIII v. Advanced Textile Corp., 214 F.3d 1058, 1067-68  (9th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). ""[A] party may preserve his or her anonymity in  judicial proceedings in special circumstances when the party's need for anonymity outweighs prejudice to the  opposing party and the public's interest in knowing the party's identity."" Id. at 1068. The Ninth Circuit does not  require a plaintiff to obtain leave to proceed anonymously before filing an anonymous pleading. A.B. v. Hilton  Worldwide Holdings Inc., 484 F. Supp. 3d 921, 945 (D. Or. 2020) (citation omitted). Because this Court finds the  need for anonymity outweighs any prejudice to the Defendants and the public, this Court grants leave for Plaintiff to  proceed under the pseudonym ""D.B."" in this case. B. Negligence Claim Plaintiff brings a negligence claim against all Defendants, alleging that Defendants breached their duty to protect  Plaintiff from harm by ""failing to properly train and supervise their agents and employees, failing to hire proper  personnel, failing to provide for safety and security, and failing to intervene in illegal or unsafe conduct at Studio 6.""  Id. at ¶¶ 55-56. Plaintiff claims that G6 Defendants owed a heightened duty of care as the possessors of a business  premises. Id. at ¶ 55. Plaintiff brings her negligence claim against G6 Defendants directly as well as vicariously for  the actions of franchisee Defendant IE and its employees. For the reasons stated below, this Court DENIES G6  Defendants' Motion to Dismiss both Plaintiff's direct liability negligence claim and Plaintiff's vicarious liability  negligence claim. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *9 Page 5 of 14 1. Negligence - Direct Liability G6 Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's direct liability negligence claim on the ground that [*12]  Plaintiff did not  sufficiently allege Defendants had a legal duty to prevent Plaintiff's trafficking. ECF 19 at 25. Typically, the elements  of common-law negligence require a plaintiff to plead and prove that (1) the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff,  (2) the defendant breached that duty, and (3) the breach was the cause-in-fact of a legally cognizable damage to  the plaintiff. Chapman v. Mayfield, 358 Ore. 196, 205, 361 P.3d 566 (2015). However, under Oregon's  contemporary jurisprudence, ""the traditional duty-breach analysis is subsumed in the concept of general  foreseeability, 'unless the parties invoke a status, a relationship, or a particular standard of conduct that creates,  defines, or limits the defendant's duty.'"" Id. (quoting Fazzolari v. Portland School Dist. No. 1J, 303 Ore. 1, 17, 734  P.2d 1326 (1987)). See generally Oregon Steel Mills, Inc. v. Coopers & Lybrand, LLP, 336 Ore. 329, 340, 83 P.3d  322 (2004) (discussing shift in Oregon jurisprudence). Where there is no special status, relationship, or standard,  ""the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant's conduct created a foreseeable and unreasonable risk of  legally cognizable harm to the plaintiff and that the conduct in fact caused that kind of harm to the plaintiff.""  Chapman, 358 Ore. at 205. a. Special Relationship Plaintiff alleges that G6 Defendants had a ""duty to protect [her] from harm"" under a ""heightened duty of care as the  possessors of a business [*13]  premises."" ECF 1-1 at ¶ 55. G6 Defendants argue that Plaintiff does not allege a  special relationship with G6. ECF 19 at 26. Under Oregon law, ""[b]usiness owners and operators have a heightened  duty of care toward patrons—invitees—with respect to the condition of their premises that exceeds the general duty  of care to avoid unreasonable risks of harm to others."" Bagley v. Mt. Bachelor, Inc., 356 Ore. 543, 563, 340 P.3d 27  (2014) (citations omitted). ""In general, it is the duty of the possessor of land to make the premises reasonably safe  for the invitee's visit."" Id. (quoting Woolston v. Wells, 297 Ore. 548, 557, 687 P.2d 144 (1984)). ""[A] business  operator's obligation to make its premises reasonably safe for its invitees includes taking into account the use to  which the premises are put."" Id. at 564 (citations omitted). ""[A] business, as a possessor of premises, has a duty to  take reasonable steps to protect its visitors from reasonably foreseeable criminal acts by third persons."" Stewart v.  Kids Inc. of Dallas, 245 Ore. App. 267, 278, 261 P.3d 1272 (2011). Plaintiff has not sufficiently pled a special relationship between Plaintiff and G6 Defendants implicating a heightened  duty of care. Plaintiff argues that ""G6 Defendants owed her a heightened duty of care as owners and franchisors of  the hotel property."" ECF 29 at 11-12. However, Plaintiff alleges in her complaint that Defendant IE, [*14]  rather  than G6 Defendants, owns the hotel property. ECF 1-1 at ¶ 12. While Plaintiff alleges that G6 Defendants built,  operated, and managed Studio 6 through a franchise, see id. at ¶¶ 12-15, Plaintiff has failed to cite any authority for  the proposition that a franchisor owes a heightened duty of care to its franchisee's customer under Oregon law.  Furthermore, ""Oregon has adopted the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965), which defines a ""possessor of land""  as ""'a person who is in occupation of the land with intent to control it.'"" Cain v. Bovis Lend Lease, Inc., 817 F. Supp.  2d 1251, 1273 (D. Or. 2011) (quoting Fireman's Fund Am. Ins. Cos. v. United States, 482 F. Supp. 893, 896 (D. Or.  1979);  (1965)). Plaintiff has failed to allege facts showing that G6 Defendants were in occupation of the motel  property. Therefore, as G6 Defendants do not qualify as possessors under Oregon law, they did not owe Plaintiff a  heightened duty of care based on a special relationship. See Bagley, 356 Ore. at 563. b. General Foreseeability Defendants also move to dismiss Plaintiff's direct liability negligence claim by asserting that Plaintiff did not  adequately allege that G6 Defendants unreasonably created a foreseeable risk of her being sex trafficked at Studio  6. ECF 19 at 26. For a negligence claim where there is no special status, relationship, or standard, ""the plaintiff  must plead and prove that the [*15]  defendant's conduct created a foreseeable and unreasonable risk of legally  cognizable harm to the plaintiff and that the conduct in fact caused that kind of harm to the plaintiff."" Chapman, 358  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *11 Page 6 of 14 Ore. at 205. Foreseeability, which serves ""as a limit on the scope of liability,"" considers ""what prospectively might  happen"" and is separate from causation. Fazzolari, 303 Ore. at 13. ""It is not necessary that the risk of harm be  more probable than not; rather, the question is whether a reasonable person considering the potential harms that  might result from his or her conduct would have reasonably expected the injury to occur."" Chapman, 358 Ore. at  206 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Stewart v. Jefferson Plywood Co., 255 Ore. 603, 609,  469 P.2d 783 (1970) (en banc) (""[T]he community deems a person to be at fault only when the injury caused by him  is one which could have been anticipated because there was a reasonable likelihood that it could happen.""). G6 Defendants first argue that Plaintiff provided ""shotgun"" negligence allegations not plausibly alleged as to G6  Hospitality. ECF 19 at 27. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a pleading that states a claim for  relief must contain a ""short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed. R.  Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The pleading standard under Rule 8 ""does not require 'detailed factual [*16]  allegations . . . . '""  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). However, the pleading must contain more than ""labels  and conclusions"" or ""'naked assertion[s]' devoid of further factual enhancement."" Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at  557). Pleadings that seek to overwhelm defendants with an unclear mass of allegations and make it difficult or  impossible for the defendants to make informed responses to the plaintiff's allegations are considered ""shotgun""  pleadings. A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide, 484 F. Supp. at 943 (citing Autobidmaster, LLC v. Alpine Auto Gallery, LLC,  No. 3:14-cv-1083-AC, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65048, 2015 WL 2381611, at *15 (D. Or. May 19, 2015)). Another  type of ""shotgun"" pleading is a complaint that asserts claims against ""multiple defendants without specifying which  of the defendants are responsible for which acts or omissions."" Id. (quoting Nissen v. Lindquist, No. C16-5093 BHS,  2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 480, 2017 WL 26843, at *2 (W.D. Wash. Jan. 3, 2017)). While it is true that Plaintiff's allegations are stated generally against all Defendants, Plaintiff also clearly alleges  facts that specifically relate to G6 Defendants regarding this claim. For example, Plaintiff alleges Defendants  generally were negligent in ""failing to develop and implement adequate policies to identify and prevent sex  trafficking,"" ""failing to hire proper personnel,"" ""failing to properly train and supervise their agents and employees,""  and ""failing to implement regular periodic training for all staff on indicators of sex trafficking."" ECF 1-1 [*17]  at ¶ 56.  Plaintiff additionally alleges that G6 Defendants specifically maintained control over hiring procedures, employment  policies and decisions, rules of operation, standardized employee training, security policies and procedures, and  practices and programs to prevent human trafficking. Id. at ¶ 70. Therefore, construed as a whole, Plaintiff's  complaint provides sufficient allegations regarding her negligence claim clearly directed towards G6 Defendants. G6 Defendants also claim that Plaintiff's allegations of foreseeability are insufficient because they are premised on  ""generalized knowledge of the potential for crime."" ECF 19 at 27. Instead, Defendants contend that Oregon  precedent requires knowledge of an unreasonable risk of danger to the particular plaintiff involved. Id. In Piazza v.  Kellim, the Oregon Supreme Court clarified the foreseeability analysis required under Oregon law. 360 Ore. 58, 69- 82, 377 P.3d 492 (2016). When evaluating negligence claims arising from third-party criminal acts, ""there is a  common requirement: a trier of fact must be able to find from concrete facts that a reasonable person in the position  of the defendant reasonably would have foreseen that the person or location and circumstances [*18]  posed a risk  of criminal harm to persons such as the plaintiff."" Id. at 81 (citing Towe v. Sacagawea, Inc., 357 Ore. 74, 86, 347  P.3d 766 (2015); Oregon Steel Mills, Inc. v. Coopers & Lybrand, LLP, 336 Ore. 329, 340, 83 P.3d 322 (2004);  Fazzolari, 303 Ore. at 17). In making a foreseeability determination, a court should consider the following facts: (1)  the similarity, frequency, and recency of prior criminal acts, (2) whether prior criminal acts were committed under  the same or similar circumstances, (3) whether prior criminal acts were committed at or near the same location, (4)  whether prior criminal acts involve the same or similar types of victims, and (5) the place and character of the  location of the current criminal act. Id. at 81 (citing Chapman, 358 Ore. at 220-22; Buchler, 316 Ore. at 511-12). Relying on Buchler, Chapman, and Stewart, G6 Defendants argue that to plausibly allege foreseeability, Plaintiff  must allege G6 Defendants were aware of the risk of danger to Plaintiff specifically. See Buchler v. State By &  Through Oregon Corr. Div., 316 Ore. 499, 853 P.2d 798 (1993); Chapman v. Mayfield, 358 Ore. 196, 361 P.3d 566  (2015); Stewart v. Kids Inc. of Dallas, OR, 245 Ore. App. 267, 261 P.3d 1272 (2011). However, Defendants  interpret this precedent in error. Under the above analysis in Piazza—a case that postdates the cases relied upon  by Defendants—a plaintiff need not allege that defendants were aware of the risk of danger to plaintiff specifically.  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *15 Page 7 of 14 Rather, a plaintiff need only allege that defendants were aware of the risk of danger to persons such as the plaintiff.  Plaintiff has sufficiently pled facts suggesting that her [*19]  trafficking was foreseeable to G6 Defendants under the  Piazza analysis. First, Plaintiff cites multiple online reviews and criminal reports to plausibly suggest that G6 Defendants were aware  of sex trafficking—the very same criminal act at issue here—on their properties generally and at Studio 6  specifically. ECF 1-1 at ¶¶ 24-33. Plaintiff alleges that G6 Hospitality properties have been connected to sex  trafficking reports predating Plaintiff's trafficking in at least twenty-six different states, a statistic suggesting the  frequency of these criminal acts. Id. at ¶ 26. Less than nine months before Plaintiff's trafficking, a Yelp reviewer  evaluated Studio 6 by observing: ""[g]reat place if you are able are willing to deal... with the sex trafficking network  that chooses to stay here there are safes places in [t]he same neighborhood Along the same street."" Id. at ¶ 32. In  addition, in 2018, the year before Plaintiff was trafficked, G6 Hospitality announced an increased commitment to  preventing sex trafficking, including overhauled training materials on how to spot the signs of trafficking. Id. at ¶ 43.  Taken together, these two allegations indicate the recency of criminal acts of sex [*20]  trafficking both at Studio 6  and G6 Hospitality properties more generally. In accordance with the requirements of Piazza, Plaintiff points to reports of sex trafficking that resemble her  trafficking both in terms of the circumstances and the location of the criminal acts. For example, citing an arrest and  conviction of a male trafficker for acts at a G6 Hospitality property in Portland, id. at ¶ 27, n.2., Plaintiff notes that  one victim was subject to similar treatment: she was also advertised online for sex, ""walk[ed] the track"" on 82nd  Avenue, followed strict rules, and was deprived of food if she did not earn enough money. Id. at ¶¶ 27, 46-47, 51. A  2017 incident of trafficking at a Portland G6 Hospitality property also involved a male and female pair of traffickers,  as was the case during Plaintiff's trafficking. Id. at ¶¶ 28, 45. While the facts alleged by Plaintiff do not provide  details about the victims of the prior acts of trafficking, it is true that at least two victims were minors—unlike  Plaintiff—at the time of their trafficking. Id. at ¶¶ 27, 28. Nonetheless, online reviews of the Studio 6 property where  Plaintiff was trafficked indicate its reputation for sex trafficking: [*21]  over the five years before Plaintiff brought this  suit, multiple online reviews mention or allude to sex trafficking. Id. at ¶¶ 30-32. Further, the Studio 6 property is  located on 82nd Avenue, an area placed into a ""prostitution free zone"" to support efforts to eliminate sex trafficking  and prostitution. Id. at ¶¶ 29. In sum, Plaintiff does not rely on allegations that crime is generally foreseeable, but rather that G6 Defendants were  aware of the repeated occurrences of similar sex trafficking acts on their properties and at Studio 6. Compare  Uihlein v. Albertson's, Inc., 282 Ore. 631, 640-42, 580 P.2d 1014 (1978) (store not liable for shopper assaulted in  supermarket when little evidence of unsafe location) with Brown v. J.C. Penney Co., 297 Ore. 695, 710, 688 P.2d  811 (1984) (store liable for shopper attacked in parking lot where there was ample evidence of criminal activity in  area). As required by Piazza, Plaintiff plausibly alleges facts that G6 Defendants ""reasonably would have foreseen  that the person or location and circumstances posed a risk of criminal harm to persons such as [Plaintiff]."" Piazza,  360 Ore. at 81. Plaintiff has therefore sufficiently pled a cognizable legal theory to support the claim that G6  Defendants unreasonably created a foreseeable risk of her trafficking. Finally, G6 Defendants maintain that Plaintiff's allegations [*22]  of foreseeability fall short because Plaintiff's  allegations amount to mere ""facilitation"" under Oregon law, rather than an unreasonable creation of a risk. ECF 19  at 27. G6 Defendants rely on the description of ""facilitation"" in Buchler: ""mere 'facilitation' of an unintended adverse  result, where intervening intentional criminality of another person is the harm-producing force, does not cause the  harm so as to support liability for it."" Buchler, 316 Ore. at 511-12. This Court disagrees. Plaintiff has not alleged the  risk created by the G6 Defendants so broadly as to amount to ""mere facilitation"" under Oregon precedent. The Oregon Supreme Court has clarified that ""mere facilitation"" refers to the problem of ""describing the type of  harm at risk too generally,"" Piazza, 360 Ore. at 75-76, such that criminal acts would become ""the legal responsibility  of everyone who may have contributed in some way to the criminal opportunity,"" id. at 75 (citing Buchler, 316 Ore.  at 511). In this case, Plaintiff alleges specifically that G6 Defendants unreasonably created the risk of her sex  trafficking by failing to implement policies and proper training regarding sex trafficking, after allegedly becoming  aware of sex trafficking at their properties generally and at Studio 6, specifically. ECF [*23]  1-1 at ¶¶ 56, 24-33.  Accordingly, G6 Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's direct negligence claim is DENIED. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *18 Page 8 of 14 2. Negligence - Vicarious Liability Plaintiff alleges G6 Defendants are vicariously liable for franchisee Defendant IE and its employees' failure to  protect Plaintiff from harm. To state a negligence claim for vicarious liability under an agency theory, Plaintiff must  plausibly allege that (1) G6 Defendants and Defendant IE were in an agency relationship, and (2) Defendant IE or  its hotel staff are plausibly liable for negligence. G6 Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to sufficiently allege an  actual agency relationship between G6 Defendants and Defendant IE, reasoning that the allegations in the  complaint merely illustrate a franchisor's right to control its brand, rather than the required day-to-day control over  Defendant IE and its employees. ECF 19 at 21-23; see id. at 29. Defendants also argue that Plaintiff's allegations  do not demonstrate that Defendant IE, itself, is liable for negligence due to a lack of legal duty. Id. at 23; see id. at  29; ECF 31 at 14. a. Agency Relationship between G6 Defendants and Defendant IE An agency relationship ""results from the manifestation [*24]  of consent by one person to another that the other  shall act on behalf and subject to his control, and consent by the other so to act."" Vaughn v. First Transit, Inc., 346  Ore. 128, 135, 206 P.3d 181 (2009) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Hampton Tree Farms, Inc. v. Jewett, 320 Ore.  599, 617, 892 P.2d 683 (1995)). ""The agency relationship can arise either from actual consent (express or implied)  or from the appearance of such consent."" Eads v. Borman, 351 Ore. 729, 736, 277 P.3d 503 (2012) (en banc)  (citation omitted). Under Oregon law, a franchise relationship does not automatically give rise to an agency  relationship as a matter of law. Viado v. Domino's Pizza, LLC, 230 Ore. App. 531, 534, 217 P.3d 199 (2009). A  franchisor may only be held accountable for the acts of its franchisee if the franchisor controls the day-to-day  operation of the franchisee. Viado, 230 Ore. App. at 534 (Or. App. 2009) (quoting Miller v. McDonald's Corp., 150  Ore. App. 274, 280, 945 P.2d 1107 (1997)). The test for vicarious liability further requires that the franchisor  controlled the specific conduct that caused the plaintiff's injury. Id. at 551-52. As recognized by the Oregon  Supreme Court, ""for a principal to be vicariously liable for the negligence of its nonemployee agents, there ordinarily  must be a connection between the principal's 'right to control' the agent's actions and the specific conduct giving  rise to the [claim]."" Vaughn, 346 Ore. 128 at 138 (emphasis added). Plaintiff alleges that G6 Defendants exercised actual control over the day-to-day activities of its franchisee  Defendant IE. ECF 1-1 at ¶ 70. For example, [*25]  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant IE had to abide by G6  Defendants' corporate policies, including ""booking and reservations, room rates, websites . . . revenue management  tools, profit sharing terms, hiring procedures, employment policies and decisions, employee wages, building and  design standards, rules of operation, standardized employee training, inspections of facilities and operations, and  security policies and procedures."" Id. Additionally, Plaintiff alleges G6 Defendants required Defendant IE to follow  practices and programs implemented to prevent human trafficking. Id. G6 Defendants dispute whether they had day-to-day control of Studio 6 via Defendant IE. Although Plaintiff may  ultimately fail to establish the agency allegations, this Court must accept as true all well-pleaded factual allegations  in the complaint at this stage in the proceeding and construe them in Plaintiff's favor. See Daniels-Hall, 629 F.3d at  998; A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 940. This Court finds that Plaintiff has met her burden of alleging  a plausible claim for an actual agency relationship between G6 Defendants and Defendant IE. Plaintiff has alleged  facts which, if proven, support her theory that G6 Defendants had authority to control aspects of Studio 6  operations [*26]  connected to Plaintiff's claim. For example, Plaintiff alleges G6 Defendants exercised control over  the means and methods of daily hotel activities through policies on hiring procedures, employment policies and  decisions, employee wages, building and design standards, rules of operations, standardized employee training,  inspections of facilities and operations, and security policies and procedures. ECF 1-1 at ¶ 70. Plaintiff additionally alleges that G6 Defendants are liable for the actions of individual Defendants John Doe 1,  Shilash Patel, Vipul Patel, and other employees and agents of G6 Defendants under the doctrine of respondeat  superior. ECF 1-1 at ¶¶ 70-71. ""Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, an employer is liable for an employee's  tort when the employee acts within the course and scope of employment."" Minnis v. Oregon Mut. Ins. Co., 334 Ore.  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *23 Page 9 of 14 191, 201, 48 P.3d 137 (2002) (emphasis omitted) (citing Chesterman v. Barmon, 305 Ore. 439, 442, 753 P.2d 404  (1988)). Plaintiff alleges that John Doe 1, Shilash Patel, Vipul Patel, and other individuals were employees of  Defendant IE's hotel, Studio 6. ECF 1-1 at ¶¶ 18-21. Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged an agency relationship  between G6 Defendants and Defendant IE—which is the employer of John Doe 1, Shilash Patel, Vipul Patel.  Accordingly, Plaintiff [*27]  has also sufficiently alleged that G6 Hospitality may be vicariously liable for the actions  of the individual defendants which occurred within the scope of their employment at Studio 6. See A.B. v. Hilton  Worldwide, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 939 (requiring that plaintiff ""plausibly allege that . . . the hotels or hotel staff are  plausibly liable"" to state a claim for vicarious liability between hotel chains and their branded hotels) (emphasis  added); Miller v. D.F. Zee's, Inc., 31 F. Supp. 2d 792, 806 (D. Or. 1998) (""[A] franchisor may be held vicariously  liable under an agency theory for intentional acts . . . by employees of a franchisee."") (citation omitted). b. Special Relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant IE While Plaintiff has failed to plead a special relationship between Plaintiff and G6 Defendants, Plaintiff has  sufficiently pled a special relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant IE, giving rise to a heightened duty of care  on behalf of Defendant IE. Under Oregon law, ""[b]usiness owners and operators have a heightened duty of care  toward patrons—invitees—with respect to the condition of their premises that exceeds the general duty of care to  avoid unreasonable risks of harm to others."" Bagley, 356 Ore. at 563 (2014) (citations omitted). ""In general, it is the  duty of the possessor of land to make the premises reasonably [*28]  safe for the invitee's visit."" Id. (quoting  Woolston, 297 Ore. at 557). ""[A] business, as a possessor of premises, has a duty to take reasonable steps to  protect its visitors from reasonably foreseeable criminal acts by third persons."" Kids Inc. of Dallas, 245 Ore. App. at  278. Plaintiff pleads that Defendant IE is the owner and operator of the Studio 6 property at issue. ECF 1-1 at ¶ 12.  Defendant IE is therefore a possessor of premises and has a duty to protect visitors from reasonably foreseeable  criminal acts by third persons. See, e.g., Radke v. Carpenter, 281 Ore. 671, 677, 576 P.2d 365 (1978) (""The owner  of a[n] . . . inn owes his business guests a duty of ordinary reasonable care to protect them from injury at the hands  of other patrons while on the premises.""). This Court finds that Plaintiff has plausibly alleged an agency relationship between G6 Defendants and Defendant  IE, as Plaintiff has alleged facts which, if proven, support a theory that the G6 Defendants had control over the day- to-day operations of Studio 6 and its employees that relate to Plaintiff's claim. Further, this Court finds that Plaintiff  has plausibly alleged that Defendant IE had a legal duty to prevent Plaintiff's trafficking under Oregon law and that  IE violated that legal duty. Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts that [*29]  employees on site at Studio 6 were aware  that Plaintiff was being trafficked. Included in the Complaint are allegations that there were a variety of indicators  that Plaintiff was the victim of sex trafficking in Studio 6. Further, Plaintiff alleges that one employee, John Doe 1,  engaged in sex with one of her traffickers. Plaintiff further alleges that John Doe 1 suggested that Plaintiff engage in  sex acts with him and his girlfriend. Viewing the allegations and drawing all inferences in the light most favorable to  Plaintiff, this Court finds Plaintiff has sufficiently plead both a negligence claim against the employees of Studio 6  and Defendant IE and that G6 Defendants are vicariously liable for such negligence. Accordingly, this Court  DENIES G6 Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's vicarious negligence claim. C. O.R.S. § 30.867 Claim Plaintiff also brings a claim under O.R.S. § 30.867 against all Defendants for violation of O.R.S. § 163.266  (Trafficking in Persons), alleging Defendants ""knowingly benefit[ed] financially . . . from participation in a venture in      2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *26 Page 10 of 14 which [Plaintiff] was [sex trafficked]."" Id. at ¶¶ 34-37. Plaintiff asserts this claim against G6 Defendants both directly,  id. at ¶¶ 60-66, and vicariously for the [*30]  conduct of Defendant IE and its employees, id. at ¶¶ 69-71. For the  reasons stated below, this Court GRANTS G6 Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's direct liability claim under  O.R.S. § 30.867 and DENIES G6 Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's vicarious liability claim under O.R.S. §  30.867. As considered more fully below, evaluating [*31]  Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claim under O.R.S. §  30.867 requires this Court to determine, as a matter of first impression, what state of mind a defendant must  possess to be held civilly liable under Oregon's civil trafficking statute. Plaintiff and G6 Defendants disagree as to  the scienter required for defendants under O.R.S. § 30.867. G6 Defendants maintain that O.R.S. § 30.867 requires  actual knowledge or reckless disregard of the victim's trafficking, while Plaintiff asserts that no such scienter  requirement applies. ECF 19 at 12; ECF 29 at 7-8. This Court first examines the scienter required under the  ""knowingly benefitted financially"" element and then the ""participation in a venture that involves a prohibited act""  element. This Court finds that (1) a defendant must act with an awareness that they are benefitting financially to  fulfill the ""knowingly benefitted financially"" element and (2) a defendant must know or recklessly disregard the  purpose of the venture to fulfill the ""participation in a venture that involves a prohibited act"" element. 1. Statutory Interpretation of O.R.S. § 30.867 Both parties have failed to provide this Court with any interpretations of O.R.S. § 30.867 in Oregon courts.  Accordingly, this Court will apply Oregon's [*32]  rules of statutory construction in interpreting the statute's scienter  requirements. When considering the meaning of an Oregon statute, courts in this district apply Oregon rules of statutory  construction. Powell's Books, Inc. v. Kroger, 622 F.3d 1202, 1209 (9th Cir. 2010). The ""paramount goal"" is  ""discerning the legislature's intent."" State v. Gaines, 346 Ore. 160, 171, 206 P.3d 1042 (2009) (en banc). Oregon  courts, interpreting Oregon law, have outlined three steps that courts must follow in ascertaining legislative intent.  Id. (interpreting 2001 amendments to O.R.S. 174.020). First, a court must examine the text and context of the  legislation in question. Id. Second, the court may consider pertinent legislative history proffered by a party, even if  the court does not find ambiguity in the legislative text. Id. at 172. And finally, if the legislature's intent remains  unclear after examining the text, context, and legislative history, ""the court may resort to general maxims of  statutory construction to aid in resolving the remaining uncertainty."" Id. 2. Role of Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (""TVPRA"") As a preliminary matter, when interpreting the scienter requirements in § 30.867, both Plaintiff and G6 Defendants  compare the language in O.R.S. § 30.867 to similar statutory language in the federal Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization [*33]  Act (""TVPRA""). See 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). The TVPRA provides, in relevant part: ""[a]n  individual who is a victim of a violation of this chapter may bring a civil action against . . . whoever knowingly  benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a venture which that person knew or           2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *29 Page 11 of 14 should have known has engaged in an act in violation of this chapter . . . in an appropriate district court of the  United States . . . ."" Id. Defendant claims that this statute provides a direct analog to O.R.S. § 30.867. ECF 19 at  16. Defendant further argues that the TVPRA imposes a lower standard of constructive knowledge compared with  O.R.S. § 30.867, which requires actual knowledge or reckless disregard of the victim's trafficking. Id. at 12; ECF 31  at 2. By contrast, Plaintiff claims that O.R.S. § 30.867 was not enacted as a direct analog and that the ""knowingly""  requirement in O.R.S. § 30.867 was not meant to apply to the ""participation in a venture"" clause. ECF 29 at 4-8. O.R.S. §§ 30.867 and 163.266 were both enacted through a single bill in 2007, a year before Congress passed the  TVPRA. Id. at 4-5. In passing the TVPRA, Congress added the following scienter requirements: ""An individual who  is a victim of a violation of this chapter may bring a civil action against the perpetrator [*34]  (or whoever knowingly  benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district court of the  United States and may recover damages and reasonable attorneys fees."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) (emphasis added);  ECF 19 at 5. The language in O.R.S. §163.266 and, by extension, O.R.S. § 30.867, has not changed since these  additions to the federal statute. ECF 29 at 6. The legislative history provided by the parties indicates that the relevant scienter language in the TVPRA was  incorporated after O.R.S. 30.867 was enacted. ECF 29 at 4; ECF 31 at 4. Nonetheless, Oregon courts have looked  to parallel federal precedent in analyzing an Oregon statute, even when the state statute precedes the federal law.  Portland State Univ. Chapter of Am. Ass'n of Univ. Professors v. Portland State Univ., 352 Ore. 697, 711, 291 P.3d  658 (2012) (en banc) (observing that Oregon Supreme Court has looked to Title VII precedent to analyze state  statues, even though ""Oregon enacted a number of civil rights statutes many years before Congress enacted Title  VII""). ""Oregon courts may examine federal precedent for contextual support when they construe state statutes that  parallel federal law."" Id. Accordingly, this Court looks to TVPRA precedent for context when [*35]  analyzing the  parallel provision in O.R.S. § 30.867. 3. Direct Liability Claim Plaintiff brings a direct claim under O.R.S. § 30.867 against G6 Defendants for violation of O.R.S. § 163.266,  alleging Defendants ""knowingly benefit[ed] financially . . . from participation in a venture in which [Plaintiff] was [sex  trafficked]."" ECF 1-1 at ¶¶ 60-66. This Court will first examine the scienter required under the ""knowingly benefitted  financially"" element and then the ""participation in a venture that involves a prohibited act"" element. a. Knowingly Benefitted Financially As noted above, when applying the Oregon rules of statutory construction, a court must first examine the text and  context of the legislation in question. Gaines, 346 Ore. at 171. The relevant statute at issue, O.R.S. § 30.867,  provides that ""a person injured by a violation of . . . 163.266 may bring a civil action for damages against a person  whose actions are unlawful under ORS . . . 163.266."" O.R.S. § 30.867. O.R.S. § 163.266, in turn, states that: ""[a]  person commits the crime of trafficking in persons if the person knowingly benefits financially or receives something  of value from participation in a venture that involves an act prohibited by subsection (1) of this section or ORS  163.263 or 163.264."" O.R.S. § 163.266(2). Based on the plain meaning of this text, Defendants must ""knowingly  benefit[] financially"" [*36]  under this statute. Under Oregon's Criminal Code, ""knowingly"" means that ""a person acts with an awareness that the conduct of the  person is of a nature so described or that a circumstance so described exists."" O.R.S. § 161.085(8). Applying this  definition to O.R.S. § 30.867, a defendant must act with an awareness that they are benefitting financially to fulfill  this element. See Delgado v. Souders, 334 Ore. 122, 132-33, 46 P.3d 729 (2002) (applying definition of ""knowingly""  from O.R.S. § 161.085 to civil anti-stalking statute with criminal statute counterpart); see also City of Portland v.  Tuttle, 295 Ore. 524, 530 n.8, 668 P.2d 1197 (1983) (applying definition of ""knowingly"" from O.R.S. § 161.085 to  municipal ordinance); A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 936 (citations omitted) (interpreting the  knowingly benefits financially element of § 1595 as ""'merely requir[ing] that Defendant knowingly receive a financial  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *33 Page 12 of 14 benefit'""); State v. Spainhower, 251 Ore. App. 25, 28, 283 P.3d 361 (2012) (""When particular terms are not  statutorily defined, we give them their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning unless the context indicates that the  legislature intended some other meaning.""). In addressing G6 Defendants' direct liability claim under O.R.S. § 30.867, Plaintiff asserts that the money gained  from Plaintiff's sex trafficking was used to pay for the room at Studio 6 where she was being trafficked. ECF 1-1 at ¶  4. Plaintiff further alleges, upon information and belief, that G6 Defendants receive a share [*37]  of each room's  rental payment at Studio 6. Id. at ¶ 44. G6 Defendants respond that Studio 6 was ""independently owned and  operated by a third-party franchisee, IE Hotel Group, LLC,"" and that, as franchisors, G6 Defendants could not have  ""knowingly accepted room rent from the pimp trafficking [of Plaintiff]."" ECF 19 at 10 (quoting ECF 1-1 at ¶ 44).  However, G6 Defendants also admit to receiving royalties tied to Studio 6 rental revenues. Id. As this Court has previously held in the TVPRA context, at this stage, a plaintiff's allegations that ""[the defendants]  benefitted from [the plaintiff's] trafficking each time they received royalty payment for rooms in which she was being  kept"" are ""sufficient to meet the 'knowingly benefits' element."" A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide, 484 F. Supp. at 936. This  Court finds that Plaintiff alleges sufficient facts that G6 Defendants ""knowingly benefitted"" financially from her  trafficking under O.R.S. § 30.867. b. Participation in a Venture that Involves a Prohibited Act The parties provide conflicting interpretations of the scienter required for the second element of participation in a  venture that involves a prohibited act under O.R.S. § 30.867. G6 Defendants assert that O.R.S. § 30.867 directly  incorporates the actual knowledge or reckless disregard [*38]  requirement of the underlying criminal statute:  O.R.S. § 163.266. ECF 31 at 4. Meanwhile, Plaintiff asserts that no scienter requirement applies. ECF 29 at 4.  Unlike the TVPRA—which states that a person may bring a civil action against ""whoever knowingly benefits,  financially . . . from participation in a venture which that person knew or should have known has engaged in an act  [of trafficking] in violation of this chapter,"" 18 U.S.C. § 1595 (emphasis added)—O.R.S. § 30.867 does not expressly  provide a second scienter requirement. Instead, O.R.S. § 163.266 provides that ""[a] person commits the crime of  trafficking in persons if the person knowingly benefits financially . . . from participation in a venture that involves an  act [of trafficking] prohibited by . . . this section."" Plaintiff asserts that the choice not to include a second scienter  requirement implies that there is no scienter required. ECF 29 at 4. Defendants argue, however, that by omitting a  second scienter requirement from the statute, the legislature intended for ""knowingly"" to apply to both the first and  second element. ECF 19 at 12. As stated above, O.R.S. § 30.867 enables a person injured by conduct violating O.R.S. § 163.266—Oregon's  criminal trafficking statute—to bring a civil action for damages. O.R.S. § 163.266 states [*39]  in relevant part that:  ""[a] person commits the crime of trafficking in persons if the person knowingly benefits financially or receives  something of value from participation in a venture"" where ""the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that  force, fraud or coercion will be used to cause the other person to engage in a commercial sex act."" O.R.S. §  163.266. O.R.S. § 30.867 incorporates the language of O.R.S. § 163.266 by reference. Accordingly, based on a  plain reading of these statutes together, in order to ""participate in a venture that involves [the prohibited act of sex  trafficking],"" the participants have to know or recklessly disregard the purpose of the venture. This Court finds that G6 Defendants' actions do not amount to direct participation in a sex trafficking venture. As  outlined in Section B, Plaintiff has alleged numerous facts that would have put employees and managers at Studio  6, and therefore Defendant IE, on notice that Plaintiff was being trafficked. However, these allegations, even when  viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, fall short of plausibly alleging G6 Defendants had knowledge of or  recklessly disregarded the alleged trafficking of Plaintiff at Studio 6. Plaintiff's allegations indicate [*40]  that G6  Defendants had notice of sex trafficking generally occurring at their hotels and perhaps even at Studio 6, id. at ¶¶  24-33, but Plaintiff has not alleged facts which sufficiently link notice of Plaintiff's sex trafficking to G6 Defendants.  See A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 938-39 (dismissing TVPRA claim against franchisor because  plaintiff's complaint failed to demonstrate participation in plaintiff's trafficking). 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *36 Page 13 of 14 Plaintiff must allege facts showing how G6 Defendants knew or, at least, recklessly disregarded the fact that  Plaintiff D.B. was trafficked at Studio 6. Plaintiff has not done so. Accordingly, Plaintiff has not alleged facts  sufficient to state a claim for direct liability under O.R.S. § 30.867. This Court GRANTS Defendants' motion to  dismiss Plaintiff's direct liability claim against G6 Defendants under O.R.S. § 30.867 with leave to amend. 4. Vicarious Liability Claim Plaintiff also asserts a vicarious liability claim under O.R.S. § 30.867 against G6 Defendants for the conduct of  Defendant IE and its employees. ECF 1-1 at ¶¶ 69-71. G6 Defendants argue that, even if Plaintiff has plausibly  alleged the existence of an agency relationship between G6 Defendants and Defendant IE—as this Court has found  that she has—she has still failed to plausibly [*41]  allege Defendant IE or its employees are liable for any violation  of O.R.S. § 30.867. This Court disagrees. a. Knowingly Benefitted Financially Plaintiff has sufficiently pled facts to satisfy the first element of O.R.S. § 30.867. Plaintiff alleges that the money  gained from her sex trafficking was used to pay Defendant IE for the room in which she was being held. ECF 1-1 at  ¶ 4. G6 Defendants also admit to receiving royalties tied to Studio 6 rental revenues. ECF 19 at 10. As this Court  has found in the TVPRA context, at the pleading stage, a plaintiff's allegations that ""[the defendants] benefitted from  [the plaintiff's] trafficking each time they received royalty payments for rooms in which she was being kept"" are  ""sufficient to meet the 'knowingly benefits' element."" A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 936 (discussing  the ""knowingly benefits"" element of 18 U.S.C. § 1595). This Court finds that Plaintiff alleges sufficient facts that  Defendant IE ""knowingly benefitted"" financially from her trafficking under O.R.S. § 30.867. b. Participation in a Venture that Involves a Prohibited Act As noted above, Plaintiff has sufficiently pled facts plausibly suggesting that Defendant IE or its employees  participated in a prohibited venture, the second element of O.R.S. § 30.867. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant [*42]   John Doe 1, an employee of Studio 6, ""paid for sex with the female trafficker who exploited [Plaintiff],"" ECF 1-1 at ¶  37, and that Defendant John Doe 1 suggested that Plaintiff should ""engage in a three-way sexual relationship with  him along with his girlfriend,"" id. at ¶ 39. This Court has recognized that a relationship between a member of the  hotel staff and a plaintiff's trafficker may be evidence that a hotel knew or should have known of the plaintiff's  trafficking in the TVPRA context. A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 941 (citing B.M. v. Wyndham Hotels  & Resorts, Inc., No. 20-CV-00656-BLF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, *6 (N.D. Cal. July 30,  2020)). Based on Plaintiff's allegations concerning John Doe 1, along with numerous factual allegations in the  Complaint that would have put Defendant IE's employees on notice that Plaintiff was being trafficked, this Court  finds that plaintiff plausibly alleges that Defendant IE knowingly or with reckless disregard participated in a sex  trafficking venture sufficient to establish the second element. Knowledge of prostitution is generally not sufficient to satisfy knowledge of sex trafficking. See A.B. v. Hilton  Worldwide, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 941 (collecting TVPRA cases). However, Plaintiff also alleges facts suggesting that  Defendant IE or its employees knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that she was subjected to fraud, force,  threats [*43]  of force, or coercion. Plaintiff alleges that widely known indicators of trafficking include ""younger  individual with an older ""boyfriend,"" ""frequent male visitors to a room for short periods of time,"" ""guest shows signs  of fear, anxiety, tension, submission, and/or nervousness,"" ""guest shows signs of malnourishment, poor hygiene, or  lack of sleep,"" and ""guest lacks freedom of movement or is constantly monitored."" Id. at ¶ 43. Among other  allegations, Plaintiff pleads that she was kept under close watch at Studio 6 for nearly a week and was not allowed  to leave her room without her traffickers unless she stayed within view of the room, id. at ¶ 50, that she was  compelled to have sex with men for money multiple times a day at Studio 6, id. at ¶ 51, and that she was deprived  of food if she failed to earn enough money for her traffickers, id. Accordingly, Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *40 Page 14 of 14 supporting a cognizable legal theory that Defendant IE or its employees had actual knowledge of or recklessly  disregarded her sex trafficking. Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to fulfill the second element of O.R.S. § 30.867. Taking Plaintiff's allegations as true, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a vicarious claim against G6 [*44]  Defendants  under O.R.S. § 30.867. Accordingly, this Court DENIES Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's vicarious liability  claim against G6 Defendants under O.R.S. § 30.867.",1
"State v. Jackson, 2018-NMCA-066","[**677]  VARGAS, Judge.  [*1]  Defendant Sharoski Jackson appeals his convictions for human trafficking, promoting prostitution,  accepting earnings from a prostitute, contributing to a delinquency of a minor, and conspiracy. The charges arose  from Defendant's interactions with a minor, B.G., in early 2013. At trial, the State presented its theory that B.G. was  engaged in commercial sexual activity at the urging and with the assistance of Defendant. The jury found Defendant  guilty of all counts. 2018-NMCA-066, *2018-NMCA-066; 429 P.3d 674, **674; 2018 N.M. App. LEXIS 55, ***1 Page 5 of 12    [*2]  Defendant appeals, raising four points of error. First, Defendant claims that the district court erred by failing to  properly instruct the jury that to convict him of human trafficking, it must find that he knew his victim was under the  age of eighteen. Second, Defendant contends that [***2]  the district court abused its discretion by admitting text  messages without requiring the State to first lay a proper foundation for their admission. Third, Defendant argues  that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of the charged crimes. Finally, Defendant insists that the district  court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for a new trial, based on new evidence that B.G. purportedly  lied during her testimony at trial. We discuss each of Defendant's claims of error in turn. Finding no error, we affirm. DISCUSSION A. Human Trafficking and Knowledge  [*3]  Defendant argues that the instructions submitted to the jury were inadequate because the jury should have  been instructed that to convict Defendant, it must find Defendant knew B.G. was under the age of eighteen when  the acts giving rise to the human trafficking conviction occurred. This is a novel issue that New Mexico courts  have not yet considered—whether knowledge of the victim's age is an essential element of human trafficking  under NMSA 1978, Section 30-52-1(A)(2) (2008). We begin our analysis by setting forth our standard of review,  which requires a plain language reading of the statute. We then consider interpretations of similar statutory [***3]   language from other jurisdictions to arrive at the conclusion that knowledge of the victim's age is not an element of  human trafficking under Section 30-52-1(A)(2).  [*4]  HN1[ ] Statutory interpretation presents ""a question of law that we review de novo."" State v. Parvilus, 2014- NMSC-028, ¶ 15, 332 P.3d 281. HN2[ ] When interpreting statutes, we seek ""to give effect to the intent of the  Legislature."" Id. ¶ 15; State ex rel. Helman v. Gallegos, 1994-NMSC-023, ¶ 23, 117 N.M. 346, 871 P.2d 1352 (""[I]t  is part of the essence of judicial responsibility to search for and effectuate the legislative intent—the purpose or  object—underlying the statute.""). The first indicator of the Legislature's intent is the plain language of the statute.  State v. Almanzar, 2014-NMSC-001, ¶ 14, 316 P.3d 183 (acknowledging that courts give ""words their ordinary  meaning, unless the Legislature indicates a different one was intended""). ""When a statute contains language which  is clear and unambiguous, we must give effect to that language and refrain from further statutory interpretation.""  State v. Jonathan M., 1990-NMSC-046, ¶ 4, 109 N.M. 789, 791 P.2d 64, superseded by statute as stated in State v.  DeAngelo, 2015-NMSC-033, 360 P.3d 1151.  [*5]  Our human trafficking statute provides: A. Human trafficking consists of a person knowingly: (1) recruiting, soliciting, enticing, transporting or obtaining by any means another person with the intent or  knowledge that force, fraud or coercion will  [**678]  be used to subject the person to labor, services or  commercial [***4]  sexual activity; (2) recruiting, soliciting, enticing, transporting or obtaining by any means a person under the age of eighteen  years with the intent or knowledge that the person will be caused to engage in commercial sexual activity; or (3) benefiting, financially or by receiving anything of value, from the labor, services or commercial sexual  activity of another person with the knowledge that force, fraud or coercion was used to obtain the labor,  services or commercial sexual activity. Section 30-52-1(A).  [*6]  Initially, we note that HN3[ ] the Legislature offset ""knowingly"" from the remainder of the definition of human  trafficking, making it applicable to all three subparts of Section 30-52-1(A). Defendant argues that, with regard to  Section 30-52-1(A)(2), the ""knowingly"" requirement refers to the entire phrase, ""recruiting, soliciting, enticing,  transporting, or obtaining by any means a person under the age of eighteen years."" Applying the plain language  2018-NMCA-066, *1; 429 P.3d 674, **677; 2018 N.M. App. LEXIS 55, ***1 Page 6 of 12   rule and utilizing rules of grammar, we conclude that the more persuasive interpretation of the statute is that the  Legislature intended that the ""knowingly"" requirement modify ""recruiting, soliciting, enticing, transporting or  obtaining"" as they are used in Section 30-52-1(A)(1) and (2) and ""benefiting"" as it is used [***5]  in Section 30-52- 1(A)(3). See Wilson v. Denver, 1998-NMSC-016, ¶ 16, 125 N.M. 308, 961 P.2d 153 (acknowledging that application  of the plain language rule allows us to consider and ""rely on rules of grammar to aid our construction . . . of a  statute""); see also State v. Johnson, 2001-NMSC-001, ¶ 13, 130 N.M. 6, 15 P.3d 1233 (applying ""rules of grammar""  when construing statute). Indeed, ""knowingly"" cannot properly modify ""a person under the age of [eighteen] years.""  See William A. Sabin, The Gregg Reference Manual 667 (11th ed. 2011) (explaining that an adverbial clause  functions as an adverb to the main, independent clause and may modify a verb, adverb, or adjective, but not a  noun). Common usage and generally accepted principles of grammar, as well as the structure and language of the  statute, indicate the Legislature intended that a jury determine whether any ""recruiting, soliciting, enticing,  transporting, or obtaining"" was done knowingly, rather than whether the defendant knew the age of the person  being recruited, solicited, enticed, transported, or obtained.  [*7]  Indeed, HN4[ ] even in instances where the language of a statute is unambiguous, ""a statutory subsection . .  . must be considered in reference to the statute as a whole."" State v. Rivera, 2004-NMSC-001, ¶ 13, 134 N.M. 768,  82 P.3d 939 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (noting courts closely examine the statute's  overall [***6]  structure and its function within a comprehensive legislative scheme). Considering the statute as a  whole, we note that, although the Legislature used the term ""knowingly"" in Section 30-52-1(A)'s definition of human  trafficking, it did not include any knowledge element in Section 30-52-1(C)'s assignment of different degrees of  felony based on the age of the victim. Section 30-52-1(C) provides: Whoever commits human trafficking is guilty of a third degree felony; except if the victim is under the age of: (1) sixteen, the person is guilty of a second degree felony; or (2) thirteen, the person is guilty of a first degree felony. HN5[ ] Given that the plain language indicates that ""knowingly"" refers to the act of ""recruiting, soliciting, enticing,  transporting or obtaining,"" or ""benefiting"" and in light of the Legislature's omission of a knowledge element in  Section 30-52-1(C), we conclude human trafficking does not require knowledge of any of the ages enumerated in  Section 30-52-1. The act of knowingly ""recruiting, soliciting, enticing, transporting or obtaining,"" or knowingly  ""benefiting"" is sufficient, regardless of whether the accused knows the victim is under the age of eighteen, sixteen,  or thirteen. See § 30-52-1(A), (C).  [*8]  Our interpretation of Section 30-52-1(A)(2) is in accordance with our statewide policy [***7]  that minors are  entitled to special protection. State v. Gunter, 1974-NMCA-132, ¶ 6, 87 N.M. 71, 529 P.2d 297. Indeed, it is the only  interpretation that furthers that purpose. The statute's language makes it  [**679]  clear that the Legislature  intended to broaden Section 30-52-1(A)'s applicability to protect minors who fall victim to sexual exploitation, rather  than the individuals seeking to exploit them. See § 30-52-1(E) (precluding human trafficking victims from being  charged as an accessory to the crime of human trafficking); Section 30-52-1(D) (stating that prosecution for  human trafficking shall not preclude prosecution under any other provision of the law, eliminating potential for  double jeopardy violations). Given the Legislature's intent and the policies underlying the human trafficking  statute, we decline to expand the ""knowingly"" requirement as Defendant suggests to ""a person under the age of  eighteen."" The intentional exploitation of a person under the age of eighteen for commercial sexual activity amounts  to a violation of Section 30-52-1(A)(2), regardless of a defendant's actual awareness of that person's age.  [*9]  Defendant attempts to analogize the human trafficking statute to other statutes that our courts have already  interpreted—particularly NMSA 1978, Section 30-6-3 (1990), contributing to the delinquency of a minor (CDM)— in [***8]  making his argument. Defendant argues that we should require knowledge of the victim's age to be an  essential element for human trafficking in the same way that this Court has required knowledge to be an essential  element of CDM. As support, Defendant cites to State v. Romero, 2000-NMCA-029, ¶¶ 27, 29, 128 N.M. 806, 999  P.2d 1038, in which this Court concluded knowledge that the minor was on probation as well as the conditions of  her probation were an essential element for a CDM conviction. Romero addressed the CDM prohibition against  encouraging a minor to refuse to obey reasonable and lawful commands of a person who has lawful authority over  2018-NMCA-066, *6; 429 P.3d 674, **678; 2018 N.M. App. LEXIS 55, ***4 Page 7 of 12   the minor. Id. ¶ 4. Whether the defendant was aware of the command was an essential element for a CDM  conviction largely because without it, an ""endless"" number of scenarios exist in which a lawful action, done without  knowledge of the command placed upon the minor, would be grounds for a CDM conviction. See id. ¶ 20  (suggesting liability could be imposed for unknowingly causing a minor to be out past curfew or act contrary to  parent's, educator's, or coach's instructions). This Court reasoned that, ""at the very least[,]"" a CDM instruction  should require proof that the accused ""knew or should have known the nature [***9]  of the command"" before being  convicted of CDM. Id. ¶¶ 21, 27 (emphasis omitted).  [*10]  Defendant argues that a human trafficking conviction under Section 30-52-1(A)(2) should require ""a degree  of knowledge"" regarding the victim's age just as a CDM conviction requires a degree of knowledge regarding the  order or command of a third party. Romero, 2000-NMCA-029, ¶ 27. Defendant's argument regarding the CDM  statute is unpersuasive in light of this Court's opinion in State v. Lozoya, 2017-NMCA-052, 399 P.3d 410. In  Lozoya, we addressed the much more specific and factually analogous issue of whether the CDM statute ""requires  proof that the charged adult knew the child's age."" Id. ¶ 24. We characterized the issue as one of first impression,  pointing out that Romero did not control our analysis because it did not specifically address whether knowledge of  the child's age was an essential element of CDM. Lozoya, 2017-NMCA-052, ¶ 24. Looking to the general purpose  of the CDM statute as well as the legislative intent to protect children, Lozoya rejected a narrow construction of the  language that would limit the statute's use in protecting children, and held that ""CDM does not require proof that the  offending adult know the age of the child to whose delinquency the adult contributed."" 2017-NMCA-052, ¶¶ 26-27.  Given this explicit rejection [***10]  of a knowledge requirement, Defendant's reliance on the CDM statute is  misplaced.  [*11]  We also note that the majority of federal appellate courts have reached similar conclusions when faced with  a similar question. Those courts have concluded that 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (2012), making it a crime to ""knowingly  transport[] an individual who has not attained the age of [eighteen] years"" across state lines for the purpose of  engaging in prostitution, does not require proof that the defendant knew the victim was under the age of eighteen  despite the use of the term ""knowingly"" in the statute. See United States  [**680]  v. Washington, 743 F.3d 938,  941-44 (4th Cir. 2014) (identifying ""knowingly"" as adverb, acknowledging minors receive special protection against  sexual exploitation, and explaining the purpose of the statute to be to make the ""victim's underage status an  aggravating factor"" and ""not to make the provision protecting minors more difficult to prove""); United States v.  Tavares, 705 F.3d 4, 19 (1st Cir. 2013) (adopting reasoning that minors require special protection and that age  referenced in statute ""is not a factor that distinguishes criminal behavior from innocent conduct, but rather serves to  justify a harsher penalty when a victim is underage"" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); United States  v. Daniels, 653 F.3d 399, 410 (6th Cir. 2011) (relying on context and the need [***11]  to provide minors with special  protection against sexual exploitation); United States v. Cox, 577 F.3d 833, 837-38 (7th Cir. 2009) (identifying  ""knowingly"" as adverb that acts on verb, not noun, stating ""[t]here is no good reason to read § 2423(a) differently[,]""  emphasizing purpose of providing greater protection to minors, and opining that ""the inclusion of age was intended  to create an aggravating factor for penological purposes""); United States v. Griffith, 284 F.3d 338, 351 (2nd Cir.  2002) (refusing to require proof that the defendant knew the victim was a minor, reasoning that the victim's age was  included in the statute to allow for imposition of tougher penalty); United States v. Taylor, 239 F.3d 994, 997 (9th  Cir. 2001) (same); United States v. Hamilton, 456 F.2d 171, 173 (3rd Cir. 1972) (same); cf. United States v.  Daniels, 685 F.3d 1237, 1248 (11th Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (analogizing similarly-worded 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b)  (2012) to § 2423, recognizing need to protect minors in both statutes, and concluding § 2422(b) does not require  proof that a defendant knew the victim was under the age of eighteen).  [*12]  Based on our plain language interpretation of the statue and the purpose and policy behind the statute, we  hold that the State was not required to prove Defendant knew B.G.'s age as an element of the offense of human  trafficking. We therefore need not reach Defendant's argument that the failure to instruct the jury that knowledge of  B.G.'s age was an element of the crime was error. B. Admission of Text [***12]  Messages 2018-NMCA-066, *9; 429 P.3d 674, **679; 2018 N.M. App. LEXIS 55, ***8 Page 8 of 12    [*13]  Defendant next argues that the text messages contained in an exhibit at trial were improperly admitted  because the State failed to properly authenticate or lay a sufficient foundation for their admission. See State v.  Imperial, 2017-NMCA-040, ¶ 28, 392 P.3d 658 (stating, HN6[ ] ""[e]vidence is properly authenticated by the  production of foundational evidence 'sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.'""  (quoting Rule 11-901(A) NMRA)). HN7[ ] A trial court's decision to admit or exclude evidence is reviewed for an  abuse of discretion. State v. Johnson, 2010-NMSC-016, ¶ 40, 148 N.M. 50, 229 P.3d 523. ""[T]here is no abuse of  discretion when the evidence is shown by a preponderance of the evidence to be what it purports to be."" State v.  Jimenez, 2017-NMCA-039, ¶ 18, 392 P.3d 668 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see Rule 11-901(A).  HN8[ ] The authentication requirement may be satisfied by evidence of ""appearance, contents, substance, internal  patterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the item, taken together with all the circumstances."" Rule 11- 901(B)(4).  [*14]  During a pretrial motion hearing, the district court heard arguments from both parties regarding the  admissibility of the text messages. The district court conducted a painstaking review of the exhibit with the parties in  an effort to determine whether each text message was admissible and reserved [***13]  ruling until after the State  had an opportunity to lay an adequate foundation for each message during trial.  [*15]  At trial, the State presented a witness who it qualified as an expert in the areas of digital analysis and digital  forensic analysis. The State's expert testified that he performed a digital analysis of two cell phones. One phone  was associated with a phone number beginning with the digits, 712 (hereinafter referred to as ""the 712 number"" or  ""712 phone""), while the other had a phone number beginning with the digits, 804 (hereinafter referred to as ""the 804  number"" or ""804 phone""). Extracting information from the 712 phone, the State's expert created a phone  [**681]   examination report setting out a timeline of that cell phone's activity between December 2012 and March 16, 2013.  The report showed numerous contacts between the 712 number and the 804 number. B.G. testified that the 712  number belonged to Defendant and that the 804 number belonged to Tiffany, who worked as a prostitute and was  named as Defendant's co-conspirator in the indictment.  [*16]  The State put on evidence that text messages in both the 712 phone and the 804 phone contained  references to Tiffany and ""Tiff,"" as well [***14]  as to Defendant, and his nicknames, ""Redd"" and ""Rock"" and  Defendant answered calls placed to the 804 number. One witness testified that she knew she was corresponding  with Defendant on the 804 number because she recognized his voice when she called the number and his text  message answers were consistent with his in-person responses. See HN9[ ] Rule 11-901(B)(5) (acknowledging  that opinion evidence identifying a person's voice through electronic transmission, in a manner that connects it with  the alleged speaker satisfies the Rule's authentication requirement). In addition, copies of Defendant's personal  documents, including a social security card, passport, and birth certificate, were sent via email to an email address  associated with the 712 number.  [*17]  The State also presented evidence tying the 712 and 804 numbers to the circumstances giving rise to  Defendant's human trafficking and prostitution-related charges. For instance, the State presented evidence that  B.G. was depicted in an advertisement on a website known as backpage.com, which is commonly used to advertise  prostitution services. That advertisement instructs interested parties to contact the 712 and 804 numbers. The 712  phone accessed backpage.com [***15]  on more than one occasion and the email associated with the 712 number  was listed as a means of contact in the backpage.com advertisements for B.G. and Tiffany. The 712 phone also  contained photographs of B.G., some of which were also included in the backpage.com advertisement. Finally,  photographs of B.G. were exchanged between the 712 number and 804 number via multimedia messages.  [*18]  The State's evidence linking Defendant to the 712 and 804 phones, presented prior to moving the text  message exhibit into evidence, was adequate to authenticate the exhibit. It established the relevance of the 712  and 804 phones' activities, and presented sufficient evidence to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the  information in the exhibit came from the 712 and 804 phones. See Imperial, 2017-NMCA-040, ¶ 32 (acknowledging  authentication may be established through circumstantial evidence). We therefore conclude the district court did not  abuse its discretion in admitting the exhibit into evidence. 2018-NMCA-066, *12; 429 P.3d 674, **680; 2018 N.M. App. LEXIS 55, ***12 Page 9 of 12    [*19]  In arguing this issue, Defendant relies on evidence in the record that Defendant used the 712 and 804  phones interchangeably, rendering it possible that Defendant did not author the text messages contained in the  exhibit. [***16]  Defendant's argument goes to the weight of the evidence, rather than its admissibility. It was for the  jury to decide whether Defendant was the author or recipient of the text messages in the exhibit. The State was free  to argue that the jury should infer Defendant was the author or intended recipient of those text messages and was  therefore in control of the phone when it was used to conduct activities relating to the human trafficking and  prostitution-related charges. Defendant was also free to argue against those inferences by arguing that others had  control of the phones and authored and received the text messages, negating Defendant's culpability. Defendant's  argument that the text messages in the exhibit could have been authored or received by someone else, does not  negate the admissibility of the text messages, but rather presents an alternative to the State's suggested  inferences.  [*20]  Defendant also argues that the text messages constitute inadmissible hearsay because they did not satisfy  the requirements of a hearsay exception, such as admissions by a party opponent or co-conspirator, without the  State first establishing that Defendant or Tiffany were the authors. It is clear [***17]  that any text messages  authored by Defendant were ""non-hearsay"" under HN10[ ] Rule 11-801(D)(2)(a) NMRA (characterizing a  [**682]   statement made by the opposing party as ""not hearsay). Similarly, text messages authored by Tiffany are ""non- hearsay"" under Rule 11-801(D)(2)(e); State v. Montes, 2007-NMCA-083, ¶ 11, 142 N.M. 221, 164 P.3d 102  (explaining that HN11[ ] co-conspirator statements are not hearsay where the proponent of the evidence  demonstrates, ""(1) [t]he existence of a conspiracy of which the declarant and the defendant were members, (2) that  the statement was made in the course of that conspiracy, and (3) that the statement was made in furtherance of  that conspiracy""). Defendant does not point to anything in the record that suggests anyone other than Defendant  and Tiffany had access to or used the 712 and 804 phones. Thus, with regard to text messages sent from the 712  and 804 number, the State has adequately identified the author to overcome a hearsay challenge.  [*21]  To the extent Defendant's hearsay argument also challenges the admission of the text messages not  authored by the 712 number, the 804 number, or B.G., it appears from the record that the majority of those  messages were offered for a reason other than ""to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement."" Rule 11- 801(C)(2). For example, some text messages [***18]  appear to be from potential clients, clarifying price and  arranging a meeting place. Those messages were not offered for their truth—that the price for services was $150  per hour or that Tiffany was in a certain location at a certain time. Rather, those statements were offered to provide  context and establish that Defendant and Tiffany were motivated by money to set up commercial sexual  transactions. Because those messages were not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statements,  they do not constitute hearsay. We therefore conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the  text messages in the exhibit. C. Sufficiency  [*22]  Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting all five of his convictions, pursuant to State  v. Franklin, 1967-NMSC-151, ¶ 9, 78 N.M. 127, 428 P.2d 982, and State v. Boyer, 1985-NMCA-029, ¶¶ 17-24, 103  N.M. 655, 712 P.2d 1. HN12[ ] ""Jury instructions become the law of the case against which the sufficiency of the  evidence is to be measured."" State v. Smith, 1986-NMCA-089, ¶ 7, 104 N.M. 729, 726 P.2d 883. We consider each  conviction in turn, keeping in mind that we ""view the evidence in the light most favorable to the guilty verdict [and]  indulg[e] all reasonable inferences . . . in favor of the verdict."" State v. Cunningham, 2000-NMSC-009, ¶ 26, 128  N.M. 711, 998 P.2d 176.  [*23]  On the human trafficking count, the jury was instructed that the State must prove Defendant  ""knowingly [***19]  recruited, enticed, transported or obtained by any means[,]"" B.G. and knew or intended that B.G.  ""would be caused to engage in commercial sexual activity"" when ""[B.G.] was under eighteen years"" of age. The  State presented evidence that Defendant used the 712 phone and an email associated with that phone to create a  backpage.com ad for B.G. The State also presented evidence that some of the photographs in the 712 phone were  the same as those used in B.G.'s backpage.com ad. B.G. testified that in February 2013 Defendant took her to a  2018-NMCA-066, *18; 429 P.3d 674, **681; 2018 N.M. App. LEXIS 55, ***15 Page 10 of 12   gas station and dropped her off there intending for her to exchange sex for money. The State also presented  evidence that B.G. was seventeen years old in March 2013 when the indictment alleges Defendant committed  human trafficking. We conclude that these facts, taken in the light most favorable to the verdict, are sufficient to  satisfy each element of human trafficking.  [*24]  On the promoting prostitution count, the jury was instructed that the State must prove beyond a reasonable  doubt that Defendant, acting in a capacity other than as a prostitute or patron of a prostitute, ""knowingly solicited  a patron for a prostitute[.]"" In addition to the evidence that [***20]  Defendant used the 712 phone to create B.G.'s  backpage.com ad and listed the number as the contact number in that ad, the State offered evidence that someone  using the 712 phone texted, ""U w[a]nt the white [expletive]?? She ready[,]"" and that Defendant used that term to  identify B.G. This evidence was sufficient to support Defendant's conviction for promoting prostitution.  [*25]  [**683]   The jury was instructed that Defendant was guilty of accepting the earnings of a prostitute if the  State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant ""accepted or received money . . . without consideration,  from the proceeds of the earnings of [B.G.], a person engaged in prostitution[,]"" and Defendant knew that B.G.  was engaged in prostitution and he received proceeds from her acts of prostitution. B.G. testified that she gave  Defendant money she received as a result of various sexual transactions. Defendant suggests that there is  insufficient evidence to support this conviction because there was also evidence to suggest B.G. gave the money to  Defendant of her own accord. HN13[ ] This potential conflict in the evidence does not negate the sufficiency of the  evidence to support the conviction. It is for the jury to [***21]  resolve conflicts in the evidence at trial, and we  resolve conflicts in the light most favorable to the verdict. See State v. Salas, 1999-NMCA-099, ¶ 13, 127 N.M. 686,  986 P.2d 482; see also Cunningham, 2000-NMSC-009, ¶ 26.  [*26]  The jury was instructed that to find Defendant guilty of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, the State  must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant ""instructed [B.G.] on how to prostitute"" and caused or  encouraged B.G. to either commit the act of prostitution or ""conduct herself in a manner injurious to her morals,  health or welfare[.]"" The evidence presented at trial was that Defendant instructed Tiffany to create the  backpage.com ad for B.G., and explained to B.G. that she would use the ad in order to exchange sex for money.  Defendant also informed B.G. when and where to meet people who responded to the backpage.com ad.  [*27]  Defendant again challenges the sufficiency of the evidence by asserting that the State failed to prove he  encouraged B.G. to commit the act of prostitution because there was evidence B.G. chose to do so voluntarily.  Again, it was for the jury to resolve the conflicting evidence at trial, and we resolve any conflicts in favor of the  verdict. See Salas, 1999-NMCA-099, ¶ 13; see also Cunningham, 2000-NMSC-009, ¶ 26. Taking the evidence in  the light most favorable to the verdict, [***22]  we conclude there was sufficient evidence to support Defendant's  conviction on this count.  [*28]  The jury was also instructed on conspiracy to commit human trafficking, which requires that the State prove  Defendant and another person ""by words or acts agreed together to commit human trafficking"" and intended to  commit human trafficking. The State presented evidence that Defendant instructed Tiffany to post a  backpage.com ad for B.G. and that Tiffany agreed to do so. We conclude that there was sufficient evidence to  support Defendant's conviction on this count.  [*29]  After reviewing the record, we conclude that the evidence presented is sufficient, when considered in the  light most favorable to the verdict, to support each of Defendant's convictions. D. Denial of Motion for New Trial  [*30]  Finally, Defendant also challenges the district court's denial of his motion for a new trial, pursuant to Franklin,  1967-NMSC-151, ¶ 9, and Boyer, 1985-NMCA-029, ¶¶ 17-24. Defendant claims newly discovered evidence in the  2018-NMCA-066, *23; 429 P.3d 674, **682; 2018 N.M. App. LEXIS 55, ***19 Page 11 of 12   form of a recording of all or part of a post-trial phone conversation between Defendant's sister and B.G. revealed  B.G. had not been truthful during her trial testimony. At some point during the course of the conversation,  Defendant's sister asked [***23]  B.G. why she lied at trial. B.G.'s response, however, was, ""'[T]hey told me that if I  didn't say anything that I would have to stay in jail[,]"" which the State contended, meant that if she did not testify, the   [**684]  court could hold her in contempt. B.G. never affirmatively admitted to having been untruthful during her  testimony.  [*31]  The district court denied the motion, concluding that Defendant failed to establish two of the six requirements  for succeeding on such a motion—that the evidence was not merely for impeachment purposes and that it would  have changed the result of the trial. On appeal, Defendant asserts the district court erred in denying the motion for  new trial.  [*32]  HN14[ ] A motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence may be made within two years of final  judgment. Rule 5-614(C) NMRA. An appellate court ""will not disturb [the district] court's exercise of discretion in  denying or granting a motion for a new trial unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion."" State v. Garcia, 2005- NMSC-038, ¶ 7, 138 N.M. 659, 125 P.3d 638. The evidence that gives rise to a motion for new trial based on newly  discovered evidence must fulfill six requirements: 1) it will probably change the result if a new trial is granted; 2) it must have been discovered since the  trial; [***24]  3) it could not have been discovered before the trial by the exercise of due diligence; 4) it must be  material; 5) it must not be merely cumulative; and 6) it must not be merely impeaching or contradictory. Id. ¶ 8 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  [*33]  Defendant argues that the recorded conversation demonstrates B.G. lied when testifying at trial, and that at a  new trial, she might testify differently. We are unpersuaded by Defendant's argument. Review of the record reveals  that if probative of any issue at all, it is clear that the recorded conversation went to the truthfulness of B.G.'s  testimony. Even when arguing the motion for new trial to the district court, defense counsel acknowledged that the  evidence went to the truthfulness of B.G.'s testimony, referring to the phone call as evidence of ""untruthful, perjured  testimony."" Furthermore, while Defendant argues on appeal that at a new trial, B.G. might testify differently, nothing  in the recorded conversation even suggests what B.G.'s testimony at a new trial might be, how it might differ, or  how it might assist Defendant, other than to impeach B.G.'s credibility. See id. Defendant already availed himself of  the opportunity [***25]  to thoroughly address any discrepancies or conflicts in B.G.'s testimony during trial through  cross-examination. B.G.'s credibility was an issue that Defendant had already explored extensively at trial.  [*34]  Finally, HN15[ ] our courts treat attacks on the veracity of trial testimony with extreme caution. Cf. State v.  Betsellie, 1971-NMSC-076, ¶ 12, 82 N.M. 782, 487 P.2d 484 (stating, ""courts must act with great reluctance and  with special care and caution before accepting the truth of a claim of perjury, and should properly require the  evidence to affirmatively establish the perjury in such clear and convincing manner as to leave no room for  reasonable doubt that perjury was committed"" and ultimately refusing to remand due to doubts as to the adequacy  of affidavits presented through post-trial motion). The evidence provided to the district court is far from the  conclusive evidence necessary to demonstrate its usefulness as more than impeachment evidence. Because  Defendant has failed to show that the recorded conversation is not merely impeaching or contradictory and cannot,  therefore, satisfy all six requirements for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, we conclude that the  district court did not abuse of its discretion by denying Defendant's Rule 5-614(C) [***26]  motion",1

Section  1591(a) of the Act imposes criminal liability for  certain sex trafficking: (a) Whoever knowingly-- (1)  in  or  affecting  interstate  or  foreign  commerce, [*3]  or within the special maritime and  territorial jurisdiction of the United States, recruits,  entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains,  advertises, maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any  means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C.A. § 1591(a). In addition to a criminal  punishment, the TVPRA provides the following civil  remedy: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in [*4]  an appropriate  district court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Thus, the TVRPA authorizes a victim of sex  trafficking to bring a direct civil claim against the  perpetrator of the trafficking and a ""beneficiary"" civil  claim  against  ""whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of [the TVPRA]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). To  state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA, Plaintiff must plausibly allege that the  defendant ""(1) knowingly benefited (2) from  participating in a venture; (3) that venture violated  the TVPRA as to [A.D.]; and (4) [Defendants] knew  or should have known that the venture violated the  TVPRA as to [A.D.]."" Doe v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21  F.4th 714, 726 (11th Cir. 2021). A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  67832, [WL] at *2. The Court will consider each of the  elements as applied to the amended pleading. II. The operative amended complaint alleges the following:  Defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc. (Choice  Hotels) knows and has known for years that sex  trafficking and prostitution occur at their branded hotel  locations. Defendants R&M Real Estate Company, Inc.,  Robert Vocisano, and Mario Vocisano (R&M Real  Estate [*5]  collectively) also know and have known for  years of both occurring specifically at the Quality Inn &  Suites Golf Resort (Quality Inn) in Naples, Florida. (Doc.  #47, ¶¶ 2-3.) This action for damages is brought by the  Plaintiff, identified by her initials A.D., a survivor of sex  trafficking under the TVPRA. (Id. at ¶ 12.) ""With knowledge of the problem, and as a direct and  proximate result of Defendants' multiple failures and  refusals to act, mandate, establish, execute, and/or  modify their anti-trafficking efforts at the Quality Inn  hotel, A.D. was continuously sex trafficked, sexually  exploited, and victimized repeatedly at the Quality Inn  hotel."" (Id. at ¶ 18.) Plaintiff alleges that defendants  ""participated in a hotel operating venture and knowingly  benefited from this venture through room rentals, profits,  third party fees, and the value of the ""good will"" of the  Choice® brand. The venture knew or should have  known that they were profiting from sex trafficking,  including the sex trafficking of A.D., in violation of the  TVPRA."" (Id. at ¶ 19.) Plaintiff further alleges that Choice Hotels and R&M  Real Estate participated in a hotel operating venture that  included staff at the Quality [*6]  Inn. R&M Real Estate  owns the Quality Inn pursuant to a franchise agreement  entered into with Choice Hotels. Plaintiff alleges an  agency relationship through Choice Hotels' ""exercise of  ongoing and systemic right of control over the Quality  Inn hotel."" (Id. at ¶¶ 29-32.) Choice Hotels makes  decisions that directly impact the operations and  maintenance of their branded hotels, including the  Quality Inn. (Id. at ¶ 39.) R&M Real Estate directly  offered public lodging services at the Quality Inn where  A.D. was trafficked for sex. (Id. at ¶ 49.) Defendants  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150397, *2 Page 3 of 5 ""participated in a hotel operating venture in connection  with the management and operating of the Quality Inn  hotel involving risk and potential profit."" (Id. at ¶ 52.) During at least 2008 to 2012, emails were exchanged by  employees of Choice Hotels that related to sex  trafficking in hotels, including the Quality Inn. (Id. at ¶  57.) Choice Hotels had actual and/or constructive  knowledge of sex trafficking, including A.D.'s sex  trafficking and victimization, occurring on its branded  property. (Id. at ¶ 63.) Choice Hotels continued to permit  and profit from male clientele who rented hotel rooms to  buy sex despite having access to sex trafficking [*7]   indicators. (Id. at ¶ 75.) In 2018, a reviewer described  the Quality Inn as being in a seedy part of Naples, ""[d]id  not feel safe."" (Id. at ¶ 79k.) Choice Hotels monitors  customer reviews. (Id. at ¶ 81.) Defendants had ""actual  or, at a minimum, constructive knowledge that the rental  of rooms was for the purpose of sex trafficking A.D., in  violation of the TVPRA."" (Id. at ¶ 105.) R&M Real Estate staff openly observed signs of  trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. R&M Real Estate  received revenue and a percentage was provided to  Choice Hotels. (Id. at ¶ 106.) Through Choice Hotels'  relationship with the staff at the Quality Inn, it benefited  or  received  royalty  payments,  licensing  fees,  membership fees and dues, reservation fees, and  percentages of the gross room revenue. (Id. at ¶ 107.)  Through their ""continuous business venture of renting  hotel rooms"", R&M Real Estate knowingly benefited. (Id.  at ¶ 109.) Plaintiff alleges that defendants benefit from  the steady stream of income that sex traffickers bring to  their hotel brands and from their reputation for privacy,  discretion, and the facilitation of commercial sex. (Id., ¶¶  118-119.) III. As previously stated, plaintiff must sufficiently [*8]  plead  that a defendant knowingly benefited from participating  in a venture, that the venture violated the TVPRA, and  that defendants knew or should have known that the  venture violated the TVPRA. A. Knowingly Benefited To satisfy the first element of a TVPRA beneficiary  claim, plaintiff must allege that defendant ""knew it was  receiving some value from participating in the alleged  venture."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. As the  Eleventh Circuit stated, ""Knowingly benefits"" means ""an awareness or  understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of  mind in which a person has no substantial doubt  about the existence of a fact."" Knowledge, Black's  Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). And Section  1595(a) explains that a defendant may benefit  ""financially or by receiving anything of value.""  Accordingly, a plaintiff like the Does must allege  that the defendant knew it was receiving some  value from participating in the alleged venture. Id. at 723-24. In the absence of a more stringent  statutory pleading requirement, knowledge ""may be  alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Alleging a  ""continuous business relationship"" is sufficient to show a  knowing benefit. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22- 2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015,  at *16 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023). The Court previously  found this element could be satisfied at this stage of the  proceedings. A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 67832, [WL] at *3. B. Participation in [*9]  Venture - Franchisor Plaintiff must allege that the benefits received by Choice  Hotels were from ""participation in a venture"" which  defendants knew or should have known has engaged in  an act in violation of the TVPRA. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a).  The Eleventh Circuit rejected the statutory definition of  ""participation in a venture"" found in the criminal  provision, § 1591(e)(4), which defined ""participation in a  venture""  as  ""knowingly  assisting,  supporting  or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)."" Instead, the  Eleventh Circuit held that ""participation in a venture"" in  the civil context requires that plaintiff allege that the  franchisor ""took part in a common undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit."" Red Roof  Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture and knowingly benefited from this  venture through room rentals, profits, third party fees,  and the value of the ""good will"" of the Choice® brand.  The venture knew or should have known that they were  profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking  of A.D., in violation of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #47, ¶ 19.)  Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture"" in connection with the Quality Inn for  potential [*10]  profit. (Id. at ¶ 52.) Plaintiff alleges that  Choice  Hotels  ""had  actual  and/or  constructive  knowledge of sex trafficking, including A.D.'s sex  trafficking and victimization,"" at its branded property and  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150397, *6 Page 4 of 5 it ""failed to implement and enforce any of its own policy  or policies and protect Plaintiff A.D. from being sex  trafficked"", failed to take action to prevent trafficking so  that it could continue to profit, and failed to address the  open and obvious presence of human trafficking on  hotel properties. (Id. at ¶ 63.) Choice Hotels is alleged to  have  demonstrated  actual  and/or  constructive  knowledge of the ""rampant culture of sex trafficking"" at  their properties around the country, including through  news stories and online reviews. (Id. at ¶ 78.) These additional facts in the Second Amended  Complaint do not remedy the problem in the original  pleading as to Choice Hotels. ""[A]s the Eleventh Circuit  has acknowledged, the alleged venture can be a  'commercial venture' like running or expanding a  business. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22-2621,  2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *6  (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023) (citing Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21  F.4th at 727 (emphasis added)). However, as before,  ""[t]he 'participation' in the sex trafficking venture is  essentially that the franchisor and the hotel operator did  not fight hard enough to [*11]  keep these traffickers  from using their hotel. The Complaint acknowledges that  Defendants  opposed  sex  traffickers,  but  fault  defendants for taking ineffective steps to curtail the  traffickers. This hardly sounds like participating in a  venture."" A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 67832, [WL] at *5. The Court finds that Choice Hotels must be dismissed  because the Second Amended Complaint does not  sufficiently plead that it participated in a sex trafficking  venture beyond participation in shared revenue as part  of its normal role as a franchisor. Red Roof Inns, Inc.,  21 F.4th at 726-27 (""These allegations may suggest that  the franchisors financially benefitted from renting hotel  rooms to the Does' sex traffickers. But they do nothing  to show that the franchisors participated in a common  undertaking involving risk or profit that violated the  TVPRA—i.e., the alleged sex trafficking ventures.""). C. Participation in Venture - Franchisee ""In order to plead Defendants participated in a venture,  Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court could  reasonably infer the hotels 'could be said to have a tacit  agreement' with the trafficker. Plaintiff need not show  that  defendants  had  actual  knowledge  of  the  participation in the sex-trafficking venture."" Doe v.  Rickey Patel, LLC, No. 0:20-60683-WPD-CIV, 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (S.D.  Fla. Sept. 30, 2020) (citation omitted). In other  words, [*12]  plaintiff can show a ""continuous business  relationship"" to show participation. J.G. v. Northbrook  Indus., Inc., 619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1235 (N.D. Ga.  2022); S.Y. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 519 F.  Supp. 3d 1069, 1081 (M.D. Fla. 2021). As to R&M Real Estate, the 'participation' is based upon  the personal relationship between staff and the  traffickers, and direct employee encounters with A.D.  and Trafficker 21 inside the Quality Inn. (Doc. #47, ¶¶  99, 107.) Trafficker 2 kept A.D. confined to her room  and the procession of men was open and obvious to  anyone working at the Quality Inn. (Id. at ¶ 97.)  Trafficker 2 gave the housekeeper $100 to keep quiet  about seeing a gun, $10,000 in cash, and drugs while  cleaning the room. (Id. at ¶ 99.) ""Through the R&M  Defendants and Choice's continuous business venture  of renting hotel rooms, which were used for trafficking  A.D. at the Quality Inn hotel, the R&M Defendants  knowingly benefited or received something of value from  activity that its facilitation of or participation in a venture  which it knew or should have known had violated the  TVPRA through the rental of rooms where A.D. was  trafficked."" (Id. at ¶ 109.) These facts at least plausibly infer that employees of the  Quality Inn were participating in an enterprise involving  risk and knowingly benefiting from the risk. Red Roof  Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 725 (citing Ricchio v. McLean, 853  F.3d 553, 556-58 (1st Cir. 2017) (agreeing with [*13]   First Circuit that an operator's association with  traffickers to serve a business objective establishes  participation in a venture with a sex trafficker). D. Knowledge This element requires the plaintiff to allege that the  defendant had either actual or constructive knowledge  that the venture violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff.  Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Knowledge requires an  awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance,  while constructive knowledge is knowledge that one  should have 'using reasonable care or diligence'. Id.  (citing Black's Law Dictionary). The 'red flags' supporting knowledge include payments  in cash, large amounts of used condoms and bodily  fluids on the sheets and towels, A.D.'s physical  appearance, excessive requests for sheets and cleaning  services, the personal relationship with staff and A.D.'s  trafficker, and the direct employee encounters with A.D.  and her trafficker inside the Quality Inn. (Doc. #47, ¶  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150397, *10 Page 5 of 5 99.) R&M Real Estate employees and staff openly  observed signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. (Id.  at ¶ 106.) The Court finds these facts are sufficient to plausibly  allege knowledge at this stage of the proceedings. An  overt or direct act is not required. See, e.g., [*14]  K.H.  v. Riti, Inc., No. 1:22-CV-3404-MHC, 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 93374, 2023 WL 3644224, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Apr.  17, 2023) (collecting cases of direct association  between hotel and trafficker); J.C. v. I Shri Khodiyar,  LLC, 624 F. Supp. 3d 1307, 1318 (N.D. Ga. 2022)  (Plaintiff claims that her daughter was forced to have  sex with Defendant's employees); J.G. v. Northbrook  Indus., Inc., 619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1239 (N.D. Ga.  2022) (employees acted as lookouts for Plaintiff's  traffickers). Accordingly, it is now ORDERED: 1. Defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc.'s  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended  Complaint (Doc. #53) is GRANTED and defendant  is dismissed with prejudice. 2. Defendant R & M Real Estate Company, Inc.,  Robert Vocisano, and Mario Vocisano's Motion to  Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint  (Doc. #54) is DENIED.

"Bonestroo v. United States, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161576","ORDER INTRODUCTION Movant, Ronald Bonestroo, a federal inmate at the Petersburg Low Federal Correctional Institution in Petersburg,  Virginia, has filed a pro se motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. This  matter was referred to this magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A) & (B) and the October 16, 2014,  standing order of the Honorable Karen E. Schreier, district judge. FACTS Mr. Bonestroo was found guilty by a jury of attempted commercial sex trafficking of a child on November 8, 2011.  The district court granted Mr. Bonestroo's motion for acquittal on January 4, 2012. The government appealed and  on January 7, 2013, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for reinstatement of the  jury verdict and imposition of sentence. Mr. Bonestroo filed a petition for writ of certiorari on June 11, 2013. Mr.  Bonestroo was sentenced on June 17, 2013, to 120 months' imprisonment and a 5 year term of supervised  Page 2 of 3   release. [*2]  On October 18, 2013, the United States Supreme Court denied the petition for a writ of certiorari. Mr.  Bonestroo filed this 2255 action over three years later, on November 16, 2016. DISCUSSION A. Review of Mr. Bonestroo's Motion Pursuant to Rule 4 Rule 4(b) of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases states in pertinent part: The judge who receives the motion must promptly examine it. If it plainly appears from the motion, any  attached exhibits, and the record of prior proceedings that the moving party is not entitled to relief, the judge  must dismiss the motion and direct the clerk to notify the moving party. If the motion is not dismissed, the judge  must order the United States attorney to file an answer, motion, or other response within a fixed time, or to take  other action the judge may order. This Court's preliminary review, required by Rule 4, reveals that Mr. Bonestroo's pending § 2255 motion may be  barred by the statute of limitations. B. Statute of Limitations Governing Section 2255 motions Section 2255 of Title 28 of the United States Code provides, in relevant part, as follows: (a) A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be  released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United  States, or that the [*3]  court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in  excess of the maximum authority authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the  court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence. 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a). As the above text illustrates, a § 2255 motion is available only to prisoners in federal custody  and must be brought in the same court that imposed the sentence now under challenge. Id. There is a one-year statute of limitations relevant to Section 2255 motions: (f) A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section. The limitation period shall run from  the latest of— (1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final; (2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by governmental action in violation of the  Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from making a motion  by such governmental action; (3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has  been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral  review; or (4) the date on which the facts supporting [*4]  the claim or claims presented could have been discovered  through the exercise of due diligence. See 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f). Motions under § 2255 are subject to a one-year statute of limitation that runs from the latest of four specified dates.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f). Only one is relevant here-""the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.""  2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161576, *1 Page 3 of 3   Id. A judgment is deemed final ""where the judgment of conviction was rendered, the availability of appeal  exhausted, and the time for petition for certiorari had elapsed [or a petition for certiorari finally denied...]."" United  States v. Johnson, 457 U.S. 537, 543, n. 8, 102 S. Ct. 2579, 73 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1982) (citation omitted); see also  Clay v. United States, 537 U.S. 522, 527, 123 S. Ct. 1072, 155 L. Ed. 2d 88 (2003) (for the purpose of starting §  2255's one-year limitation period, ""[f]inality attaches when [the Supreme] Court affirms a conviction on the merits on  direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.""). The  time for filing a petition for certiorari is 90 days after entry of the court of appeals' judgment. Clay, 537 U.S. at 525. In Mr. Bonestroo's case, the statute of limitations began to run on October 18, 2013 (the date the Supreme Court  denied his petition for certiorari), and he had until October 18, 2014, to file a § 2255 motion. See 28 U.S.C. §  2255(f). Mr. Bonestroo did not file his § 2255 motion until November 16, 2016. His [*5]  motion is clearly time-barred  unless equitable tolling applies. In the Eighth Circuit, the doctrine of equitable tolling has been extended to § 2255 motions. United States v. Martin,  408 F.3d 1089, 1092 (8th Cir. 2005). Equitable tolling is an extraordinary remedy used only in rare circumstances  and ""affords the otherwise time-barred petitioner an exceedingly narrow window of relief."" Jihad v. Hvass, 267 F.3d  803, 805 (8th Cir. 2001); United States v. Riggs, 314 F.3d 796, 799 (5th Cir. 2002). ""[A]ny invocation of equity to  relieve the strict application of a statute of limitations must be guarded and infrequent, lest circumstances of  individualized hardship supplant the rules of clearly drafted statutes.'"" Jihad, 267 F.3d at 806 (quoting Harris v.  Hutchinson, 209 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir. 2000)). Equitable tolling is only applicable in two instances: ""(1) if there are extraordinary circumstances' beyond a movant's  control that would keep him from filing in a timely fashion or (2) if the government's conduct 'lulled' the movant into  inaction through reliance on that conduct."" United States v. Hernandez, 436 F.3d 851, 858 (8th Cir. 2006) (internal  citations omitted). ""Equitable tolling only applies when the circumstances that cause the delay in filing are 'external  to the plaintiff and not attributable to his actions.'"" Id. at 858 (citing Maghee v. Ault, 410 F.3d 473, 476 (8th Cir.  2005)) (additional citation omitted). Further, [t]he petitioner must also demonstrate that he acted with due diligence  in pursuing his [§ 2255] petition."" E.J.R.E. v. United States, 453 F.3d 1094, 1097 (8th Cir. 2006).",1
"United States v. Lacey, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3423","WO ORDER Pending before the Court is Defendants' Joint Motion to Dismiss Indictment for Grand Jury Abuse or, in the  Alternative, for Disclosure of Grand Jury Transcripts. (Doc. 782, ""Mot."" or ""Motion"".) The Government responded  and Defendants replied. (Doc. 812, ""Resp.""; Doc. 826, ""Repl."".) Defendants requested oral argument, but the Court  elects to resolve the Motion without it. See LRCiv 7.2(f). Defendants move to dismiss the indictment because the  grand jury process was ""unconstitutionally tainted,"" or alternatively, for ""the disclosure of the grand jury transcripts  so that the Defendants and the Court can examine the government's actions before the grand jury."" (Mot. at 8; see  Repl. at 6.) Having considered the parties' briefings, the superseding indictment, (Doc. 230, ""SI""), and pertinent  case law, the Court denies Defendants' Motion as explained below. I. BACKGROUND The grand jury initially returned a 93-count indictment against Defendants on March 28, 2018. [*4]  (Doc. 3.)  Roughly five months later, it returned a 100-count superseding indictment against them. (Doc. 230, ""SI"".) The SI  charges conspiracy (Count 1), facilitating prostitution under the Travel Act (Counts 2-51), conspiracy to commit  money laundering (Count 52), concealment of money laundering (Count 53-62), international promotion of money  laundering (Count 63-68), transactional money laundering (Counts 69-99), and international concealment of money  laundering (Count 100) against Defendants. (See generally id.) Defendants now move to dismiss the SI in its  entirety for grand jury abuse, or alternatively, for disclosure of the grand jury's transcripts. (Mot. at 8.) II. LEGAL STANDARD ""[T]he grand jury is deeply rooted in Anglo-American history."" United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 342, 94 S.  Ct. 613, 38 L. Ed. 2d 561 (1974); see Costello v.

It exists to ""determin[e] whether there is probable cause to believe a crime has been  committed"" and to ""protect[] . . . citizens against unfounded criminal prosecutions."" Calandra, 414 U.S. at 343. ""The  grand jury proceeding is accorded a presumption of regularity, which generally may be dispelled only upon  particularized proof of irregularities in the grand jury process."" United States v. Mechanik, 475 U.S. 66, 75, 106 S.  Ct. 938, 89 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1986) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring); see also Costello, 350 U.S. at 363 (""An indictment  returned by a legally constituted [*5]  and unbiased grand jury, . . . if valid on its face, is enough to call for trial of the  charge on the merits. The Fifth Amendment requires nothing more[]""); see also United States v. R. Enters, Inc., 498  U.S. 292, 300, 111 S. Ct. 722, 112 L. Ed. 2d 795 (1991) (noting how ""the law presumes, absent a showing to the  contrary, that a grand jury acts within the legitimate scope of its authority""). A. Dismissing Indictment for Error in Grand Jury Proceedings ""[A]s a general matter, a district court may not dismiss an indictment for errors in grand jury proceedings unless  such errors prejudiced the defendants."" Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U.S. 250, 254, 108 S. Ct. 2369,  101 L. Ed. 2d 228 (1988). In line with this, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a)'s harmless error inquiry  Page 3 of 7   requires federal courts disregard errors, defects, irregularities, or variances not affecting substantial rights. See  Mechanik, 475 U.S. at 70-72 (finding post-trial refusal to dismiss indictment for Rule 6(d) violation because error  rendered harmless after guilty verdict). ""[T]here is 'no reason not to apply [Rule 52(a)] to errors, defects,  irregularities, or variances occurring before a grand jury[.]'"" Bank of Nova Scotia, 487 U.S. at 255 (quoting  Mechanik, 475 U.S. at 71-72). When ""a court is asked to dismiss an indictment prior to the conclusion of the trial, . . . dismissal of the indictment is  appropriate only 'if it is established that the violation substantially influenced the grand jury's decision to indict,' or if  there is 'grave doubt' that [*6]  the decision to indict was free from the substantial influence of such violations."" Bank  of Nova Scotia, 487 U.S. at 256 (emphasis added) (quoting Mechanik, 475 U.S. at 78 (O'CONNOR, J.,  concurring)). ""[Bank of Nova Scotia's 'grave doubts'] standard does not 'circumvent the harmless-error inquiry  prescribed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a),' because it requires the defendant[s] suffer prejudice.""

""Dismissal of an indictment is required only in flagrant cases in which  the grand jury has been overreached or deceived in some significant way, as where perjured testimony has  knowingly been presented[.]"" Samango, 607 F.2d at 882 (quoting United States v. Thompson, 576 F.2d 784, 786  (9th Cir. 1978)). In evaluating whether to dismiss, a court may not look beyond the indictment to determine if the evidence upon  which it was based is sufficient.  [*7] See Costello, 350 U.S. at 363; see also United States v. Lunstedt, 997 F.2d  665, 667 (9th Cir. 1993) (""A district court cannot grant a motion to dismiss an indictment if the motion is  substantially founded upon and intertwined with evidence concerning the alleged offense"" (citations and internal  quotations omitted)).

Disclosing Grand Jury Transcripts The longstanding cornerstone of the grand jury is that ""[i]t deliberates in secret and may determine alone the course  of its inquiry.""

Not even a judge presides to monitor its proceedings.  Calandra, 414 U.S. at 343. ""This 'indispensable secrecy of grand jury proceedings,' must not be broken except  where there is a compelling necessity"" that is ""shown with particularity."" United States v. Procter & Gamble Co, 356  U.S. 677, 682, 78 S. Ct. 983, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1077 (1958) (internal citation omitted). ""To allow the intrusion . . . into the  indispensable secrecy of grand jury proceedings—as important for the protection of the innocent as for the pursuit  of the guilty—would subvert the functions of federal grand juries [*8]  by all sorts of devices . . . such as ready resort  to inspection of grand jury minutes."" Johnson, 319 U.S. at 513. The Supreme Court has acknowledged numerous public policy principles justifying the secrecy of grand jury  proceedings:    Page 4 of 7   (1) To prevent the escape of those whose indictment may be contemplated; (2) to insure the utmost freedom to  the grand jury in its deliberations, and to prevent persons subject to indictment or their friends from importuning  the grand jurors; (3) to prevent subornation of perjury or tampering with the witnesses who may testify before  [the] grand jury and later appear at the trial of those indicted by it; (4) to encourage free and untrammeled  disclosures by persons who have information with respect to the commission of crimes; (5) to protect innocent  accused who is exonerated from disclosure of the fact that he has been under investigation, and from the  expense of standing trial where there was no probability of guilt. Douglas Oil Co. of Cal. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 441 U.S. 211, 219 n.10, 99 S. Ct. 1667, 60 L. Ed. 2d 156 (1979)  (citing Procter & Gamble Co., 356 U.S. at 681-82, n.6 (quoting United States v. Rose, 215 F.2d 617, 628-29 (3rd  Cir. 1964))). Nevertheless, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(3)(E)(ii) permits the Court to authorize disclosure of grand  jury transcripts ""at the request of a defendant who shows that a ground may exist to dismiss the indictment because  of a matter that occurred before the grand jury."" The Supreme Court [*9]  has articulated a three-part analysis for  this disclosure: ""[p]arties seeking grand jury transcripts under Rule 6(e) must show that the material they seek is  needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial proceeding, that the need for disclosure is greater than the  need for continued secrecy, and that their request is structured to cover only material so needed."" Douglas Oil Co.  of Cal., 441 U.S. at 222. This showing must be made even if the grand jury whose transcripts are sought has  ""ended its activities."" Id. And ""[m]ere 'unsubstantiated, speculative assertions of improprieties in the proceedings' do  not supply the 'particular need' required to outweigh the policy of grand jury secrecy."" United States v. Ferreboeuf,  632 F.2d 832, 835 (9th Cir. 1980) (citation omitted). III. ANALYSIS A. Dismissing the Superseding Indictment for Vague and Speculative Grand Jury Abuse Based on  Evidentiary Disputes is Unwarranted. Defendants argue dismissal is appropriate because the SI ""reveals three separate ways in which the government  abused the grand jury process."" (Mot. at 9.) They argue it ""[(1)] recklessly, explosively, and irrelevantly accuses  Defendants of engaging in child sex trafficking . . . [(2)] materially misrepresents key documentary evidence . . .  [and] [(3)] makes clear that [*10]  the government incorrectly and/or incompletely instructed the grand jury regarding  the applicable law."" (Id.) Because the SI somehow shows these three things, Defendants essentially argue the  Government must have abused the grand jury process. (See id. (""The totality of these misrepresentations of fact  and law leaves no doubt that the government abused the grand jury process [under the 'grave doubts' standard]"");  see also Repl. at 6.) As a general matter, the Government claims Defendants have not met their ""heavy burden of showing irregularities  in the Grand Jury proceedings,"" (Resp. at 6 (""Defendants ""cherry-pick paragraphs from the SI and juxtapose them  with reports of interviews in a futile effort to show that the Grand Jury was prejudiced and misled[]"")), and that the  proper forum for their disagreements about ""certain items of evidence"" is trial—not on a motion to dismiss, (see  generally id. at 9-12).        Page 5 of 7   The Court agrees with the Government that Defendants have failed to meet the heavy burden of overcoming the  presumption of regularity in grand jury proceedings to foreclose the possibility of a trial on the merits. See Bank of  Nova Scotia, 487 U.S. at 256; see also Mechanik, 475 U.S. at 75. Defendants make no particularized or non- speculative [*11]  showing of any way in which the grand jury process was abused by the Government that  warrants the extraordinary remedy of dismissal. See Bank of Nova Scotia, 487 U.S. at 256. Defendants claim the  SI's allegations of child sex trafficking are irrelevant, (Mot. at 9-12), is clearly incorrect. Defendants' knowledge  relating to child sex trafficking or juvenile prostitution on Backpage is relevant to six charged counts as well as  their mens rea. The Government's inclusion of these allegations is also not overly prejudicial to Defendants'  opportunity for a fair trial. Without Defendants even identifying an actual violation during grand jury proceedings,  there is no reason to believe Defendants were prejudiced. Nevertheless, Defendants ask the Court to speculate on  post-hoc interpretations of selected references in the SI and find that the Government must have abused the grand  jury process. There is no reasonable inference that this is the case here, and Defendants' arguments are  insufficient to simply toss out the historically defined province of a grand jury's probable cause determination. See  Calandra, 414 U.S. at 342. Again, Defendants highlight no specific conduct during the grand jury proceedings and  also do not argue any structural error at [*12]  grand jury proceeding requires dismissing the indictment. See  Navarro, 608 F.3d at 538. The Court refuses to find such a strong presumption of regularity in grand jury  proceedings to be overcome by such vague and speculative showings. Additionally, Defendants' disagreements with the Government's representation of evidence in the SI does not  warrant preemptively shutting the doors of a possible trial. See Costello, 350 U.S. at 363; see also Lunstedt, 997  F.2d at 667. Many of Defendants' arguments are necessarily ""founded upon and intertwined with evidence  concerning the alleged offense[s]."" Lunstedt, 997 F.2d at 667. For instance, Defendants attach about 120 pages of  disputed evidentiary exhibits to their Motion in arguing that they inadequately support the grand jury's decision to  indict. (See Docs. 782-1, 782-2, and 782-3.) The Court has reviewed these exhibits in light of Defendants'  allegations and finds their allegations to be a matter of interpretation reserved for trial. For example, Defendants  allege the Government ""misrepresented the evidence to the grand jury,"" (Mot. at 13), regarding ""plausible  deniability"" and what it means, (id. at 14). After reviewing the supporting documents in this case, the Court finds a  juror could interpret that clause in numerous ways. In any event, this [*13]  allegation is inappropriately brought  under the guise of asserting grand jury abuse. Lunstedt, 997 F.2d at 667. In another example, Defendants allege no  evidence supports the SI's allegation that ""some banks closed accounts that were held by Backpage out of concern  the accounts were being used for illegal purposes."" (Id. at 15.) In truth, a plethora of evidence does supports that  statement in the SI. These factual disputes are properly reserved for trial and fail to support dismissing an  indictment. See Costello, 350 U.S. at 363 (""If indictments were to be held open to challenge on the ground that  there was inadequate or incompetent evidence before the grand jury, the resulting delay would be great indeed.  The result of such a rule would be that before trial on the merits a defendant could always insist on a kind of  preliminary trial to determine the competency and adequacy of the evidence before the grand jury."") The Court will  not engage in such a preliminary trial for Defendants and intrude upon the grand jury's province absent a more  particularized showing. Accordingly, this Court finds Defendants have not established a violation during grand jury proceedings (let alone  sufficiently identify one) substantially influenced the grand jury's [*14]  decision to indict or that there is grave doubt  its decision to indict was free from substantial influence of such (unidentified) violation. See Bank of Nova Scotia,  487 U.S. at 256. Defendants' factual disputes about evidence are also inappropriately resolved here on a motion to  dismiss. Their speculative and attenuated arguments about grand jury abuse without identifying a prejudicial  violation are unavailing considering the strong presumption of regularity accorded to grand jury proceedings. B. Disclosing Grand Jury Transcripts and/or Instructions is Inappropriate Because Defendants Have Not  Shown a Ground May Exist to Dismiss the Indictment.  Page 6 of 7   Defendants alternatively argue the Court should disclose the grand jury transcripts and/or instructions under  Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(3)(E)(ii) so they can ""examine . . . and determine what occurred before the  grand jury."" (Mot. at 22.) They argue disclosure is appropriate because the Government abused the grand jury  process, Jencks, Giglio, and/or Brady warrant disclosure, and that the secrecy of the grand jury's proceedings is no  longer important here. (Id. at 21-22; Repl. at 14-15.) At a minimum, they claim they are ""entitled to the legal  instructions provided to the grand jury and any colloquy between the grand jurors and the prosecutors [*15]   regarding the applicable law."" (Mot. at 21 n.6.) The Government claims ""Defendants have not met their burden of demonstrating the particularized, specific need  for grand jury materials required by Douglas Oil."" (Resp. at 15.) It claims their request to disclose grand jury  transcripts and/or instructions should be denied because it would ""enable Defendants to 'engage in a fishing  expedition in hopes of uncovering an impropriety or defect in the proceeding where they have no basis to conclude  that an impropriety or defect exists."" (Id.) As discussed at length above, the Court finds that Defendants' arguments that the grand jury process was abused  do not warrant dismissing the superseding indictment. As a result of this finding, the Court cannot authorize  disclosure of the grand jury materials because Defendants have not ""show[n] a ground may exist to dismiss the  indictment because of a matter that occurred before the grand jury."" Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(E)(ii). In other words,  Defendants have identified no compelling reason with any sort of particularity worthy of breaching the secrecy of the  grand jury. See Procter & Gamble Co., 356 U.S. at 682; see also Johnson, 319 U.S. at 513. Without a showing that  a ground may exist to dismiss the indictment for grand jury abuse, disclosure [*16]  of grand jury transcripts is  unavailable by Rule 6(e)'s text. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(E)(ii). Furthermore, and contrary to Defendants' assertion that the secrecy of the grand jury is no longer relevant here, the  Court finds Rule 6(e)'s considerations and standard for disclosure discussed in Douglas Oil informative. See id.,  441 U.S. at 219. With these considerations in mind, the Court finds Defendants' bare assertions that the grand jury  proceedings ""must have been improper"" not persuasive enough to establish that the secrecy of the grand jury is  less important than the need for disclosure. See id. (""parties seeking grand jury transcripts under Rule 6(e) must  show . . . that the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy[.]"") The Court also finds  Defendants' request for ""disclosure of all grand jury transcripts"" extraordinarily overbroad. See id. (""parties seeking  grand jury transcripts under Rule 6(e) must show . . . that their request is structured to cover only material so  needed."") Lastly, Defendants do not argue any specific aspect of the grand jury proceedings must be disclosed to  avoid a possible injustice. Not only is no particular aspect identified, as noted, but they also do not identify any  potential prejudice. Lastly, Defendants [*17]  are not ""entitled to the legal instructions provided to the grand jury and any colloquy  between the grand jurors and the prosecutors."" See United States v. Stephanyan, No. CR 15-0234 CRB (JSC),  2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110280, 2016 WL 4398281, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 28, 2016) (""Defendant's insistence that . . .  no 'particularized need' is required for disclosure of the government's instructions to the grand jury is wrong."").  Having found no particularized need for disclosing the grand jury transcripts, the Court will not order disclosure of  these grand jury items either. Accordingly, Defendants have failed to show that a ground may exist to dismiss the SI and similarly failed to provide  a compelling and particularized need for disclosure of the grand jury transcripts and/or instructions that trumps the  secrecy of the grand jury's deliberations.",0
"Baston v. United States, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120812","REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF MAGISTRATE JUDGE I. Introduction This matter is before the Court on Movant's amended pro se motion to vacate, filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255,  attacking the constitutionality of his conviction and sentence entered following a jury verdict in Case No. 13-CR- 20914-ALTONAGA. Movant was convicted of numerous crimes relating to sex trafficking and prostitution, false  Page 2 of 11   statements in use of a passport, aggravated identity theft, reentry of a removed alien, and money laundering, in  violation of various federal statutes. (See Cr-DE#7). This cause has been referred to the undersigned for consideration and report pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B),  (C); S.D. Fla. Local Rule 1(f) governing Magistrate Judges; S.D. Fla. Admin. Order 2019-02; and Rules 8 and 10  Governing Section 2255 Cases in the United States District Courts. The Court has reviewed Movant's amended motion, signed under the penalty of perjury, and his amended  memorandum of law, not signed under the penalty [*2]  of perjury (Cv-DE#7, 7-1); the government's response and  exhibits (Cv-DE#9); all pertinent portions of the underlying criminal file, including the hearing, trial, and sentencing  transcripts; and the Eleventh Circuit's opinion affirming Movant's conviction and sentence. II. Claims Construing the § 2255 motion liberally as afforded pro se litigants, pursuant to Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 92  S. Ct. 594, 30 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1972), Movant raises the following claims alleging ineffective assistance of counsel: 1. Counsel was ineffective because he slept during the majority of Movant's trial. (Cv-DE#s 7:4; 7-1:1, 4-5). 2. Movant raises several claims involving Juror N.A. as violative of his right to an impartial jury, which are  sufficiently related to address together: a. Counsel failed to have N.A. removed as a juror because she was biased against Movant. b. Counsel failed to move for a mistrial based on N.A.'s admitted bias against Movant. c. After the court removed N.A. as a juror, she continued to deliberate with the jury without authorization. d. Counsel failed to seek a curative instruction for the jury following N.A.'s removal and substitution with an  alternate juror. (Cv-DE#s 7:4, 6-7; 7-1:5-9). 3. Counsel caused Movant to wear prison garb ""during the first [*3]  week and a half of the trial"" because  Movant did not meet counsel's demand for $30,000. (Cv-DE#s 7:4, 8; 7-1:9-11). 4. Counsel failed to raise the issue of trial court error in allowing the government to introduce uncharged crimes  into evidence at trial. (Cv-DE#s 7:13; 7-1:11-12). Movant requests that this Court vacate, set aside or correct his sentence, and any other relief deemed proper. (Cv- DE#s 7:12; 7-1:13). Upon careful and thorough review, for the reasons stated within this Report, all of Movant's claims fail on the merits  and should be DENIED. III. Facts of the Offense            2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120812, *1 Page 3 of 11   The Eleventh Circuit summarized the facts in United States v. Baston, 818 F.3d 651 (11th Cir. 2016), cert. den'd.,  137 S. Ct. 850, 197 L. Ed. 2d 478 (Mar. 6, 2017). Movant, an immigrant to the United States, was convicted of an  aggravated felony and ordered removed in 1998. Id. at 657. Movant illegally re-entered the United States by using  an assumed identity he purchased. Id. Under this assumed name, he opened bank accounts, started businesses,  rented apartments, and obtained a driver's license and a United States passport. Id. Movant funded a lavish lifestyle  as an international sex trafficker forcing numerous women to prostitute for him. Id. Several of Movant's victims  testified about how they met him, the progression of [*4]  their relationships, and how Movant ""used violence and  coercion to force them into prostitution."" Id. at 659. IV. Relevant Procedural History A. Indictment Movant was charged in a 21-count, superseding indictment with (Count 1) sex trafficking by force, fraud, and  coercion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a)(1), (b)(1) and 1596; (Counts 2 and 3) sex trafficking by force, fraud,  and coercion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1) and (b)(1); (Count 4) importation of an alien for prostitution, in  violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1328; (Counts 5 through 9) transportation of individual for prostitution, in violation of 18  U.S.C. § 2421; (Count 10) false statement in use of a passport, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1542; (Count 11)  aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1); (Count 12) reentry of removed alien, in violation of  8 U.S.C. § 1326(a) and (b)(2); and (Counts 13 through 21) laundering of monetary instruments, in violation of 18  U.S.C. § 1956. (Cr-DE#36). For his crimes, Movant faced a maximum penalty of life in prison for Counts 1 through 3, with a mandatory  minimum sentence of 15 years; ten years in prison for Counts 4 through 10; a mandatory two-year sentence for  Count 11; and 20 years in prison for Counts 12 through 21. (Id. at 14-15). B. Trial, Sentencing, and Appeal Movant asserted his right to a jury trial, which lasted for ten days. At the closing of [*5]  the government's case,  counsel motioned for a judgment of acquittal and argued the government did ""not [sustain] its burden of going  forward on the indictment as a whole"" and that, as to each count, the evidence was insufficient. (Cr-DE#151:259- 262). The court denied the motion. (Id. at 267). After the court's colloquy, Movant testified on his own behalf on  three separate days. (Cr-DE#s 152:41-210, 153:3-322, and 154:3-118). On the final day of trial, counsel renewed  his motion for a directed verdict, which was denied. (Cr-DE#154:207). A unanimous jury returned a guilty verdict as  to all 21 counts. (Cr-DE#95; Cr-DE#155:21-23). At sentencing, the court found that Movant committed perjury at trial adding a two-level enhancement for  obstruction of justice: The issue is whether or not the defendant in testifying at his trial...so committed perjury that this two-level  enhancement should apply. And this is one of those cases where the level and amount of falsehoods uttered  during the defendant's testimony are so significant that the two-level enhancement is, indeed, appropriate and  he should receive that... the defendant's testimony contained material falsehoods. (Cr-DE#156:12). Still, the court varied [*6]  downward and sentenced Movant to 324 months in prison, followed by a  life-time term of supervised release. (Cr-DE#130; see also sentencing transcript at Cr-DE#147:23). Movant filed a direct appeal and raised several arguments including challenging the sufficiency of the evidence.  United States v. Baston, 818 F.3d at 660. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed Movant's conviction and sentence, found  merit in the government's cross-appeal for the refusal to award one of Movant's victims increased restitution, and  remanded the case with instructions to increase the amount of restitution for the victim's prostitution in Australia.  Id. at 657, 671. 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120812, *3 Page 4 of 11   The Supreme Court of the United States denied certiorari on March 6, 2017. Finally, on January 11, 2018, Movant  timely filed an initial federal habeas petition (Cv-DE#1), which he subsequently amended. (Cv-DE#7). The following  day, trial counsel died. (Cv-DE#9-2). V. Threshold Issue - Timeliness Parties, correctly, do not dispute that Movant's federal habeas petition is timely filed. VI. Applicable Law A. Standard of Review of Section 2255 Motions Section 2255 states in relevant part that ""[a] prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of  Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence [*7]  was imposed in violation of the  Constitution...may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside, or correct the sentence."" 28  U.S.C. § 2255. Because collateral review is not a substitute for direct appeal, the grounds for collateral attack on final judgments  pursuant to § 2255 are extremely limited. A prisoner is entitled to relief under § 2255 if the court imposed a  sentence that (1) violated the Constitution or laws of the United States, (2) exceeded its jurisdiction, (3) exceeded  the maximum authorized by law, or (4) is otherwise subject to collateral attack. See 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a); McKay v.  United States, 657 F.3d 1190, 1194 n.8 (11th Cir. 2011). ""Relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 'is reserved for  transgressions of constitutional rights and for that narrow compass of other injury that could not have been raised in  direct appeal and would, if condoned, result in a complete miscarriage of justice.'"" Lynn v. United States, 365 F.3d  1225, 1232 (11th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted). The ""fundamental miscarriage of justice"" exception recognized in  Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496, 106 S. Ct. 2639, 91 L. Ed. 2d 397 (1986), provides that it must be shown that  the alleged constitutional violation ""has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent..."" The Eleventh Circuit promulgated a two-part inquiry that a district court must consider before determining whether a  movant's claim is cognizable. First, a district [*8]  court must find that ""a defendant assert[ed] all available claims on  direct appeal."" United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 102 S. Ct. 1584, 71 L. Ed. 2d 816 (1982); McCoy v. United  States, 266 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir. 2001); Mills v. United States, 36 F.3d 1052, 1055 (11th Cir. 1994). Second,  a district court must consider whether the type of relief the movant seeks is appropriate under § 2255. This is  because ""[r]elief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is reserved for transgressions of constitutional rights and for that narrow  compass of other injury that could not have been raised in direct appeal and would, if condoned, result in a  complete miscarriage of justice."" Lynn, 365 F.3d at 1232-33 (quoting Richards v. United States, 837 F.2d 965, 966  (11th Cir. 1988) (internal quotations omitted)). If a court finds a claim under § 2255 to be valid, the court ""shall vacate and set the judgment aside and shall  discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.""  28 U.S.C. § 2255. To obtain this relief on collateral review, a petitioner must ""clear a significantly higher hurdle than  would exist on direct appeal."" Frady, 456 U.S. at 166 (rejecting the plain error standard as not sufficiently  deferential to a final judgment). Under § 2255, unless ""the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively  show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief,"" the court shall ""grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues      2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120812, *6 Page 5 of 11   and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto."" [*9]  However, ""if the record refutes the  applicant's factual allegations or otherwise precludes habeas relief, a district court is not required to hold an  evidentiary hearing."" Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465, 474, 127 S. Ct. 1933, 167 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2007). See also  Aron v. United States, 291 F.3d 708, 715 (11th Cir. 2002) (explaining that no evidentiary hearing is needed when a  petitioner's claims are ""affirmatively contradicted by the record"" or ""patently frivolous""). B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Principles To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a habeas petitioner must demonstrate both (1) that  counsel's performance was deficient, and (2) a reasonable probability that the deficient performance prejudiced the  defense. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 694, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984); Harrington v.  Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 104, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624 (2011). If the movant cannot meet one of Strickland's  prongs, the court does not need to address the other prong. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697. To show counsel's performance was unreasonable, a defendant must establish that ""no competent counsel would  have taken the action that his counsel did take."" Gordon v. United States, 518 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir. 2008)  (citations omitted); Chandler v. United States, 218 F.3d 1305, 1315 (11th Cir. 2000). To establish prejudice, the  movant must establish that, but for counsel's deficient performance, the outcome of the proceeding would have  been different. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. For the court to focus merely on ""outcome determination,"" however, is  insufficient; ""[t]o set aside a conviction or sentence solely because [*10]  the outcome would have been different but  for counsel's error may grant the defendant a windfall to which the law does not entitle him."" Lockhart v. Fretwell,  506 U.S. 364, 369-70, 113 S. Ct. 838, 122 L. Ed. 2d 180 (1993); Allen v. Sec'y, Fla. Dep't of Corr., 611 F.3d 740,  754 (11th Cir. 2010). A defendant, therefore, must establish ""that counsel's errors were so serious as to deprive the  defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable."" Lockhart, 506 U.S. at 369 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at  687). When counsel decides not to raise a meritless claim, it is not ineffective assistance. United States v. Winfield, 960  F.2d 970, 974 (11th Cir. 1992). ""And a petitioner would also not be prejudiced by his counsel's failure to do so.""  Hittson v. GDCP Warden, 759 F.3d 1210, 1262 (11th Cir. 2014). VII. Discussion As discussed herein, the motion, the files, and records of the case conclusively show that Movant is not entitled to  federal habeas relief. A. Claim 1 Counsel Was Not Ineffective for Falling Asleep During Trial Because the Record Contradicts Movant's Claim In Claim 1, Movant claims that counsel was ineffective for falling asleep during trial. (Cv-DE#1:5-9). The § 2255  motion is bereft of any factual support for the claim. (Id.). The government asserts that this claim was previously  addressed and resolved following the jury verdict and before sentencing where, under oath, Movant admitted that  his claim that counsel was asleep during trial was false. (Cv-DE#9:8-10). The government points out that  Movant [*11]  ""has a perjury problem."" (Id. at 10). Movant's claim fails. ""[I]f counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing, then there has been a  denial of Sixth Amendment rights that makes the adversary process itself presumptively unreliable."" United States  v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 104 S. Ct. 2039, 80 L. Ed. 2d 657 (1984); United States v. Russell, 205 F.3d 768, 770-71  (5th Cir. 2000). Accordingly, prejudice is presumed when ""counsel is repeatedly unconscious through not  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120812, *8 Page 6 of 11   insubstantial portions"" of a trial. Burdine v. Johnson, 262 F.3d 336, 341 (5th Cir. 2001) (relying on Cronic, 466 U.S.  at 659 (1984)). Here, following the verdict, Movant filed a pro se letter amounting to a motion for mistrial. (Cr-DE#101). Movant  claimed, inter alia, ineffective assistance of counsel alleging his counsel fell asleep multiple times over the course of  the proceedings. (Id. at 2). The court denied Movant's motion pursuant to S.D. Fla. Loc. R. 7.7, since he was  represented by counsel. (Cr-DE#102; Cv-DE#9-1:3). Nonetheless, the court held a hearing addressing the letter  and counsel's motion for new trial. (Cv-DE#9-1). Counsel confirmed he remained as Movant's counsel and stated  that Movant wanted to withdraw his motion. (Id. at 3-4). The court questioned Movant whether his complaints were  ""true or not true."" (Id. at 4). Under oath, Movant stated, ""Not true."" When asked why he made the complaints, he  stated, ""I was frustrated."" (Id.). Specifically, [*12]  the court again asked Movant whether the allegation of counsel  falling asleep multiple times during the proceedings was a true statement. (Id. at 6). Movant answered, ""No, Your  Honor."" (Id.). When asked whether counsel should continue to represent him, Movant said, ""Yes, Your Honor."" (Id.  at 7). Movant then voluntarily withdrew his complaints raised in his letter. (Id.). In the instant habeas petition, Movant does not indicate during which substantial portions of trial counsel was  allegedly sleeping. Moreover, he asserts no actual prejudice such that counsel's sleeping led to the presentation of  inadmissible evidence, if any, or where counsel missed opportunities to raise objections during any testimony.  Movant fails to demonstrate how counsel failed to subject Movant's case to meaningful adversarial testing. In short,  even assuming counsel were asleep during portions of trial, Movant cannot establish prejudice. It is worth noting that within his unsworn memorandum, Movant falsely claims that he was somehow coerced or  admonished by the court to withdraw the claim; and he asserts that the court's admonishment might even be  missing from the record. (Cr-DE#7-1:3). He also claims that he relitigated the [*13]  issue on December 10, 2014.  (Id.). Movant's memorandum containing various conclusory allegations does not comport with the requirements of  28 U.S.C. § 1746 because he did not sign it under the penalty of perjury; therefore, the allegations are not entitled  to the presumption of truth or consideration by this Court. Movant cannot satisfy either prong of Strickland. Accordingly, Claim 1 is without merit, does not warrant relief, and  should be DENIED. B. Claim 2 Movant's Right to a Fair Trial by an Impartial Jury Was Not Violated by Juror N.A. Because Movant's Claims are  Controverted by the Record In Claim 2, Movant claims the trial court erred in not removing a biased juror from deliberations, counsel failed to  request a mistrial resulting from the impartial juror, and counsel failed to request a curative instruction for the jury.  (Cv-DE#7:4-7). The § 2255 motion is bereft of any factual support for these claims. (Id.). The government asserts  that the record contradicts Movant's claims — the juror was not biased and was accepted by both parties; she was  excused and replaced with an alternate with Movant's agreement; the court gave the jury instructions to begin  deliberations anew with the alternate; and there [*14]  was no basis for counsel to object. (Cv-DE#9:11-16).  Movant's claims are affirmatively controverted by the record. During voir dire, Juror N.A. indicated that she had someone close to her who had been accused of a crime, namely,  her uncle. (Cr-DE#146:42-43, 56, 59). N.A. explained that in 2008, her cousin was murdered in a ""domestic  situation,"" which resulted in N.A. and her mother becoming the caretakers for her cousin's child, so Movant's case  might ""trigger some emotions and feelings"" for her. Id. at 59, 81. Ultimately, both parties accepted N.A. as a juror.  Id. at 98. On Day 3 of the trial, N.A. communicated to the court security officer that she was bothered by defense counsel's  cross-examination of a witness and that she no longer wanted to be a juror in the case. (Cr-DE#148:117-120).  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120812, *11 Page 7 of 11   However, N.A. stated if given some time she could think objectively about the evidence. (Id. at 120-122). N.A.  agreed to notify the court if she had further misgivings. (Id. at 122). N.A. did not raise any further issues during the  remainder of trial. The jury began deliberations on June 27, 2014. (Cr-DE#154:207). Several days later, N.A.  contacted the courtroom deputy and said she did not want to come back for economic reasons. (Cr- DE#155:3). [*15]  Ultimately, N.A. did return; and the court told her she would need to explain why she did not want  to continue deliberating but she told the court she preferred to continue deliberations rather than be questioned. (Id.  at 3-4). Outside N.A.'s presence, during a hearing on the matter, the parties agreed that since it was the second  time N.A. raised issues, she should be excused and replaced with an alternate juror. (Id. at 4-5). The court then  presented the issue directly to Movant: The Court: All right. Mr. Baston, are you in agreement? Movant: Yes, Your Honor. (Id. at 5). Following a recess, the court explained that rather than remain outside the jury room as directed, while the parties  debated whether to excuse her, N.A. had resumed deliberations with the jury. (Id. at 6). N.A. was then removed  from the jury room. (Id.). Both parties reaffirmed the decision to have N.A. replaced with the alternate. (Id. at 6-7).  The court explained to the jury that N.A. was replaced ""for personal issues"" and then gave the jury curative  instructions to begin deliberations anew with the alternate juror. (Id. at 14-15). The jury found Movant guilty on all  charges. (Id. at 21-23). Counsel filed a motion for a new trial raising three grounds, including, one involving N.A. (Cr-DE#100). [*16]   Counsel argued: [N.A.] indicated that she could not serves as a Juror over the weekend after deliberations had commenced, yet  although she was instructed to stay outside the Jury Room she rejoined the Jury and commenced deliberation  contrary to the instructions... She was later dismissed as a Juror. This was tantamount to a non-juror  participating in deliberations with the jury. (Id. at 2). The court denied the motion and, specifically, summarized the circumstances surrounding N.A.: ...the second morning of deliberations, N.A. was asked to wait outside the jury room while the parties and the  Court discussed a written request she had submitted requesting to be excused from further service...because  of what she described as her financial situation...the parties expressed their wish [that] N.A. be replaced by  alternate F.E... Unbeknownst to the parties and court staff, N.A. had entered the jury room and was deliberating with the jury  while the Court and the parties were addressing what to do with respect to N.A. and her request to be excused.  When the parties were informed N.A. had entered the jury room despite being asked to wait outside...they  again expressed their decision to remove N.A. N.A. was [*17]  removed from the jury room, was informed she  was excused and could leave, and the...jury was asked to wait for the alternate juror F.E....When F.E.  arrived...all jurors were returned to the courtroom and instructed to begin their deliberations anew, following all  of the Court's instructions as a whole... N.A.'s brief participation in deliberations while the parties considered whether to have her removed and after  she had been told to wait outside the jury room did not convert N.A. into a ""non-juror""...and there is 'no  reasonable possibility that the participation of N.A. 'in the jury's initial deliberations prejudiced [the defendant]...'  [citing] United Stated v. Acevedo, 141 F.3d 1421, 1427 (11th Cir. 1998)... (Cr-DE#120:1-3). It is worth noting that when Movant filed his letter amounting to a motion for mistrial (Cr-DE#101), he raised a  similar claim that N.A. ""made two motions stating that she was biased towards the defendant."" Id. He then withdrew  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120812, *14 Page 8 of 11   his letter stating that his claims were false. (Cv-DE#9-1:7). The record demonstrates that such a claim was, indeed,  false. In his unsworn memorandum, Movant falsely asserts that N.A. admitted she would be biased because she and a  friend were in abusive relationships, the court removed N.A. as a juror [*18]  but she deliberated anyway, and after  Movant sought her removal she went back into the jury room. (Cv-DE#7-1:5-8). Not only is the unsworn  memorandum not entitled to the presumption of truth, those scenarios never occurred. N.A. never stated she had  been in an abusive relationship, had not yet been excused from the jury when she returned to the jury room, and  Movant had not sought N.A.'s removal; rather, she sought to be excused. Movant cannot satisfy either prong of Strickland. Claim 2 is without merit, does not warrant relief, and should be  DENIED. C. Claim 3 Movant's Appearance at Trial in Prison Garb Did Not Violate His Right to a Fair Trial Because His Claim is  Improperly Pled, Is Unsupported by the Record, or Otherwise Fails to Satisfy Strickland. In Claim 3, Movant claims that counsel caused him to be presented at trial in prison clothing. (Cv-DE#7:8). Movant  claims in his unsworn memorandum that counsel refused Movant civilian clothes when family members attempted  to bring him clothing but did not pay counsel $30,000 and when the Marshals informed counsel to permit Movant his  civilian clothing. (Cv-DE#7-1:9-11). The government asserts that even if counsel was deficient, counsel [*19]  is  deceased and cannot defend these vague allegations, and there was no prejudice given the overwhelming amount  of evidence to support the jury's conviction. (Cv-DE#9:16-18). Movant's claim fails. Again, Movant fails to properly allege reasonably specific, non-conclusory facts in support of his claim. Movant did  not present this Court with any affidavits or properly authenticated documents in support of his claim; he names no  one, no dates, and no details. Movant's allegations in his unsworn memorandum may not be considered, as  explained earlier. Furthermore, Movant may not shift the burden to this Court to mine through a voluminous record,  including ten days of trial transcripts, to determine whether there is any evidence to support his claims. Cf. Adler v.  Duval County School Board, 112 F.3d 1475, 1481 n. 12 (11th Cir. 1997); Johnson v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 126  F.3d 1372, 1373 (11th Cir. 1997) (""We are not obligated to cull the record ourselves in search of facts not included  in the statements of fact.""). Even assuming Movant was dressed in prison garb, that alone is insufficient to support claims of a violation of the  constitutional right to a fair trial. Although a defendant cannot be compelled to wear identifiable prison clothes  before a jury at trial, see Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S. 501, 512-13, 96 S. Ct. 1691, 48 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1976), the  Supreme [*20]  Court has recognized that 'it is not an uncommon defense tactic to produce the defendant in jail  clothes in the hope of eliciting sympathy from the jury.' Id. at 508; United States v. Graham, 643 F.3d 885, 895  (2011). In fact, some courts observed that wearing jail clothing might even serve to ""[confer] a strategic advantage  to appear as a captive""; thus, ""[a] litigant should not be permitted to seek this advantage...and then set up the same           2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120812, *17 Page 9 of 11   point as a reason for reversal."" Duarte v. United States, 81 F.3d 75, 77 (7th Cir. 1996). More importantly, ""[t]he  failure to make an objection to the court as to being tried in such clothes, for whatever reason, is sufficient to negate  the presence of compulsion necessary to establish a constitutional violation."" Id. at 512-13. Thus, it is possible that  even if Movant wore prison clothing at his trial, it could have been part of a reasonable strategy, for which counsel  would not be deficient. However, there is no indication on record that Movant was wearing an identifiable prison uniform. Witnesses,  including his own mother, simply identified Movant as wearing a ""brown shirt"" or ""black shirt"" or ""white shirt."" (Cr- DE#s 147:13; 148:166; 149:14, 77; 150:13; 152:6). Even if Movant were wearing prison clothing and assuming counsel was deficient, Movant cannot demonstrate  prejudice. [*21]  The government presented more than 400 exhibits; and more than a dozen witnesses, including  the victims, who testified at trial. For several days, Movant testified on his own behalf; and to his own detriment, was  found to have committed perjury, as noted at his sentencing hearing. Movant's conviction and sentence were  upheld on appeal, supported by sufficient evidence; and the motion for judgment of acquittal was properly denied.  Baston, 818 F.3d at 664. Ultimately, Movant cannot satisfy both prongs of Strickland. Necessarily, Claim 3 is meritless, does not warrant  relief, and should be DENIED. D. Claim 4 The District Court Did Not Err in Admitting Uncharged Crimes into Evidence at Trial and Counsel is Not Ineffective  Where the Record Controverts the Claim and Where Counsel is Not Required to Raise Meritless Arguments. Finally, in Claim 4, Movant claims the district court erred by allowing evidence of uncharged crimes to be admitted  at trial and counsel was ineffective for failing to object. (Cv-DE#7:13). Again, the § 2255 motion is silent as to any  facts supporting Movant's claim. (Id.). In his unsworn memorandum, Movant claims the evidence of uncharged  crimes was related to prostitution in ""Australia Emirater, and [*22]  Indonesia."" (Cv-DE#7-1:11). The unsworn  memorandum also claims that appellate counsel failed to raise the issue on appeal. (Id.). The government asserts  that the matter was properly litigated before trial, counsel objected to the presentation of the evidence, and  counsel's performance was within the purview of a reasonable trial strategy. (Cv-DE#9:18-19). The government  also asserts that appellate counsel is not ineffective for failing to raise meritless arguments. (Id. at 19). Movant's  claim fails. The government filed notices of its intent to offer evidence pursuant to Rules 404(b) and 413 for uncharged crimes  including but not limited to violent, sexual assaults against other victims and prostitution in Australia. (Cr-DE#s 52,  63, 67). Trial counsel filed objections, specifically, asserting that Movant was never criminally charged in Australia  and denied any involvement in sexual assaults. (Cr-DE#70). Following a pre-trial hearing at which counsel  articulated the same objection (Cr-DE#145:6-12), the court granted the government's motions finding the evidence  admissible under the Rules because it was inextricably intertwined with the charged crimes. (Cr-DE#s 145:14 and  72). The merits of the evidence concerning [*23]  certain uncharged crimes were properly litigated prior to trial.  Appellate counsel is not required to raise meritless arguments. United States v. Nyhuis, 211 F.3d 1340, 1345 (11th  Cir. 2000). Finally, Movant's claims and factual assertions raised in an unsworn memorandum are awarded no  weight for the reasons stated previously in this report. Movant cannot demonstrate that either counsel was deficient under Strickland. Accordingly, Claim 4 is without  merit, does not warrant relief, and should be DENIED. 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120812, *20 Page 10 of 11   Ultimately, all of Movant's claims are affirmatively belied by the record. The claims Movant lists in his § 2255 motion  (Cv-DE#7) are, essentially, without factual support. This Court simply cannot rely on Movant's recitation of facts  within an unsworn memorandum, particularly, when the scenarios he describes are false when compared to the  underlying record. Movant claims fail under Strickland analysis. Counsel was not deficient; and Movant did not  suffer prejudice. Movant's Claims 1 through 4 are meritless and should be DENIED. VIII. Evidentiary Hearing Movant is also not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the claims raised in this proceeding. Movant has the burden  of establishing the need for an evidentiary hearing, and he would only be entitled to [*24]  a hearing if his  allegations, if proved, would establish his right to collateral relief. See Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465, 473-75,  127 S. Ct. 1933, 167 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2007) (holding that if the record refutes the factual allegations in the petition or  otherwise precludes habeas relief, a district court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing). See also  Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 307, 83 S. Ct. 745, 9 L. Ed. 2d 770 (1963); Holmes v. United States, 876 F.2d  1545, 1553 (11th Cir. 1989) (holding that § 2255 does not require that the district court hold an evidentiary hearing  every time a Section 2255 petitioner simply asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and stating: ""A  hearing is not required on patently frivolous claims or those which are based upon unsupported generalizations. Nor  is a hearing required where the petitioner's allegations are affirmatively contradicted by the record.""). IX. Certificate of Appealability A prisoner seeking to appeal a district court's final order denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus has no  absolute entitlement to appeal but must obtain a certificate of appealability (ACOA@). See 28 U.S.C. § 2253 (c)(1);  Harbison v. Bell, 556 U.S. 180, 183, 129 S. Ct. 1481, 173 L. Ed. 2d 347 (2009). This Court should issue a certificate  of appealability only if the petitioner makes ""a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right."" See 28  U.S.C. § 2253 (c)(2). Where a district court has rejected a petitioner's constitutional claims on the merits, the  petitioner must demonstrate [*25]  that reasonable jurists would find the district court's assessment of the  constitutional claims debatable or wrong. See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S. Ct. 1595, 146 L. Ed. 2d  542 (2000). However, when the district court has rejected a claim on procedural grounds, the petitioner must show  that ""jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional  right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.""  Id. Upon consideration of the record as a whole, this Court should deny a certificate of appealability.  Notwithstanding, if petitioner does not agree, he may bring this argument to the attention of the district judge in  objections. X. Recommendations Based on the foregoing, it is recommended that the motion to vacate be DENIED on the merits, that no certificate of  appealability issue, and, that this case be CLOSED. Objections to this report may be filed with the District Judge within fourteen days of receipt of a copy of the report.  Failure to do so will bar a de novo determination by the district judge of anything in the recommendation and will bar  an attack, on appeal, of the factual findings of the Magistrate Judge. See [*26]  28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C); Thomas  v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 149, 106 S. Ct. 466, 88 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1985); RTC v. Hallmark Builders, Inc., 996 F.2d 1144,  1149 (11th Cir. 1993).

"United States v. Zitlalpopoca-Hernandez, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53523","MEMORANDUM OPINION ON RE-SENTENCING This case was remanded for re-sentencing so that the Court can explain why it rejects Defendant's argument — the  defense argument that imposing a 200-month sentence constitutes a so-called ""unwarranted sentencing disparity""  in his case. Re-sentencing was held on December 19, 2017. This Opinion memorializes and supplements the oral  findings and conclusions of the Court. I. FACTS & TESTIMONY The course of Defendant's criminal conduct and the facts leading up to his crimes of conviction provide the needed  context for fashioning an appropriate sentence and rejecting the unwarranted sentencing disparity argument.  Defendant's actions were not the product of a momentary lapse of judgement or an isolated act of financial     Page 2 of 16   desperation. Defendant [*2]  took his time. He planned and implemented his criminal scheme over days, weeks,  and months. The Court finds the following facts to be true beyond a reasonable doubt. FLORENCIA Florencia was 17 years old and living in Mexico. She came from a poor family. She was going to elope with her  boyfriend and agreed to meet him at a bus station. After waiting five or six hours, her boyfriend never showed up.  The Defendant Adrian Zitlalpopoca did. Defendant offered to help Florencia. He loaned her his cell phone to make a  call, then left. He returned later around midnight. It was cold. He loaned her his sweater. Defendant told Florencia  that the next bus would not depart until morning. He offered to drive her to his ""sister's"" house and he would return  her the next morning. After spending a short time at the ""sister's"" house, he drove her to his mother's house in a nearby town. There they  became intimate. He asked her to be his ""wife."" He then drove her to his brother's house in Tlaxcala, Mexico. While  en route he told Florencia not to listen to gossip that she might hear. A couple of weeks passed. He took Florencia  to see a fancy car and fancy house that belonged to his friend. Florencia testified [*3]  that after he showed her the  car and the house he suggested she become a prostitute. He told her that he owed a debt and that if she agreed,  it would help him out. At first she refused. Then she refused again. Eventually, she relented. Once she surrendered, she was introduced  to his friend's ""wife"" or ""woman"" who was also a prostitute. The woman traveled with Florencia to another town  called Puebla, Mexico, where Florencia was introduced to prostitution. Florencia testified that she worked five or  six days a week. She gave all of her earnings to Defendant at his instruction. In 2005, Defendant directed Florencia to travel to Tijuana, Mexico, where she could earn more money. Florencia  testified that on one occasion when Defendant did not come home at night she went looking for him. He responded  by grabbing her by the hair. He punched her in the face. He kicked her. On another occasion he whipped her —  with the cord to an iron. She heard that Defendant was looking for other woman to work for him. Defendant told her  that ""some come, some leave."" Florencia learned that Defendant and another woman had traveled to the United States and that she was working  for Defendant. Defendant and Florencia [*4]  had talked about traveling to the United States before. Upon learning  that Defendant was in the United States with Annabel, Florencia asked to also be brought to the United States.  Defendant arranged for Florencia to be smuggled in. Within 3 or 4 days after arriving in the United States, Florencia began once again working as a prostitute. She  would work in what evidence showed were the brushy canyons of San Diego's back country. After her arrest,  Florencia was contacted by two of Defendant's brothers, Juan and Tonatiuh. She knew Tonatiuh was violent. She  feared that Defendant and his family would come after her if she ""turned on him."" ANNABEL Annabel was 18 years old and living in Mexico. Her parents were also field laborers. She was going to college. In  March of 2006, she was at a public park. Defendant approached her. They began to talk. He lied to her. He told her  he was younger than his actual age. Defendant told her that he worked buying and selling clothing. They saw each  other over several weekends at the park. Eventually, he asked her to marry him.   2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53523, *1 Page 3 of 16   He told Annabel that he had been working in the United States. He told Annabel that they could go to the United  States to work, save [*5]  money, and get married. One week before the school year was over, she left school with  Defendant. They traveled to another town. Again, in Tlaxcala, Mexico. He took her to a house he said was his. The  next morning Defendant introduced her to his mother, sisters, and brothers as his wife. On the second night, Defendant left. He told her he was going to go to work. He told her she was not allowed to  speak to anyone. She was not to leave the house, or speak to anyone or use the phone. She did not go out of her  room very much. Defendant told her she could not talk to his family. One night while they were together, Defendant suggested that she should work as a prostitute. He told her that he  had a friend that had made a lot of money in prostitution and that they could too. She became upset and started  crying. But ""he insisted."" Defendant told her that if she loved him, she would do it. He told her that if she became a  prostitute, then they would get married and she could help her family. She refused. He left for Tijuana, Mexico. While away he would call her. She told him she missed him and wanted to be with him.  He told her that she could come to Tijuana, ""but you know what for."" She too relented. [*6]  Defendant arranged for a friend to bring her food. When Annabel told Defendant she would  work as a prostitute, the next day, his friend and his wife brought her clothes. They then took her to work. Again to  the town of Puebla, Mexico. She was told what clothes to wear and how much to charge. She worked in Puebla  three days from noon to 9:00 p.m. Defendant then sent her an airplane ticket to travel to Tijuana. While she worked in Puebla, she gave her earnings  to Defendant's friend, Jose, with Defendant's ""permission."" She then flew to Tijuana with the woman who had  taught her and taken her to Puebla. The next day, she began working in Tijuana. She would work from 7:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m., or later. She worked every day. Defendant told her the money she  earned was his and she had to give it to him. When she tried to keep some of the money, he took it away from her. In September 2006, he sent her to buy food. She looked in his wallet for money and found a condom. She asked  him why he had a condom. He responded by throwing a remote control device at her, hitting her on the leg.  Defendant then grabbed her hair and hit her in the face — with his fist. He hit her in the mouth with his fist. She [*7]   became very scared. In January 2007, he took her to a party. Defendant saw her talking to another woman. He had told Annabel earlier  that she was not allowed to talk to anyone. Defendant reacted by hitting Annabel on the leg with his fist. He hit her  with his elbow. He hit her in the mouth. He grabbed her by the arm and dragged her toward the car. He continued  hitting her. Annabel testified that Defendant was angry with her frequently. Annabel testified that there were other  occasions when he would hit her. Defendant then moved Annabel to Mexico City to continue her work. She continued to deposit the money she  earned into Defendant's bank account. At one point, she called Defendant and said she wanted to return to  Tlaxcala to be with him. He told her that if she returned to him, she would not have to work as a prostitute  anymore. And so she planned to return to Tlaxcala. Instead, he met her at the airport in Mexico City. He said to her:  ""You thought that I was going to leave everything for you and that you weren't going to work anymore, well, I lied to  you."" Defendant then took Annabel back to Puebla to continue to work. He took her to his parents' house. He then  left again. On one occasion [*8]  while in Tlaxcala, Defendant and Annabel were at a park. They argued. She threw a corncob  on the ground. Defendant then began hitting her. He hit her and hit her until she bent down to pick up the corncob  — not with her hand, but according to his orders — with her mouth. 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53523, *4 Page 4 of 16   Annabel testified that Defendant abused her on other occasions. On one occasion, he whipped her, just like he had  whipped Florencia. With a cable. He also hit her with a broomstick. Annabel also testified that Defendant told her  that his friends were looking for a woman who had gone to the police in order to ""kill her, beat her or something, but  they wanted to find her."" She testified that she became scared. Defendant told Annabel that if they came to the United States she would be his only woman. Of course, that proved  not to be true. Defendant arranged to have himself and Annabel smuggled into the United States. When they arrived in the United  States, Defendant told Annabel that she had to work in order to repay Defendant's cousin who had paid the  smuggler's fee. She began working two days after arriving in the United States. Annabel testified that she worked at  a ""ranch."" She also testified that they used plastic tarps [*9]  to lay down on while she and Florencia worked.  Annabel lived with Defendant's cousin, co-defendant Eduardo Aguila and his wife. Annabel also testified that she  was scared of Defendant. II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY Defendant Adrian Zitlalpopoca-Hernandez was indicted on December 10, 2008. A Superceding Indictment was filed  April 8, 2009. In that Indictment, Defendant was charged with the following crimes: Counts 1 & 2, Title 18, U.S.C.,  §§ 1591(a) (1) and (b)(1) - Sex Trafficking by Force, Fraud, or Coercion; Counts 3 & 4, Title 18, U.S.C., § 2422(a)  - Persuasion or Coercion to Travel to Engage in Prostitution; Counts 5 & 6, Title 8, U.S.C., § 1328 - Harboring  Aliens for Purposes of Prostitution; Counts 7 & 8, Title 8, U.S.C., § 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii) - Bringing Illegal Aliens into  the United States for Financial Gain; Title 18, U.S.C., § 2 - Aiding and Abetting; Counts 9 & 10, Title 8, U.S.C., §  1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) and (v)(II) - Harboring Illegal Aliens and Aiding and Abetting; Count 11, Title 8, U.S.C., § 1326(a) -  Deported Alien Found in the United States. A three-day trial was held in January 2010. The jury returned a guilty verdict in just 99 minutes. Defendant was  found guilty on Counts one through ten. Count 11 was dismissed. This Court sentenced the Defendant to a total custodial term of 292 months. An appeal was filed. The Court of  Appeals reversed the convictions [*10]  on Counts 1, 2 & 4, and remanded for re-sentencing on Counts 3, 5, 6, 7, 8,  9, and 10. U.S. v. Zitlalpopoca-Hernandez, 495 Fed. Appx. 833, 835-36 (9th Cir. Nov. 7, 2012). The Court of  Appeals determined there was insufficient evidence for the § 1591 convictions (Counts 1 & 2). It reasoned that  although there was evidence that Zitlalpopoca physically assaulted the women on numerous occasions in Mexico,  there was no evidence of assaults in the United States and whatever assaults had occurred took place prior to 2008  (which was the beginning date specified in the Indictment). Id. The Court of Appeals also determined that there was  insufficient evidence for one of the § 2422(a) convictions (Count 4) because, in its words, [t]he evidence at trial demonstrated that it was Florencia who persuaded Zitlalpopoca to bring her to the United  States, not the other way around. Contra United States v. Rashkovski, 301 F.3d 1133, 1135 (9th Cir. 2002)  (sufficient evidence supported § 2422(a) conviction where defendant traveled to Russia, held recruiting  meetings to promote prostitution in the United States, and arranged and paid for Russian women to travel to  the United States to work as prostitutes). Id. at 836. After remand, Defendant was re-sentenced for a total custodial term of 262 months. Another appeal  followed and again the Court of Appeals reversed. It held that this time [*11]  the Sentencing Guidelines were  improperly computed by applying a sexual abuse enhancement under § 2241 and a vulnerable victim enhancement  under U.S.S.G. § 3A1.1(b). U.S. v. Zitlalpopoca-Hernandez, 632 Fed. Appx. 335, 337 (9th Cir. Dec. 28, 2015). It  was also error to impose mandatory restitution. Id. at 338. The case was again remanded for re-sentencing.  2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53523, *8 Page 5 of 16   On April 18, 2016, Defendant was re-sentenced: Counts 3, 5, and 7 - 100 months as to each count concurrently;  Counts 6 and 8 - 100 months as to each count concurrently; Counts 9 and 10 - 60 months as to each count  concurrently; Counts 3, 5, and 7 to run consecutive to Counts 6 and 8; Counts 9 and 10 to run concurrent as to all  counts. In total, the Court imposed a sentence of 200 months. A third appeal followed and a third remand. U.S. v.  Zitlalpopoca-Hernandez, 709 Fed. Appx. 428, 430 (9th Cir. Sept. 26, 2017). This remand is the reason for the present sentencing. The remand was occasioned by this Court's lack of explanation for rejecting an ""unwarranted sentencing  disparities"" argument offered for the very first time at the end of a late-filed, last-minute pleading. Sentencing had  been set for the morning of Monday, March 28, 2016. Defense counsel filed late the memorandum electronically on  the afternoon of Thursday, March 24, 2016 at 4:15 p.m. (i.e., the Thursday before the Monday sentencing). A  printed copy of the memorandum [*12]  was delivered to chambers the following day. Faced with a newly-minted  sentencing argument — to which the Government had no opportunity to respond — and with which the Court had  little time to consider, the sentencing hearing was re-set for April 18, 2016. On December 19, 2017, Defendant was again sentenced. The Court again imposed a 100 month sentence on each  of Counts 3, 5, and 7, with the counts to run concurrently. The Court also imposed a 100 month sentence on each  of Counts 6 and 8 with the counts to run concurrently. On Counts 9 and 10, the Court imposed 60 months each to  run concurrently and to run concurrently with all other Counts. The concurrent 100 month sentences for Counts 3,  5, and 7, run consecutively to the 100 month sentences for Counts 6 and 8. The resulting total custodial sentence  time remains 200 months. III. DEFENDANT'S ""UNWARRANTED DISPARITIES"" ARGUMENT The reason for this re-sentencing (as noted above) is that Defendant made a late-filed, last-second, newly-minted  argument that this Court did not orally address during the sentencing hearing. That argument cobbled [*13]   together a dozen lighter sentences in other local cases and argued that a 200-month sentence would be an  ""unwarranted disparity."" The Court of Appeals remanded the case because, ""[w]hen a party raises a specific,                      2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53523, *11 Page 6 of 16   nonfrivolous argument tethered to a relevant § 3553(a) factor in support of a requested sentence, then the judge  should normally explain why he accepts or rejects the party's position."" Id. (quoting U.S. v. Carty, 520 F.3d 984,  992-93 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc)). A. Sentencing Memorandum Cases — Which One to Compare? At the December 19, 2017 sentencing hearing, the Court discussed at length, inter alia, the argument tethered to 18  U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6) that similarly situated defendants in other cases were given lighter sentences and that therefore  Zitlalpopoca's sentence represents an unwarranted disparity. Defendant's late-filed, last-minute, codicil about  unwarranted disparities suffers from several glaringly obvious flaws. One problem is that Defendant's memorandum simply sets forth a list of cherry-picked cases that are unfamiliar to  this Court (with one exception). The list is a selection of cases presided over by other judges. For each case,  Defendant supplies his own description of charges and conduct and the sentence imposed. The sentences imposed  range from time served to 153 months and there is no uniformity. It is difficult to imagine which of those cases and/or sentences might serve as a sound basis for comparison or how  a court would sort through them to reach a decision. For example, in one case there were 38 defendants. Two  defendants received time served. One [*15]  defendant was sentenced to 153 months. The rest were sentenced to  varying amounts in between. Given these disparate sentences, Defendant's real argument is not that a 200 month  total sentence is an unwarranted disparity, but rather, that it is higher than the highest sentence imposed in any of  the selected cases. Of course, a reasonable judge with prior experience in sentencing would immediately want to  ask a few relevant questions about the other cases. For example: - Did the defendant plead guilty or was the defendant convicted at trial? - Did the defendant accept responsibility? - Did the defendant waive appeal? - Did the defendant provide substantial assistance?                      2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53523, *13 Page 7 of 16   - Was there a fast-track or combination of factors departure, or § 3553(e) variance? Answers to these obvious questions were not provided by the Defendant. In fact, when defense counsel was asked  at the sentencing hearing whether she knew the answers to these questions for the cases listed in her brief, she did  not. For example, when asked if a defendant had pleaded guilty or gone to trial, counsel did not know. When asked  if a defendant had waived appeal as part of a plea agreement, counsel did not know. When asked if a defendant  had [*16]  cooperated with the government, counsel did not know. When asked if there were any aggravating or  mitigating factors, counsel did not know. The poverty of sentencing facts makes meaningful comparisons of other  sentences futile. B. The Only Familiar Case in the List: U.S. v. Stephens The one case in Defendant's list that the Court does know about is U.S. v. Stephens, Case No. 13cr828-BEN. The  reason this Court knows about Stephens is because it sentenced the defendant in that case. It was the only one  that this Court knows much about beyond the cryptic case descriptions sketched out by defense counsel. Stephens  was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § 1594(c) by conspiring to engage in the sex trafficking of children. Stephens  pled guilty. Stephens waived appeal. There were mitigating factors which the Court took into account, including the  defendant's age, his substance addiction, and the relevant conduct. The Guidelines called for a sentence of 135  to168 months. After considering the 3553(a) factors, this Court imposed a below-Guideline sentence of 120 months. After the sentencing [*17]  hearing in the present case, defense counsel filed a Rule 35 motion. Incredibly, after  having asked the Court to consider the Stephens case as one of his smorgasbord of cases, Defendant criticizes this  Court in his Rule 35 motion for distinguishing Stephens during the sentencing hearing. C. U.S. v. Smith is Omitted Without Explanation Confined to sentencing comparisons from Defendant's list, Zitlalpopoca's 200 month total sentence appears to be  an outlier. Yet, there was one glaring omission in the list of cases. For some reason, Defendant failed to include in  his list of cases, the case of U.S. v. Maurice Smith, Case No. 11cr471-BEN — a case with which this Court is very  familiar. The sentence was affirmed on appeal in U.S. v. Smith, 719 F.3d 1120 (9th Cir. 2013). The omission of  Smith undermines any persuasive force of Defendant's custom selection of comparable sentences. In Smith, this  Court sentenced Mr. Smith at the low end of the Guidelines range to 360 months. The criminal conduct and the  criminal charges were similar. After considering the § 3553(a) factors and the defendant's age, this Court                 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53523, *14 Page 8 of 16   considered that 360 months was sufficient but not greater than necessary. Of course, had Defendant included  Smith in its list of cases, Zitlalpopoca's 200 [*18]  month total sentence would no longer be an outlier. Once again, in his after-filed Rule 35 motion, Defendant chastises the Court for even referring to the Smith case, of  course, claiming bias and prejudice. Defendant argues that the Court should not have compared Smith's sentence  because Defendant knows nothing about that case. So, in essence, Defendant argues: ""Judge, you can't use the  Smith case for comparison because I know nothing about it, but I expect you to distinguish the smorgasbord of  cases in my memorandum that you know nothing about."" It is probably obvious that the value of using a case like Smith for comparisons comes from the fact that Smith is a  published opinion that any attorney can find, it is an authoritative opinion from the court of appeals affirming the  sentence, and the published opinion itself recites two pages of facts, making comparisons meaningful. Defendant's  cited cases do not have these important qualities. D. Other Cases 1. National cases not mentioned Another problem with the unwarranted disparities argument made here is that only local cases were selected by the  defense for comparison. Defendant relied on a dozen cases from the Southern District of California. [*19]  See  Sentencing Memorandum, filed Mar. 24, 2016, at 8-12. Yet, there is no principled reason for measuring disparity  against cases hand-picked from the local district. In fact, it is fair to say that the creation of the United States  Sentencing Commission and concomitant Sentencing Guidelines was a response to the inequity of parochial  sentencing. See e.g., U.S. v. Wills, 476 F.3d 103, 109 (2nd Cir. 2007) (the ""primary purpose"" of § 3553(a)(6) was  ""to reduce unwarranted disparities nationwide"") (emphasis added). The argument for a national comparison has  even more force for a § 1328 or a § 2422(a) crime where victims are coerced to travel to engage in prostitution.  Violations of § 1328 and § 2422(a) are by definition not localized crimes. Yet, Defendant offered no reason for  omitting cases and sentences from across the nation, for example, the case of U.S. v. Todd, 627 F.3d 329 (9th Cir.  2010). 2. U.S. v. Todd Todd is a case that went to trial with facts very similar to Zitlalpopoca's crime. At trial, Todd was convicted of  multiple counts of § 1591 and § 2421 and sentenced to 312 months on the § 1591 counts running concurrently with  a 120-month sentence on the § 2421 count. See Judgment, Case No. 07cr395-JLR (E.D. Wash. Sept. 29, 2008).  That sentence was affirmed on appeal. 627 F.3d 329. 3. U.S. v. Bell Todd resembles another national case: U.S. v. Bell, 761 F.3d 900 (8th Cir. 2014), cert. denied [*20] , 135 S. Ct.  503, 190 L. Ed. 2d 378 (2014). Bell also was convicted by a jury of multiple counts of §§ 1591 and 2422(a) and  sentenced to a total of 360 months (with a 240-month sentence on the coercion and enticement to travel in  interstate commerce for prostitution counts). 761 F.3d at 906. 4. Cases cited in Defendant's appeal brief Defendant did raise sentences from beyond the Southern District of California in his most recent appeal brief.  However, those cases do not reflect an unwarranted sentencing disparity in Defendant's case. Rather, they tend to  show that Defendant's 200-month total sentence is not disparate. For example, he mentions U.S. v. Hornbuckle,  2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53523, *17 Page 9 of 16   784 F.3d 549 (9th Cir. 2015). In that case two co-defendants were sentenced to 188 and 151 months for trafficking  minors. Id. at 551. The sentence was affirmed. The minors, however, were prostituting before meeting the co- defendants and the co-defendants pleaded guilty. Id. at 557. Neither fact is present in Zitlalpopoca's case.  Defendant next mentions U.S. v. Basa, 817 F.3d 645 (9th Cir. 2016). Basa was sentenced to 210 months for  ""providing housing for two 15-year-old girls and facilitat[ing] their having sex with adult men. Id. at 647. The  sentence was affirmed. Basa did not use or threaten physical violence and Basa pleaded guilty. Id. Neither fact is  present in Zitlalpopoca's case. Defendant's next published [*21]  case is U.S. v. Brooks, 610 F.3d 1186 (9th Cir.  2010). In that case co-defendants were sentenced to 198 months and 97 months. Id. at 1193. The sentences were  reversed and remanded because the sentences erroneously included a two-level enhancement for ""custody, care,  or supervisory control over the girls."" Id. at 1200. On re-sentencing, Brooks was sentenced to 180 months for each  count of conviction (concurrent). U.S. v. Fields, No CV112458 PHX-DGC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 169574, 2012 WL  5989493 (D. Ariz. Oct. 22, 2012). Defendant next cites U.S. v. Sanders, 558 F. App'x 763 (9th Cir. 2014). The  Sanders memorandum disposition does not offer much detail about the offense or the defendant. It does, however,  report a 194-month sentence and that Sanders pleaded guilty and waived his right to appeal. Id. at 764. The  sentence is close to Defendant's 200-month sentence and Defendant did not plead guilty or waive his right to  appeal. Defendant cited in his appeal brief an older case from this district: U.S. v. Rashkovski, 301 F.3d 1133 (9th Cir.  2002). Rashkovski and his co-defendant were convicted at trial. His co-defendant, Nataliya Kozlova, remains a  fugitive. Defendant argues in his appeal brief that Rashkovski ""trapped"" his victim in a prostitution ring but was  only sentenced to 60 months, a sentence much lighter than 200 months. But the facts in Rashkovski paint a much  lighter shade of harm. Rashkovski did not trick his victims into being [*22]  smuggled into the United States and  prostitution through false promises of love and nice things. Defendant omits to say that Rashkovski was  apparently quite up front about his proposition of prostitution profit sharing. To recruit more Russian women, Rashkovski and Kozlova flew to Moscow in June 1999 and held meetings to  promote the limitless job opportunities in the dynamic field of prostitution in the United States. To the  attendees at one of the meetings . . . Rashkovski explained that although it was unlikely he could get visas for  all of the women, he would make their travel arrangements and pay for the plane tickets. The women would  repay him with the money they made in his ""established prostitution business"" — $60 per hour of the $200  they would charge. Rashkovski, 301 F.3d at 1135. In a perfect example of why details matter, Defendant cited a case in his appeal brief without mentioning the  sentences imposed. Defendant describes U.S. v. Valenzuela, 495 F. App'x 817 (9th Cir. 2012) as a case that really  did involve young victims while criticizing Zitlalpopoca's 200-month sentence as if it involved young victims. But the  sentences imposed in the Valenzuela case are not mentioned by either Defendant or in the memorandum  disposition. Only by searching through the [*23]  federal courts' Pacer case information service for the district  court's docket sheet can one find out what sentences were imposed. Six co-defendants were sentenced in Case  No. 07cr11-MMM (C.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2009). Gladys Valenzuela was sentenced to 480 months. Mirna Valenzuela  was sentenced to 360 months. Defendant Maria Vincente was sentenced to 360 months. Defendant Gabriel  Mendez was sentenced to 420 months. Defendant Maribel Rodriguez-Vasquez was sentenced to 360 months. Luis  Vasquez was sentenced to 71 months. While the important individual sentencing factors are not known, it is fair to  say that five of the six Valenzuela defendants received much harsher sentences than Zitlalpopoca's 200-month  sentence — suggesting the absence of an unwarranted upward sentencing disparity for Zitlalpopoca. While Defendant cites other cases, his appeal brief argues that, ""perhaps the best example of an unwarranted  sentencing disparity is between this case and that of United States v. Flavors, 15 F. App'x 491 (9th Cir. 2001).""  Flavors was sentenced to 168 months for transporting a 15-year-old from Washington to California for prostitution.  A second charge of transporting a 17-year-old was dismissed as part of a plea bargain. Defendant says the two  girls [*24]  were kidnapped, but that is not apparent from the memorandum disposition. What is apparent is that  Defendant forced the 15-year-old to prostitute herself for a total of twelve days and he allegedly forced the 17- year-old into prostitution for three days. He also forced the victims to have sex with himself. 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53523, *20 Page 10 of 16   Defendant asserts that by comparison, his own harsher 200-month sentence is obviously unwarranted because his  crimes ""did not involve minors, bondage, rape, or sex slavery."" But the 32-month ""disparity"" is warranted in view of  the facts that: (1) Defendant's crimes lasted much longer than Flavors' three days (in one case) or 12 days (in the  other case); (2) though Florencia was 18 by the time she was smuggled into the United States, her victimization  began much earlier when she was a minor; and (3) Zitlalpopoca did not plead guilty as Flavors did. Perhaps Flavors  is actually a good example of why the ""unwarranted sentencing disparity"" argument is insubstantial. 5. Other cases from the Government's brief It is fair to say that Defendant has not surveyed the entirety of sentences in similar federal cases. The Government  offers some additional cases for comparison. Gov't. Sentencing Mem. [*25]  and Resp. (filed Dec. 11, 2017), Exhibit  5. One such similar case is U.S. v. Carreto, 583 F.3d 152 (2d Cir. 2009). In Carreto, two defendants were  sentenced to 50 years and a third was sentenced to 25 years. Another case cited is U.S. v. Mendez, 362 F. App'x  484 (6th Cir. 2010), where the defendant was sentenced to 600 months. A third case is U.S. v. Cortes-Meza, 685 F.  App'x 731 (11th Cir. 2017), where the defendant was sentenced to 480 months. In affirming the 480-month  sentence, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals dispatched one of Zitlalpopoca's arguments in observing, ""[t]hat  Defendant received a harsher sentence than his co-defendants does not mean that his sentence was  unreasonable. In fact, this court has recognized that a 'disparity between the sentences imposed on codefendants  is generally not an appropriate basis for relief on appeal.'"" Id. at 738. The Government cites a number of other federal cases in a similar vein. Each involves longer sentences than 200  months. One case deserves special mention: U.S. v. Fields, 625 F. App'x 949 (11th Cir. 2015). In Fields, the  defendant carried out a similar course of criminal conduct targeting women who were vulnerable, prompting the  district court to remark, ""That's exactly what you were, you were a predator . . . . you were preying on those young  women because they were just that. They were vulnerable."" Gov't. Sentencing Mem., Exhibit [*26]  5, at 2. The  court sentenced defendant to 480 months. That sentence was affirmed on appeal. E. Comparing to Co-Defendants Defendant's Sentencing Memorandum is flawed in another even more obvious way. Defendant argues that this  Court's sentence was much higher than that imposed on the two co-defendants and that the Court did not explain  the disparity. The reason why the Court did not need to explain the difference in sentences was well known to  Defendant and would be obvious to anyone else in a New York minute. Co-defendant No. 1 was convicted of one count of violating 8 U.S.C. § 1328. So was co-defendant No. 2.  Defendant, on the other hand, was convicted of two counts of Aiding and Abetting Harboring Aliens for Purposes of  Prostitution under 8 U.S.C. § 1328, two counts of Aiding and Abetting Bringing Illegal Aliens into the United States  for Financial Gain under 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii) (a conviction under this statute carries a minimum mandatory  three-year sentence), two counts of Aiding and Abetting Harboring Illegal Aliens under 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii),  and Aiding and Abetting Persuasion or Coercion to Travel to Engage in Prostitution under 18 U.S.C. § 2422(a). Both co-defendants entered pleas of guilty. Both co-defendants waived appeal. There was no evidence that the co- defendants [*27]  induced, enticed, or even knew that Florencia and Annabel had traveled in interstate commerce.  There was no evidence that the co-defendants ever coerced Annabel and Florencia or used any type of physical  violence against them. There was no evidence that the co-defendants participated or arranged for Annabel and  Florencia to be smuggled into the United States. The co-defendants' involvement was of very short duration. It is true that the co-defendants received shorter sentences. But the reasons for the shorter sentences are obvious.  Furthermore, the Court found that each co-defendant had a minor role in Zitlalpopoca's criminal operation.   2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53523, *24 Page 11 of 16   Specifically, co-defendant Eduardo Aguila-Tecuapacho provided a place for Annabel to live while she was in the  United States. He was also the owner of two vehicles used to transport Florencia to work. He was the subscriber of  the phone used to arrange for prostitution dates. Co-defendant Carlos Tzompantzi also lived with Annabel and  Defendant. He admitted to driving Annabel on one occasion to an address where Annabel performed acts of  prostitution. Additionally, neither co-defendant had any history of other violations of U.S. laws — unlike Zitlalpopoca [*28]  who  had illegally entered the United States numerous times and had been deported or removed but chose to re-enter  illegally for purposes of conducting his sex trafficking business. Each co-defendant accepted responsibility early in  the case and pleaded guilty. Each agreed to an appeal waiver, saving the government and the public time and  expense. That the conduct ascribed to the co-defendants was dissimilar to Defendant's conduct, as this Court  stated previously, is glaringly obvious. Given the long, unlawful, degrading, dehumanizing, and violent course of  conduct of Defendant's sophisticated trafficking conduct, the co-defendants' shorter sentences for their limited  conduct do not demonstrate unwarranted sentencing disparities. F. U.S. v. Treadwell Already Rejected the Same Approach Finally, Defendant's overall approach to arguing an unwarranted sentencing disparity was roundly rejected in U.S.  v. Treadwell, 593 F.3d 990, 1011-12 (9th Cir. 2010), cert. denied, 562 U.S. 973, 131 S. Ct. 488, 178 L. Ed. 2d 309  (2010) (affirming 360 months total sentence for defendant found guilty of fraud in $40 million Ponzi scheme).  Treadwell teaches that the mere fact that a defendant can point to some other defendant convicted at a different  time of a different crime ""does not create an 'unwarranted' sentencing [*29]  disparity."" 593 F.3d at 1012. Treadwell  describes several reasons why such an approach is unconvincing: Nor does it matter for the purposes of § 3553(a) that Treadwell can point to a specific criminal defendant, like  Rigas, who may have received a lighter sentence for a different fraud. A district court considers the § 3553(a)  factors to tailor a sentence to the specific characteristics of the offense and the defendant. ""It has been uniform  and constant in the federal judicial tradition for the sentencing judge to consider every convicted person as an  individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes mitigate, sometimes magnify,  the crime and the punishment to ensue."" The mere fact that Treadwell can point to a defendant convicted at a  different time of a different fraud and sentenced to a term of imprisonment shorter than Treadwell's does not  create an ""unwarranted"" sentencing disparity. For one thing, we aren't presented with the records in the cases  on which Treadwell relies when he argues that other fraud defendants got off better than him. Moreover,  sentencing disparity is only one factor a court considers in crafting an individualized sentence under § 3553(a).  A district court need not, and, [*30]  as a practical matter, cannot compare a proposed sentence to the  sentence of every criminal defendant who has ever been sentenced before. Too many factors dictate the  exercise of sound sentencing discretion in a particular case to make the inquiry Treadwell urges helpful or even  feasible. Id. at 1011-12 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). Zitlalpopoca's approach is as flawed as the argument dismissed in Treadwell. And even though Treadwell was  decided several years ago, Defendant has not offered (either in his briefing in this court or in his appellate briefing)  any reason to overlook Treadwell. Zitlalpopoca may not discuss it, but it remains the law of the circuit. See United  States v. Kahre, 737 F.3d 554, 583 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Treadwell, 593 F.3d at 1012); see also U.S. v. Burgum,  633 F.3d 810, 813-14 (9th Cir. 2011) (""The district court was not required to conform the sentence to those imposed  in similar cases . . . . [D]ivergence from sentences imposed in similar cases is permissible so long as the court is  attentive to relevant sentencing factors""). G. Final Points 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53523, *27 Page 12 of 16   1. No national average data Two final points deserve mention. In his memorandum, Defendant attempts to identify a national average sentence.  However, national sentencing data is not published about the crime of transportation for prostitution/sex (e.g., 18  U.S.C. §§ 2421; 2422(a)). [*31]  For example, on appeal Defendant incorrectly claimed that one could look to the  Annual Report of the U.S. Sentencing Commission to establish that his sentence was an unwarranted disparity.  Defendant incorrectly relied on data concerning the Commission's primary offense category of ""sexual abuse.""  However, Defendant's assumption is wrong. The crime of transportation for prostitution/sex (§ 2422(a)) is not  counted by the Commission in the primary offense category of ""sexual abuse."" In fact, it is not counted separately  at all. Prior to 2010, the data was included in a different primary offense category labeled  ""Pornography/Prostitution."" See U.S. Sentencing Commission, 2016 Annual Report and 2016 Sourcebook of  Federal Sentencing Statistics, at S-167. Since 2010, the Commission averages the data in a catch-all category of  ""Other Miscellaneous Offenses."" Consequently, Defendant's entire argument based upon the Sentencing  Commission reporting rests on a faulty foundation.                                  2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53523, *30 Page 13 of 16   2. Concurrent vs. consecutive sentences Lastly, Defendant never addresses the fact that he was found guilty of multiple crimes having different elements  and against multiple victims. As a result, Defendant never addresses the Court's decision to impose concurrent or  consecutive sentences. Whether sentences run concurrent or consecutive is within the court's discretion under 18  U.S.C. § 3584. See e.g., U.S. v. Werle, Case No. 14cr041-JLQ, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104350, 2016 WL 4205354  *5 (E.D. Wash. Aug. 8, 2016) (180-month concurrent sentence vacated on appeal and reimposed as 140-month  consecutive sentences pursuant to § 3584). In Zitlalpopoca's case, the total length of the sentence is composed of  multiple sentences. Some run concurrently. Some run consecutively. On this point, Defendant is silent. IV. THE § 3553(a) FACTORS APPLIED TO ZITLALPOPOCA This Court finds that its sentence orally pronounced on December 19, 2017 is sufficient, but not greater than  necessary. The Court has discussed from the bench on several occasions its analysis of the § 3553(a) (1) through  (5) sentencing factors as applied to Zitlalpopoca. The reasons and explanations given at each sentencing hearing  are re-adopted here. These comments are made simply for the purpose of further explanation. During its sentencing hearings, [*33]  the Court has used strong language such as ""predator"" and ""vulnerable""  victim. These terms are used carefully to accurately describe the Defendant's criminal actions and the female  victims, respectively. In ordinary English usage, a predator is: ""A person who ruthlessly exploits others; 'a sexual  predator.'"" Oxford Living Dictionary, https://en.oxforddictionaries.com ; see also Oxford Learning Dictionary,  https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com (predator: "" person or an organization that uses weaker people for their  own advantage""). This correctly described Defendant's criminal behavior. Was his behavior ""egregious?"" Yes it  was. As one dictionary defines the word, his criminal behavior was ""conspicuously bad or offensive."" American  Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, https://www.ahdictionary.com .; cf. U.S. v. Bernardo, 818 F.3d 983,  985 (9th Cir. 2016) (affirming Guidelines enhancement for ""egregious"" conduct of alien smuggling by strapping a  woman inside a car dashboard). Similarly, to describe the two individual female victims in this case, the adjective ""vulnerable"" was used according to  the ordinary meaning given in English usage — not in the legal sense defined by U.S.S.G. § 3A1.1(b) (examples of  this include individuals who are ""unusually [*34]  vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or who are  otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.""). See U.S.S.G. § 3A1.1, cmt. n. 2. In ordinary usage,  ""vulnerable""  means  ""able  to  be  easily  hurt,  influenced,  or  attacked.""  Cambridge  Dictionary,  https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english . This is precisely what this Court meant when it described  Annabel and Florencia. These victims were vulnerable. These victims were unlike those in other § 2422 cases (and  the cases under the predecessor statute) where women who were already prostitutes were simply recruited to  travel from place A to place B. There can be little argument that there is a difference in actual vulnerability when  one compares an adult prostitute who is recruited to travel to another place to work, and Annabel and Florencia.  Some may believe that these young girls were not vulnerable in the ordinary sense. This Court vehemently  disagrees. This Court has considered the types of punishment available. The Court could have imposed a within-Guidelines  sentence. Acknowledging that the Guidelines are the starting point for determining a sentence, the Guidelines  would be as follows:           2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53523, *32 Page 14 of 16       The Court finds that a Guidelines sentence does not fully account for all of Defendant' conduct. The Court is  required to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of three years for the convictions under § 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii) and  could have imposed a maximum sentence of 240 months on the § 2422(a) conviction or consecutive sentences on  all counts. That sentence, however, would in this Court's view, be greater than necessary. The Court considered all of the § 3553(a) factors. Some considerations deserve highlighting. Concerning the  seriousness of the offense, there can be no doubt that human trafficking is a serious offense. This Defendant  operated a sophisticated sex trafficking organization. He preyed upon the vulnerability of at least two young  women, one of whom was a minor when he first recruited and groomed her. During his course of conduct he lied,  played on their emotions, isolated them, brutally beat them, and smuggled them into the United States with one  intention - to use their bodies for sale. Concerning Defendant's history and characteristics, it is noted that Defendant has illegally entered into the United  States [*36]  on several occasions. He has been removed, deported or excluded on July 17, 1998, August 1, 1998,  May 24, 2001, and December 16, 2004. He was arrested on January 1, 1996 and was charged with violating Calif.  Penal Code § 245(a)(1) Assault Great Bodily Injury and with a Deadly Weapon. For whatever reason the charges  were ultimately dismissed. He was convicted on May 23, 2001 on charges of misdemeanor burglary in violation of  Calif. Penal Code § 459 and Cal. Vehicle Code § 10852 for tampering with a vehicle. He admitted that, ""I did break  and enter another vehicle with intent to commit theft."" There is no credible evidence that he has ever held an honest job in the United States or elsewhere. There is no  credible evidence that the Defendant has any meaningful or close family ties except those members of his family  who were participants in the offenses. Defendant has argued that he maintains relationships with his children. This Court notes there is no evidence that  the relationship is close. Worthy of note is that this Defendant has been before this Court on four sentencing  occasions, yet not once has the Defendant submitted any letters of support from his children or others. Defendant  has expressed remorse, but it is impossible to determine if he really is remorseful [*37]  or whether his remorse is  feigned. That he has a motive to feign remorse can hardly be questioned. Concerning the sentencing factors of protecting the public and deterring further criminal conduct (§§ 3553(a)(2)(B)  and (C)), a special comment is deserved. Section 3553(a) provides that the sentence should provide general and  specific deterrence. In the usual case, a judge is required to predict the length of sentence that will both deter  further criminal conduct and protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. But in this case, the salutary  effect of the sentence imposed has been admitted by the Defendant, himself. Assuming, without conceding that  Defendant's assertions are true, it is self-evident that this Court's sentence has served as a deterrent to Defendant  and his trafficking family and protected the public. According to defense counsel at the hearing, Defendant has had a change of mind and will not engage in this same  criminal conduct upon his release. Counsel has reported that Defendant told her, ""about the first year after he was  caught . . . he thought, well, this case is going to blow over . . . And I can just wait it out and then I'll go back to  Mexico, and I'll take this up again and do what [*38]  I was doing before."" Over time, he has changed, according to  his counsel. Now, after serving his sentence, Defendant wants to return to Mexico and work with his father in his  business buying and selling livestock. In other words, deterrence has been achieved, assuming the report is  accurate. Moreover, family members who were formerly engaged in his criminal prostitution business, have turned away  from crime and are pursuing other kinds of work. Defense counsel has explained, ""I think as the records show, his  family was somewhat involved in — in this business. As a result of Mr. Zitlalpopoca's letters, and the sentence  received in this case, his family has turned away."" The sentence has proven to be effective in deterring criminal  conduct. 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53523, *35 Page 15 of 16   Concerning the protection of the public, because Defendant has become a different person, and because of his  sentence, other vulnerable women have been saved from suffering the fates of Annabel and Florencia. According to  Defendant's counsel, Mr. Zitlalpopoca is very grateful to the Court because not only has he become a different person, but because  of what the Court has done, probably numerous women in Mexico have not suffered the same fates as the  victims [*39]  in this case. Transcript of Proceedings on December 19, 2017, at 5 (emphasis added); see also Defendant's Sentencing  Memorandum (filed December 7, 2017), at 11 (""[H]is family slowly began to disentangle themselves from the  prostitution business and take up other vocations . . . . Mr. Zitlalpopoca has not only reformed himself, he has  reformed his family, and by so doing has likely prevented dozens of women from becoming involved in the  prostitution trade.""). Once again, assuming the report is accurate, the sentence has already had an effect on  protecting the public. The Court, of course, takes Defendant's contrition and representations as to his family's disentanglement with a  grain of salt. That convicted defendants will have a motive to paint the proverbial rosy picture is well known. Cf.  Nielson v. United States, 24 F.2d 802, 803 (9th Cir. 1928) (defendant's statement, ""was so obviously self-serving  that the question of the propriety of excluding it requires no discussion.""). Additionally, the Court notes Defendant's  self-professed relationship with his daughter and his family's ""disentanglement."" Yet, no corroborating or supporting  evidence has been submitted to this Court at any of the sentencing hearings. In well over 2,600 sentencing [*40]   hearings that this Court has presided over it is not unusual, in fact, it is quite common for letters of support and  corroborating evidence to be submitted at the sentencing hearing. The lack of such evidence in this case is highly  suspect. Finally, while the sentence already imposed has protected the public at large from the scourge of human sex  trafficking, it could be said that it has also protected individual women from being smuggled into the United States  to suffer the emotional and psychological damage of this type of crime. Annabel filed a victim impact statement at the original sentencing. See Statement (filed June 7, 2010) (Docket No.  121-2). In her victim impact statement Annabel said: ""The psychological and physical damages have been severe  and unforgettable""; ""At the moment I am undergoing therapy""; ""The psychological damages . . . are irreparable""; ""Is  there any woman, by any chance, that deserves the suffering, the shame, the enslavement I went through?""; and ""I  still feel very affected in every aspect of my life . . . ."" Florencia also filed a victim impact statement. See Sentencing Document (filed Dec. 17, 2017) (Docket No. 225). In  her statement she said: ""You isolated [*41]  me from the world because I was afraid of an evil person like you. I  wish that I never met you, that this was all a dream. I had nightmares for the longest [time]. You affected my life  physically [and] psychologically in so many ways."" She reflected, ""You preyed on young naive women who were  vulnerable targets."" It has been argued that there was no lasting emotional or psychological injury to the victims. However, this Court  chooses to believe the victims. Psychologists may not have opined at trial about the psychological damage suffered          2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53523, *38 Page 16 of 16   by Annabel and Florencia, but it was clear to hear and see. To find lasting psychological harm where two young  women were duped into selling their bodies to hundreds of men, to line Defendant's pockets and the pockets of his  family, coupled with degrading and at times violent conduct, does not require specialized knowledge or skill. As the  Defendant's own briefing acknowledges, But after the enormity of his conduct and the consequences of it began to sink in, Mr. Zitlalpopoca began to  feel deeply ashamed of what he had done. He realized the emotional, psychological, sexual, and physical  damage he had inflicted on Ms. Calixto and Ms. de la Cruz. He realized [*42]  . . . he had ruined both his own  life and the lives of his victims and his family members. Defendant's Sentencing Memorandum (filed December 7, 2017), at 10. Given Defendant's conduct and the harm to  Annabel and Florencia, this Court believes its sentence is just punishment. Having considered all of the above pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act, this Court has sentenced the Defendant  to a total sentence of 200 months. Given that the Defendant has admitted his participation in this sophisticated  trafficking organization, his admission that his sex trafficking has and would have caused harm to other women  and given the harm to Florencia as reflected in her victim impact statement, this Court finds that a fine of $250 is  appropriate. The Defendant shall also pay a penalty assessment of $100 per count for a total of $700. The Court  finds that the $5,000 JVTA assessment is not applicable. And finally, the Defendant shall be on three years of  supervised release for each count, concurrently, on the conditions previously stated at the oral sentencing hearing  and in the written conditions of supervised release attached to the Judgment, which are incorporated herein by  reference.",1
"United States v. Friend, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 32368","[*1] Appeal from the United States District Court for the  Eastern District of Virginia, at Norfolk. John A. Gibney,  Jr., Senior District Judge. (2:22-cr-00042-JAG-RJK-1) Submitted: November 30, 2023 Decided: December 7,  2023 Before WILKINSON and HARRIS, Circuit Judges, and  TRAXLER, Senior Circuit Judge. Vacated and remanded by unpublished per curiam  opinion. ON BRIEF: Geremy C. Kamens, Federal Public  Defender, Frances H. Pratt, Assistant Federal Public  Defender, Keith Loren Kimball, Assistant Federal Public  Defender, OFFICE OF THE FEDERAL PUBLIC  DEFENDER,  Alexandria,  Virginia,  for  Appellant.  Jacqueline Romy Bechara, Alexandria, Virginia, Emily  Rebecca Gantt, OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES  ATTORNEY, Norfolk, Virginia, for Appellee. Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this  circuit. PER CURIAM: Christafer Douglas Friend seeks to appeal the life  sentence imposed following his guilty plea, pursuant to  a written plea agreement, to attempted sex trafficking of  a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 1591(a)(1),  (b)(1). The district court additionally imposed a lifetime  term  of  supervised  release.  Friend  raises  two  challenges on appeal. First, he contends that his life  sentence  is  substantively  and  procedurally  unreasonable. [*2]  Second, he argues that the district  court reversibly erred by including a discretionary  condition of supervised release (the ""special computer  condition"") * in the written judgment that it did not orally  pronounce at sentencing. Friend contends that this error  requires us to vacate his sentence and remand for  resentencing. Invoking the waiver of appeal rights contained in the  plea agreement, the Government has moved to dismiss  the appeal to the extent Friend challenges the  reasonableness of his sentence. The Government also  moves to vacate, in part. It acknowledges the district  court's error in failing to pronounce the special computer  condition and concedes that this argument is not barred  by the appeal waiver. However, the Government argues  that, for various reasons, a full resentencing is  inappropriate. * This condition mandates that Friend shall not own or have a computer in his residence or  place of employment. Also, the defendant shall not use  a computer to access any online computer services in  any location, including employment, without the prior  approval of the probation officer. This includes any  Page 2 of 2 internet service provider bulletin board systems, or any  other public or private [*3]  computer network. (J.A. 154). ""J.A."" refers to the joint appendix filed by the  parties in this appeal. 2 A district court is required to orally pronounce at  sentencing all discretionary conditions of supervised  release. United States v. Rogers, 961 F.3d 291, 296  (4th Cir. 2020); see also United States v. Singletary  (Singletary I), 984 F.3d 341, 345 (4th Cir. 2021). This  requirement ""is a critical part of the defendant's right to  be present at sentencing,"" Rogers, 961 F.3d at 300 (internal quotation marks  omitted), and ensures the defendant has an opportunity  to challenge unwarranted conditions before they are  imposed, id. at 298. The usual remedy for a  Rogers/Singletary error is to vacate the sentence and  remand for a full resentencing. See Singletary I, 984  F.3d at 346 & n.4. The Government argues that, in light of Friend's life  sentence, a full resentencing is unwarranted because  Friend ""likely will never be subject to the challenged  condition."" The Government therefore suggests that the  appropriate remedy is either simply to vacate the special  computer condition, or to vacate the condition and  remand for resentencing on that condition only.  However, ""defendants with valid Singletary claims are  entitled to a full vacatur of their sentences and remand  for resentencing."" United States v. Singletary (Singletary II), 75 F.4th 416, 427 n.7 (4th Cir. 2023)  (noting, however, that defendants raising such claims  can ""elect to request a narrower [*4]  remedy, in the  form of a limited remand on only the challenged  conditions""). Friend does not request a narrower  remedy. Although the Government attempts to distinguish these  cases, we find the Government's arguments for  departing from our established precedent unpersuasive.  We have recognized that ""custodial and supervised  release terms [are] components of one unified  sentence."" United States v. Ketter, 908 F.3d 61, 65 (4th  Cir. 2018); see SingletaryI, 984 F.3d at 346 & n.4  (rejecting suggestion to ""simply . . . strike"" challenged  conditions 3 from written judgment and reiterating that ""Rogers drew  no distinction between the defendant's supervised  release  sentence  and  his  custodial  sentence"").  Accordingly, we find that the usual remedy for a Rogers  error is appropriate in this case. Because this ""leaves us  with no occasion to reach [Friend's] other arguments,""  Singletary I, 984 F.3d at 346, we deny the Government's  motion. We therefore vacate Friend's sentence and remand for  resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because  the facts and legal contentions are adequately  presented in the materials before this court and  argument would not aid the decisional process. VACATED AND REMANDED 4",1
"A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int_l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150391","OPINION AND ORDER This matter comes before the Court on review of  defendant Tampa Bay Hotels, LLC Motion to Dismiss  Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint, or in the  Alternative, Motion to Strike (Doc. #50) filed on May 23,  2023, and defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc.'s  Motion  to  Dismiss  Plaintiff's  Second  Amended  Complaint (Doc. #51) filed on June 1, 2023. Plaintiff filed  a Consolidated Response in Opposition (Doc. #56) on  July 3, 2023. Both defendants filed Replies. (Docs. ##  60, 61.) Plaintiff filed a Notice [*2]  of Supplemental  Authority (Doc. #62) on August 8, 2023. I. On April 19, 2023, the Court granted in part defendants'  motions to dismiss with leave to file an Amended  Complaint. A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., No. 2:22-CV- 648-JES-NPM, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68586, 2023 WL  3004547, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 19, 2023). On May 9,  2023, plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (Doc.  #46) and defendants have now essentially renewed  their motions to dismiss. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a  Complaint must contain a ""short and plain statement of  the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.""  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).

Ct. 1955,  167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). In deciding a  Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court must accept  all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take  them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, Erickson v.  Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d  1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal conclusions without adequate  factual support are entitled to no assumption of truth,""  Mamani v. Berzaín, 654 F.3d 1148, 1153 (11th Cir.  2011) (citations omitted). Page 2 of 5 Plaintiff's (second) amended complaint is brought  pursuant  to  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act (TVPRA). As previously stated, The TVPRA is a criminal statute that also provides  a civil remedy to victims of sex trafficking. Section  1591(a) of the Act imposes criminal liability for  certain sex trafficking: (a) Whoever [*3]  knowingly-- (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or  within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction  of the United States, recruits, entices, harbors,  transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains,  patronizes, or solicits by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C.A. § 1591(a). In addition to a criminal  punishment, the TVPRA provides the following civil  remedy: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have [*4]  known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Thus, the TVRPA authorizes a victim of sex  trafficking to bring a direct civil claim against the  perpetrator of the trafficking and a ""beneficiary"" civil  claim  against  ""whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of [the TVPRA]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). To  state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA, Plaintiff must plausibly allege that the  defendant ""(1) knowingly benefited (2) from  participating in a venture; (3) that venture violated  the TVPRA as to [A.D.]; and (4) [Defendants] knew or should have known that  the venture violated the TVPRA as to [A.D.]."" Doe  v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 726 (11th Cir.  2021). A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  68586, [WL] at *2. The Court will consider each of the  elements as applied to the amended pleading. II. The operative amended complaint alleges the following:  Defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc. (Choice  Hotels) knows and has known for years that sex  trafficking and prostitution occur at their branded hotel  locations. Defendant Tampa Bay Hotels, LLC [*5]   (Tampa Bay) also knows and has known for years of  both occurring specifically at the Comfort Suites at  Fairgrounds Casino (Comfort Suites) located in Tampa,  Florida. (Doc. #46, ¶¶ 2-3.) This action for damages is  brought by the Plaintiff, identified by her initials A.D., a  survivor of sex trafficking under the TVPRA. (Id. at ¶  12.) ""With knowledge of the problem, and as a direct and  proximate result of Defendants' multiple failures and  refusals to act, mandate, establish, execute, and/or  modify their anti-trafficking efforts at the Comfort Suites  hotel, A.D. was continuously sex trafficked, sexually  exploited, and victimized repeatedly at the Comfort  Suites hotel."" (Id. at ¶ 18.) Plaintiff alleges that  defendants ""participated in a hotel operating venture  and knowingly benefited from this venture through room  rentals, profits, third party fees, and the value of the  ""good will"" of the Choice® brand. The venture knew or  should have known that they were profiting from sex  trafficking, including the sex trafficking of A.D., in  violation of the TVPRA."" (Id. at ¶ 19.) Plaintiff further alleges that Choice Hotels and Tampa  Bay participated in a hotel operating venture that  included staff at [*6]  the Comfort Suites. Tampa Bay  owns the Comfort Suites pursuant to a franchise  agreement entered into with Choice Hotels. Plaintiff  alleges an agency relationship through Choice Hotels'  ""exercise of ongoing and systemic right of control over  the Comfort Suites hotel."" (Id. at ¶¶ 29-32.) Choice  Hotels makes decisions that directly impact the  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150391, *2 Page 3 of 5 operations and maintenance of their branded hotels,  including the Comfort Suites. (Id. at ¶ 39.) Tampa Bay  directly offered public lodging services at the Comfort  Suites where A.D. was trafficked for sex. (Id. at ¶ 49.)  Defendants ""participated in a hotel operating venture in  connection with the management and operating of the  Comfort Suites hotel involving risk and potential profit.""  (Id. at ¶ 52.) During at least 2008 to 2012, emails were exchanged by  employees of Choice Hotels that related to sex  trafficking in hotels, including the Comfort Suites. (Id. at  ¶ 57.) Choice Hotels had actual and/or constructive  knowledge of sex trafficking, including A.D.'s sex  trafficking and victimization, occurring on its branded  property. (Id. at ¶ 63.) Choice Hotels continued to permit  and profit from male clientele who rented hotel rooms to  buy sex despite having [*7]  access to sex trafficking  indicators. (Id. at ¶ 75.) Defendants ""had actual or  constructive knowledge of law enforcement activity at  the Comfort Suites hotel reporting sexual battery, drug  dealing and other illicit activities occurring at the hotel.""  (Id. at ¶ 87.) Tampa Bay employees and staff openly observed signs  of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. Tampa Bay  received revenue and a percentage was provided to  Choice Hotels. (Id. at ¶ 104.) Through Choice Hotels'  relationship with the staff at the Comfort Suites, it  benefited or received royalty payments, licensing fees,  membership fees and dues, reservation fees, and  percentages of the gross room revenue. (Id. at ¶ 105.)  Through their ""continuous business venture of renting  hotel rooms"", Tampa Bay knowingly benefited. (Id. at ¶  107.) Plaintiff alleges that defendants benefit from the  steady stream of income that sex traffickers bring to  their hotel brands and from their reputation for privacy,  discretion, and the facilitation of commercial sex. (Id., ¶¶  116-117.) III. As previously stated, plaintiff must sufficiently plead that  a defendant knowingly benefited from participating in a  venture, that the venture violated the TVPRA, [*8]  and  that defendants knew or should have known that the  venture violated the TVPRA. A. Knowingly Benefited To satisfy the first element of a TVPRA beneficiary  claim, plaintiff must allege that defendant ""knew it was  receiving some value from participating in the alleged  venture."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. As the  Eleventh Circuit stated, ""Knowingly benefits"" means ""an awareness or  understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of  mind in which a person has no substantial doubt  about the existence of a fact."" Knowledge, Black's  Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). And Section  1595(a) explains that a defendant may benefit  ""financially or by receiving anything of value.""  Accordingly, a plaintiff like the Does must allege  that the defendant knew it was receiving some  value from participating in the alleged venture. Id. at 723-24. In the absence of a more stringent  statutory pleading requirement, knowledge ""may be  alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Alleging a  ""continuous business relationship"" is sufficient to show a  knowing benefit. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22- 2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015,  at *16 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023). The Court previously  found this element could be satisfied at this stage of the  proceedings. A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 68586, [WL] at *3. B. Participation in Venture - Franchisor Plaintiff must allege that the benefits received by Choice  Hotels were from ""participation in [*9]  a venture"" which  defendants knew or should have known has engaged in  an act in violation of the TVPRA. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a).  The Eleventh Circuit rejected the statutory definition of  ""participation in a venture"" found in the criminal  provision, § 1591(e)(4), which defined ""participation in a  venture""  as  ""knowingly  assisting,  supporting  or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)."" Instead, the  Eleventh Circuit held that ""participation in a venture"" in  the civil context requires that plaintiff allege that the  franchisor ""took part in a common undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit."" Red Roof  Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture and knowingly benefited from this  venture through room rentals, profits, third party fees,  and the value of the ""good will"" of the Choice® brand.  The venture knew or should have known that they were  profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking  of A.D., in violation of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #46, ¶ 19.)  Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture"" in connection with the Comfort Suites  for potential profit. (Id. at ¶ 52.) Plaintiff alleges that  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150391, *6 Page 4 of 5 Choice  Hotels  ""had  actual  and/or  constructive  knowledge of sex [*10]  trafficking, including A.D.'s sex  trafficking and victimization,"" at its branded property and  it ""failed to implement and enforce any of its own policy  or policies and protect Plaintiff A.D. from being sex  trafficked"", failed to take action to prevent trafficking so  that it could continue to profit, and failed to address the  open and obvious presence of human trafficking on  hotel properties. (Id. at ¶ 63.) Choice Hotels is alleged to  have  demonstrated  actual  and/or  constructive  knowledge of the ""rampant culture of sex trafficking"" at  their properties around the country, including through  news stories and online reviews. (Id. at ¶ 78.) These additional facts in the Second Amended  Complaint do not remedy the problem in the original  pleading as to Choice Hotels. ""[A]s the Eleventh Circuit  has acknowledged, the alleged venture can be a  'commercial venture' like running or expanding a  business. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22-2621,  2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *6  (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023) (citing Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21  F.4th at 727 (emphasis added)). However, as before,  ""[t]he 'participation' in the sex trafficking venture is  essentially that the franchisor and the hotel operator did  not fight hard enough to keep these traffickers from  using their hotel. The Complaint acknowledges that  Defendants opposed sex traffickers, [*11]  but fault  defendants for taking ineffective steps to curtail the  traffickers. This hardly sounds like participating in a  venture."" A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 68586, [WL] at *4. The Court finds that Choice Hotels must be dismissed  because the Second Amended Complaint does not  sufficiently plead that it participated in a sex trafficking  venture beyond participation in shared revenue as part  of its normal role as a franchisor. Red Roof Inns, Inc.,  21 F.4th at 726-27 (""These allegations may suggest that  the franchisors financially benefitted from renting hotel  rooms to the Does' sex traffickers. But they do nothing  to show that the franchisors participated in a common  undertaking involving risk or profit that violated the  TVPRA—i.e., the alleged sex trafficking ventures.""). C. Participation in Venture - Franchisee ""In order to plead Defendants participated in a venture,  Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court could  reasonably infer the hotels 'could be said to have a tacit  agreement' with the trafficker. Plaintiff need not show  that  defendants  had  actual  knowledge  of  the  participation in the sex-trafficking venture."" Doe v.  Rickey Patel, LLC, No. 0:20-60683-WPD-CIV, 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (S.D.  Fla. Sept. 30, 2020) (citation omitted). In other words,  plaintiff can show a ""continuous business relationship""  to show participation. J.G. v. Northbrook Indus., Inc.,  619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1235 (N.D. Ga. 2022); S.Y. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 519 F. Supp. 3d 1069,  1081 (M.D. Fla. 2021). As to Tampa Bay, the 'participation' [*12]  is based upon  the relationship between the traffickers and the hotel.  Trafficker 2 routinely instructed A.D. to rent multiple  rooms in her name using cash with one room facing the  parking lot to monitor when buyers would arrive. There  would be ""a parade of unregistered male guests coming  in and out of the hotel room at all times of day."" (Doc.  #46, ¶¶ 95-96.) ""The rooms were rented by night and  the next morning A.D. in her disheveled, drug induced  state, would go to the front desk and extend the stay.""  (Id. at ¶ 97a.) Other red flags include excessive  requests for sheets, a personal relationship between  staff and the trafficker, and direct employee encounters.  (Id. at ¶ 97j-l.) These facts at least plausibly infer that employees of the  Comfort Suites were participating in an enterprise  involving risk and knowingly benefiting from the risk.  Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 725 (citing Ricchio v.  McLean, 853 F.3d 553, 556-58 (1st Cir. 2017) (agreeing  with First Circuit that an operator's association with  traffickers to serve a business objective establishes  participation in a venture with a sex trafficker). D. Knowledge This element requires the plaintiff to allege that the  defendant had either actual or constructive knowledge  that the venture violated the TVPRA as to the  plaintiff. [*13]  Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725.  Knowledge requires an awareness or understanding of  a fact or circumstance, while constructive knowledge is  knowledge that one should have 'using reasonable care  or diligence'. Id. (citing Black's Law Dictionary). The 'red flags' supporting knowledge include payments  in cash, large amounts of used condoms and bodily  fluids on the sheets and towels, A.D.'s physical  appearance, excessive requests for sheets and cleaning  services, the personal relationship with staff and A.D.'s  trafficker, and the direct employee encounters with A.D.  and her trafficker inside the Comfort Suites. (Doc. #46, ¶  99.) Tampa Bay employees and staff openly observed  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150391, *9 Page 5 of 5 signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. (Id. at ¶ 104.) The Court finds these facts are sufficient to plausibly  allege knowledge at this stage of the proceedings. An  overt or direct act is not required. See, e.g., K.H. v. Riti,  Inc., No. 1:22-CV-3404-MHC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  93374, 2023 WL 3644224, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 17,  2023) (collecting cases of direct association between  hotel and trafficker); J.C. v.

Supp. 3d 1228, 1239 (N.D. Ga. 2022)  (employees acted as lookouts for Plaintiff's traffickers). Accordingly, it is now ORDERED: 1. Defendant Tampa Bay Hotels, LLC Motion to  Dismiss  Plaintiffs'  Second  Amended  Complaint, [*14]  or in the Alternative, Motion to  Strike (Doc. #50) is DENIED. 2. Defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc.'s  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended  Complaint (Doc. #51) is GRANTED and defendant  is dismissed with prejudice. DONE AND ORDERED at Fort Myers, Florida, this 25th  day of August 2023. /s/ John E. Steele JOHN E. STEELE SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150391, *13",1
"Richardson v. NW Univ., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 168742","MOO Hayden Richardson alleges that, as a member of the  Northwestern University cheerleading [*2]  team, she  suffered sexual assaults and sexual harassment at the  hands of fans, alumni, and donors at tailgates, alumni  fundraising events, and a private University club. Worse,  Richardson alleges that the head cheerleading coach  intentionally put Richardson and the other women  cheerleaders into the gauntlet of those assaulters, with  the explicit purpose that the cheerleaders flirt with the  fans, alumni, and donors, and knowing that the assaults  would be the result. On top of that, after Richardson  complained to University and Athletics Department  leaders about the assaults, the leaders did little to stop  the victimization. In a 256-paragraph complaint, Richardson first asserts  that Northwestern's mishandling of her cries for help  violated  federal  anti-discrimination  statute  and  regulations  governing  educational  institutions,  commonly known as Title XI, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq.  R. 1, Compl. Those two Title IX counts (Counts 1 and  2)  target  Northwestern  as  the  defendant,  and  Northwestern has not moved to dismiss those claims.  Three other counts—labelled Counts 3, 4, and 5—bring  claims under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act  against Northwestern and other defendants. R. 1,  Compl. Count 3 cites to 18 U.S.C. § 1590, R. 1 at 40,                  Page 2 of 13 which prohibits trafficking in forced [*3]  labor, and is  asserted against the University itself, as well as Heather  Obering (the former Associate Athletic Director for  Marketing); Amanda DaSilva (the former Deputy Title IX  Coordinator); Michael Polisky (the former Deputy  Director of Athletics); and Pamela Bonnevier (the former  head coach of the cheerleading team). Compl. ¶¶  19-22. Count 4 asserts that the Defendants violated the  sex-trafficking prohibition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §  1591. Id. at 44-48. The final federal law claim, Count 5,  alleges that the Defendants violated the ban against  forced labor, 18 U.S.C. § 1589. Richardson also brings state law breach-of-contract and  promissory-estoppel claims against Northwestern, and a  state law claim for intentional infliction of emotional  distress against Bonnevier. Compl. ¶¶ 238-49, 250-56.  For the reasons discussed in this Opinion, the motions  to dismiss are granted in part and denied in part. The  motions to dismiss the claims for forced-labor trafficking  (Count 3), sex trafficking (Count 4), and forced labor  (Count 5) are denied as to all of the Defendants. The  state law claims for breach of contract and estoppel  (Counts 6 and 7) are dismissed, for now without  prejudice. The emotional-distress claim (Count [*4]  8)  against Bonnevier survives. I. Background For purposes of this motion, the Court accepts as true  the factual allegations in the Complaint, Erickson v.  Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d  1081 (2007), as well as those in Richardson's response  brief (but only to the extent that the allegations in the  brief are consistent with the Complaint), see Heng v.  Heavner, Beyers & Mihlar, LLC, 849 F.3d 348, 354 (7th  Cir. 2017). See also Thompson v. Ill. Dep't of Prof. Reg.,  300 F.3d 750, 753 (7th Cir. 2002) (on a Rule 12(b)(6)              motion, the pleadings ""consist generally of the  complaint, any exhibits attached thereto, and supporting  briefs."") (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c)). Hayden  Richardson  transferred  to  Northwestern  University in 2018 to begin her sophomore year of  college. R. 1, Compl. ¶¶ 47-48. An avid cheerleader for  most of her life, Richardson began looking into  Northwestern's cheerleading team soon after she  transferred. Id. ¶¶ 45, 49. After viewing the cheerleading  team's website and social-media accounts, Richardson  contacted the head coach, Pamela Bonnevier, about  joining the team. Id. ¶¶ 49-50. Bonnevier asked  Richardson to submit videos of her cheerleading skills,  including in performing stunts. Id. After viewing the  videos, Bonnevier quickly accepted Richardson onto the  team. Id. For her participation on the team, Richardson received  scholarships in both 2019 and 2020. Compl. ¶ 51. In  2019, she received a $5,500 scholarship, [*5]  and in  2020 the scholarship amount was $4,041. Id. As part of  joining the team, Richardson was required to sign a  contract. Id. ¶ 55 The contract, referred to by  Richardson as the Spirit Squad Contract, laid out the  terms of her membership on the cheerleading team. Id.  The contract required team members to attend all home  games and tournaments, in addition to any other events  dictated  by  the  coaching  staff.  Id.  Throughout  Richardson's two cheerleading seasons, these events  mostly included tailgating, alumni donor events, and  appearances at the University's limited-membership  Wilson Club. Id. ¶¶ 55, 100. When Richardson attended  any of these events, she and the other female  cheerleaders were required to wear their cheer  uniforms. Id. ¶¶ 2-3, 57, 64, 67. The women's cheer  uniforms were scant and exposed much of the women's  bodies—yet the men's cheer uniforms did not. Id. ¶¶ 57,  64, 67. The contract also stated that if a team member  were to quit or be asked to leave the team, then the  cheerleader would be required to repay the University  for the cheerleading scholarship, as well as for all fees  and expenses associated with the cheerleading  events—including travel, food, equipment, and [*6]   camp costs. Id. ¶¶ 55, 101. A. Bonnevier Bonnevier was the head coach of the cheerleading team  throughout Richardson's two seasons on the team.  Compl. ¶¶ 22, 95. As the 2018-2019 cheer season  began, Bonnevier told the women cheerleaders that  Page 3 of 13 their top priorities were to keep fans happy and always  appear as ""fun girls."" Id. ¶ 56. Richardson understood  this instruction to especially apply to keeping alumni- donor fans happy. See id. ¶ 63. Throughout both 2019  and 2020, Bonnevier acknowledged that some fans  might be ""creepy,"" but that the cheerleaders must  endure taking photos with fans even if they moved their  hands to inappropriate places or made the cheerleaders  feel  uncomfortable.  Id.  Bonnevier's  pre-season  prophesies came true: on multiple occasions, fans  touched Richardson's breasts and buttocks. Id. ¶ 58.  Richardson alleges multiple specific instances of these  assaults, including at a game in September 2018 when  Bonnevier directly instructed Richardson to take photos  with fans, and those fans touched Richardson's breasts.  Id. ¶ 59. During another incident of inappropriate  touching that season, Bonnevier gave Richardson's full  name to a group of intoxicated fans, who then not  surprisingly [*7]  threatened to find her after the game.  Id. ¶¶ 61-63. In addition to instances in which Bonnevier  acted as a liaison between Richardson and the alumni  fans, Bonnevier also instructed Richardson and other  women cheerleaders not to eat before games and to  undress and change in public view on the team bus;  Bonnevier also isolated the women from one another  whenever she wanted the cheerleaders to interact with  as many as donors as possible, and also controlled the  cheerleaders' access to the restroom. Id. ¶¶ 71-74, 76- 78, 81. As the season progressed, Bonnevier made it clear that  Richardson and the other cheerleaders were required  not only to attend sporting tailgates, but also specific  alumni-donor events and to make appearances at the  University's exclusive donor club, the Wilson Club.  Compl. ¶¶ 57, 64-65, 100. The Wilson Club is a private  space available only to donors who contributed $6,000  or more—the highest donation bracket pertinent to the  Athletics Department. R. 48-2, Pl.'s Exh. 1, Fan Priority  Seating Order at 3. Yet Richardson's male teammates  were not required to attend the same alumni fundraising  events or make appearances at the Wilson Club.  Compl. ¶¶ 67, 164. On multiple [*8]  occasions  Bonnevier sent Richardson to the Wilson Club to flirt  with wealthy donors. Id. ¶ 57. Bonnevier made it clear to  Richardson that if Richardson did not follow the coach's  instructions, she would no longer be part of the team.  And if Richardson were no longer part of the team, she  would lose her sports scholarships and be responsible  for reimbursing the University for the scholarships and  myriad expenses. Id. ¶¶ 60, 101. B. Athletics Department Leadership & Title IX  Deputy Coordinator In addition to the accusations against Coach Bonnevier,  Richardson  alleges  misconduct  committed  by  Northwestern itself, through former University leaders  Polisky, Obering, and DaSilva. As a reminder, at the  time of the alleged misconduct, Polisky was the Deputy  Director of Athletics; Obering was the Associate Athletic  Director for Marketing; and DaSilva was the Deputy Title  IX Coordinator. Compl. ¶¶ 18-21. Before raising her  concerns with these University leaders, Richardson first  complained  about  Bonnevier's  conduct  to  the  cheerleading team's doctor. Id. ¶ 82. This discussion  happened on January 8, 2019 (as explained later in this  Opinion, the exact timing is important). Id. Richardson  told the [*9]  team doctor that Bonnevier had time and  again forced the female cheerleaders to attend—for the  University's  benefit—events  during  which  the  cheerleaders were sexually harassed and assaulted. Id.  The following day (January 9), Associate Athletic  Director Obering emailed Richardson to discuss the  allegations. Id. ¶ 83. Richardson told Obering about the  misconduct, and Obering in turn instructed Richardson  to gather testimonials and evidence from other students  to corroborate the allegations. Id. ¶¶ 84-85. Richardson  followed those instructions and submitted corroborating  materials. Id. ¶¶ 86-87. She also requested a meeting  with the University's then-Athletic Director, Jim Phillips,  but Deputy Athletic Director Polisky did not set up a  meeting with Phillips. Id. ¶ 87. On January 24, 2019, Richardson and a teammate met  with Obering and Polisky to discuss the alleged  misconduct. Id. ¶ 88. Both Obering and Polisky accused  Richardson of falsifying the corroborating student  testimonials and suggested that she had not done  enough to show that the allegations were true. Id. ¶¶ 8,  88. Despite the evidence that Richardson had brought  forward, the University's Title IX Office did not open a  formal investigation. [*10]  Id. ¶ 9. Around one week later, on February 1, 2019, DaSilva  (the Deputy Title IX Coordinator) reached out to  Richardson via email. Compl. ¶ 90. DaSilva's email to  Richardson mischaracterized Richardson's allegations,  including by asserting that Richardson had raised only  the single issue of one individual fan harassing her. Id.  In  response,  Richardson  corrected  DaSilva's  mischaracterization and set forth multiple dates and  events during which she was assaulted. Id. ¶ 91. A few  days later (on February 5), Richardson emailed Obering  to report that, although Bonnevier had been more  Page 4 of 13 organized at a recent basketball game, she ""still made  derogatory comments to members of the team  regarding their physical appearance ...."" Id. ¶ 92. In the  meantime, communication from DaSilva was sparse,  with just a general February 18 notification saying that  the Title IX Office was still working with Bonnevier to  address the situation. Id. ¶ 93. Then one month passed  with no more outreach from DaSilva, and eventually the  response petered out with an end to the ""training"" of  Bonnevier on April 17, 2019. Id. ¶¶ 93-95. So, instead of opening a Title XI investigation,  Bonnevier simply received some form of training [*11]   and was told that she could no longer force the  cheerleaders to attend tailgating events. Id. ¶ 11. The  tailgating stopped but the cheerleaders were still  required to attend alumni fundraising events. Id. ¶ 11. At  that time, the University took no other action was taken  against Bonnevier. Id. ¶¶ 94-95. At the end of May 2019, Richardson had a follow-up  meeting with Obering and Polisky. Id. ¶ 96. Richardson  told them that Bonnevier's problematic behavior was  ongoing, including the misconduct that she first told  them about in January 2019. Id. At some later date,  DaSilva finally started a formal investigation into the  ongoing alleged sexual misconduct. Id. ¶ 12. But during  the course of the investigation, DaSilva changed  Richardson's status from Title IX complainant to  witness. Id. ¶ 13. The change in status meant that  Richardson no longer had access to the status of the  investigation or its ultimate outcome. Id. ¶¶ 13-14. On  top of that change in status, the misconduct continued  into 2020. Id. ¶¶ 53, 102-03. II. Legal Standard Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a  complaint generally need only include ""a short and plain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This short and  plain [*12]  statement must ""give the defendant fair  notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon  which it rests."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,  555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)  (alteration in original) (cleaned up). The Seventh Circuit  has explained that this rule ""reflects a liberal notice      pleading regime, which is intended to 'focus litigation on  the merits of a claim' rather than on technicalities that  might keep plaintiffs out of court."" Brooks v. Ross, 578  F.3d 574, 580 (7th Cir. 2009) (quoting Swierkiewicz v.  Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 514, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L.  Ed. 2d 1 (2002)). ""A motion under Rule 12(b)(6) challenges the sufficiency  of the complaint to state a claim upon which relief may  be granted."" Hallinan v. Fraternal Order of Police of Chi.  Lodge No. 7, 570 F.3d 811, 820 (7th Cir. 2009). ""[A]  complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,  accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is  plausible on its face.'"" Ashcroft v.

These allegations ""must be  enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative  level."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. The allegations that  are entitled to the assumption of truth are those that are  factual, rather than mere legal conclusions. Iqbal, 556  U.S. at 678-79. III. Analysis A. Trafficking Victims Protection Act Forced Labor  (§ 1589) and Forced-Labor Trafficking (§ 1590) Generally speaking, the Trafficking Victims Protection  Act establishes criminal and civil penalties against  forcing a person, by deploying certain prohibited tactics,  to perform labor or services. 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589, 1590.  Section 1589(a) bans the primary conduct, that is,  knowingly providing or obtaining the labor or services of  a person by using [*13]  (among other things) force,  serious harm, abuse of law, or threats of any of those  things. § 1589(a)(1), (2), (3), (4). Section 1589(b)  prohibits knowingly benefiting from participation in a  venture that has provided or obtained forced labor by  the prohibited means, when the defendant knows or  recklessly disregards the fact that the venture has done  so. § 1589(b). And Section 1590(a) addresses  trafficking of forced labor, that is, knowingly recruiting,  harboring, transporting, providing, or obtaining forced  labor or services by the forbidden means set forth in  primary-conduct statute, § 1589(a)(1)-(4). § 1590(a).  The forbidden means in § 1589(a)(1)-(4) run the  spectrum from threats of ""force,"" ""physical restraint,""  ""serious harm,"" or ""abuse"" of legal process: (1) by means of force, threats of force, physical  restraint, or threats of physical restraint to that  person or another person; Page 5 of 13 (2) by means of serious harm or threats of serious  harm to that person or another person; (3) by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of  law or legal process; or (4) by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern  intended to cause the person to believe that, if that  person did not perform such labor or services, that  person or another person would suffer serious harm  or physical restraint[.] 18 U.S.C. § 1589(a)(1)-(4) (emphasis added). [*14]   This case presents the question of the meaning of  ""threats of serious harm."" Here, Richardson alleges that the Defendants forced  Richardson to perform services by requiring her to  attend alumni events and tailgating events in violation of  both Sections 1589 and 1590. See Compl. ¶ 226. The  Defendants also knowingly benefitted from participation  in their venture of forcing Richardson to perform the  services. As detailed in more depth below, Richardson  believed that she would suffer serious financial harm if  she did not perform those services. Id. ¶ 227. The  Northwestern Defendants argue that Richardson has  not plausibly alleged forced labor under § 1589 or  forced-labor trafficking under § 1590 because she has  failed to allege that the threat of ""serious harm,"" §  1589(a)(2), caused her to perform the services. NU  Defs.' Br. at 23. As pertinent here, to successfully plead a forced-labor  claim under § 1589, Richardson must adequately allege  that the Northwestern Defendants and Bonnevier used  ""threats of serious harm"" to obtain her services. Section  1589(c)(2) defines ""serious harm"" for the Trafficking  Victims Protection Act: it ""means any harm, whether  physical  or  nonphysical,  including  psychological,  financial, or reputational harm, that is sufficiently  serious, under all the surrounding [*15]  circumstances,  to compel a reasonable person of the same background  and in the same circumstances to perform or to continue  performing labor or services in order to avoid incurring  that harm."" 18 U.S.C. § 1589(c)(2). As the statutory  definition spells out, the term ""serious harm"" covers both  overt physical coercion and nonphysical forms of  coercion, including ""financial"" harm. See United States  v. Calimlim, 538 F.3d 706, 714 (7th Cir. 2008) (""Section  1589 is not written in terms limited to overt physical  coercion, and we know that when Congress amended  the statute it expanded the definition of involuntary  servitude to include nonphysical forms of coercion.""). Richardson alleges that the Defendants used a plethora  of financially coercive means—that is, the cheerleading  contracts, financial incentives, online advertisements,  and representations on social media—to compel her to  attend and to perform at tailgating events and various  alumni events. Compl. ¶¶ 180-81, 226, 227. The key  allegation rests on the Sprit Squad contracts, the  execution of which was a mandatory condition for  joining the team. Id. ¶ 55. Under the terms of the  contracts, if Richardson had left the team, then she  would  have  owed  Northwestern  over  $10,000,  comprising a minimum of $9,541 to pay back the  cheerleading [*16]  scholarships, plus all lodging, food,  equipment-rental, and training expenses. See id. ¶¶ 55,  101. This allegation of a mandatory financial burden  adequately supports the force-labor and forced-labor  trafficking claims as a ""threat of serious harm"" under the  Act. Remember that evaluating whether a harm qualifies  as a ""serious harm"" under the Act takes into account  whether the financial harm would compel a reasonable  person ""of the same background and in the same  circumstances"" as the victim. § 1589(c)(2). Viewing the  allegation in Richardson's favor, as required at the  pleading stage, $10,000 at stake is more than enough  for a reasonable person in Richardson's shoes—a  young adult (not yet 21 years old at the time, Compl. ¶  58) pursuing an education funded in part by a  scholarship—to reasonably feel compelled to continue  performing the services. Indeed, Richardson outright  alleges—and this must be accepted as true right now— that she ""could not afford the financial liability attendant  to quitting the team or being terminated."" Id. ¶ 60. On  top of the sheer dollar amount, the mandatory nature of  the reimbursement provision supports the reasonable  inference, at the pleading stage, that the payback [*17]   requirement was indeed intended to coerce Richardson  to stay on the team and to attend the dictated events.  The  looming  financial  burden  of  the  payback  requirement and the go-forward possibility of losing  one's access to college education (plus, Richardson had  already transferred from another university, Compl. ¶  47) readily qualify as a threat of serious harm under the  Act. At the very, very least, the Complaint sufficiently  alleges that the Defendants used a scheme or plan  intended to cause Richardson to believe (even if in fact  it would not happen) that she would suffer serious harm  if she did not perform the services. § 1589(a)(4). With regard to specific Defendants, there is no doubt  that the Complaint adequately alleges that the head  coach at the time, Bonnevier, knew and relied on the  Spirit Squad contracts. It would be odd indeed if the  Page 6 of 13 head coach of the Sprit Squad did not know and rely on  the terms of the mandatory contracts. With regard to the  University itself (through its Athletics Department), as  well as Obering, DaSilva, and Polisky, here again it is  plausible that, when viewing the allegations in  Richardson's favor, that the Northwestern Defendants  were all aware of the contents [*18]  of the Spirit Squad  contracts and of the requirement that cheerleaders  reimburse the University if they leave the team.  Remember that Richardson had put Obering, DaSilva,  and Polisky on notice of the harassment. It is  reasonable to infer that, in response to being put on  notice of the harassment, these University leaders  would (at the very least) examine the fundamental  document setting forth the obligations that Richardson  (and other cheerleaders) had to the University, and that  the University had to Richardson. Giving the benefit of  reasonable inferences to Richardson at the pleading  stage, the Complaint adequately alleges that the  individual Northwestern Defendants (and through them,  the University itself) deployed threats of serious financial  harm  (with  all  its  attendant  consequences  on  Richardson and her education), or at least knew of  those threats, to compel Richardson to perform  services. B. Trafficking Victims Protection Act Sex-Act  Trafficking (§ 1591) Moving on from the forced-labor and forced-labor  trafficking claims, Congress expanded the Trafficking  Victims Protection Act back in 2000 to specifically  combat sex trafficking in an effort ""to prevent violence  against women ...."" Pub. L. No. 106-386 § 102, 114  Stat. 1488 (2000) (codified as 18 U.S.C. § 1591). To  successfully plead a sex-trafficking claim under Section  1591(a)(1) of the Act—the provision [*19]  that governs  the primary conduct of sex-trafficking, as distinct from  benefitting from sex trafficking—the plaintiff must  adequately allege that the defendant (1) knowingly  recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided,  obtained, or maintained by any means a person; (2)  'knowing, or in reckless disregard of the fact, that means  of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion ... will be  used""; (3) ""to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1). Here, the  Defendants challenged the sex-trafficking claim in the  Complaint on two primary grounds. The defense  contends that Richardson has not adequately alleged a  ""commercial sex act"" under the Act, nor has she  plausibly alleged that ""coercion"" (the pertinent form of  forbidden conduct in this case) caused the commercial  sex act. NU Defs.' Br. at 20-26; Bonnevier's Br. at 7-12.  Again, however, the defense arguments fail at the  pleading stage. The Act defines ""commercial sex act"" under § 1591 as  ""any sex act, on account of which anything of value is  given to or received by any person."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(e)(3). Richardson argues that the harassment that  she experienced—which included sexual groping and  touching—constitutes a ""sex act"" under the Act.  Pl.'s [*20]  Br. at 2. None of the Defendants actually  disagree with Richardson on this specific point. So the  question here is whether Richardson adequately alleges  that anything of value was given or received ""on account  of"" the sex act. § 1591(e)(3). To the Defendants' way of  thinking, the answer is no, because Richardson has not  specifically alleged that there was a direct payment of  donations from alumni or fans in exchange for the sex  acts. Defs.' Br. at 20. But this argument is premised on a too-narrow definition  of commercial sex act when compared to the plain  meaning of the statutory text. The statutory definition  does not require pleading any direct exchange—only  that ""on account of"" the sex act, act ""anything of value""  was ""given to or received by any person,"" § 1591(e)(3)  (emphases added). As set out in the factual Background  section in this Opinion, the allegations do plausibly  allege an exchange of donations for the sex acts. At  every home game, cheerleaders were instructed to  ""flirtatiously mingle"" with fans, and on ""several""  occasions, Coach Bonnevier sent Richardson to the  limited-membership Wilson Club ""to flirt with wealthy,  elderly donors ...."" Compl. ¶ 57. These mandated events  led to harassment and [*21]  assaults in which fans  ""placed their hands on [Richardson's] buttocks and  breasts while taking pictures."" Id. ¶ 58. On top of that,  outside of athletics games, the cheerleaders were  required to attend alumni events dressed ""in their tiny  cheerleading uniforms."" Id. ¶ 64. At the alumni events,  the women on the cheerleading team—and only the  women, not the male cheerleaders, who were not even  required to attend, id. ¶ 67—were required to ""flirt"" and  take photos with the alumni, who touched ""them  inappropriately on their lower backs and behinds while  taking photos."" Id. ¶ 65. Based on these marching  orders to the female cheerleaders, and the specific  emphasis on the Wilson Club and alumni events, the  reasonable inference is that the fans and donors were  allowed to engage in sex acts with the cheerleaders in  exchange for the fans' and donors' financial support of  the Athletics Department and the University. See id. ¶  66. Page 7 of 13 The other disputed element of the sex-trafficking claim  is the Act's requirement that ""means of force, threats of  force, fraud, [or] coercion"" caused the commercial sex  act. 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Richardson grounds her claim  on ""coercion."" Pl.'s Br. at 34. The Defendants argue that  the payback [*22]  of the scholarship and expenses,  plus the go-forward loss of the scholarship, does not  amount to ""coercion"" under the Act. This back-and-forth is essentially a reprise of the  dispute over whether Richardson labored under a threat  of serious harm under the forced-labor statutes, §§  1589, 1590. That is because the Act defines ""coercion""  for a sex-trafficking claim as (among other things): ""(A)  threats of serious harm ... against any person; (B) any  scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to  believe that failure to perform an act would result in  serious harm to ... any person."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(2).  Threats of serious harm, in turn, is defined—like it is in  the forced-labor statutes—sufficiently serious, under all  the surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable  person of the same background and in the same  circumstances to perform or to continue performing  commercial sexual activity in order to avoid incurring  that harm,"" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(5). And, again like the  forced-labor definition, ""harm"" does include ""financial""  harm. § 1591(e)(5). Given the similarity between the forced-labor definition  and the sex-trafficking definition, the analysis and the  answer are the same. Richardson faced the risk (going  forward) of losing almost $10,000 [*23]  in scholarships,  as well as (looking backwards) a mandatory repayment  of around that same amount of money. With the benefit  of the pleading-stage standard of review, Richardson  has adequately alleged that she was coerced into  performing the commercial sex acts. C. Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization  Act Civil Liability (§ 1595) In its early versions, the Trafficking Victims Protection  Act imposed criminal liability for, among other things,  forced labor, forced-labor trafficking, and sex trafficking.  18 U.S.C. §§ 1589, 1590, 1591. In 2003, Congress  added a civil-liability provision through the Trafficking  Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. Pub. L. No. 108- 193, 117 Stat. 2875, 2878 (codified at 18 U.S.C. §  1595). At that time, the civil provision only imposed  liability against the direct trafficker of the victims. Id. In  2008, however, Congress expanded the scope of civil  liability. Pub. L. 110-457, 122 Stat. 5044 (William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008). Section 1595 of the Act  now provides a civil remedy against not only the direct  perpetrator, but also ""whoever knowingly benefits, or  attempts or conspires to benefit, financially or by  receiving anything of value from participation in a  venture which that person knew or should have known  has engaged in an act in violation of this chapter,"" 18  U.S.C. § 1595(a) (emphases added). As  discussed  earlier,  Richardson  alleges  that  Northwestern, DaSilva, Obering, Polisky, and Bonnevier  all violated specific criminal-liability provisions of the Act,  namely, 18 U.S.C. § 1589 (forced labor), [*24]  § 1590  (forced-labor trafficking), § 1591 (sex trafficking).  Because  the  Defendants  allegedly  violated  the  underlying criminal statutes, Richardson argues, they  are allegedly liable under 18 U.S.C. § 1595 for civil  liability. Richardson argues that Bonnevier is liable as  the direct perpetrator, and Northwestern, DaSilva,  Obering, and Polisky are liable, at the least, as knowing  beneficiaries of the violations. Compl. ¶¶ 185-87, 192,  209-11, 218-19, 228-30, 235-36. The Northwestern Defendants frame the elements of  beneficiary liability differently than Richardson, but all  agree in substance that to successfully state a claim for  civil  liability  on  the  Northwestern  Defendants,  Richardson must adequately allege that they (1)  knowingly benefitted (2) from participation in a venture,  and (3) that the venture violated the Act and (4) that the  Northwestern Defendants knew or should have known  that the venture violated the Act. The Defendants argue  that Richardson has failed to plead sufficient facts for  any element of the civil-liability provision. NU Defs.' Br.  at 7-19; Bonnevier Br. at 7-11. According to all of the  Defendants, the allegations do not plausibly allege that  a ""venture"" was formed; nor that the Defendants [*25]   ""particpat[ed]"" in the venture; nor that the Defendants  knew or should have known that the venture violated the  Act; nor that there was any knowing benefit to the  Defendants. Defs.' Br. at 8-19. But these objections to  the civil-liability claim fall short at the pleading stage.  Each element is addressed in turn, taking the ""venture""  and ""participation"" in a venture together and first. 1. ""Venture"" and ""Participation"" in a Venture As a threshold matter, the parties focus much of their  disagreement on the definitions of ""venture"" and  ""participation in a venture"" under 18 U.S.C. § 1595.  Unfortunately, Section 1595 does not define ""venture"" or  Page 8 of 13 ""participation"" in a venture. But the underlying criminal  provision for sex trafficking, passed before Congress  added a civil liability provision, does define those terms  in 18 U.S.C. § 1591 (though, as explained in detail  below, there is a distinction between the carry-over (or  not) of ""venture"" versus ""participation"" in a venture). On the definition of ""venture,"" the Defendants argue  that, because venture is not defined in § 1595, it should  be given its plain meaning as provided by dictionary  definitions. NU Defs.' Br. at 8. The Defendants rely on  various,  hand-picked  dictionary  definitions  to  suggest [*26]  that venture must involve some element  of ""risk."" Id. But there is no need to turn to dictionary  definitions at all, because Congress defined venture in  the same statutory scheme. Congress defined ""venture""  in the sex-trafficking provision, 18 U.S.C. § 1591, as  ""any group of two or more individuals associated in fact,  whether or not a legal entity,"" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(6).  That's it. There is no reference to riskiness of the  venture or, really, to anything else. With the Section 1591 sex-trafficking definition of  ""venture"" in place, the plain language of the statute is  conclusive unless there is some other clear statutory  command to the contrary. United States v. Berkos, 543  F.3d 392, 396 (7th Cir. 2008) (cleaned up). Identical  words used in different parts of the same statute are  generally presumed to have the same meaning. United  States v. Achbani, 507 F.3d 598, 602 (7th Cir. 2007).  Given that Section 1595 authorizes civil liability for sex- trafficking violations of Section 1591, the statutory- interpretation tool applies equally well here: the sex- trafficking definition in Section 1591 ought to be  incorporated into Section 1595. It is true that the Eleventh Circuit has declined to carry  over the criminal definition of ""participation in a venture""  to the civil-liability provision and has asserted that the  text of § 1591 overcomes that presumption. Doe #1 v.  Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 724 (11th Cir. 2021).  In Red Roof, the Eleventh Circuit reasoned in part that  because [*27]  § 1591 explicitly says that its definition of  ""participation in a venture"" applies ""[i]n this section,"" §  1591(e) (prefatory clause), Congress did not intend for  the definition to apply elsewhere—including to the civil- liability provision. In lieu of the sex-trafficking definition,  the Eleventh Circuit applied a mixture of dictionary  definitions to define ""venture"" and ""participation in a  venture"" as taking part in a common undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit. Red Roof,  21 F.4th at 725. But the two statutory sections, Sections 1591 and 1595,  were enacted in a sequence that undermines that  reasoning. As explained earlier, the sex-trafficking  statute, § 1591, was passed in 2000, before the civil- liability section, § 1595, was passed in 2003. There is  nothing in the text of Section 1591's definitional  subsections to suggest that Congress was affirmatively  excluding their application to any later-passed, related  statute—let alone one that actually incorporates the  elements of Section 1591, like the civil-liability provision  of Section 1595. Also, Section 1591's reference to ""In  this section"" is merely the prefatory clause before the  listing of terms. The subsection is set out as ""(e) In this  section:"" and goes on to set forth subparagraphs (1)  through (6). § 1591(e), § 1591(e)(1)-(6). It is not as if the  clause says, ""In this section, [*28]  and only in this  section."" Nothing in the text of the sex-trafficking  definitional section precludes its application to the civil- liability provision. Indeed, the Public Law that added  Section  1595's  civil-liability  provision  contains  a  congressional  finding  emphasizing  the  continued  problem of human trafficking: ""Trafficking in persons  continues to victimize countless men, women, and  children in the United States and abroad."" Pub. L. 108- 193, § 2(1). It would be odd for Congress to make that  finding and then laden the civil-liability provision with  new, barnacled definitions of terms already defined by  pre-existing anti-trafficking provisions. The Defendants also argue that Richardson must plead  that the Defendants actively formed a venture. But,  again, no requirement like that is found in the sex- trafficking definition of ""venture,"" which is simply ""any  group of two or more individuals associated in fact,  whether or not a legal entity."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(6).  Associated-in-fact is not a completely new legal term:  the Supreme Court has used that term in explaining  when a group of individuals can qualify as an  ""enterprise"" under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt  Organizations  Act,  18  U.S.C.  §  1961(4).  An  ""association-in-fact enterprise"" should have at least  three structural features: ""a purpose, relationships [*29]   among those associated with the enterprise, and  longevity sufficient to permit those associates to pursue  the enterprise's purpose."" Boyle v. United States, 556  U.S. 938, 946, 129 S. Ct. 2237, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1265  (2009). Applying that definition (from one pre-existing criminal  statute to another), Richardson pleads sufficient facts to  allege that Northwestern, Obering, DaSilva, and Polisky  (and, indeed, Bonnevier) were associated in fact. The  individual Defendants were employed by Northwestern  Page 9 of 13 and the actions spanned over the course of two years.  Despite Richardson's objections and warnings to  University leadership, she continued to be forced to  attend the alumni events and Wilson Club events that  subjected her to sexual assaults. As part of the  University and the Athletics Department, the Defendants  (it is reasonable to infer) were motivated to promote the  financial support and donations of fans and alumni. This  is more than enough to allege an association in fact.  Richardson has adequately alleged that the Defendants  were part of a ""venture"" under Section 1595(a). Moving on to ""participation"" in a venture, the carry-over  from the sex-trafficking statute to the civil-liability  provision is not nearly as smooth. Section 1591 defines  participation in a venture: ""the term participation in a  venture [*30]  means knowingly assisting, supporting, or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1),"" where (a)(1)  refers to the first subsection of Section 1591. 18 U.S.C.  § 1591(e)(4) (emphasis added). The key term here is  the mental state of ""knowingly."" Under Section 1591,  participation in a venture requires a knowing mental  state: (a)Whoever knowingly— ... (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2) (emphases added). In contrast,  Section 1595(a) allows civil liability based on a less- culpable mental state, namely, it is enough if the  defendant knew or ""should have known"" that the  venture has violated the Act. § 1595(a). This is an  important textual difference that creates a more  expansive range of culpable mental states for civil  liability under § 1595(a) that the mental states required  for criminal liability. Yes, it is generally true that the  same statutory terms ought to be read identically in  related statutes, but the general presumption yields  where, as here, ""there is such variation in the  connection in which the words are used as reasonably  to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in  different parts of the act with different intent,"" Atlantic  Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, 286 U.S. 427, 433,  52 S. Ct. 607, 76 L. Ed. 1204 (1932). The upshot is that     civil liability does [*31]  not require that the defendant  knowingly participate in a violation of the Act—because  it is enough for the defendant to benefit from  participation in a venture that the defendant ""should  have known"" violated the Act. Having said that, it bears emphasizing that the textual  differences between Section 1591 and Section 1595  only pertains to the necessary mental state—there is no  reason to alter the conduct aspect of the definition in  Section 1591(e)(4). Participation in a venture still  requires ""assisting, supporting, or facilitating"" the  venture. Id. But Richardson need not plead that the  Defendants themselves committed an overt act in  furtherance of ""the sex trafficking aspect of the venture,""  United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App'x 272, 286 (6th Cir.  2016) (unpublished order); see A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc.,  455 F. Supp. 3d 171 (E.D. Pa. 2020); M.A. v. Wyndham  Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959 (S.D. Ohio  2019). Here, given the absence of a requirement that  the Defendants directly engaged in sex trafficking, the  Complaint adequately pleads participation: after each  Defendant became aware of the alleged misconduct,  they drew distinctions between the misconduct that the  Defendants chose to curtail—and the misconduct that  they allowed to continue. Bonnevier was still permitted  by the Northwestern Defendants to require women  cheerleaders to attend alumni fundraising events and  events at the Wilson Club. Indeed, it is [*32]  a  reasonable inference from the allegations that the  alumni fundraising events and the Wilson Club events  were the more financially lucrative events at which the  sex acts took place. At the pleading stage, giving  Richardson the benefit of the doubt, the Complaint  sufficiently alleges that the Defendants facilitated the  continued  presence  of  the  female  cheerleaders  specifically at the events that most benefitted the  Athletics Department and the University. Both the  elements of ""venture"" and ""participation"" in a venture  have been sufficiently pleaded. 2. Knew or Should Have Known Next, the Defendants argue that the Complaint lacks  facts to suggest that they knew or should have known  that the venture engaged in a violation of the Trafficking  Victims Protection Act. NU Defs.' Br. at 14-17;  Bonnevier Br. at 2. As part of this argument, the  Defendants contend that the last commercial sex act  alleged by Richardson happened in January 2019, and  that because the University, Obering, Polisky, and  DaSilva were not put on notice of the misconduct until  Page 10 of 13 that same month, the allegations fail to allege  knowledge or even constructive knowledge. NU  Defendants' Br. at 16, n. 10, 17. The Defendants are wrong. The Complaint clearly  alleges [*33]  that the harassment and sex acts  continued to happen after Richardson put those  University leaders on notice of the misconduct.  Richardson alleges that, after putting the Defendants on  notice of the harassment, she was ""subjected to the  same photo opportunities, groping, and harassment that  she had previously notified Northwestern about."" Compl.  ¶ 100 (emphasis added). That is not a mere conclusory  allegation. The allegation directly refers back to specific  conduct that was already laid out in the Complaint, so  Richardson need not restate each act of misconduct to  show the continuing timeline. So, after being explicitly  put on notice (which is actual knowledge, let alone  constructive  knowledge)  of  the  misconduct,  the  harassment and sex acts continued. Those allegations  sufficiently allege the culpable mental state for civil  liability under Section 1595 for all of the Defendants. Even more specifically, Obering (the Associate Athletic  Director  for  Marketing)  allegedly  knew  of  the  harassment and sex acts because Northwestern's team  doctor  directly  told  Obering  that  (according  to  Richardson) Bonnevier forced Richardson to participate  in events, including fundraising events and appearances  at the Wilson [*34]  club, where she was sexually  harassed and assaulted. Compl. ¶¶ 57, 82. Indeed, in  mid-January 2019, Richardson directly told Obering  about the harassment, id. ¶ 84, and even provided on  January 22 (in response to Obering's demand) written  testimonials from other cheerleaders detailing the  misconduct, id. ¶¶ 84-86. With regard to then-Deputy Director of Athletics Polisky,  Richardson met with Polisky in January 2019 and told  him about the abuse that she had suffered at various  alumni events. Compl. ¶ 88. Polisky (and also Obering)  accused Richardson of writing the testimonials herself,  and put the burden on Richardson to corroborate the  claims. Id. Polisky later attended the meeting on May  28, 2019, during which Richardson reiterated that the  forced and coerced participation in various events  where she was sexually harassed and touched had  continued. Compl. ¶¶ 88, 96. Lastly, with regard to Deputy Title IX Coordinator  DaSilva, as discussed earlier, here too Richardson  adequately alleged that she put DaSilva on notice of the  harassment and sex acts. To sum up again, the context  starts with, on February 1, 2019, DaSilva emailing  Richardson with mischaracterizations of her allegations,  including [*35]  saying that Richardson had only raised  the single issue of one individual fan harassing her.  Compl. ¶ 90. In response, Richardson corrected  DaSilva's mischaracterization and set forth multiple  dates and events during which she had been assaulted.  Id. ¶ 91. A few days later (on February 5), Richardson  emailed Obering to report that, although Bonnevier had  been more organized at a recent basketball game, she  ""still made derogatory comments to members of the  team regarding their physical appearance ...."" Id. ¶ 92.  Yet DaSilva refused to conduct a formal investigation,  and instead only provided training to Bonnevier that did  not work. Id. ¶ 95. DaSilva's knowledge of the  misconduct is adequately alleged. 3. Knowingly Benefitted The next question is whether Richardson has sufficiently  alleged that the Defendants ""knowingly benefit[ted] ...  financially or by receiving anything of value"" from  participation in the venture. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Here,  again, at the early pleading stage, the factual allegations  are sufficient to support the reasonable inference that  the Defendants all knowingly benefitted from their  participation  in  the  venture.  Remember  that  Richardson's allegations primarily focus on three  categories [*36]  of events: tailgating; alumni fundraising  events; and appearances at the Wilson Club. Of those  three categories, only tailgating was addressed by the  Defendants, when Richardson finally was no longer  forced to attend tailgates. But it is reasonable to infer  that the presence of the cheerleaders at tailgates—open  to virtually all fans, regardless of whether they were  donors—had the smallest impact on alumni fundraising  and alumni relations. Yet even after Richardson made  the Defendants aware of the sexual harassment and the  barrage of assaults, she was still required to attend the  fundraising events and Wilson Club events, Compl. ¶¶  12, 100, 104, 152, the most financially lucrative events  for the Athletics Department and, in turn, the University.  The Wilson Club is a private space and is restricted to  fans who hold loge, Wilson Club, or courtside (for  basketball games) tickets. Id. ¶ 57 & n.4. Polisky,  DaSilva, Obering, DaSilva, and Bonnevier all had an  interest—as University leaders and employees—in  maintaining the flow of donations from alumni and from  Wilson Club members. To be sure, the individual  Defendants did not pocket money directly from donors.  But that is not needed under [*37]  the Act. Instead, it is  enough to benefit by receiving anything of value for  Page 11 of 13 participating in the venture, § 1595(a), including the  benefit of promoting their own employer's coffers and  prestige, and maintain their own employment. The  Defendants themselves allegedly drew a distinction  between tailgating—with its less-sizeable donation  impact—and the fundraising and Wilson Club events. At  least at the pleading stage, before discovery can test  the facts, the benefit element has been adequately  pleaded. In sum, then, the forced-labor claim (Count 5),  the force-labor trafficking claim (Count 3), and the sex- trafficking claim (Count 4) are all adequately pleaded  and survive the motion to dismiss. D. Breach of Contract & Promissory Estoppel Moving from the federal claims to the state law claims,  Richardson also brings state law claims for breach of  contract and promissory estoppel. For these two claims,  Richardson relies on Northwestern's published Policy on  Sexual Misconduct. Compl. ¶¶ 111, 239. But both  claims are not adequately pleaded because Richardson  has not sufficiently alleged that Northwestern made and  broke a binding promise somewhere in the Policy. Under Illinois common law, it is indeed [*38]  possible  that the relationship between a student and a university  can amount to a binding contract in certain aspects.  See, e.g., Ross v. Creighton Univ., 957 F.2d 410, 416  (7th Cir. 1992). But the mere existence of a student- college relationship is not carte blanche for breach-of- contract claims. To successfully state a claim for breach  of contract, Richardson must point to a specific  contractual promise, rather than challenge the way that  Northwestern handled the sexual-misconduct complaint.  Yes, the handling of the complaint can give rise to other  forms of liability, like under Title IX's anti-discrimination  provisions. But that does not mean that a contract- based promise was broken, and the Complaint does not  identify that kind of promise. A similar flaw applies to the promissory-estoppel claim.  To successfully allege a claim for promissory estoppel  under Illinois common law, a plaintiff must allege that (1)  the defendants made an unambiguous promise to the  plaintiff; (2) the plaintiff relied on the promise; (3) the              plaintiff's reliance was expected and foreseeable by  defendants; and (4) the plaintiff relied on the promise to  the plaintiff's detriment. Quake Constr., Inc. v. American  Airlines, Inc., 141 Ill. 2d 281, 565 N.E.2d 990, 1004, 152  Ill. Dec. 308 (Ill. 1990). The Complaint fails on the first  element:  Richardson  has  not  alleged  facts  suggesting [*39]   that  Northwestern  made  any  unambiguous promise to her. Richardson offers the following as the alleged promises:  (1)  Northwestern's  promise  to  provide  a  safe  environment free from discrimination and harassment,  Compl. ¶ 246; and (2) Northwestern's promise to  provide a thorough and equitable process to resolve any  alleged violation of the University's policies. Id. But  neither of those statements are definite enough to  constitute an unambiguous promise. At most, they  reflect a commitment to broad principles of fairness and  nondiscrimination without giving specifics about how  those principles will be achieved. Indeed, the context in which the statements were made  confirms that they are not the kind of unambiguous  promises on which a reasonable person would be  entitled to rely. The Sexual Misconduct Policy, for  example, begins with broad aspirational statements,  noting that the policy is intended to ""promot[e] the  dignity of all individuals."" R. 42-1 at 2, Defs.' Exh. A,  2018 Sexual Misconduct Policy; R. 42-2 at 2, Defs.' Exh.  B, 2019 Sexual Misconduct Policy. More to the point,  the Policy explicitly says that because of the unique  nature of sexual misconduct claims, the University  ""reserves [*40]  discretion to take reasonable actions to  address those issues in a manner consistent with the  spirit of the applicable policies and these guidelines.""  2018 Sexual Misconduct Policy at 21 (emphases  added); 2019 Sexual Misconduct Policy at 22. Those  discretion-reserving statements hedge so much that a  student cannot reasonably rely on them as setting forth  specific promises. The promissory-estoppel claim must  be dismissed. E. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress Richardson's final claim is that Bonnevier intentionally  caused her severe emotional distress. As a threshold  matter, Bonnevier asserts the statute of limitations, that  is, she argues that the emotional-distress claim against  her is time-barred because all of the alleged conduct  took place before January 29, 2019, placing it outside  the two-year statute of limitations. Bonnevier Br. at 12. But the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense,  Page 12 of 13 and ""plaintiffs need not anticipate and attempt to plead  around all potential defenses."" Xechem, Inc. v. Bristol- Myers Squibb Co., 372 F.3d 899, 901 (7th Cir. 2004).  Indeed, the Seventh Circuit has repeatedly held that  dismissal under Civil Rule 12(b)(6) on statute-of- limitations grounds is ""irregular,"" because the defendant  bears the burden of proof on affirmative defenses. [*41]   United States v. Northern Trust Co., 372 F.3d 886, 888  (7th Cir. 2004) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)). It is true,  however, that when the allegations of a complaint itself  reveal that the case is barred by the statute of  limitations—and no factual development is otherwise  needed—then dismissal can be appropriate. Indep.  Trust Corp. v. Stewart Info. Servs. Corp., 665 F.3d 930,  935 (7th Cir. 2012); Jay E. Hayden Found. v. First  Neighbor Bank, N.A., 610 F.3d 382, 383 (7th Cir. 2010)  (explaining that ""if it is plain from the complaint that the  [statute of limitations] defense is indeed a bar to the suit  dismissal is proper without further pleading."") (cleaned  up). The motion to dismiss would be, in essence,  treated as a motion for judgment on the pleadings under  Civil Rule 12(c). Brownmark Films, LLC v. Comedy  Partners, 682 F.3d 687, 690 (7th Cir. 2012) (citing  Brooks, 578 F.3d at 579). Here, it is not clear from the Complaint itself that the  statute of limitations bars the emotional-distress claim  against Bonnevier. The statute of limitations on  emotional-distress claims in Illinois is two years. Flentye  v. Kathrein, 485 F. Supp. 2d 903, 923 (N.D. Ill. 2007)  (citing 735 ILCS 5/13-202). Richardson filed the  Complaint in this case on January 29, 2021. Bonnevier  would be right that the claim is barred by the statute of  limitations if all of the alleged misconduct happened  before January 29, 2019. But, as detailed earlier, the  Complaint does allege ongoing misconduct after  January 29, 2019. For example, Richardson alleged that  during the 2019 athletics season—which would start in  Fall 2019—she still suffered the harassment and  assaults: [*42]  Plaintiff was still sent to numerous alumni events as  well as the Wilson Club during games to be  paraded around in her skimpy uniform in order to  please alumni and garner donations. As such, she  was subjected to the same photo opportunities,  groping, and harassment that she had previously  notified Northwestern about. Compl. ¶ 100 (emphasis added). Even later in time,  Richardson also alleges that she told DaSilva again in  May 2020 that the ""same issues"" concerning Bonnevier  continued. Id. ¶ 103. To repeat what the Opinion  explained earlier, Richardson need not spell out the  specific conduct again in every single paragraph and  every single time frame—it is enough that she  incorporates by reference the conduct that she  specifically alleged earlier in the Complaint. Maybe  discovery will disprove the allegations, but at the  pleading stage, the statute of limitations is not a barrier. On the merits of the emotional-distress claim, to  successfully allege that type of claim under Illinois  common law, a plaintiff must allege that (1) the  defendant's conduct was ""extreme and outrageous;"" (2)  the defendant either intended that his conduct inflict  severe emotional distress or knew that there was [*43]   at least a high probability that his conduct would cause  severe emotional distress; and (3) the defendant's  conduct in fact caused severe emotional distress.  Schweihs v. Chase Home Fin., LLC, 2016 IL 120041,  412 Ill. Dec. 882, 77 N.E.3d 50, 63 (Ill. 2016). Run-of- the mill annoyances and oppressions do not qualify as  ""extreme and outrageous"" conduct. Instead, the  offending conduct must be ""so outrageous in character,  and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible  bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious,  and utterly intolerable in a civilized community."" Id.  (cleaned up). The Complaint readily alleges for the emotional-distress  claim to survive the dismissal motion. Richardson has  plausibly alleged that Bonnevier, among other things,  intentionally and repeatedly put Richardson in situations  where she would be sexually assaulted; forced  Richardson to undress and to change clothes in public  spaces; restricted her ability to eat; and mocked her  attempts to report sexual harassment. Compl. ¶¶ 117- 18, 57-59, 61-62, 64-65, 68-71, 75-78, 100. As the head  coach, Bonnevier was in a position of supreme authority  over Richardson—which intensifies the outrageousness  of the misconduct. Nor were these one-off instances.  Bonnevier allegedly knew that she was putting  Richardson [*44]  in the path of assault, and yet  continued to do so again and again over the course of  two years. And given Richardson's complaints to and  about Bonnevier, Bonnevier knew how Richardson was  suffering—yet continued on anyway. Viewing the light in  the most favorable to Richardson, as required at the  pleading stage, the allegations amount to extreme and  outrageous misconduct. What's more, Richardson has  alleged that as a result of Bonnevier's misconduct,  Richardson experienced panic attacks, and needed both  mental-health therapy and prescription medications. Id.  ¶¶ 167, 255. At this stage, all of the elements of an  emotional-distress claim have been adequately alleged. Page 13 of 13",0
"United States v. Stennis, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112659","MEMORANDUM Defendant Darnell Stennis was charged with several crimes in connection with his sex trafficking of women. At  trial, Stennis admitted that he recruited women to work as prostitutes, posted advertisements for their services, and  took the money they earned. But Stennis denied that he had forced anyone to engage in acts of prostitution. The jury concluded otherwise. Stennis was convicted in October 2021 of two counts of sex trafficking by force,  fraud, or coercion; two counts of interstate transportation of a person to engage in prostitution; and one count of  obstructing the enforcement of the federal law against sex trafficking. ECF No. 157. At trial, Stennis moved for a judgment of acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a). The Court reserved decision on the  motion and later, at Stennis's sentencing hearing, denied the motion. This memorandum describes the reasons for  the Court's decision. I. BACKGROUND     Page 2 of 9   A. Stennis Meets A.R. By his telling, Stennis first began pimping around 2014, after serving a prison term [*2]  in California. He met a  woman, slightly older than he, who introduced him to the ""game"" (as he calls it). He spent a couple months in  Sacramento acting as her pimp before they parted ways. He pimped other women in the San Francisco Bay area  until about 2016, when homesickness led him to return to Illinois. There, he was arrested for illegal possession of  firearms, and he served time on that charge—and then he served more time for a probation violation. He was  released from custody in late 2018. After (very) briefly holding a legitimate job, Stennis returned to pimping. To recruit women, he would message them  on Facebook. In early January 2019, he introduced himself to A.R. through that platform, and the two met in person  shortly thereafter. (Both lived in Peoria, Illinois.) According to Stennis, A.R. was at first just interested in dating him.  But, by the end of January, the two were in a pimp-prostitute relationship. B. The Westlake Arrest Stennis and A.R. rented a car and started traveling around the Midwest so that A.R. could engage in sex work in  various cities, including St. Louis, Missouri; Kansas City, Missouri; Memphis, Tennessee; and eventually  Independence, Ohio. On February [*3]  5, 2019, after their rental car broke down, Stennis and A.R. boarded a  Megabus passenger bus to Chicago. Stennis testified that they intended to take another bus from Chicago back to  Peoria. While on the Megabus, A.R. sent her mother (who lived in Peoria) an alarming text message from a different  phone number than A.R. usually used. A.R.'s mother went to the Peoria Police Department and showed Sergeant  Brock Lavin the message. Lavin called the number from which the message had been sent. A man answered. After  Lavin asked for A.R., the man claimed not to know A.R. and hung up. A few moments later, A.R.'s mother's phone  rang, with A.R. on the line. After Lavin spoke with A.R., A.R. handed the phone to the bus driver, and Lavin told the  bus driver to pull over and wait for police to arrive. The bus driver pulled over in Westlake, Ohio, and the bus company's safety director called police to the scene.  After boarding the bus, police arrested Stennis and found A.R.'s driver's license in his pocket. While being driven to  jail for booking, Stennis spontaneously asked an officer if A.R. had said that Stennis was her pimp. Stennis later  commented to the officer about the shutdown [*4]  of Backpage, a website Stennis had used to post advertisements  for prostitutes. Stennis also told the officer that he owned three Facebook accounts. Police matched Stennis's  phone—the one A.R. had used to text her mother—to a phone number listed in several online advertisements for  prostitution in St. Louis; Decatur, Illinois; Memphis; and Cleveland, Ohio (near Westlake). Those ads had been  posted during the nine days preceding Stennis's arrest at Westlake. Westlake police eventually referred the case to Cuyahoga County's human-trafficking task force. That task force,  in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, began investigating Stennis for sex trafficking.         Page 3 of 9   C. A.J. Joins for a Road Trip to Minot Soon after Stennis was released from custody in Ohio, he reunited with A.R., and the two made their way to  Minnesota so that A.R. could engage in sex work. In March 2019, Stennis started exchanging text messages with  A.J., a prostitute who advertised on MegaPersonals (a website used by pimps and prostitutes to advertise  commercial sex). A.J. lived near Minneapolis. She had been working as a prostitute for some time, and she was  looking for a pimp. Stennis arranged a meeting with [*5]  A.J. and brought along A.R., who had a black eye.  Stennis and A.J. agreed that Stennis would act as her pimp. After a failed attempt by Stennis and A.J. to find customers on the streets of Minneapolis, Stennis took A.J. and  A.R. to Minot, North Dakota, to engage in sex work. A.R. was upset, as she wanted to go home to Peoria. But  Stennis did not allow A.R. to return home. On the drive to Minot, Stennis told A.R. and A.J. to post advertisements for themselves on commercial-sex  websites. When A.J.'s advertisements did not create sufficient interest, Stennis took her phone and reworked her  postings to make them ""eye-catching."" ECF No. 179 at 235. Arriving in Minot, the three checked into a hotel room, and A.R. and A.J. started arranging ""dates."" Stennis  sometimes took their phones and replied to inquiries as though he were A.R. or A.J. Stennis also set the prices for  the women's services. Because the trio rented only a single room, if one woman was seeing a customer in the  room, Stennis and the other woman would wait outside in the car. After completing a ""date,"" A.R. or A.J. would let  the customer out the side door, let Stennis and the other woman in through the same door, and give Stennis [*6]   the money. That Stennis was entitled to all of the women's money was one of many ""rules"" that he imposed. A.J. obeyed  Stennis's rules without resistance, but A.R. was ""kind of belligerent"" (as A.J. testified), and Stennis sometimes  enforced his rules against A.R. ""physically."" Id. at 257. Another of Stennis's rules was that his prostitutes should not  spend too much time with a client. A.R. violated that rule in Minot. She spent too much time with a client, refused to  answer Stennis's and A.J.'s calls, and even refused to answer when they knocked on the door of the room. When  A.R. finally came out of the room, she looked like she'd ""had fun"" during her ""date."" ECF No. 180 at 16-17. (Having  fun with a customer was also against Stennis's rules.) Stennis got upset. He and A.R. started arguing—so loudly that hotel guests called the lobby to complain. Further, a  hotel employee testified that, when Stennis and A.R. walked through the lobby, A.R. screamed that Stennis had spit  on her. The hotel employee called the police, and Stennis and A.R. fled to a nearby Walmart so police could not  find them. D. Bloomington Stennis, A.R., and A.J. left Minot early the next morning (March 24, 2019) and headed [*7]  back to Minnesota. A.R.  sat in the back seat, crying. She wanted to go home to Peoria, but Stennis insisted that she work another night, this  time in Minnesota. Stennis and A.J. posted an advertisement online, and the three checked into a La Quinta hotel in  Bloomington, Minnesota, early in the morning of March 25. A.R., still unhappy, refused to work. She stayed at the  hotel while Stennis took A.J. out to walk the streets. After Stennis and A.J. returned, A.R. went into the bathroom,  locked the door, and called a man on her phone. Based on what she overheard, A.J. thought that the man  ""sounded like another pimp"" and that ""the conversation sounded like maybe [A.R.] was trying to switch over or  something."" ECF No. 180 at 32.   Page 4 of 9   Talking to other pimps was a major violation of Stennis's rules. Stennis tried to force his way into the bathroom, and  he eventually got in (although it is not clear if he forced the door open or if A.R. opened it herself). Stennis and A.R.  started fighting, and A.J. could hear A.R. screaming, telling Stennis to stop. When A.R. finally emerged from the  bathroom, she had fresh injuries, including a second black eye. A guest in the hotel reported sounds of yelling and [*8]  someone being thrown against a wall to the hotel manager,  who called the Bloomington police. A separate 911 call was placed from a cell phone in the area of the hotel, but  the dispatcher heard no one talking on the line—only ""background noise that sounded like a struggle."" ECF No. 179  at 149. Bloomington Police Officer David Mast, the first to arrive at the La Quinta, went to the 17th floor, from which the  noise complaint had originated. There, he encountered Stennis and A.J. in the hallway. Once other officers arrived,  they stayed with Stennis and A.J. while Mast went into their room. The room was in disarray; items had been  thrown around the bedroom and bathroom, the towel rack in the bathroom was bent, and the toilet lid was broken  into multiple pieces. A.R. entered the room. A.R. was upset and crying, and she had a large black eye. She told Mast that Stennis  assaulted her after she told him that she did not want to continue to work as a prostitute for him. According to A.R.,  Stennis shoved her around the room and bathroom, eventually pinning her against the wall and squeezing his hand  around her throat. A.R. said she tried to fight Stennis off but that he ""bashed"" her head into the [*9]  towel rack on  the wall and pushed her down onto the toilet with sufficient force to break the lid. Id. at 171. Stennis was arrested. Before Stennis was taken into custody, he gave his cell phone to A.J. Stennis also directed  A.J. not to tell the police that it was ""a pimping situation."" Instead, A.J. was to say that she and A.R. were Stennis's  girlfriends and that A.R. was upset because ""[A.R.] was supposed to be the main girlfriend and she didn't want to  have a threesome."" ECF No. 180 at 35. Stennis also told A.J. to delete everything on his cell phone that related to  prostitution ""[j]ust in case the police got ahold of it,"" id. at 37, to change the phone's number, to continue to lie to  the police, and to tell A.R. not to press charges. E. Stennis's Phone Calls from Jail On March 26, 2019 (the day after he was arrested at the La Quinta), Stennis was charged in state court with  domestic assault by strangulation. He was apparently unable to post bail, so he remained in custody. Once he was  able to make contact with A.R., Stennis began calling her from jail almost every day—sometimes more than once a  day. The jury heard recordings or read transcripts of many of those calls. During some [*10]  of the calls, Stennis  displayed awareness of the investigations into his conduct, as well as awareness of the potential charges and  penalties he faced. For example, on May 28, 2019, Stennis told A.R. that he had received ""some paperwork that say[s] Homeland  Security on it."" ECF No. 180 at 194. He further remarked: ""I guess St. Louis and Ohio are still doing an investigation  because they sent me the paperwork, man. . . . So that's how I know I am under investigation. You know what I  mean? But I ain't charged yet for that."" Id. He recognized that ""Homeland Security is the Feds."" Id. After A.R. asked  Stennis ""what do they have to prove?,"" he responded that he did not know but expressed his belief that if he ""beat  this . . . domestic violence,"" then he would ""beat the promotion of prostitution, too"" because the two charges went  ""hand in hand."" Id. Stennis was also anticipating being charged in federal court. He expressed his understanding of federal jurisdiction  on the May 28, 2019, call with A.R.:    Page 5 of 9   I guess the fuckin' prosecutor and the promoting prostitution shit because . . . shorty [A.J.] told them that I  took her across state lines, so that's no longer a state case. Anything you do illegal [*11]  across state lines . . .  is federal, is a federal charge. If I take a weed from Minnesota—I mean Chicago to Missouri, I don't give a fuck  if it's a pound of weed. I get it. That's federal. Id. at 206-07. Still later, Stennis noted that he would have to register as a sex offender and potentially serve a steep  sentence if convicted of ""[h]uman trafficking"": Yeah, and with this shit—and this shit is all crazy because, dude, that means I'd have to register as a sex  offender. . . . That's what they make people do for them type of charges. Human trafficking, you gotta register  as a sex offender under something—not as a rapist but under something else, other category. But you gotta  register like that. And motherfuckers—motherfuckers—motherfuckers get 60-720—that's just—god damn it . . .  . Id. at 210. In other calls, Stennis asked A.R. to hide evidence related to his acting as her pimp. In December 2019, Stennis  directed A.R. to change the number on her phone: Do you hear me? I need you to change this number. It's not—this is not a game. This is—this is—it's not an  option. . . . But—but soon the court—soon—Indiana or whatever state that is court—contact these courts and  give them all your information; [*12]  I'm booked. It ain't gonna matter if you show up no more then. Id. at 196. Stennis called A.R. the next day and again told her to change her phone number: ""[T]he court's gonna  have this number. Peoria gonna have this number. Peoria gone give the court these. They'll hear that number and  gonna run that, then I'm done."" Id. at 198. Through his frequent contact with A.R., Stennis continued to act as her pimp, directing her where to post  advertisements, what hotels to use, and what prices to charge. Often Stennis would tell A.R. to send him money  (money that she had earned from sex work). When A.R. did not respond as Stennis wanted or when she failed to  send him money, Stennis would become angry and occasionally threaten to hurt or even kill A.R. after he got out of  jail. On one call, A.R. told Stennis that she did not want to continue doing sex work, and he gave her a ""pep talk"" to  convince her not to stop. ECF No. 181 at 73-74. On another call, Stennis told A.R. to read the rules of being a  prostitute from a book titled ""Pimpology: The 48 Laws of the Game"" by author ""Pimpin' Ken."" Stennis then  chastised A.R. for having a bad attitude and not following Pimpin' Ken's rules completely. Pimpin' [*13]  Ken's rules  include that a prostitute must obey her pimp, must not call the police, and must not run away. F. Prosecution and Conviction In late 2019, Bloomington Detective Heather Jensen referred Stennis's case for potential federal prosecution. In  January 2020, a federal grand jury charged Stennis with one count of sex trafficking of A.R. by force, fraud, or  coercion and two counts of violating the Mann Act. ECF No. 14. In October 2020, a superseding indictment was  filed, charging Stennis with an additional count of sex trafficking of A.R. by force, fraud, or coercion and one  count of obstructing the enforcement of § 1591. ECF No. 62. At trial, Stennis testified in his own defense and conceded guilt on the Mann Act counts. Stennis admitted that he  was a pimp and that he had promoted A.R. and A.J. as prostitutes. He even admitted to hitting A.R. in the  bathroom at the La Quinta and threatening her with death over the phone while he was in jail. ECF No. 181 at 181,  214-15. Stennis's defense, essentially, was that the violence and threats of violence stemmed from a dysfunctional  romantic relationship; he insisted that he had not used violence, threats of violence, [*14]  or other coercion to  make A.R. engage in prostitution. See id. at 194, 204-05. He further contended that he had no idea that he was   Page 6 of 9   being investigated for sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion; he thought he was being investigated only for  domestic violence and promoting prostitution. Id. at 186. At the close of the government's case-in-chief, Stennis moved for a judgment of acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.  ECF No. 181 at 132. The Court reserved ruling on that motion until after the jury returned its verdict. Id. After  presenting his defense, Stennis renewed his oral Rule 29 motion. Id. at 233. The Court again reserved ruling on the  motion (except that the Court ruled that Stennis was not entitled to relief as to Count 2 on the ground of improper  venue). ECF No. 182 at 6-8. After the jury returned a guilty verdict, the Court requested briefing on the Rule 29  motion as it pertained to Count 5 (the obstruction count). Id. at 90. At Stennis's sentencing hearing, the Court ruled from the bench on Stennis's Rule 29 motion. Specifically, the Court  said: Mr. Stennis moved under Rule 29 for a judgment of acquittal. Having reviewed the trial transcript carefully and  having conducted additional legal research, I deny the Rule 29 motion [*15]  as to all counts, including Count 5,  and I will explain the basis of my ruling in a written order that I hope to issue in the near future. ECF No. 216 at 4. This memorandum provides the explanation promised by the Court. II. ANALYSIS A. Legal Standard On a defendant's motion, the Court ""must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is  insufficient to sustain a conviction."" Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a). In ruling on a Rule 29 motion, the Court must view the  evidence in the light most favorable to the government, resolve any evidentiary conflicts in the government's favor,  and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict. United States v. Jenkins, 758 F.3d 1046, 1049 (8th Cir.  2014). The Court may grant the motion only if no reasonable jury could have convicted the defendant. Id. Because  Stennis moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government's case and the Court reserved its ruling at  that time, the Court must consider only the government's evidence in ruling on his motion. Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(b). B. Count 5: Obstructing the Enforcement of § 1591 The jury convicted Stennis of violating 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) by obstructing the government's investigation of him for  sex trafficking. Section 1591(d) provides that ""[w]hoever obstructs, attempts to obstruct, or in any way interferes  with or prevents [*16]  the enforcement of [18 U.S.C. § 1591], shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for a term  not to exceed 25 years, or both."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d). Notably, § 1591(d) does not contain an express mens rea  element. When Congress is silent as to mental state, the general rule is that a defendant cannot be convicted  unless he ""know[s] the facts that make his conduct illegal."" See Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 605-07,  616-19, 114 S. Ct. 1793, 128 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1994); see also United States v. White, 863 F.3d 784, 787 (8th Cir.  2017) (en banc). Consistent with that rule, the few courts that have interpreted § 1591(d) have found that the statute  includes a knowledge requirement. See United States v. Farah, 766 F.3d 599, 613 (6th Cir. 2014) (""Here, [§  1591(d)] is silent, thus knowingly is the appropriate mens rea.""); United States v. McCray, No. 1:15-cr-212-WSD,  2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115689, 2017 WL 3141172, at *14 (N.D. Ga. July 25, 2017) (""To convict a defendant of  [violating § 1591(d)], the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly  obstructed or attempted to obstruct the enforcement of Section 1591 . . . .""). ""It is for [the Court], through interpretation of the statute, to define the mens rea required for a conviction""—here, to  determine which facts the government must prove Stennis knew. Staples, 511 U.S. at 612 n.6. Without the benefit  of much case law on the issue, the Court was required to draft the jury instructions for Count 5 essentially from  scratch. After careful consideration and extended discussion with the parties, see ECF No. [*17]  181 at 18-28, the  Court instructed the jury that, to convict Stennis on Count 5, the jury had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that  Stennis (1) ""was being investigated or prosecuted for sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion""; (2) ""knew of  Page 7 of 9   that investigation or prosecution""; and (3) ""voluntarily and intentionally acted in some way to obstruct, attempt to  obstruct, interfere with, or prevent that investigation or prosecution."" ECF No. 153 at 11. The Court further instructed the jury that it was not necessary for the government to prove: (1) that Stennis knew  that a federal statute made it illegal to engage in sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion; (2) that Stennis was  in fact guilty of sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion; or (3) that Stennis was aware of the federal nature of  the investigation of him for sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion. Id.; see 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) (prohibiting ""in  any way interfer[ing] with or prevent[ing] the enforcement of"" § 1591 (emphasis added)); see also United States v.  Delay, 788 F. App'x 551, 552 (9th Cir. 2019) (reserving judgment on whether government must prove that  defendant knew he would interfere with a federal investigation). After a thorough review of the transcript of the trial and the [*18]  exhibits admitted into evidence at the trial, the  Court finds that a reasonable jury could have found that the government established all of the elements of a §  1591(d) offense beyond a reasonable doubt: First, Stennis was being investigated for sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion. One investigation started on  February 5, 2019, after A.R. used Stennis's phone to send a text message to her mother. A.R.'s mother relayed that  text message to the police, and the police then arrested Stennis after directing the bus driver to pull over. The  alarming nature of A.R.'s text, her mother's response, and the fact that Stennis was holding A.R.'s identification  card at the time of his arrest gave the police reason to believe that Stennis was coercing A.R. Of course, Stennis was engaged in the sex trafficking of A.R. at that point, as he more or less told the police, and  as the police confirmed by finding the online advertisements listing Stennis's phone number. It is possible that even  though the police had reason to believe that Stennis was A.R.'s pimp and that Stennis was holding her against her  will, the police may not have immediately known why Stennis was holding her. But that does not matter; [*19]  the  police had begun to investigate the conduct that was ultimately determined to be sex trafficking by force, fraud, or  coercion. That was sufficient to bring the investigation within the ambit of § 1591(d). A second investigation of Stennis for sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion began after police were called to  the La Quinta. The police were dispatched to the hotel because a guest had reported sounds of yelling and  someone being thrown against a wall and because a 911 operator had received a call from the location of the hotel  with no voice but with sounds of a struggle. Once Officer Mast arrived, A.R. told him that she was a prostitute and  Stennis was her pimp, that she no longer wanted to do sex work for Stennis, and that Stennis had started beating  her shortly after she informed him of that fact. A.R. bore fresh injuries (including a new black eye), and the room  contained evidence of a violent struggle, corroborating A.R.'s account. Thus, the investigation of Stennis by the  Bloomington police was from the outset an investigation into whether he had engaged in sex trafficking by force,  fraud, or coercion. Second, Stennis knew of these investigations. There is little dispute that [*20]  he knew that he was being  investigated for something. He was first arrested shortly after A.R. sent the text from the Megabus, and he was  arrested a second time shortly after he assaulted A.R. at the La Quinta. A reasonable jury could have found that Stennis also knew that among the crimes for which he was being  investigated was the crime of sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion. As to the Minnesota investigation:  Stennis knew that he had been acting as A.R.'s pimp, he knew that A.R. did not want to keep doing sex work, he  knew that he had assaulted A.R. at the La Quinta after she said as much, and he knew that the Bloomington police  were investigating him for what he had done at the La Quinta. The jury could easily find that Stennis knew that he  was being investigated by the Bloomington police for suspected sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion.     Page 8 of 9   As to the Westlake investigation: Stennis again knew that he had been traveling with A.R. and acting as her pimp,  and he knew that he had been found holding A.R.'s identification card. It is possible that Stennis did not see A.R.'s  text message to her mother from his cell phone, as that text message was deleted from his phone (possibly [*21]   by A.R. after sending it). ECF No. 179 at 116-17. But a reasonable jury could have found that Stennis must have  known that the bus suddenly pulled over and police came onto the bus to arrest him because A.R. had  communicated to someone that she was being held against her will. Stennis knew that these investigations were ongoing when he engaged in the obstructive conduct. Just before his  arrest in Bloomington, he knew that he was under investigation for assaulting A.R. in relation to her sex work for  him; that is presumably the reason why he told A.J. to take his phone and delete information connected to his  activities as a pimp. Stennis never had any reason to believe that the Bloomington investigation had terminated; to  the contrary, he continued to be held in custody in Minnesota. Stennis likewise had no reason to believe that the  Westlake investigation had concluded. As Stennis himself said in a May 2019 jail call with A.R., he received  paperwork from the Department of Homeland Security informing him of its investigation into his involvement in  human trafficking. Any obstructive activity Stennis undertook from that point onward (if not earlier) would have  been directed at both the [*22]  federal human-trafficking investigation and the Bloomington investigation (which  did not become federal until late 2019). Third, Stennis voluntarily and intentionally acted to obstruct, interfere with, or prevent those investigations. Shortly  before Stennis was taken into custody at the La Quinta, he gave A.J. his phone and told her to delete everything  related to his activities as a pimp, to change the phone number, and to lie to the police about the phone and about  her work as a prostitute. The inference that Stennis was trying to impede a sex-trafficking investigation is  strengthened by the kind of lie that Stennis asked A.J. to tell (viz., that Stennis and A.R. had been in a fight about  not wanting to have a threesome). That lie would not be a defense against a domestic-assault charge, but it would  be a defense against a § 1591(a) charge. Further examples of Stennis's obstructive behavior abound: telling A.J. to dissuade A.R. from pressing charges  against him; insisting that A.R. follow his rules, including not talking to the police and not acting to Stennis's  detriment; threatening violence against A.R. after she said or did something to upset him; and instructing A.R. to  change her phone [*23]  number so that law-enforcement officers could not find her. See United States v. Brinson,  772 F.3d 1314, 1327-28 (10th Cir. 2014) (holding that calling subpoenaed witness from jail and encouraging her not  to testify before grand jury was sufficient evidence to support § 1591(d) conviction). Stennis's goal with respect to  all of these acts—sometimes expressly stated during jail calls and other times reasonably inferable from the  evidence—was to hinder the investigations of his conduct. In sum, the evidence presented by the government in its case-in-chief was sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to  find that the government had established all of the elements of a § 1591(d) offense beyond a reasonable doubt. C. The Remaining Counts Little need be said about Counts 3 and 4, the Mann Act violations. There was overwhelming evidence that Stennis  transported A.R. and A.J. from Minnesota to North Dakota to engage in prostitution. In fact, Stennis readily  conceded guilt on these counts at trial. ECF No. 179 at 32; ECF No. 181 at 191; ECF No. 182 at 34-35. There was also sufficient evidence for a jury to convict Stennis on Counts 1 and 2, the two sex-trafficking counts.  With respect to Count 1—which related to the period from January 2019 (when Stennis met A.R.) to March  2019 [*24]  (when Stennis was arrested for assaulting A.R.)—the jury could reasonably have concluded that  Stennis recruited, enticed, transported, provided, obtained, advertised, or maintained A.R. while knowing that he  would use some combination of force, threats of force, or coercion to cause A.R. to engage in sex work. Count 2 related to the period from May 2019 to November 2019, during which period Stennis was in custody in  Minnesota. Even though Stennis was in jail, he continued to act as A.R.'s pimp. Stennis managed A.R.'s sex work  through jail calls, telling her where to post advertisements, which hotels to use, and how much to charge. He  Page 9 of 9   badgered A.R. into rereading his rules—including rules requiring A.R. to obey him, never call the police, and never  run away—and then chastised A.R. for her lack of commitment to the rules. Stennis repeatedly ordered A.R. to put  money on his jail account. And when A.R. did not do what Stennis wanted—especially when she failed to send him  money—Stennis would threaten to hurt or kill her. A jury could reasonably conclude that Stennis, although  incarcerated, coerced A.R. into prostitution through threats of serious harm. Last, Stennis argued that venue did [*25]  not lie in the District of Minnesota for either of the sex-trafficking counts.  At trial, the Court denied the Rule 29 motion on this ground with respect to Count 2 and reserved judgment on that  ground with respect to Count 1, later denying the motion as to Count 1 at Stennis's sentencing hearing. Venue for a  federal crime lies in any district in which that offense ""began, continued, or was completed."" United States v. Banks,  706 F.3d 901, 904 (8th Cir. 2013); see also 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a) (""Any offense involving . . . transportation in  interstate . . . commerce . . . is a continuing offense and, except as otherwise expressly provided by enactment of  Congress, may be inquired of and prosecuted in any district from, through, or into which such commerce . . .  moves.""). The events in Minot and Bloomington are sufficient to show that Stennis moved A.R. in interstate  commerce into the District of Minnesota during the time period charged in Count 1 in order to continue forcing or  coercing her into sex work. Thus, under § 3237(a), a reasonable jury could find that venue for Count 1 lay in this  District. In sum, a reasonable jury could conclude that the government proved all elements of all counts beyond a  reasonable doubt. The Court therefore denied Stennis's Rule 29 motion in all respects.

"Ross v. Jenkins, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54295","MEMORANDUM AND ORDER Page 2 of 11   Before the court is plaintiff Kendra Ross's Motion to Amend [*2]  Judgment (Doc. 285), filed in Ross v. Jenkins, No.  17-cv-2547 (also available as Doc. 88 in the CM/ECF record in Ross v. The Promise Keepers, Inc., No. 19-cv- 2091). Defendants have not filed a response and the time for filing one has expired. For reasons explained below,  the court denies plaintiff's motion. I. Background a. Case History On September 15, 2017, in the case captioned Ross v. Jenkins, plaintiff Kendra Ross filed a Complaint against  Royall Jenkins, The Value Creators, Inc. (f/k/a The United Nation of Islam, Inc.), The Value Creators LLC, and The  Value Creators Inc. Doc. 1. The Complaint asserted 16 federal and state law claims. On May 23, 2018, the court  entered default judgment against defendants Royall Jenkins, The Value Creators, Inc. (f/k/a The United Nation of  Islam, Inc.), The Value Creators LLC, and The Value Creators Inc. (the ""Judgment Debtors""). See Doc. 41. Plaintiff then filed a separate action—captioned Ross v. The Promise Keepers, Inc.— seeking to invalidate certain  asset transfers from Judgment Debtors to The Promise Keepers, Inc., The Promise Keepers 417 Inc., and The  Promise Keepers [*3]  417, Inc. Am. Compl., Ross v. The Promise Keepers, Inc., No. 19-cv-2091 (D. Kan. Mar. 25,  2019), ECF No. 45. Plaintiff named The Promise Keepers, Inc., The Promise Keepers 417 Inc., and The Promise  Keepers 417, Inc. as defendants. Id. For simplicity, this order refers to these defendants as ""The Promise Keepers""  collectively. Plaintiff filed a Motion to Consolidate (Doc. 57) in Ross v. The Promise Keepers, Inc., No. 19-cv-2091 to consolidate  the case with Ross v. Jenkins, No. 17-cv-2547, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 42. Mot. to Consolidate, Ross, No. 19-cv-2091  (D. Kan. Apr. 1, 2019), ECF No. 57. On April 11, 2019, the court granted plaintiff's motion and consolidated Case  No. 19-cv-2091 with Case No. 17-cv-2547. Doc. 193. On April 23, 2019, plaintiff filed an Application for Clerk's Entry of Default against The Promise Keepers. Doc. 194.  On May 1, 2019, the Clerk granted that motion and entered default against The Promise Keepers under Federal  Rule of Civil Procedure 55(a). Clerk's Entry of Default, Ross, No. 19-cv-2091 (D. Kan. May 1, 2019), ECF No. 68. On June 19, 2019, plaintiff filed a Motion for Default Judgment against The Promise Keepers, seeking judgment in  the amount of $8,055,730.64. Doc. 208. Plaintiff asserted The Promise Keepers were [*4]  liable for her judgment in  Ross v. Jenkins under principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel. Doc. 209 at 8-9. Plaintiff also sought  judgment under two alternative claims against The Promise Keepers: one for violation of the Kansas Uniform  Fraudulent Transfer Act (""KUFTA"") and the other for unjust enrichment. Id. at 9-13. On March 16, 2020, the court denied default judgment on plaintiff's ""res judicata/collateral estoppel"" claim and  unjust enrichment claim. Doc. 266 at 8-10, 12-13. But, the court concluded plaintiff had established that ""Judgment  Debtors and The Promise Keepers acted with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud plaintiff, violating the  KUFTA."" Id. at 12. And the court concluded that this violation entitled plaintiff to recover damages. Id. at 13. But,  because the record did not support the amount of damages sought by plaintiff's motion, the court denied her motion  (Doc. 208) without prejudice to refiling. Id. at 14.      2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54295, *1 Page 3 of 11   b. Plaintiff's ""Renewed Partial Motion for Default Judgment"" (Doc. 269) Plaintiff then filed a ""Renewed Partial Motion for Default Judgment"" and ""submit[ted] this Motion for Default  Judgment against Defendants, [The Promise Keepers] in the amount of $300,000, plus interest."" Doc. 269 [*5]  at  1. In support, plaintiff argued ""Kansas law permits this Court to void the transfers between Judgment Debtors and  The Promise Keepers 'to the extent necessary to satisfy [plaintiff's] claims.'"" Doc. 270 at 4 (quoting Kan. Stat. Ann.  § 33-207(a)(1)). Plaintiff asserted she ""'may recover judgment for the value of the asset transferred' or 'the amount  necessary to satisfy the creditor's claim, whichever is less.'"" Id. at 4-5 (quoting Kan. Stat. Ann. § 33-208(b)). Plaintiff directed ""this Court to the Expert Report of William C. Harvey, II regarding the West Virginia property  previously identified in an exhibit to the Ross Memorandum [Doc. 209] at ECF 209-4 (the 'West Virginia  Property')[.]"" Id. at 5. Plaintiff explained, ""the West Virginia Property had a retrospective market value of $300,000  on the date of its fraudulent conveyance to The Promise Keepers."" Id. So, plaintiff argued, ""the retrospective market  value of the West Virginia Property is less than 'the amount necessary to satisfy' her claim of $8,055,730.62, and  therefore Kansas law entitles [plaintiff] to judgment in the amount of $300,000, which equals 'the value of the asset  transferred.'"" Id. (quoting Kan. Stat. Ann. § 33-208(b)). She thus requested ""an order entering partial default  judgment against The Promise Keepers [*6]  Inc., The Promise Keepers 417 Inc., and The Promise Keepers 417,  Inc. on her KUFTA count in her Complaint in an amount of $300,000."" Id. But plaintiff didn't attach an affidavit to the motion supporting her damage claim. See Docs. 269, 270. The court  thus deferred its ruling on the motion and ordered plaintiff to do one of two things: supplement the record or  schedule an evidentiary hearing. Doc. 276. Plaintiff complied and filed supplementary materials supporting her  damage claim for the West Virginia Property. Doc. 279. The supplementary materials established the value of the  West Virginia Property was $300,000 when the Judgment Debtors had fraudulently transferred it to The Promise  Keepers. See id. at 6 ¶ 3. But plaintiff's motion and supplementary materials only established the value of the West  Virginia Property. See Docs. 270, 279. That is, plaintiff didn't try to prove damages for any of the other property  that—according to her Amended Complaint—was transferred fraudulently. See Am. Compl. Ross v. The Promise  Keepers, et al., No. 19-cv-2091 (D. Kan. Mar. 25, 2019), ECF No. 45 at 18-19. c. Court's Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion and Directing Entry of Judgment (Doc. 280) ""The court already [*7]  [had] concluded that plaintiff [had] shown Judgment Debtors and The Promise Keepers  [were] liable to her for damages under the Kansas Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act[,]"" so the court ""consider[ed]  only whether the record support[ed] plaintiff's requested damage award."" Doc. 280 at 4-5. The court concluded,  ""Plaintiff has established that the West Virginia property's market value was $300,000 when Judgment Debtors  transferred it to The Promise Keepers on July 7, 2018."" Id. at 6. And, the court granted ""plaintiff's request for  monetary damages"" because ""Plaintiff [was] entitled to a $300,000 judgment—the value of the West Virginia  property Judgment Debtors transferred to The Promise Keepers on July 7, 2018."" Id. The court then entered  ""default judgment against the Promise Keepers on plaintiff's Kansas Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act claim in the  amount of $300,000."" Id. The court also closed the case and noted: The court notes plaintiff contends her motion is ""partial."" Doc. 269 at 1; Doc. 270 at 1. But plaintiff never  explains what ""partial"" means in her motion. Nor does she invoke Rule 54(b), which allows the court to enter  ""final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties"" if [*8]  the court determines ""there is no  just reason for delay."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). The court is aware that plaintiff alleged The Promise Keepers  received other property fraudulently transferred from Judgment Debtors, but in this ""partial"" motion, plaintiff  merely invokes Rule 55(b), which does not provide for partial judgments. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b). The court  thus enters final judgment and closes the case. Id. at 6 n.2. The court instructed The Clerk of the Court ""to enter judgment against defendants The Promise  Keepers, Inc., The Promise Keepers 417, Inc., and The Promise Keepers 417 Inc. for $300,000 plus post-judgment  interest at the rate permitted by law."" Id. at 7. Judgment was entered ""in favor of plaintiff against defendants in the  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54295, *4 Page 4 of 11   amount of $300,000, plus post-judgment interest at the rate permitted by law."" Ross v. The Promise Keepers, Inc.,  No. 19-cv-2091 (D. Kan. July 17, 2020), ECF No. 86. II. Motion to Amend Judgment Plaintiff's motion to amend judgment makes two main arguments. First, she argues the court erred by refusing to  enter partial judgment because her ""Renewed Partial Motion for Default Judgment"" (Doc. 269) invoked Fed. R. Civ.  P. 55—not Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Doc. 286 at 6. Second, she asserts an amended judgment ""is necessary to  prevent manifest injustice and to clarify"" [*9]  her position. Id. Plaintiff's Motion to Amend Judgment invokes Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). Doc. 285 at 1. ""Rule 59(e) permits a court to  alter or amend a judgment, but it 'may not be used to relitigate old matters, or to raise arguments or present  evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.'"" Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 554 U.S. 471,  485 n.5, 128 S. Ct. 2605, 171 L. Ed. 2d 570 (2008) (quoting 11C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure §  2810.1, pp. 127-28 (2d ed. 1995)). A ""court can grant relief under Rule 59(e) only when the court has  'misapprehended the facts, a party's position, or the controlling law.'"" Castanon v. Cathey, 976 F.3d 1136, 1141  (10th Cir. 2020) (quoting Servants of Paraclete v. Does, 204 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th Cir. 2000)). A court has  discretion when deciding a motion to amend under Rule 59(e). See Walters v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 703 F.3d  1167, 1172 (10th Cir. 2013). Plaintiff makes appropriate arguments for a Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion. She doesn't try to relitigate issues. See  Exxon Shipping Co., 554 U.S. at 485 n.5. Instead, she questions the substantive correctness of the court's Order  and Judgment closing Ross v. The Promise Keepers, Inc, No. 19-cv-2091. See Castanon, 976 F.3d at 1141 (the  court may grant relief under Rule 59(e) when the court misapprehends the controlling law). And, plaintiff asserts the  court misapprehended her position and thus caused manifest injustice. See id. (the court may grant relief under  Rule 59(e) if it misapprehended a party's position). Thus, the court considers plaintiff's two arguments, in turn,  below. III. Procedural Requirements for Entry [*10]  of Partial Default Judgment Plaintiff argues invoking Rule 55, instead of Rule 54(b), should not bar her from securing partial default judgment.  Doc. 286 at 8. And, she argues, ""courts in this District have invoked Rule 55 to grant partial default judgment, and  thus, [plaintiff] was permitted to seek partial default judgment as to the West Virginia Property under this rule."" Id. at  6 (citing Operating Eng'rs Loc. No. 101 Pension Fund v. Christiansen-Foust Steel, LLC, No. 07-2068-KHV, 2007  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35924, 2007 WL 1455889, at *2 (D. Kan. May 15, 2007)). a. Purposes of Rule 55 and Rule 54(b) Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55 allows a court to enter default judgment against a party who fails to plead or  otherwise defend a lawsuit. If the court determines it should enter a default judgment, plaintiff must adduce  evidence to support the amount of damages. See Mathiason v. Aquinas Home Health Care, Inc., 187 F. Supp. 3d  1269, 1274-75 (D. Kan. 2016) (explaining default judgment does not establish the amount of damages and ""Plaintiff  must establish that the amount requested is reasonable under the circumstances."" (citation and internal quotation  marks omitted)); see also 10A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2688 (4th ed. 2009) (""Once the  court decides that a judgment by default should be entered, it must determine the amount and character of the  recovery that should be awarded.""). ""Damages may be awarded only if the record [*11]  adequately reflects the  basis for the award via a hearing or a demonstration by detailed affidavits establishing the necessary facts.""  Mathiason, 187 F. Supp. 3d at 1275 (citation, internal quotation marks, and text alterations omitted). 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54295, *8 Page 5 of 11   In contrast, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) allows the court to ""direct entry of a final judgment as to one or  more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for  delay."" This provision ""relaxes the former general practice that, in multiple claims actions, all the claims had to be  finally decided before an appeal could be entertained from a final decision upon any of them."" Gelboim v. Bank of  Am. Corp., 574 U.S. 405, 409, 135 S. Ct. 897, 190 L. Ed. 2d 789 (2015) (citation and internal quotation marks  omitted). But, ""[a] decision that leaves a portion of the claim pending as to all defendants does not fall within the  ambit of Rule 54(b)."" 10 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2656 (4th ed. 2009); see also Jordan v.  Pugh, 425 F.3d 820, 826 (10th Cir. 2005) (""To be final for purposes of Rule 54(b), an order must be final in the  sense that it is an ultimate disposition of an individual claim entered in the course of a multiple claims actions.""  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). ""Rule 54(b) is not intended to provide a mechanism for splitting  multiple claims into separate lawsuits."" See Jordan, 425 F.3d at 829. ""Interrelated [*12]  legal claims and alternative  theories for recovery should be litigated together and appealed together."" Id. A judgment ""is not final until it is set out separately and entered as required by Rule 58."" 10 Wright & Miller, Federal  Practice and Procedure § 2656 (4th ed. 2009); see also id. at § 2651 (""rendition of a judgment is the  pronouncement of [a court's] decision and the act that gives it legal effect.""). A party may execute an award only  ""upon a final judgment."" Redding & Co. v. Russwine Constr. Corp., 417 F.2d 721, 727, 135 U.S. App. D.C. 153  (D.C. Cir. 1969). And until entry of final judgment, there is ""no judgment upon which an execution may issue prior to  adjudication of the case in its entirety."" Id.; see also United States v. Muzio, 757 F.3d 1243, 1257 (11th Cir. 2014)  (Coogler, J., concurring) (collecting cases) (explaining execution may issue only upon final judgment). Without ""a  Rule 54(b) order, a party who received a favorable, partial judgment could not register it[.]"" Williams v. Seidenbach,  958 F.3d 341, 353 (5th Cir. 2020) (Ho, J., concurring) (citing FDIC v. McFarland, 243 F.3d 876, 892-93 (5th Cir.  2001)). b. Analysis Plaintiff's argument confuses a court's authority to enter, on one hand, a final judgment under Rule 55 and, on the  other hand, direct entry of partial judgment on a claim under Rule 54(b). Plaintiff's ""Renewed Partial Motion For Default Judgment"" asked the court to enter default judgment ""in the amount  of $300,000, plus interest."" Doc. 269 at 1. The court entered [*13]  judgment for the value of the West Virginia  Property because plaintiff repeatedly asked for a judgment of $300,000. See id.; see also Doc. 270 at 1, 5  (requesting court to enter default judgment ""for $300,000, plus interest"" and explaining, ""the retrospective market  value of the West Virginia Property is less than 'the amount necessary to satisfy' her claim of $8,055,730.62, and  therefore Kansas law entitles Ms. Ross to judgment in the amount of $300,000"" (emphasis added)); see also id. at  5 (""request[ing] an order entering partial default judgment against [The Promise Keepers] on her KUFTA count in  her Complaint in an amount of $300,000""). Plaintiff never invoked Rule 54(b), and under Rule 55, she never  explained how (or why) the court should direct entry of a partial default judgment for only part of her KUFTA claim.  So, the court interpreted plaintiff's ""Renewed Partial Motion for Default Judgment"" to request an entry of judgment  on her KUFTA claim for the value of The West Virginia Property—the only damage evidence presented to support  that claim in Ross v. The Promise Keepers, Inc., No. 19-cv-2091. Plaintiff's Motion to Amend Judgment continues to conflate the purpose of Rule 55 with Rule 54(b). She explains  she sought [*14]  ""partial default judgment in the interest of preventing a subsequent fraudulent transfer of the West  Virginia Property as she gathered evidence of her damages regarding the remaining fraudulent transfers"" on her  KUFTA claim. Doc. 286 at 6. And she asks the court to amend its Order (Doc. 280) to provide that the court's  judgment does not prohibit plaintiff from ""seeking additional judgments as to the other fraudulent transfers under  KUFTA as alleged in Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint[.]"" Id. at 9. But she never explains how the court can enter  partial default judgment limited to part of her KUFTA claim. And indeed, she cites no case law suggesting the court  has any authority to do so. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54295, *11 Page 6 of 11   To support her argument that courts in this District can grant partial default judgment under Rule 55, plaintiff cites  Operating Engineers Loc. No. 101 Pension Fund v. Christiansen-Foust Steel, LLC, No. 07-2068-KHV, 2007 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 35924, 2007 WL 1455889, at *2 (D. Kan. May 15, 2007). The Operating Engineers Complaint sought  ""relief which include[d] costs and attorney's fees and an order requiring defendant to post a surety bond""—a form of  injunctive relief. See 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35924, [WL] at *1. The court granted plaintiffs' motion—which it  construed as a motion for default judgment—in part. See 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35924, [WL] at *2. The court  granted partial [*15]  judgment on plaintiffs' request for attorney's fees and costs—resolving that claim. See id.; see  also Cox v. Flood, 683 F.2d 330, 331 (10th Cir. 1982) (explaining claim for attorney's fees is separate from merits of  a case and requires separate inquiry). But the court delayed entry of judgment on plaintiffs' claim seeking an order  requiring defendant to post a surety bond. See id. The court did not enter a judgment for part of a claim. See id. So,  Operating Engineers does not support plaintiff's position that Rule 55 authorizes the court to enter partial default  judgment on her KUFTA claim. Plaintiff also cites three other cases that—in her view—show Fed. R. Civ. P. 55 allows partial default judgment.  Doc. 286 at 7 (first citing Universal Am-Can, Ltd. v. Interstate Brands Corp., 160 F.R.D. 151, 152 (D. Kan. 1995)  (entering show cause order requiring third party defendant, who had failed to plead or otherwise defend, to show  cause why ""the court should not enter partial default judgment"" against that defendant on liability); then citing  Extreme Tool & Eng'g, Inc. v. Bear Cub Enters., LLC, No. 2:08-CV-257, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79004, 2009 WL  2948467, at *2-3 (W.D. Mich. Sept. 3, 2009) (granting motion for default judgment on plaintiff's claim seeking  permanent injunction for patent infringement—deciding that issue—but deferring decision on plaintiff's claims for  patent infringement money damages and claim for attorney's [*16]  fees); then citing United States v. Funds Up to &  including the Amount of $56,634 in U.S. Currency on Deposit in Banesco Int'l, Panama, 79 F. Supp. 3d 112, 114  (D.D.C. 2015) (entering default judgment against defendants—individual bank accounts—under civil forfeiture  statutes in 18 U.S.C. §§ 981(a)(1)(A) and 984 and thus resolving claims against those defendants)). But none of  these cases directed entry of partial judgment for part of a claim. And though Extreme Tool and Banesco do not  explicitly identify the procedural mechanism that these courts used to enter partial default judgment, the courts  resolved an entire claim or resolved all claims against a party—consistent with the authority conferred by Fed. R.  Civ. P. 54(b). In short, these cases don't support plaintiff's argument that the court can enter partial default  judgment on part of her KUFTA claim. Plaintiff also cites three other cases, arguing that they recognize federal courts can grant partial default judgment  under Fed. R. Civ. P. 55 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Doc. 286 at 7-8 (first citing Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers Local No.  43 Pension, Annuity & Health & Welfare Funds v. Kay-R Elec. Corp., No. 5:09-CV-0087, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  4798, 2011 WL 167080, at *3-4 (N.D.N.Y. Jan. 19, 2011); then citing Anfinson v. True Blue of Pinellas, Inc., No.  8:17-CV-210-T-17JSS, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157251, 2018 WL 4403277, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 29, 2018), report  and recommendation adopted,  [*17]  No. 8:17-CV-210-T-17JSS, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 156724, 2018 WL  4385125 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 14, 2018); then citing Canal Ins. Co. v. Fenn, No. 2:08-CV-957-MEF, 2011 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 14006, 2011 WL 624597, at *3 (M.D. Ala. Feb. 11, 2011)). As the next three paragraphs explain, these  cases do not support the result sought by plaintiff. The court begins with International Brotherhood. There, plaintiffs moved for partial default judgment and—unlike  plaintiff's original motion here—relied on Rule 54(b). International Bhd., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4798, 2011 WL  167080, at *1. The Northern District of New York sustained plaintiffs' motion in part, granting its request for ""partial  default judgment on the issue of liability pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) and 55(b)."" 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4798,  [WL] at *3. The court declined to enter an award of damages, however, because the case involved multiple         2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54295, *14 Page 7 of 11   defendants and fewer than all of them had defaulted. Id. And while the court recited that it was granting a ""partial  default judgment"" limited to liability, the case's CM/ECF docket reveals that the Clerk did not actually enter a  judgment based on this January 19, 2011 Order. See Docket, Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers Local No. 43 Pension,  Annuity & Health & Welfare Funds v. Kay-R Elec. Corp., No. 5:09-CV-0087 (GTS/DEP) (N.D.N.Y.). Instead, after  the court had decided all the case's claims, it entered a judgment—including an award of damages against the  defaulting defendants—and closed the case. See Judgment, Int'l Bhd [*18] ., No. 5:09-CV-0087 (GEP/DEP),  (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2011), ECF No. 32. Given this procedural history, the court concludes that the New York court's  order purporting to grant a partial default judgment instead announced a ""decision"" on which the Clerk—much later  and after the court had resolved all claims—entered a judgment. See id. The court's analysis thus concludes that  the ""partial default judgment"" is actually a decision and not a Rule 54(b) judgment. See 10 Wright & Miller, Federal  Practice and Procedure § 2651 (4th ed. 2009). As this leading treatise explains: [T]here are several different stages that lead to the creation of a judgment that is final and appealable. It is  important to differentiate the various steps that are part of this process. The first distinction that should be  drawn is between the adjudication, either by a decision of the court or a verdict of the jury, and the judgment  that is entered thereon. The terms ""decision"" and ""judgment"" are not synonymous under the federal rules. The  decision consists of the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law; the rendition of judgment is the  pronouncement of that decision and the act that gives it legal effect. Id. (footnotes omitted). These distinctions persuade the court that International Brotherhood announced a ""decision""  which took effect when the Clerk entered judgment. Plaintiff's second case—Anfinson—grants partial default judgment but only after the court had resolved an  entire [*19]  claim. In Anfinson, the magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation urging the district judge  enter ""partial default judgment"" on Count I, ""but wait to enter final judgment until after [plaintiff] moves for, and  receives, default judgment on Counts II and III or voluntarily dismisses those counts."" Anfinson, 2018 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 157251, 2018 WL 4403277, at *3. The district court adopted the recommendation and directed entry of  partial default judgment on Count I against defendant. Anfinson, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 156724, 2018 WL 4385125,  at *1. The Clerk entered a Partial Default Judgment on Count I in the amount of $14,400 plus interest—resolving  that claim in its entirety—but didn't certify it as a Rule 54(b) judgment. See Partial Default Judgment, Anfinson v.  True Blue of Pinellas, Inc., No. 8:17-CV-210-T-17JSS (M.D. Fla. Sept. 17, 2018), ECF No. 38. In this court's  judgment, since it wasn't certified under Rule 54(b), plaintiff likely could not execute on this ""partial judgment"" until  the court resolved the case in its entirety. See Redding, 417 F.2d at 727 (""there can be no execution until either the  demands of Rule 54(b) are satisfied or the case is fully litigated on all claims against all defendants""). Last, Canal Insurance is even farther afield. Plaintiff, an insurance company, filed an interpleader action against  defendants—potential claimants [*20]  under a policy of insurance. Canal Insurance, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14006,  2011 WL 624597, at *1. After depositing the interpleaded funds, interpleader plaintiff filed a motion for discharge  seeking (1) discharge from liability, (2) ""permanent injunction against any of the claimants filing suit against it,"" (3)  default judgment against defaulting defendants, and (4) attorneys' fees. Canal Insurance, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  14006, 2011 WL 624597, at *1. The court granted plaintiff's motion in part, granting all relief except the request for  attorneys' fees—thus adjudicating the entirety of these claims. 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14006, [WL] at *3. The court  entered a partial judgment under Rule 54(b)—after adjudicating the entirety of the claims against interpleader  plaintiff. See Partial Final Judgment, Canal Ins. Co. v. Fenn, No. 2:08-CV-957-MEF (M.D. Ala. Feb. 11, 2011), ECF  No. 117. None of plaintiff's cases persuade the court to grant the relief plaintiff now seeks. Plaintiff ""concedes that Rule 54 is the most common procedural mechanism for a partial default judgment"" but she  provides nothing to support her proposition here, i.e., that the court may enter a Rule 54(b) order awarding her  some of the damages she seeks to recover on her KUFTA claim. Doc. 286 at 8 n.5. Plaintiff fails to support any  argument that Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) applies to her case when she received default judgment on just one  aspect [*21]  of one claim and asks the court to enter judgment for merely a portion of her damages claimed on that  single cause of action. See id. Rule 54(b) addresses partial judgment on one or more claims. See Jordan, 425 F.3d at 826 (explaining a Rule  54(b) order is final only when ""it is an ultimate disposition of an individual claim""). Plaintiff never argues the  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54295, *17 Page 8 of 11   fraudulent transfer of The West Virginia Property constituted a separate claim. So, the court could not have entered  a Rule 54(b) order awarding some of the damages sought on her KUFTA claim while also allowing her, later, to  prove additional damages on that same claim. Instead, plaintiff's Renewed Partial Motion for Default Judgment  (Doc. 269) sought judgment on her KUFTA claim. When the court granted plaintiff's Renewed Partial Motion for  Default Judgment it directed the Clerk to enter a judgment for precisely what her motion had requested—a  judgment on plaintiff's KUFTA claim that awarded the damages in the amount plaintiff had proved, i.e., the value of  The West Virginia Property. In her Motion to Amend Judgment, plaintiff explains that she sought partial default judgment to prevent subsequent  fraudulent transfers of The West Virginia Property while she gathered evidence of other fraudulent [*22]  transfers.  See Doc. 286 at 6. But, the court already had entered a preliminary injunction against The Promise Keepers  enjoining them from transferring or disposing of any property. Preliminary Injunction Order, Ross v. The Promise  Keepers, No. 19-cv-2091 (D. Kan. Mar. 7, 2019), ECF No. 34 at 2. So, it is still unclear what relief plaintiff sought in  her Renewed Partial Motion for Default Judgment since she cannot execute on any recovery in Ross v. The  Promise Keepers, Inc. without entry of a judgment. Unless presented with a Rule 54(b) request—a request that  plaintiff here never made—the court can direct entry of judgment only when it has resolved all pending claims. See  Seidenback, 958 F.3d at 353 (explaining a prevailing party cannot register a partial judgment without a Rule 54(b)  order); see Jordan, 425 F.3d at 826 (requiring the court to resolve all pending issues on a claim before entering a  Rule 54(b) order). Notably, plaintiff cites no case from the Tenth Circuit, or even one from a court in our Circuit, where the court  granted partial default judgment and directed entry of partial judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 55 for part of a claim.  See Doc. 286 at 7. And, plaintiff never explains how the court can enter partial default judgment on her KUFTA  claim under either Rule 55 or Rule 54(b). c. [*23]  Conclusion In sum, plaintiff's motion fails to explain how the court, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 55, can direct entry of partial judgment  limited to part of her KUFTA claim limited to the value of The West Virginia Property and, later, allow her to proceed  against The Promise Keepers for other fraudulent transfers pleaded by that same claim. And, plaintiff makes no  argument that Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) applies or that it would allow the court to enter partial judgment limited to part of  plaintiff's KUFTA claim for the value of The West Virginia Property. The court did not err when it entered default  judgment on plaintiff's KUFTA claim and awarded damages for the value of The West Virginia Property—the only  damages she proved. IV. Plaintiff's Position and Manifest Injustice Next, plaintiff argues an amended judgment is necessary to clarify her position and prevent manifest injustice. Doc.  286 at 8. Plaintiff asserts ""amendment to the Judgment would clarify [plaintiff]'s position that she sought partial  judgment against The Promise Keepers as to the West Virginia Property only, though she intends to seek default  judgment under KUFTA as to the remainder of the fraudulent transfers by The Promise Keepers."" Id. As explained  above, plaintiff [*24]  never explains how the court can enter a ""partial judgment"" on her KUFTA claim limited to The  West Virginia Property and allow her to prove more damages on the same claim. Plaintiff has failed to explain how  the court misapprehended plaintiff's position in her ""Renewed Partial Motion for Default Judgment"" (Doc. 269). Plaintiff also argues that amending the Judgment is necessary to prevent manifest injustice. Doc. 286 at 8.  Amending the Judgment, she asserts, ""would ensure [plaintiff] is able to pursue full recovery against The Promise  Keepers and the Judgment Debtors, against whom she has an $8 million judgment for human trafficking and  forced labor, among other claims."" Id. She argues an amended judgment is necessary because ""preventing  [plaintiff] from pursuing partial default judgment may force her to forgo potential future recovery of additional assets  she has not yet been able to identify[.]"" Id. at 9. And, she argues, barring plaintiff from pursuing partial default  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54295, *21 Page 9 of 11   judgment may ""prevent her from any recovery unless and until she can identify each and every fraudulently  transferred asset at the same time."" Id. But plaintiff fails to explain how an amended judgment prevents the manifest [*25]  injustice she describes. As  already explained above, the court cannot enter a partial judgment on her KUFTA claim that is limited to The West  Virginia Property and allow plaintiff to continue proving other damages recoverable on that KUFTA claim. See  Jordan, 425 F.3d at 826-27 (explaining that only Rule 54(b) permits the court to direct entry of final judgment for  one claim in plaintiff's complaint before resolving all issues). Plaintiff cannot execute on any damages she proves in  Ross v. The Promise Keepers without entry of a final judgment. And plaintiff has not explained how the court can  award the relief she seeks, an entry of judgment limited to The West Virginia Property without directing entry of  judgment on her KUFTA claim. Also, the court is unwilling to leave Ross v. The Promises Keepers, Inc., open in perpetuity. Plaintiff filed her  Complaint in that case in February 2019. Compl., Ross v. The Promise Keepers, No. 19-cv-2091 (D. Kan. Feb. 15,  2019), ECF No. 1. She identified bank accounts and six properties—including The West Virginia Property—that  allegedly were transferred fraudulently. Am. Compl., Ross v. The Promise Keepers, No. 19-cv-2091 (D. Kan. Mar.  25, 2019), ECF No. 45 at 18-19. She never has sought [*26]  to prove damages for the other alleged fraudulently  transferred properties and her filings never explain why. The court is unwilling to permit the case to remain open  indefinitely, providing, in effect a platform for plaintiff to use to assert ad hoc damage claims as they arise. And, as  discussed in the next section, if plaintiff later discovers evidence to prove additional damages, she can seek relief  from the court under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). The court finds plaintiff's manifest injustice argument unpersuasive. V. Plaintiff Seeks Conflicting Relief Plaintiff's Motion to Amend Judgment seeks an amendment ""to (1) reflect that the consolidated case remains open  and/or (2) acknowledge she may proceed against The Promise Keepers for fraudulent transfers beyond the West  Virginia Property under KUFTA."" Doc. 286 at 5. Plaintiff also ""seeks clarification that the Court's footnote does not  impact [plaintiff]'s ability to pursue relief against Judgment Debtors in the consolidated case, Ross v. Jenkins[.]"" Id.  at 6. Plaintiff asks the court to amend footnote 2 in its earlier Order (Doc. 280). Doc. 286 at 9. She identifies the  amendment she seeks in this fashion: The Court noted plaintiff contends her motion is ""partial."" [*27]  Doc. 269 at 1; Doc. 270 at 1. But plaintiff never  explains what ""partial"" means in her motion. Nor does she invoke Rule 54(b), which allows the court to enter  ""final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties"" if the court determines ""there is no just  reason for delay."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). The Court is aware that plaintiff alleged The Promise Keepers received  other property fraudulently transferred from Judgment Debtors. On August 10, 2020, Plaintiff moved to amend  the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e). For the reasons stated in her motion, the Court reaffirms [that] the  judgment rendered does not close the case and decrees that nothing prohibits Ms. Ross from alleging  additional fraudulent transfers with the exception of the West Virginia Property and seeking additional  judgments as to other fraudulent transfers under KUTFA as alleged in Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, to  the extent the evidence supports such allegations. Doc. 286 at 9. In short—plaintiff explains—she seeks ""to ensure that closing the case does not prohibit her ability to  continue to enforce her judgment against the Judgment Debtors and The Promise Keepers."" Id. For reasons stated  below, the court cannot amend its Judgment in [*28]  Ross v. The Promise Keepers, Inc. as plaintiff requests. First, the court does not need to amend its Judgment in Ross v. The Promise Keepers, Inc. to clarify that plaintiff  may continue to execute on her judgment in Ross v. Jenkins. Consolidating cases under Fed. R. Civ. P. 42 ""is not  equivalent to merger and consolidated cases do not lose their separate identities because of consolidation."" Cooper    2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54295, *24 Page 10 of 11   Clark Found. v. Oxy USA Inc., 785 F. App'x 579, 581 (10th Cir. 2019) (citing Hall v. Hall, 138 S. Ct. 1118, 200 L.  Ed. 2d 399 (2018)). ""Consolidation is merely an administrative device used for convenience"" and each cause of  action retains its separate character. See Liming Wu v. Bernhardt, 820 F. App'x 669, 672 (10th Cir. 2020); see also  Chaara v. Intel Corp., 410 F. Supp. 2d 1080, 1094 (D.N.M. 2005) (""Consolidation is not like a marriage, producing  one indissoluble union from two distinct cases. Instead, consolidation is an artificial link forged by a court for the  administrative convenience of the parties; it fails to erase the fact that, underneath consolidation's facade, lie two  individual cases.""). So, a final judgment in one of two consolidated cases does not affect the rights of the parties in  the other consolidated cases. See Hall, 138 S. Ct. at 1128 (explaining Supreme Court's interpretation of Rule 42  and explaining ""constituent cases should end in separate decrees or judgments—the traditional trigger for the right  to appeal""). Plaintiff moved to [*29]  consolidate Ross v. Jenkins, No. 17-cv-2547, with Ross v. The Promise Keepers, Inc., No.  19-cv-2091 under Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a)(2). The court granted plaintiff's motion and consolidated the two cases for  purposes of discovery. Doc. 193 at 2-3. The court's order directing entry of judgment directed the Clerk to enter final  judgment in Ross v. The Promise Keepers, Inc. Doc. 280 at 6 n.2. And the Judgment (Doc. 86) entered in Ross v.  The Promise Keepers, Inc., No. 19-cv-2091 listed that case as the only one decided by that judgment. Since the  two cases retain their separate identity, the court's Judgment in Ross v. The Promise Keepers, No. 19-cv-2091,  does not affect plaintiff's right to collect on her judgment in Ross v. Jenkins, No. 17-cv-2427. So, the court finds  plaintiff's first argument doesn't warrant an amended judgment. Second, the court cannot amend its Order or Judgment in the fashion that plaintiff requests. Plaintiff asks for a  partial judgment on her KUFTA claim equal to the value of The West Virginia Property. See Doc. 286 at 8-9. But,  she also wants the case to remain open to allow her to prove more damages from allegedly fraudulent transfers. Id.  As the court explained in Section III, above, [*30]  it cannot enter a partial judgment without—at a minimum— resolving the entire claim. See Jordan, 425 F.3d at 826-27 (explaining the district court may enter a Rule 54(b)  order for partial judgment but only if it decides the ""ultimate disposition of an individual claim"") (internal quotation  marks omitted)). The court cannot amend its Order or Judgment as plaintiff requests. Plaintiff may not be without procedural remedies to prove more damages on her KUFTA claim. For example,  plaintiff might seek relief from the judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) if she can prove damages for any of the  other five fraudulently transferred properties and bank accounts based on evidence that she hasn't yet discovered.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) allows plaintiff to move for relief from judgment for: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move  for a new trial under Rule 59(e); (3) fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing  party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been  reversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is [*31]  no longer equitable; or (6) any other reason that justifies relief. Plaintiff must file a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)-(3) within one year after entry of final judgment. See Fed.  R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1). But, alternatively, plaintiff may file a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4)-(6) within a  reasonable time. Id. So, to the extent she still seeks to prove additional damages for other properties identified in  this claim in her Amended Complaint, Rule 60(b) may provide her with an avenue. Or, plaintiff might file a new case  asserting a KUFTA cause of action if she should learn of additional fraudulent transfers beyond those identified in  her Amended Complaint.",1
"State v. Jose Y., 2023 N.J. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 2234","[*1] Argued November 6, 2023 - Decided December 7,  2023   Before Judges Sabatino, Marczyk, and Chase.   On appeal from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law  Division, Somerset County, Indictment No. 20-01-0028.    Samuel Clark Carrigan, Assistant Deputy Public   Defender, argued the cause for appellant (Joseph E.   Krakora, Public Defender, attorney; Samuel Clark   Carrigan, of counsel and on the briefs).       1  Under  Rule  1:38-3(c)(9),  records  of  criminal  proceedings relating to child victims of sexual assault  are anonymized and excluded from public access in  order to protect the identity of the victims. As there was  no actual child victim in this case, such anonymization is  not necessary here.      Emily M. M. Pirro, Assistant Prosecutor, argued the  cause for respondent (John P. McDonald, Somerset  County Prosecutor, attorney; Emily M. M. Pirro, of  counsel and on the brief).   The opinion of the court was delivered by CHASE,  J.S.C. (temporarily assigned).   The main issue in this criminal appeal is whether the  Luring , Enticing Child by Various Means statute,  N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a), requires the State to prove a  defendant lured or enticed a ""child,"" in this case an  undercover law enforcement officer posing as a fourteen  -year-old girl, into traveling or accompanying [*2]  the  defendant to some location other than the victim's own  home.   We reject defendant Jose Y. Martinez-Mejia's contention  that because he enticed the ""child"" to meet him alone,  and defendant traveled to the ""child's"" home, a  judgment of acquittal should have been entered. By its  plain language, the statute forbids an adult from ""luring  or enticing a child to meet or appear at any other place.""  We hold that the child's home can be the ""other place.""  Here, that location is a place ""other"" than where the  defendant was when he communicated with the child.   In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we address  unrelated arguments raised by defendant on appeal  alleging  evidentiary  issues.  Having  found  those  arguments do not demonstrate plain error, we affirm  defendant's convictions and sentence.   A-3472-21      2     Page 2 of 9 I.   The prosecution in this matter originated in October  2019 when a team of state, federal, and local law  enforcement agencies participated in an undercover  operation to investigate adults using the internet to lure  ch ildren into sexual activity. Teams of officers were  stationed  in  an  apartment  complex  in  Franklin  Township, Somerset County.   Special Agent Cedro Cruz from the [*3]  Department of  Homeland Security served as a ""chatter,"" posing as a  fourteen-year-old girl named ""Angela."" Agent Cruz  created a profile for Angela on SKOUT, a location - based  social  networking  and  dating  application  emphasizing generalized user location. Because of age  restrictions on SKOUT, Angela's profile was created  using a birthdate to reflect that she was eighteen-years  old. Angela's profile picture and other pictures  associated with her account were photographs of an  adult female border patrol officer. Agent Cruz used age- regression software to alter the photographs, making  Angela appear younger.   At a jury trial, Agent Cruz testified solely as a fact  witness that on the afternoon of October 25, 2019,  acting as Angela, he accepted a SKOUT chat request  from defendant, who went by the username ""James.""  Defendant was thirty-two years old at the time.  Defendant's first messages were ""Hi, sweetheart, how  are you?"" and ""Hi, sweetheart, what are you doing?""  When    A-3472-21      3      Angela replied with ""nothing,"" he immediately followed  up with, ""[y]our pictures turn me on, honey. Where are  you from?"" When Agent Cruz testified about this first  exchange with defendant, the following [*4]  ensued:   Q: On October 25[,] of 2019, why was the conversation  only minutes?   A: Because the defendant sent Angela a, I would say a  lewd image, and I basically said gross and that  discontinued the conversation.   Q: And by lewd image what do you mean?   A: So it was an image of a male in tight boxer shorts  and you could see the contour of his - his penis.   Defendant contacted Angela again via SKOUT the next  afternoon in an   interaction that lasted approximately two hours. When  defendant expressed a desire to meet Angela, the  following exchange ensued:   Angela: Yeah, but I'm mad young.   Defendant: How old are you now?   Angela: Fourteen. You?   Defendant: Oh, I see, 23.   Angela: Oh, okay, cool.   Defendant: Yes, love, I like your body.   Angela: Aw, thanks.   Defendant: I would like to see more pictures from you.   Angela: Why?   Defendant: I like you.    A-3472-21      4     During this exchange, and after Angela revealed her  age, defendant sent Angela   multiple photographs of himself, including a picture of  his erect penis.   Angela revealed she was home alone because her  grandmother had left   and would not be returning until the next day. Defendant  asked Angela explicit   questions about sex and [*5]  masturbation and said he  wanted ""more sexy pic tures""   of her. When Angela asked if he wanted only pictures,  he responded, ""I want to   know you in person, baby."" Defendant asked if Angela  wanted to touch his body   and told her he wanted to perform oral sex on her.   The prosecution admitted the photographs into evidence  and published   them for the jury. Agent Cruz was asked to ""describe to  the jury what they're   Page 3 of 9 seeing[.]"" He replied, ""The jury is seeing an image sent  to Angela through   SKOUT on October 26[,] of a hand holding an erect  penis.""   On re-direct, Agent Cruz testified as follows:   Q: During the course of those communications at any  point in time did you threaten the defendant that he had  to continue communicating with you?   A: No. I was trying to dissuade him from communicating  with me.   . . . .   Q: How did you do that?   A: Well, I asked if he was a pic collector, and if he would  have said yes, I am just a pic collector, then he would  have just been a pic collector. I said that I -I was  [fourteen] years old, I would hope after somebody    A-3472-21      5      hears that, that they are communicating with a  [fourteen]-year-old,  they  would  then  cease  communications with that person. [*6]  I said that I was  alone, a fourteen-year-old alone in her house to which  he asked me if there were any neighbors around and,  you know, I lived with my grandmother and my  grandmother was not home. That, any reasonable  person, that's going to dissuade you and you are not  going to travel. As a matter of fact, you might try to  either report this person, which has happened in the  past, but in this situation it didn't happen. And on top of  that he sent a picture of his erect penis to a [fourteen]- year-old.    When defendant offered to come to Angela at 4:00 p.m.  that day, she gave   him the address of the apartment in Franklin and a  phone number associated   with Agent Cruz's undercover phone.   The communication then proceeded outside of SKOUT  and directly   between defendant and the undercover phone, which  recorded every call and   text message. Agent Cruz continued to send and reply  to text messages; while   Detective Katie Feehan from the New Jersey State  Police Internet Crimes   Against Children Unit (""ICACU"") provided Angela's voice  for phone calls.   Detective Feehan testified to her role with the ICACU  and the training   that she received in acting as a child in an undercover  capacity; however, [*7]  she   was not tendered as an expert witness. She testified to  the details of her three   phone calls with defendant.         A-3472-21      6      During the first phone call, defendant asked Angela to  confirm that she was home alone. Angela told defendant  her grandmother was in Atlantic City and would not be  returning for a couple of days. Angela said her  grandmother could not take her on the trip because she  was not old enough to gamble. On a second phone call,  Angela confirmed no one else was in th e house by  saying, ""Just me and my grandma, and she isn't here.  So I mean, I'm completely alone."" On the third phone  call, the following exchange ensued:   [Angela]: . . . I'm just trying to figure out if you're coming  up. Because, if not, I'm probably just gonna go out.   [Defendant]: I mean, okay. So let me take a shower and  then go - go over there.   [Angela]: You gonna come? [Defendant]: Yes.   [Angela]: Okay. Awesome. I'm gonna clean up a little bit  then.   When Angela asked defendant what he wanted to do  when he arrived, he repeated his desire to perform oral  sex on her. She reaffirmed she was going to clean the  apartment to prepare for his arrival, and then she was  going to wait for him. [*8]    Defendant hired an Uber to take him to Franklin and  sent Angela a screen shot of his phone's Uber  application, showing that he was on his way to her  house. When defendant texted Angela that he had  Page 4 of 9 arrived, Agent Cruz could   A-3472-21      7      see him standing outside through the apartment  window. Defendant was arrested and was found to be in  possession of a cell phone, a receipt with Angela's  address written on it, $184 dollars, and two condoms.   At trial, Detective Feehan was asked on cross- examination about her training on the topic of  entrapment. Detective Feehan testified that she ha d  reviewed the relevant New Jersey law and that it closely  matched the national standard. She testified that she  had been trained to allow the subject of the investigation  ""to set the tone, pace, and subject matter of the  conversation[.]"" She was presented with a portion of the  investigative standards from the ICACU, which was  entered into evidence.   On re-direct, the following exchange took place:   Q: On cross-examination you were asked some  questions about your training with regard to the topic of  entrapment. Do you recall that?   A: Yes.   Q: And you testified that you received training about  the [*9]  federal and also State of New Jersey  entrapment laws. Is that correct?   A: Yes.   Q: Did you follow the entrapment laws in this case? A:  Yes.          A-3472-21      8      Defense counsel re-crossed Detective Feehan on those  points, asking whether ""[w]hat do you wanna do when  you get here?"" was a conversation topic that defendant  initiated, to which she replied in the negative.   During an extensive charge conference, defense  counsel raised no objections to the language of the  second-degree luring charge. The jury was instructed  that a guilty verdict on luring required the State to prove:   1. That ""Angela"" was a child. When I say Angela I have  that in quotes, or, that the defendant reasonably  believed that Angela was a child.   2. Defendant-that defendant attempted to lure or entice  Angela into a motor vehicle, structure or isolated area,  to meet or appear at any other place; and,   3. That defendant had a purpose to commit a criminal  offense with or against the child.   The jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of all  charges: second - degree luring, N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a);  second-degree attempted sexual assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:5- 1(a)(3) and 2C:14-2(c)(4); third-degree attempted  endangering the welfare of a child, N.J.S.A. 2C:24- 4(a)(1), 2C:5-1(a)(1) and (a)(3); and third-degree [*10]   attempted promoting obscene material to a minor,  N.J.S.A. 2C:34 - 3(b)(1), 2C:5-1(a)(1) and (a)(3).   After merging the attempted endangering the welfare of  a child count with the attempted sexual assault count,  the judge sentenced defendant concurrently to five  years of imprisonment on the attempted sexual assault  charge; five years   A-3472-21      9      on the luring charge; and three years on the attempted  obscene material charge. Defendant was also subjected  to Megan's Law registration requirements and parole  supervision for life.   On appeal, defendant raises the following claims for the  first time:   I. THE LURING CHARGE MUST BE VACATED  BECAUSE DEFENDANT DID NOT TRY TO LURE A  CHILD INTO GOING ANYWHERE.   II. THE DEFENDANT'S CONVICTIONS SHOULD BE  REVERSED BECAUSE INADMISSIBLE LAY OPINION  TESTIMONY  FROM  INVESTIGATING  OFFICERS  INTRODUCED UNFAIR PREJUDICE.   II.   When a party does not object to an alleged trial error, or  otherwise preserve the issue for the appellate record, it  is reviewed for plain error. Review for plain error  requires determining: ""(1) whether there was error; and  (2) whether that error was 'clearly capable of producing  an unjust result,' [under Rule] 2:10-2; that is, whether  there is 'a reasonable doubt . . . as to whether [*11]  the  error led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have  reached.'"" State v. Dunbrack, 245 N.J. 531, 544 (2021)  (quoting State v. Funderburg, 225 N.J. 66, 79 (2016)  Page 5 of 9 (omission in original)). ""To determine whether an alle  ged error rises to the level of plain error, it 'must be  evaluated in light of the overall strength of the State's  case.'"" State v. Clark, 251 N.J. 266, 287 (2022) (quoting  State v.     A-3472-21      10      Sanchez-Medina, 231 N.J. 452, 468 (2018)). ""The mere  possibility of an unjust result is not enough.""  Funderberg, 225 N.J. at 79. Where there is a failure to  object, reviewing courts presume the newly minted  objection on appeal is ""not error"" and ""unlikely to  prejudice the defendant's case."" State v. Singleton, 211  N.J. 157, 182 (2012) (citing State v. Macon, 57 N.J. 325,  333-34, (1971)).   Statutory  interpretations  are  legal  determinations  reviewed by an appellate court ""de novo, 'unconstrained  by deference to the decisions of the trial court[.]'"" State  v. Fuqua, 234 N.J. 583, 591 (2018) (quoting State v.  S.B., 230 N.J. 62, 67 (2017)). A trial court's evidentiary  rulings, by contrast, are reviewed for abuse of  discretion. State v. Garcia, 245 N.J. 412, 430 (2021)  (citing State v. Nantambu, 221 N.J. 390, 402 (2015)). An  appellate court ""will not substitute [its] judgment unless  the evidentiary ruling is 'so wide of the mark' that it  constitutes 'a clear error in judgment.'"" Ibid. (quoting  State v. Medina, 242 N.J. 397, 412 (2020)).     III.   Defendant does not claim the indictment should have  been dismissed, nor does he explicitly express that the  trial court, sua sponte, should have found that the State  had not met the elements of [*12]  the crime at the close  of its case. Rather, defendant's issue seems to be a  conceptual one, where h e believes we should hold: (1)  telling a child you want to meet for sex; (2) asking them  to meet you    A-3472-21      11      to fulfill that desire; and (3) making sure a child is alone  and vulnerable before meeting them, is not luring or  enticing the child into a sexual encount er so long as the  child makes the mistake of meeting the would -be  predator at the child's own house.   Defendant emphasizes that the forbidden conduct  element of the statute is ""to lure or entice"" a child to go  somewhere. Relying on the dictionary definitio n of  ""lure,"" defendant argues its aim is ""to lead someone into  a dangerous or difficult situation that they otherwise  would not have entered."" Merriam-Webster's Collegiate  Dictionary, (11th ed. 2020). Therefore, defendant  reasons, the statute does not criminalize traveling to the  child for the criminal purpose. Defendant concedes a  child may be ""lured"" into staying at a place that they  otherwise would have left, such as a school after -hours,  but argues if a child would be at home or school  anyway, even without the defendant's enticement, then  luring has not [*13]  taken place.   Defendant argues, in the alternative, that even if the  statutory language was not clear, the only provision that  could be considered ambiguous is the term ""to meet or  appear at any other place."" Defendant employs the  canon of ejusdem generis to argue that the phrase ""any  other place"" must also refer to places where a child  must be lured to travel towards for the statutory  elements to be met. Defendant points to the luring  statute's close relationship to the kidnapping    A-3472-21      12      statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(c), to support his theory.  Defendant argues even if the statutory language did not  support his position, the principle of lenity should apply  in favor of interpreting the statute to require the child to  be lured to travel.   The State responds that defendant is asking us to  create a ""convenient loophole"" in the statutory scheme  by finding that an adult traveling to a child's location for  the purpose of sex is not criminalized by the luring  statute. The State maintains that a complicated analysis  of the text under ejusdem generis is not required since  the clause ""to meet or appear at any other place"" is  unambiguous on its face.   The  ""ordinary  meaning  and  significance""  of  statutory [*14]  language is acknowledged as ""'the best  indicator of [the Legislature's] intent.'"" Tumpson v.  Farina, 218 N.J. 450, 467 (2014) (alteration in original)  (quoting DiProspero v. Penn, 183 N.J. 477, 492 (2005)).  Only where the statutory language at issue is  ambiguous should a court ""look to extrinsic evidence,  such as legislative history [and] committee reports"" to  determine legislative intent. Tumpson, 218 N.J. at 468.  Where the textual analysis and extrinsic aids both fail to  resolve ambiguity, the rule of lenity ""requires that the  ambiguity be resolved in favor of the defendant."" State  Page 6 of 9 v. Regis, 208 N.J. 439, 451 (2011). Courts should ""avoid  statutory interpretations that 'lead to absurd or  unreasonable results.'"" State v. Lewis, 185 N.J. 363,  369 (2005) (quoting State v. Gill, 47 N.J. 441, 444  (1966)).    A-3472-21      13     The plain language of the statutory text in question  provides in relevant   part:   A person commits a crime of the second degree if he  attempts, via electronic or any other means, to lure or  entice-a child or one who he reasonably believes to be a  child into a motor vehicle, structure or isolated area, or  to meet or appear at any other place, with a purpose to  commit a criminal offense with or against the child.   [N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a) (emphasis added).]   One must look at the wording of the entire phrase in its  context, which   prohibits to ""lure or entice,"" and the entire dictionary  definition of both words  [*15]   to  determine  the  statute's  ordinary  meaning.  Defendant's argument only focuses   on the dictionary definition of ""lure"" to conclude that ""to  lead someone into a   dangerous or difficult situation that they otherwise would  not have entered""   means to go to another location. The definition of ""lure""  includes ""to lead astray   from one's true course."" Merriam-Webster's College  Dictionary, (11th ed. 2020). And ""entice"" is defined as  ""to lure or induce; esp., to wrongfully solicit (a person) to  do something."" Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019).  The   prohibited conduct is thus defined by its aim to lead  someone into a dangerous   or difficult situation that they otherwise would not have  entered. The course of   action Angela was lured into was staying alone,  isolated, and vulnerable to meet   an adult male for an illegal sexual encounter.       A-3472-21      14      Here, the ordinary meaning of the phrase ""to meet or  appear at any other place"" also leads to the conclusion  defendant engaged in prohibited conduct when he  enticed Angela to stay at her home and not go out with  her friends. There is no reason to construe the phrase of  ""any other place"" as containing an unwritten exception  for places [*16]  where the child is already located.  Here, that location is a place ""other"" than where the  defendant was when he communicated with the child.  Defendant went through great pains to ensure Angela  would be alone before telling her he was coming over.  Indeed, by requesting the child to stay at her home, the  abuse is all the easier to commit; since it lulls the child  into a false sense of security; creating the dangerous  circumstance of isolation and vulnerability that this  statute is meant to punish. Neither the dictionary  definitions nor the language of the statute expresses a  requirement of the victim going to a different place.     Although there is no need to make any further inquiry,  our decision is also supported by the legislative history,  which suggests an intent to create an expansive  scheme to criminalize an increasing number of  dangerous behaviors. The original text, now thirty years  old, was limited to luring a child into a motor vehicle. By  contrast, the current statute criminalizes two actions  (luring and enticing), by unlimited means (electronic or  any other), with two categories of victims (children or  those reasonably believed to be children), a wide  number of    A-3472-21 [*17]       15      prohibited enticements (motor vehicles, structures,  isolated areas, and meetings or appearances at any  other place), and a broadly stated purpose element (to  commit a criminal offense with or against the child).   In addition, analyzing this statute in relation to our  kidnapping statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:13-1, also undermines  defendant's position. The kidnapping statute was meant  to address the kind of danger isolation poses to a child,  and such isolation and danger can certainly be present  at the child's own home, especially where, as here, the  child is confirmed to be home alone. See State v. Cruz- Pena, 243 N.J. 342, 354-61 (2020) (kidnapping occurs  Page 7 of 9 when the victim is confined to one place for a  substantial period, citing to a litany of cases where  kidnapping - by-confinement occurs in places where the  victim would still otherwise be); State v. LaFrance, 117  N.J. 583, 592-93 (1990) (confining a victim to his own  bedroom for a substantial period in order to isolate the  man's wife and sexually assault her constituted  kidnapping).   Defendant's request that the principle of lenity support  an interpretation in his favor is similarly unavailing, and  is not required, given the unambiguous text and  expansive legislative history. The fact that other statutes  such as the child endangerment statute, [*18]  N.J.S.A.  2C:24 -4, might also criminalize a defendant's behavior  does not compel us to adopt a crabbed interpretation of  N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a).    A-3472-21      16     IV.   The remaining arguments presented by defendant  warrant no more than a brief discussion.   A.   Lay witnesses may testify ""in the form of opinions or  inferences if [the testimony]: (a) is rationally based on  the witness's perception; and (b) will assist in  understanding the witness's testimony or determining a  fact in issue."" N.J.R.E. 701. Perception ""rests on the  acquisition of knowledge through use of one's sense of  touch, taste, sight, smell, or hearing."" State v. McLean,  205 N.J. 439, 457 (2011) (citations omitted). Lay opinion  testimony is impermissible when it constitutes ""an  expression of a belief in defendant's guilt"" or ""an opinion  on matters that were not beyond the understanding of  the jury."" Id. at 463. Lay witnesses may not opine on a  matter ""as to which the jury is as competent as [the  witness] to form a conclusion[.]"" Id. at 459 (second  alteration in original) (quoting Brindley v. Firemen's Ins.  Co., 35 N.J. Super. 1, 8 (App. Div. 1955)). So long as  the lay witness opinion is competent under N.J.R.E.  701, and is not otherwise inadmissible, it will not be  objectionable simply becau se it ""embraces an ultimate  issue to be decided by the trier of fact."" N.J.R.E. 704.  See Biunno, Weissbard & Zegas, Current [*19]  N.J.  Rules of Evidence, cmt. on N.J.R.E. 704 (2023)  (""[O]pinion testimony is not inadmissible solely because  it includes the    A-3472-21      17     ultimate issue in question. If lay or expert opinion  testimony is otherwise   competent under N.J.R.E. 701, 702 and 703, the fact  that it may embrace the   ultimate fact issue in dispute does not render it  incompetent."").   Fact testimony, by contrast, is ""ordinary fact-based  recitation by a witness   with first-hand knowledge."" McLean, 205 N.J. at 460.  For a police officer, in   the context of a narcotics trial, such fact testimony may  include:   a description of what the officer did and saw, . . . that  defendant stood on a corner, engaged in a brief  conversation, looked around, reached into a bag,  handed another person an item, accepted paper  currency in exchange, threw the bag aside as the officer  approached, and that the officer found drugs in the bag.   Ibid.   In McLean, our Supreme Court cautioned against  admitting lay opinion   testimony by a police officer where the opinion is based  on the officer's training   and experience, writing ""the analysis of admissibility has  been, as it must be,   firmly rooted in the personal observations and  perceptions of the lay witness in   the traditional meaning [*20]  of the Rule 701."" 205 N.J.  at 459. The McLean Court   considered the admissibility of a police officer's  testimony in which he first   recounted his observations of an interaction between  two individuals and then   testified as to his own belief, based on his experience,  that what he had observed   was a hand-to-hand drug transaction. Id. at 446.       Page 8 of 9 A-3472-21      18      The McLean Court found the second part of the officer's  testimony inadmissible because the police officer had  not been qualified as an expert and because the lay  opinion rule could not provide a basis for admissibility.  Id. at 463. The Court held such testimony ""was  impermissible both because it was an expression of a  belief in defendant's guilt and because it presumed to  give an opinion on matters that were not beyond the  understanding of the jury."" Ibid.   B.   Defendant argues testimony given by Detective Feehan  included inadmissible lay opinions with ""zero probative""  value, which introduced such an unfair prejudice that a  new trial is required. Specifically, defendant argues  Detective Feehan should not have been permitted to  testify that she followed the laws on entrapment.  Defendant argues the entrapment statute requires the  issue to be settled by [*21]  the factfinder. The State,  meanwhile, contends the testimony was proper.   This testimony from Detective Feehan was offered on re  -direct examination, after detailed cross-examination  squarely placed entrapment at issue. Here, Detective  Feehan's testimony was like that of the hypothetical  narcotics officer described in McLean. It was a factual  recitation of her own actions during the operation,  namely that she followed protocol, not an opinion about  anything defendant did or did not do. The jury was free  to find her    A-3472-21      19      statements credible or not. Detective Feehan was not  asked for, and did not offer, her thoughts or beliefs as to  defendant's guilt or innocence. She only recounted the  actions she took that day.   Even to the extent that Detective Feehan's testimony  could be considered a lay opinion on entrapment, such  an opinion is not inadmissible simply because it goes to  an issue to be decided by the factfinder. It must be  incompetent under N.J.R.E. 701 or inadmissible on  other grounds. The only argumen t defendant advances  on this point is that the statement had ""zero probative  value,"" possibly an attempt to disqualify the statements  under N.J.R.E. 701(b) or N.J.R.E. 401. This position is  untenable, [*22]  given that entrapment and Detective  Feehan's training on the same were extensively  explored in cross-examination by defense counsel.   Detective Feehan's one-word answer of ""yes"" to the  question, viewed in light of the overall evidence against  defendant, was not ""clearly capable"" of producing an  unjust result. R. 2:10-2. It was evidence to be weighed  by the jury under a preponderance standard if and only  if they found guilt had been established.   C.   Defendant maintains Agent Cruz's description of the  photograph sent on October 25 as ""a lewd image"" and  pointing out the contour of the penis was unnecessary  and impermissibly purported to usurp the role of the  jury. The State    A-3472-21      20     believes the testimony was proper because Agent  Cruz's description was   rationally based on his own perception, as required by  N.J.R.E. 70 1(a).   Agent Cruz's testimony that defendant ""sent a picture of  [an] erect penis   to a [fourteen-year-old],"" his characterization of the  photograph as a ""lewd   image,"" and his description of the displayed photograph  indicating the ""contour   of the penis"" are opinion testimony only to the extent  that they reflect Agent   Cruz's beliefs about the images displayed for the jury.  Our Court [*23]  recently took   up the admissibility of lay witness testimony providing  subjective   interpretations of a video recording in State v. Watson,  254 N.J. 558 (2023).   There, the Court held:   A fact witness who participated in an event can of  course testify about it and recount relevant evidence  without resort to Rule 701. Rule 701, in its purest form,  allows witnesses to offer lay opinion testimony based on  their firsthand observation of events in real time. Beyond  Page 9 of 9 that, they can offer lay opinion testimony about parts of  a recording that depict what they perceived in real time.  In those instances, they plainly have sufficient personal  knowledge within the meaning of Rules 602 and 701.    [Id. at 599.]   The Watson Court also addressed the helpfulness  prong of N.J.R.E.   701(b), holding the analysis is ""more straightforward and  depends on the facts   of the individual case."" Id. at 600. In contrast, in State v.  Higgs the Court   disallowed narration evidence by a police officer who  was not present on the    A-3472-21      21      scene because ""[t]he jury was as competent as the  detective to view the video and determine what the  image did or did not show."" 253 N.J. 333, 3 36 (2023).  Higgs is distinguishable from this case because Agent  Cruz personally participated in the chat to which he was  testifying.   Applying this [*24]  same analysis to the photos before  Agent Cruz, it is clear he was permitted to testify as to  his firsthand observations of the photographs. To the  extent  his  testimony  included  any  subjective  interpretation of the photographs, it would still be an  admissible lay opinion since he personally participated  in the chat and therefore, under Watson, ""plainly [has]  sufficient personal knowledge"" to satisfy N.J.R.E.  701(a). 254 N.J. at 599. And Agent Cruz's testimony  was helpful to the jury under N.J.R.E. 701(b) because  this testimony was offered to explain his interactions  with defendant.   Defendant  posits  Agent  Cruz's  testimony  was  inadmissible because by stating that ""any reasonable  person"" would not continue chatting with someone who  revealed themselves to be a fourteen-year-old, and by  stating ""you are not going to travel"" after learning of the  child's age, Cruz impermissibly opined on defendant's  guilt.  This  opinion,  according  to  defendant,  impermissibly invaded the province of the jury by  embracing an ultimate issue.   Agent Cruz's testimony constitutes opinion testimony in  that it is not a factual recitation of actions taken or  observations made during the operation,    A-3472-21      22      but rather a subjective characterization [*25]  of what  defendant or others in defendant's position might do.  Therefore, to be admissible, the statement must satisfy  both the perception and helpfulness prongs of N.J.R.E.  701, and it must not constitute expression of a belief  about defendant's guilt or innocence.   Here, Agent Cruz's testimony about the behavior of ""any  reasonable person"" and that such a person is ""not going  to travel"" after learning of Ange la's age is more like the  precluded evidence in McLean, in that it is a subjective  lay opinion of defendant's behavior, based on Agent  Cruz's training and experience in performing these types  of operations in the past. These statements were  inadmissible lay opinions, and it was error for them to be  admitted.   However, considering the brevity of these comments  compared to Agent Cruz's overall testimony, the error  does not rise to the level of being clearly capable of  producing an unjust result and was not plain error, given  the overall strength of the State's case and the clear  evidence of defendant's continued sexually explicit  conversation with Angela after being told her age.   Affirmed.                  A-3472-21      23",0
"United States v. Lacy, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70886","MEMORANDUM AND ORDER On February 23, 2017, a jury convicted Defendant Daederick Lacy of one count of sex trafficking of a child, one  count of sex trafficking accomplished by force, fraud, or coercion, and one count of transportation with intent to  engage in criminal sexual activity. Lacy now moves this Court to enter a judgment of acquittal (Doc. 47). For the  reasons stated below, the Court denies Lacy's motion. I. Discussion Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(c), a defendant may move the Court to set aside a jury verdict and enter an acquittal.  Lacy argues that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal because there was insufficient evidence presented for  each of the three counts to sustain a conviction. In considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the  Court must determine whether ""viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier  Page 2 of 5   of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond [*2]  a reasonable doubt."" The jury may base  its verdict on both direct and circumstantial evidence, together with all reasonable inferences that could be drawn  therefrom. The Court may not ""weigh conflicting evidence or consider witness credibility, as that duty is delegated exclusively  to the jury."" Instead, the proper inquiry is for the Court to ""simply determine whether the evidence, if believed,  would establish each element of the crime."" Thus, the Court may only enter a judgment of acquittal if ""no rational  trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt."" A. Sex Trafficking of a Child To support a conviction for sex trafficking of a child, the Government must prove: (1) That the defendant knowingly recruited, enticed, transported, provided, or maintained a minor, whom the  defendant knew would be caused to engage in a commercial sex act; (2) That the defendant: a. Knew that the minor had not yet attained the age of 18 years; or b. Recklessly disregarded the fact that the minor had not attained the age of 18 years; or c. Had reasonable opportunity to observe the child; and (3) That the offense was in or affecting interstate commerce. Here, [*3]  the Government offered sufficient evidence pertaining to each element to support Lacy's conviction for  sex trafficking of a child. Direct evidence was provided through testimony of B.J., the minor victim, and through  Government's Exhibit 7—the Facebook conversation between B.J. and Lacy. Regarding the first element, B.J. testified that her first communications with Lacy occurred around November 5th,  2015 after Lacy ""in-boxed me on Facebook."" Lacy messaged B.J.: ""What's good. You trying to make some  [money]?"" After they established a relationship, B.J. testified that Lacy began posting advertisements for B.J. on  Backpage.com, suggesting that B.J. would perform ""sex acts for money."" According to B.J., clients would contact  Lacy about the ads, after which Lacy would drive B.J. to the ""call."" B.J. testified that she would then perform sex  acts in exchange for money, and B.J. would then return to Lacy and give him the money she had received. This  evidence is sufficient to establish the first element of the crime. Regarding the second element, sufficient evidence was introduced for the jury to find that Lacy knew B.J. had not  yet attained the age of 18, and that Lacy had reasonable opportunity [*4]  to observe B.J. First, B.J. testified that  she was 16 at the time she was performing ""calls"" for Lacy. B.J. testified that while she was doing these ""calls"" for  Lacy, ""[a]t first he thought I was 17, and then he found out my real age."" This was reflected in the Facebook  messages sent between B.J. and Lacy. She then testified that at one point during their relationship, she logged into  Facebook on Lacy's phone, and he read through the messages on her account. While reading through a message  chain between B.J. and her sister, Lacy discovered that B.J. was 16. B.J. testified that she and Lacy then had a         2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70886, *1 Page 3 of 5   conversation about her only being 16. The Government then asked: ""After he finds out you're 16, are there still  dates that occur—or calls that come in that you go and perform sex acts and receive money for?"" B.J. answered:  ""Yes."" Sufficient evidence was therefore presented to establish that Lacy knew B.J. had not yet turned 18.  Furthermore, B.J. testified that she had a relationship with Lacy between November 5th, 2015, and December 6th,  2015. This evidence is sufficient for a jury to find that Lacy had reasonable opportunity to observe B.J. Therefore,  this evidence is sufficient to establish [*5]  the second element of the crime. Finally, the Government presented sufficient evidence to establish that the offense was in or affecting interstate  commerce. The majority of Lacy's communications with B.J. were done through text messages and Facebook.com.  And Lacy arranged for B.J. to perform sex acts for money by posting advertisements to Backpage.com. This  evidence indicated that Lacy ""had utilized facilities of interstate commerce, such as the internet and cellular phones,  to engage in sex trafficking."" Accordingly, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime of sex trafficking of a child  beyond a reasonable doubt. B. Sex Trafficking Accomplished by Force, Fraud, or Coercion To support a conviction for sex trafficking accomplished by force, fraud, or coercion, the Government must prove  the following elements: (1) That the defendant knowingly recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained or maintained a  person whom the defendant knew would be caused to engage in a commercial sex act; (2) That the defendant knew that force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion, or any combination of such  means, would be used to cause such person to engage [*6]  in a commercial sex act; and (3) That the offense was in or affecting interstate commerce. Here, the Government offered sufficient evidence pertaining to each element to support Lacy's conviction for sex  trafficking accomplished by force, fraud, or coercion. Direct and circumstantial evidence was provided through  testimony of S.G. (the victim), S.G.'s mother, Officer Crafton, Mathew Molino, and through Government's Exhibits 1,  2, and 17. First, S.G. testified that Lacy contacted her through Facebook. Their Facebook conversation revealed that Lacy  promised S.G. more than $500,000 in income if she would agree to work for him, possibly as a model. Lacy told  S.G. that he had a flight attendant that worked for him, so S.G. could travel the world with him for free. When S.G.  agreed to meet with Lacy, Lacy took her to a dorm room at Friends University. There, S.G. was introduced to B.J.,  and the two began ""talking about other things, about sexual matters to other people."" Lacy then took S.G.'s phone  and car keys from her. Using pictures from S.G.'s phone, Lacy posted an advertisement of her on Backpage. Lacy  then told S.G. that she had a client, and he drove her to a hotel to meet the client, [*7]  at which point S.G. engaged  in a sex act with the client in exchange for money, which she provided to Lacy after the encounter. This evidence is  sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Lacy recruited, enticed, transported, or maintained a person whom  the defendant knew would be caused to engage in a commercial sex act. Second, testimony from S.G., her mother, and Officer Crafton sufficiently established that Lacy used force, threats  of force, fraud, or coercion to cause S.G. to engage in a commercial sex act. S.G. testified that Lacy was       2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70886, *4 Page 4 of 5   controlling of her. For example, she testified that Lacy tried to make her sell her car even though she did not want  to. She ""felt like [she] was forced,"" and not ""in control."" Mathew Molina's testimony corroborated this. And as  mentioned above, Lacy took her car keys and her phone from her before he drove her to the hotel for the ""call."" On  cross-examination, S.G. testified that she engaged in the sex act for money because ""I felt like I had lost my  control, like, as in I wasn't able to do anything under my control."" She then testified that when she got her car keys  back, she drove off, but Lacy chased after her and tried to drive her off [*8]  the road. S.G.'s mother testified that  she received a phone call from S.G., in which S.G. told her that ""[h]e's gonna kill me."" At that point, S.G.'s mother  testified that she called 911. The responding officer—Officer Crafton—testified that he received a report about a woman who was really worried  ""because this guy has threatened to kill her . . . and also making her have sex and also making her become a  prostitute and threatening her life."" When Officer Crafton was able to locate S.G., he testified that ""she seemed  very distressed,"" and ""visibly upset."" He testified: ""She explained that she met a Daederick Lacy and . . .  communicated with him on Facebook . . . and at first she said this individual was wanting her to work in some kind  of recruiting-type situation where she would recruit people for jobs, and that she would—and it sounded kind of  glamorous . . . ."" He further testified about what S.G. told him about her first ""call."" S.G. believed that ""her job was to  do massages on people . . . and they ended up getting this room at the Regency Inn, and . . . Daederick and her  were sitting in her car . . . and that he wanted to have sex with her but she didn't want to . . . and that she [*9]  said  that Daederick told her, you know, you can't turn back now . . . and then oral sex came up and she agreed to do  oral sex with him because she didn't really want to . . . but she felt threatened that she had to or she wasn't going to  be able to get out of this situation alive."" Together, this evidence sufficiently established that Lacy used force,  threats of force, fraud, or coercion to cause S.G. to engage in a commercial sex act. Regarding the third element, S.G. testified that Lacy would communicate with her through talking on the phone,  texting on the phone, and using Facebook. As explained above, this evidence supports the conclusion that Lacy  utilized facilities of interstate commerce in commission of the offense. Accordingly, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime of sex trafficking  accomplished by force, fraud, or coercion beyond a reasonable doubt. C. Transportation With Intent to Engage in Criminal Sexual Activity To support a conviction for transportation with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, the Government must  prove the following elements: (1) That the defendant knowingly transported a person from one state into another [*10]  state; (2) That the person was under the age of 18 at the time; (3) That the defendant did this with the intent that such person would engage in criminal sexual activity, that  being prostitution. Here, the Government offered sufficient evidence pertaining to each element to support Lacy's conviction for  transportation with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. First, the Government presented evidence to establish that S.B., another minor victim, was transported from  Kansas to Texas. Although S.B. was not available to testify, B.J. testified that she knew S.B. during the month that  she worked for Lacy. The Government introduced into evidence a picture of B.J. and S.B. together that was taken in  November 2015 at the Friends University dorms in Wichita, Kansas. This evidence is sufficient to establish that S.B.  was in Kansas in November 2015. The Government then provided evidence that Lacy transported S.B. to Texas.    2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70886, *7 Page 5 of 5   Dana Reed testified that Lacy borrowed Reed's car on December 6th, 2015. Lacy sent Reed a text message saying  that he ""need[ed] a week max to stack and lay low."" During this conversation, Lacy often used the pronoun ""we""  while talking about his plans to ""lay low,"" indicating [*11]  that he was not traveling alone. On December 7th, Reed's  car (which Lacy had borrowed) was located at a hotel in Mesquite, Texas. The police located S.B. at that same  hotel. This evidence is sufficient to support the conclusion that Lacy transported S.B. from Kansas to Texas using  Dana Reed's car. Regarding the second element, S.B.'s mother testified that S.B. was only 17 years old during the period of time she  had a relationship with Lacy (November and December of 2015). This testimony is sufficient for a jury to conclude  that S.B. was a minor at the time she was transported from Kansas to Texas. Third, the Government presented sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that Lacy transported S.B. from  Kansas to Texas with the intent that S.B. engage in prostitution. B.J. testified that both she and S.B. performed  sex acts in exchange for money at Lacy's direction. B.J. also testified that S.B. and Lacy had ""[p]retty much the  same relationship"" as B.J. had with Lacy—indicating that S.B. also engaged in prostitution for Lacy. The  Government introduced Facebook conversations in which B.J. and S.B. talked about ""calls"" and condoms. This  evidence reasonably supports the conclusion that S.B. engaged [*12]  in prostitution for Lacy in Kansas. Then, the Government introduced a receipt bearing Lacy's name. The receipt reflected that Lacy purchased  Lifestyles condoms in Wichita, Kansas on December 3rd, 2015. This receipt was then found in the motel room with  S.B. in Mesquite, Texas on December 8th when the police searched the room. In addition, Lacy also sent Reed a  text message saying he needed ""a week max to stack and lay low,"" which could reasonably be interpreted to  conclude that Lacy intended to ""stack""—or make money—by having S.B. engage in sex acts for money there in  Texas. Although this evidence is circumstantial, it does support the reasonable inference that Lacy transported S.B.  from Kansas to Texas with the intent that S.B. engage in prostitution. Accordingly, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime of transportation with intent  to engage in criminal sexual activity beyond a reasonable doubt.",1

"McSean v. LeMons, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217918","[*1] MEMORANDUM AND ORDER Before the Court is the motion of Plaintiff Kelly McSean,  f/k/a Larry Bemboom, for leave to proceed in forma  pauperis in this civil action. The Court has reviewed the  motion and the financial information provided in support,  and has determined to grant the motion and assess an  initial partial filing fee of $7.95. In additional, the Court  will partially dismiss the Complaint and direct the Clerk  to effect service of process as to the non-frivolous  portions, and will deny without prejudice Plaintiff's  motion to appoint counsel. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(b)(1) Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(b)(1), a prisoner bringing  a civil action in forma pauperis is required to pay the full  amount of the filing fee. District courts ""shall assess  and, when funds exist, collect, as a partial payment of  any court fees required by law, an initial partial filing fee  of 20 percent of the greater of"" the average monthly  deposits to the prisoner's account, or the average  monthly balance in the prisoner's account for the prior  six-month period. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(b)(1). After payment  of the initial partial filing fee, the prisoner is required to  make monthly payments of 20 percent of the preceding  month's income credited to his account. 28 U.S.C. §  1915(b)(2). The agency having custody of [*2]  the  prisoner will forward these monthly payments to the Clerk of Court each time the amount in  the account exceeds $10, until the filing fee is fully paid.  Id. In support of the instant motion, Plaintiff filed an inmate  account statement that shows an average monthly  deposit of $39.73, and an average monthly balance of  $29.39. Therefore, the Court assesses an initial partial  filing fee of $7.95, which is twenty percent of Plaintiff's  average monthly deposit. Legal Standard on Initial Review This Court is required to review a complaint filed in  forma  pauperis  to  determine  whether  summary  dismissal is appropriate. See 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e). This  Court must dismiss a complaint or any portion of it that  states a frivolous or malicious claim, that fails to state a  claim upon which relief may be granted, or that seeks  monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from  such relief. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2). An action is frivolous  if it ""lacks an arguable basis in either law or fact.""  Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 328 (1989). An action  fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted if  it does not plead ""enough facts to state a claim to relief  that is plausible on its face."" Bell Atlantic Corp. v.  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). A claim is facially plausible when the plaintiff ""pleads  factual content that allows the court [*3]  to draw the  reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the  misconduct alleged."" Page 2 of 5 Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Determining  whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief is  a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court  to draw upon judicial experience and common sense. Id.  at 679. The court must assume the veracity of well- pleaded facts, but need not accept as true ""[t]hreadbare  recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported  by mere conclusory statements."" Id. at 678 (citing  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). Seealso Barton v. Taber,  820 F.3d 958, 964 (8th Cir. 2016) (courts must ""accept  as true the facts 2 alleged, but not legal conclusions or threadbare recitals  of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere  conclusory statements.""). This Court liberally construes complaints filed by  laypeople. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976).  ""Liberal construction"" means that ""if the essence of an  allegation is discernible,"" the court should ""construe the  complaint in a way that permits the layperson's claim to  be considered within the proper legal framework.""  Solomon v. Petray, 795 F.3d 777, 787 (8th Cir. 2015)  (quoting Stone v. Harry, 364 F.3d 912, 914 (8th Cir.  2004)). However, even complaints filed by self- represented persons must allege facts that, if true, state  a claim for relief as a matter of law. Martin v. Aubuchon,  623 F.2d 1282, 1286 (8th Cir. 1980). Federal courts are  not required to assume facts that are not alleged, Stone,  364 F.3d at 914-15, and are not required to  interpret [*4]  procedural rules to excuse mistakes by  those who proceed without counsel. See McNeilv.  United States, 508 U.S. 106, 113 (1993). The Complaint Plaintiff is a pretrial detainee at the St. Francois County  Detention Center (also ""Detention Center""). Because  Plaintiff identifies herself as a transgender female, the  Court will refer to her using feminine pronouns. Plaintiff  filed the Complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983  against  Officers  Jessica  Lemons  and  Unknown  Bainbridge. Plaintiff identifies both defendants as St.  Francois County Sheriff's Department employees, and  sues them in their official and individual capacities. She  alleges as follows. ""After being informed that the ACLU and an attorney  had contacted the St. Francois County Detention Center  of the Constitutional rights of transgender persons,""  Plaintiff ""submitted an Inmate Request Form as to the  status of ability to purchase and have female 3 undergarments."" (ECF No. 1 at 5). 1 Plaintiff references  her June 10, 2023 Inmate Request Form (also ""Form""),  and states she plans to file a copy of it as an exhibit. Id.  at 5, 21. On the afternoon of June 21, 2023, Lemons, ""who has  not been involved in this matter, used her authority and  position to retaliate, discriminate, and sexually harass  Ms. McSean"" [*5]  when she entered the pod and  yelled, ""what cell is he in."" Id. at 5. Lemons then went to  Plaintiff's cell door with six other officers, and began  yelling at Plaintiff ""in front of other inmates, for  exercising her First Amendment right by filing a request  form."" Id. Lemons waved her arms, told Plaintiff she was  making the canteen officer uncomfortable, yelled and  ""sexually harassed"" Plaintiff in a loud aggressive voice,  and said she ""was about to lose it."" Id. at 6. Lemons asked Plaintiff how many times she had been  told ""no,"" and Plaintiff replied ""several."" Id. Lemons  asked ""how many times"" again in a louder voice, and  Plaintiff repeated ""several."" Id. In a ""demanding voice,""  Lemons told Plaintiff to stop, and to not ask for the  undergarments  again.  Id.  Bainbridge  then  twice  demanded that Plaintiff tell Lemons ""yes ma'am,"" while  keeping his hand on his can of mace. Id. at 6-7. Plaintiff  alleges she feared she would be maced or assaulted.  She states she ""did not file a grievance on this issue  due to being told not to ask again. I fear their actions of  doing so."" Id. at 21. Plaintiff claims the Defendants violated her rights under  the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. She can  be  understood  to  claim  that  the  Defendants  retaliated [*6]  against her ""for exercising her First  Amendment right by filing"" the Form. Id. at 5. Plaintiff  also states that the Defendants sexually harassed her,  sexually assaulted her, verbally abused her, and  discriminated against her on the basis of sex. She  identifies her injuries as increased anxiety, emotional  and 1Plaintiff handwrote the Statement of Claim in all  uppercase letters. When quoting the Complaint, the  Court will use lowercase letters. 4 mental distress, undue worry and stress, sleep  disturbance, and fear of authority figures. She seeks  monetary relief. Page 3 of 5 Discussion The Court will dismiss Plaintiff's official-capacity claims.  An official-capacity claim against an individual is actually  ""against the governmental entity itself."" White v.  Jackson, 865 F.3d 1064, 1075 (8th Cir. 2017). Thus, a  ""suit against a public employee in his or her official  capacity is merely a suit against the public employer.""  Johnson v. Outboard Marine Corp., 172 F.3d 531, 535  (8th Cir. 1999). See also Elder-Keep v. Aksamit, 460  F.3d 979, 986 (8th Cir. 2006) (stating that a ""suit against  a public official in his official capacity is actually a suit  against the entity for which the official is an agent"");  Brewington v. Keener, 902 F.3d 796, 800 (8th Cir. 2018)  (explaining that an official capacity suit against sheriff  and his deputy ""must be treated as a suit against the  County""). To prevail on an official capacity claim, a  plaintiff must establish the [*7]  governmental entity's  liability for the alleged conduct. Kelly v. City of Omaha,  Neb., 813 F.3d 1070, 1075 (8th Cir. 2016). Plaintiff identifies both defendants as St. Francois  County Sheriff's Department employees. The St.  Francois County Sheriff's Department is not an entity  that is subject to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See  Ketchum v. City of West Memphis, Ark., 974 F.2d 81, 82  (8th  Cir.  1992)  (stating  that  ""departments  or  subdivisions"" of local government are not ""juridical  entities suable as such""). St. Francois County is an  entity that can be sued directly under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs. of City of New York, 436  U.S. 658, 690 (1978). Liability may attach if a  constitutional violation resulted from an official policy, an  unofficial custom, or a deliberately indifferent failure to  train or supervise. Mick v. Raines, 883 F.3d 1075, 1079  (8th 5 Cir. 2018). In this case, the Complaint contains no such  assertions. Therefore, the Court will dismiss Plaintiff's  official-capacity claims. The Court now addresses Plaintiff's individual-capacity  claims. Plaintiff can be understood to assert a First  Amendment retaliation claim against both defendants  under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. To establish such a claim, a  plaintiff must show (1) she engaged in a protected  activity, (2) the government official took adverse action  against her that would chill a person of ordinary  firmness from continuing in the activity, and (3) the  adverse action was motivated at least in part by the  exercise [*8]  of the protected activity. Revels v.  Vincenz, 382 F.3d 870, 876 (8th Cir. 2004). The  ""ordinary firmness"" test is an objective one. Garcia v.  City of Trenton, 348 F.3d 726, 728 (8th Cir. 2003). The  relevant inquiry is not whether the plaintiff was deterred;  although the plaintiff's actions might be evidence of what  a reasonable person would have done. Id. The inquiry  ""is usually best left to the judgment of a jury."" Santiago  v. Blair, 707 F.3d 984, 992 (8th Cir. 2013). In this case, the activity for which Plaintiff claims she  suffered retaliation was the filing of the June 10, 2023  Form. Therefore, the Court considers whether that  qualifies as activity that is protected under the First  Amendment. Prisoners have a First Amendment right to  ""petition for redress of grievances under a prison's  grievance procedure."" Nelson v. Shuffman, 603 F.3d  439, 449 (8th Cir. 2010). ""The filing of a prison  grievance, like the filing of an inmate lawsuit, is  protected First Amendment activity."" Lewis v. Jacks, 486  F.3d 1025, 1029 (8th Cir. 2007). Plaintiff identifies the June 10, 2023 filing as an ""Inmate  Request Form,"" and she initially states she filed it ""as to  the status of ability to purchase and have female  undergarments."" (ECF No. 1 at 5). Considered in  isolation, that does not characterize the Form as a  petition for redress of a grievance that would be  protected by the First Amendment. Based upon  Plaintiff's other 6 statements in the Complaint, however, it is clear that  Plaintiff previously requested the undergarments [*9]   ""several"" times, and had been told ""no."" Id. at 6. Also,  Plaintiff can be understood to explain that she filed the  Form after she learned new information that she thought  might allow her to challenge those past denials and  seek redress. Id. at 5. Therefore, liberally construing the  Complaint, the Court cannot conclude for purposes of  initial review that Plaintiff's filing of the Form did not  qualify as protected First Amendment activity. The right to be free from retaliation for availing oneself  of the grievance process is clearly established in the  Eighth Circuit. Santiago, 707 F.3d at 991. See also  Nelson, 603 F.3d at 450 (stating ""that actions taken in  retaliation for an inmate's filing of a grievance are  actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983""). Here, Plaintiff  alleges that Lemons and Bainbridge took adverse action  to retaliate against her for filing the Form, and to prevent  her from trying to obtain the undergarments. Plaintiff's  allegations are sufficient to establish, for purposes of  initial review, that the adverse action would chill a  person of ordinary firmness from continuing in that  Page 4 of 5 activity. See Santiago, 707 F.3d at 992 (stating that the question  of ordinary firmness ""is usually best left to the judgment  of a jury.""). To the extent Plaintiff can be understood to claim that  the [*10]  defendants violated her federally protected  rights by subjecting her to sexual harassment or sexual  assault, however, such claims fail. The only encounter  Plaintiff identifies is the June 21, 2023 incident. Plaintiff  does not allege that either Defendant made any  statement or gesture that could be construed as sexual  in nature, nor does she allege that either Defendant  made physical contact with her. While Plaintiff  characterizes the Defendants' actions as sexual  harassment or sexual assault, this Court need not  accept Plaintiff's speculation as true. See Twombly, 550  U.S. at 555 (citation omitted). In addition, the Eighth  Circuit has recognized that even verbal sexual  harassment without contact 7 or touching does not amount to a constitutional violation.  Howard v. Everett, 208 F.3d 218 (8th Cir. 2000)  (unpublished table decision); see also Burton v.  Livingston, 791 F.2d 97, 99 (8th Cir. 1986) (""mere  words, without more, do not invade a federally protected  right.""). Plaintiff also states that the Defendants subjected her to  sex discrimination. However, there are no allegations as  to either Defendant that can be construed as amounting  to discrimination on the basis of sex, and the Court is  not required to accept Plaintiff's speculation as true. See  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citation omitted). Plaintiff also claims that the Defendants [*11]  verbally  abused her. While retaliating against Plaintiff for  exercising her First Amendment rights is actionable  under § 1983, verbal abuse or verbal harassment alone  is not. See King v. Olmsted Cnty., 117 F.3d 1065, 1067  (8th Cir. 1997) (fear or emotional injury resulting ""solely  from verbal harassment or idle threats is generally not  sufficient to constitute an invasion of an identified liberty  interest""); McDowell v. Jones, 990 F.2d 433, 434 (8th  Cir. 1993) (""Verbal threats and name calling usually are  not actionable under § 1983""); Hopson v. Fredericksen, 961 F.2d 1374, 1378  (8th Cir. 1992) (""Generally, mere verbal threats made by  a state-actor do not constitute a § 1983 claim.""). A  ""threat is redressable under § 1983 if it caused severe injuries, was grossly  disproportionate to the need for action under the  circumstances and was inspired by malice rather than  merely careless or unwise excess of zeal so that it  amounted to an abuse of official power that shocks the  conscience."" Turner v. Mull, 784 F.3d 485, 492 (8th Cir.  2015). Here, Plaintiff's allegations fail to establish that  the Defendants' conduct rose to the level of actionable  verbal abuse, and the Court need not accept Plaintiff's  speculation as true. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555  (citation omitted). 8 In the Complaint, Plaintiff states that this Court has  supplemental jurisdiction over her state law claims.  However, she does not identify any particular state law  claim, and this Court cannot construct [*12]  a legal  theory on her behalf. See Stone, 364 F.3d at 914-15. For the foregoing reasons, the Court will direct the Clerk  to issue process upon the Defendants in their individual  capacities as to Plaintiff's First Amendment retaliation  claims. The Court will dismiss Plaintiff's official capacity  claims against the Defendants, and will dismiss the  claims of sexual harassment, sexual assault, sex  discrimination, and verbal abuse that Plaintiff purports to  bring pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiff has also filed a motion to appoint counsel. An  indigent litigant has ""neither a constitutional nor a  statutory right to appointed counsel in civil cases.""  Patterson v. Kelley, 902 F.3d 845, 850 (8th Cir. 2018)  (citing Phillips v. Jasper Cnty. Jail, 437 F.3d 791, 794  (8th Cir. 2006)). A district court may appoint counsel in a  civil case if it is ""convinced that an indigent plaintiff has  stated a non-frivolous claim . . . and where the nature of  the litigation is such that plaintiff as well as the court will  benefit from the assistance of counsel."" Id. (citing  Johnson v.Williams, 788 F.2d 1319, 1322 (8th Cir.  1986)). When determining whether to appoint counsel  for an indigent litigant, a court considers relevant factors  such as the factual complexity of the issues, the  litigant's ability to investigate the facts and present his or  her claims, the existence of conflicting testimony, and  the complexity of the legal arguments. [*13]  Id. (citing  Phillips, 437 F.3d at 794). In this case, there is no indication Plaintiff is incapable  of representing herself, and nothing in the instant motion  or in the record before the Court indicates that the  factual or legal issues are sufficiently complex to justify  the appointment of counsel. Moreover, the defendants  have yet to be served with process and discovery has  Page 5 of 5 not begun, so there is no conflicting 9 testimony. However, recognizing that circumstances  may change, the Court will deny the motion for  appointment of counsel without prejudice, and will  consider future such motions, if appropriate, as the case  progresses. Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff's motion  seeking leave to commence this action without  prepaying fees or costs (ECF No. 2) is GRANTED. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, by January 8, 2024,  plaintiff must pay an initial filing fee of $7.95. Plaintiff is  instructed to make her remittance payable to ""Clerk,  United States District Court,"" and to include upon it: (1)  her name; (2) her prison registration number; (3) this  case number; and (4) the statement that the remittance  is for an original proceeding. Plaintiff'sfailure to timely  pay the initial partial filing fee as ordered may [*14]   result in the dismissal of this case without prejudice and  without further notice. IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff's official  capacity claims against the Defendants, and Plaintiff's  claims of sexual harassment, sexual assault, sex  discrimination, and verbal abuse brought pursuant to 42  U.S.C. § 1983, are DISMISSED without prejudice. A  separate order of partial dismissal will be filed herewith. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiff's motion to  appoint counsel (ECF No. 4) is DENIED without prejudice. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of Court shall  issue process or cause process to issue upon the  Complaint as to Defendants Jessica Lemons and Officer  Unknown Bainbridge in their individual capacities.  Defendants shall be served by issuance of summons  and service by the U.S. Marshal's Service and  personally served at the address identified by 10 Plaintiff, which is the St. Francois County Sheriff's  Department, 1550 Doubet Road, Farmington, Missouri  63640. IT IS HEREBY CERTIFIED that an appeal from this  partial dismissal would not be taken in good faith. ____________________________________ RONNIE L. WHITE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE Dated this 7th day of December, 2023. 11",0
"United States v. Paris, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78418","RULING ON POST-TRIAL MOTIONS  [*2]  Defendant Dennis Paris has moved the Court under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29 (hereafter, ""Rule 29 Motion"") to set  aside the jury's guilty verdict as to all twenty-one counts of the Second Superseding Indictment,  or, in the  alternative, to grant a new trial under Fed. R. Crim. P. 33 (hereafter, ""Rule 33 Motion""). I. Background  Paris was convicted of twenty-one  [*3] counts associated with the operation of a prostitution business in the  Hartford, Connecticut area. Count One charged Paris with conspiring with Brian Forbes and Shanaya Hicks and  ""others known and unknown to the Grand Jury"" to use cellular telephones to operate a business enterprise  involving prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Two charged Paris with sex trafficking of Eileen K.,   a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. Count Four charged Paris with the sex trafficking of Marianne C., a  minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. Count Nine charged Paris with sex trafficking of Jennifer D. by fraud,  force, or coercion in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. Count Ten charged Paris with sex trafficking of Melissa P. by  fraud, force, or coercion in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. Counts Eleven, Twelve, and Fourteen through Twenty- one charged Paris with use of cellular telephones to promote, manage, and carry on a prostitution business in  violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1952. Counts Twenty-two through Twenty-four charged Paris with accepting credit card  charges as payment for prostitution services in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1952. Counts Twenty-five through Twenty- seven charged Paris  [*4] with money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956.  II. Rule 29 Motion  A. Standard In deciding a motion for judgment of acquittal, the Court views the evidence presented in the light most favorable to  the Government, and draws all reasonable inferences in the Government's favor. United States v. Autuori, 212 F.3d  105, 114 (2d Cir. 2000). The evidence  [*5] must be considered in its totality, not in isolation, and the Government  need not negate every theory of innocence. Id. The Court must be careful to avoid ""usurping the role of the jury,"" id.  (quoting United States v. Guadagna, 183 F.3d 122, 129 (2d Cir. 1999)), and accordingly may not substitute its own  determinations of credibility or relative weight of the evidence for that of the jury. Autuori, 212 F.3d at 114. The  Court ""must determine whether upon the evidence, giving full play to the right of the jury to determine credibility,             Page 3 of 13   weigh the evidence, and draw justifiable inferences of fact, a reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a  reasonable doubt."" Id. (quoting United States v. Mariani, 725 F.2d 862, 865 (2d Cir.1984)). If the Court concludes  that either a verdict of guilty or not guilty was possible based on the evidence, it must uphold the jury's guilty verdict.  See Autuori, 212 F.3d at 114. Put another way, the Court may ""not disturb a conviction on grounds of legal  insufficiency of the evidence at trial if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime  beyond a reasonable doubt."" United States v. Pimentel, 346 F.3d 285, 295 (2d Cir.2003)  [*6] (internal quotation  marks and citations omitted). B. Evidence Presented at Trial 1. Eileen K. Eileen testified that she worked for Paris as a prostitute for about two weeks in March 2002, when she was sixteen  years old. Eileen also testified that she told Paris her age and that she was still in high school. Paris told her to tell  customers that she was nineteen. According to Eileen, she was introduced to Paris by her friend Marianne C., who had worked for Paris in the past.  Paris arranged for ""in calls"" in her motel room as well as ""out calls"" at the customer's location. Paris paid her a  portion of the funds given to him by the customers. Paris used a cell phone to set up the calls. According to Eileen, Marianne stopped working for Paris in June 2001, but started working for him again shortly  after Eileen began working for Paris. Eileen also testified that she and Marianne did a ""call"" together on at least one  occasion when both were working for Paris. According to Eileen, Corrine L. was another high school friend of hers who also worked for Paris. However, Corrine  later testified that she worked for Forbes rather than Paris. At trial, Eileen identified Paris and a photograph of  Forbes. 2.  [*7] Marianne C. Marianne testified that she met Paris when she was fourteen years old and living with friends. At that time, she  understood that Paris would provide her with work, but Marianne did not know the nature of the work. Paris took  Marianne to a Days Inn in Hartford, Connecticut and explained that her work would be to go on ""dates"" with men.  According to Marianne, Paris then showed her what a ""date"" would entail by instructing her to disrobe and dance,  and then had sexual intercourse with her. At age fourteen, Marianne was ""somewhat developed"" physically. After that first session with Paris, Marianne worked for Paris by having sexual intercourse with Paris's customers.  She would perform in calls and out calls for Paris, two to three times a day. Of the $ 120 Paris collected for the  calls, Marianne was paid $ 80 by Paris. She performed approximately 100 calls for Paris, and he provided her with  condoms. Paris advertised for Marianne in a local newspaper and referred to her as ""Sasha"" in the advertisements.  According to Marianne, she continued working intermittently for Paris for one and a half years until about June  2001.  Marianne confirmed that Eileen had worked for Paris and that she had introduced Eileen to Paris. Marianne also  testified that she and Eileen did a call together for Paris. While she was working for Paris, Paris bought Marianne cigarettes. Paris never asked Marianne to see her  identification. During this time, Marianne used a false New Jersey identification card to enter 21-and-older clubs and  to obtain a tattoo. 3. Jennifer D.   Page 4 of 13   Jennifer D. testified that she left her home in Vermont in the fall of 2003 to live with her aunt in Hartford. At that  time, Jennifer was eighteen years old and addicted to heroin. Shortly after she moved to Hartford, Jennifer was  introduced to Forbes by her aunt, and went to live with him. Forbes provided Jennifer with heroin and Jennifer  testified that, at first, she was happy living with Forbes. Jennifer asked her friend Melissa P. to come down from  New Hampshire and live with them. Forbes picked Melissa up in New Hampshire. Jennifer testified that Forbes had Jennifer and Melissa work as prostitutes for him. He and Shanaya Hicks would  take them to calls.  [*9] Forbes provided condoms to them. According to Jennifer, Forbes would yell at and hit  Melissa and Jennifer. Jennifer testified that Forbes kept them locked in a bedroom guarded by his girlfriend  Shanaya Hicks when he was out. According to Jennifer, at some point Forbes introduced Paris to Jennifer and Melissa. Jennifer testified that Paris  had Jennifer and Melissa disrobe and took their measurements and photographed them. According to Jennifer's  testimony, she and Melissa were introduced to Paris so that Paris could arrange calls for them for Forbes's benefit. In late 2003, Jennifer was given the choice to leave Forbes to go work for Paris. She chose to work for Paris  because ""it was so bad [with Forbes] that anything else would be better."" Jennifer testified that Forbes was angry  that she and Melissa were leaving, and that Paris offered to pay him $ 1200 before they left. At first, Jennifer was happy working for Paris. Paris provided Jennifer with heroin and condoms. She was given  money for doing ""calls"" and was allowed to go shopping and out to restaurants. Jennifer testified that during this  period ""you felt like you were free."" According to Jennifer, as time went on she started receiving  [*10] less money from Paris for her calls. If she  refused to do a call, Paris would also refuse to provide her with heroin. Jennifer testified that when Paris withheld  heroin ""it feels like you get the flu but wors[e]. You have chills. Every bone and joint in your body aches. Your skin  crawls. You can't hold your bowel movements or anything."" She testified that after feeling this way she would do the  call if Paris provided her with heroin. Jennifer also testified that Paris had sex with her many times. She testified  that she did not want to have sex with Paris, but that she did not feel that she could refuse him because she did not  want to be ""dope sick."" On one occasion, Paris struck Jennifer in the face, causing her to break a tooth. According to Jennifer, Paris struck  her during an argument that resulted when she refused to do a call. Paris later testified that the reasons for the fight  were different. Jennifer testified that a time came when she felt that she could not leave Paris because she was scared and ""didn't  know what was going to happen."" Paris used cell phones to arrange her calls. 4. Melissa P. Melissa P. confirmed that Jennifer and Forbes brought her down to Hartford from New  [*11] Hampshire, and that  both of them first worked as prostitutes for Forbes. Melissa shared a room with Jennifer at Forbes' apartment.  According to Melissa, Forbes promised that drugs would be available to them at any time. Melissa did two to three  calls per day at Forbes' apartment. Melissa testified that she asked Brian to let her go home and he refused.  Melissa then refused to have sex for money. In response, Forbes ""started forcing himself on [Melissa]. So it got  physical after that."" If ""Melissa and Jennifer weren't working to the standards that [Forbes] wanted"" he would  withhold heroin from them, but still require them to work. According to Jennifer, Forbes also locked Jennifer and  Melissa into the room that they shared in his apartment. Melissa testified that Forbes told her that ""we would eventually be meeting up with [Paris]."" Then, Forbes brought  Melissa and Jennifer to Paris. According to Jennifer, Paris had the girls undress and wrote down descriptions of  their bodies. A few weeks later, Melissa and Jennifer started doing calls for both Forbes and Paris. Melissa testified  that at this point Forbes and Paris were sharing Melissa and Jennifer. According to Melissa, during the  [*12] time  when she was selling sex for money for both Forbes and Paris, she was still locked in Forbes's house, and Forbes  was still assaulting her. Melissa testified that she talked to Paris and told him that Forbes was beating, choking, and  Page 5 of 13   raping her. According to Melissa, Paris and Forbes talked to each other on cellular telephones during this period to  arrange for the girls to do calls for Paris. At some point, Paris told Forbes that he was going to take Jennifer away and said that he would also take Melissa if  she wanted to come with him. Paris promised Melissa that she would be provided with money and drugs if she  came with him, and that he would not physically abuse her. Melissa testified that she decided to go work for Paris.  Later, Paris told Melissa that she and Jennifer ""weren't worth the money he paid."" According to Melissa, Paris provided her with heroin while she was working for him. Melissa testified that Paris  would tell her whether a customer wanted oral sex, intercourse, or both, and that he would provide her with  condoms.  Melissa also testified that ""[i]f we didn't want to do the call we still had to."" In particular, she testified that  one customer requested anal sex.  [*13] Melissa called Paris to say that she did not want to provide anal sex. Paris  directed her to do the call anyway. Melissa typically performed six to seven calls per day for Paris. Melissa testified that on one occasion, Melissa was arrested and called Paris. Paris arranged for Ron Martinez,  another pimp who also worked as a bail bondsman, to post bail for Melissa. Melissa testified that she and Jennifer went home to Vermont and New Hampshire at Christmastime in 2003. When  they returned the other women who had worked for Paris were gone. After this, Paris began to treat Melissa and  Jennifer differently and stopped paying them the full amounts they had earned. Melissa testified that Paris hit her on two occasions. One time a customer refused to see Melissa because she was  too pale. In response, Paris hit Melissa and took her to a tanning salon. Melissa testified that this incident caused  her to feel less able to leave Paris: ""before it was just verbal, like, threats . . . and I didn't feel I could walk away and  I didn't want to risk it, but now I knew that it had reached a different level. Like if I did leave,  [*14] then what would  he do if he caught me trying to leave."" After Melissa left the tanning salon, the man operating the salon called Paris  to arrange a session with Melissa. The session was painful for Melissa and she called Paris to say that she could  not handle the session. Paris directed her continue. Melissa testified that the session caused ""ripping and bleeding""  but that she and Paris ""immediately went to another call"" afterwards. On a second occasion, Melissa testified that Paris was angry with her because she had taken photographs from  him and Paris believed that Melissa had reported him to the police. Melissa testified that Paris raped her,  handcuffed her, wrapped her in a blanket, called for heroin from another person, and told Melissa that ""he was  going to get rid of me."" Paris then took Melissa's identification and left with Barry Perez, a friend of Melissa's.  Melissa testified that ""I just made myself deal with the fact that I was going to die."" When Paris and Perez returned,  Paris had food with him, was laughing and acting ""[l]ike it didn't even happen."" Melissa was allowed to leave the  room. She went back to her own hotel room and called her mother. She told her mother ""I  [*15] don't know what I  just got myself into. . . I can't come home. I'm scared."" Melissa testified that she told her mother that she did not  want to go home because she was afraid that Paris knew where she lived and that he might harm her younger  siblings if she left him.  On another occasion, Melissa witnessed Paris assault another woman at a ""stag party."" Melissa testified that the  woman ""started getting mouthy"" and Paris ""grabbed her throat."" According to Melissa, the woman ""went down, but .  . . didn't lose complete consciousness, but then [Paris] walked her out of the hotel room and she didn't come back.""  Melissa testified that this incident made her concerned about her own safety: ""[i]f [Paris] can do it to her, he can do  it to any of us.""    Page 6 of 13   Melissa testified that she felt that she had to obey Paris because ""I didn't want to find out what would happen if I  said no. I said no before and I got the temper and the anger, but I'd only been slapped a couple of times. And I seen  what he did to the other  [*16] girl."" Melissa testified that she was able to go home to New Hampshire from time to time, but that she also tried to leave  Paris permanently three times. The first two times Melissa attempted to hide, but Paris found her and she went  back to working for him. Melissa testified that Paris slapped her after one of her attempts to leave. On the third  occasion, shortly after Melissa left Paris, Martinez's bail bondsmen arrested her for violating her bail conditions.  When she was arrested, Paris was present. Melissa testified that she believed that Paris had arranged for her to be  arrested because Paris ""had told [her] at one point that as long as [she] was working in Connecticut, his state, that  [she] was going to be working for him and nobody else."" Melissa testified that Paris used cell phones to talk to potential customers and drivers. Melissa testified that Paris  would write information about phone calls on a note pad that he kept in his briefcase. 5. Other Evidence The Government also elicited testimony from five other witnesses. Barry Perez confirmed Melissa's account of the  incident during which she believed Paris intended to kill her. Kathleen Celotti testified that she and other women   [*17] engaged in sexual intercourse for Paris's personal financial benefit. Michael Huchko testified that on several occasions he called Paris's phone number in response to an advertisement  in the Hartford Advocate newspaper, and arranged to meet a woman for sexual intercourse. Huchko testified that  twice he used a credit card to pay for this service. Dennis Ireland testified that he also solicited prostitution in  response to advertisements in the Hartford Advocate, and that he twice called Paris's service.  Ireland testified that  he paid for sexual intercourse using a credit card, but that the girl Paris provided looked young, scared, and  unwilling to engage in sexual intercourse; so Ireland left without having intercourse with the girl. Special Agent Chris Grispino of the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified that Paris made more than 20,000  telephone calls from his cellular telephone during the relevant time period, and that 2,000 of these phone calls were  to out-of-state numbers. Grispino also pointed  [*18] to the records of Huchko and Ireland's cellular telephone calls  with Paris. Special Agent Douglas Werth of the Internal Revenue Service testified that Dennis Paris accepted credit  card payments for his prostitution business and used credit card machines that utilized interstate wires, that the  motels Paris used for his prostitution business were frequented by interstate travelers, and that the condoms Paris  provided to his prostitutes were manufactured out of state. During the Government's rebuttal case, Grispino testified  that Paris admitted operating a prostitution ring and that he provided condoms. Grispino also testified that Paris  admitted that he used Melissa's outstanding warrants as threats to cause her to continue working for him. Paris testified in his own defense, and elicited the testimony of Corrine L., who testified that she had never worked  for Paris. C. Discussion Paris argues that the Court should grant a judgment of acquittal with respect to each of the counts of conviction  because the Government introduced insufficient evidence by which a rational jury could conclude that he was guilty.  In particular, Paris maintains that the Government's evidence was insufficient to  [*19] support his conviction on the  conspiracy and sex trafficking counts. Paris also argues that the activity described in the sex trafficking counts is  beyond the reach of Congress's power to legislate pursuant to the Commerce Clause. 1. Conspiracy   Page 7 of 13   Paris maintains that the Government's evidence was insufficient because it showed that Paris and Forbes were  competitors rather than co-conspirators. According to Paris, the jury convicted Paris based on a conspiracy other  than that charged in the Second Superseding Indictment. The Government produced substantial evidence that Paris, Forbes, and Hicks conspired to use an interstate facility  to promote prostitution: Melissa and Jennifer testified that, in late 2003, Forbes introduced them to Paris so that  they could sell sex for money in sessions arranged by Paris for the benefit of both Paris and Forbes. Melissa  testified that subsequently Forbes and Paris shared Melissa and Jennifer and shared the proceeds of calls. Melissa  also testified that Paris and Forbes communicated with each other on cellular telephones to arrange calls for the  girls. Finally, Jennifer and Melissa testified that Hicks aided Forbes in his prostitution business. The Court  [*20] instructed the jury that it could only convict Paris of the conspiracy charged in the Second  Superceding Indictment: You must determine whether the conspiracy charged in the indictment existed, and, if it did, whether the  defendant was a member of it between around November 2003 to around December 2003. If you find that the  conspiracy charged did not exist, then you must return a not guilty verdict, even though you find that some  other conspiracy existed. If you find that a defendant was not a member of the conspiracy charged in the  indictment, then you must find that defendant not guilty, even though that defendant may have been a member  of some other conspiracy. The Court finds that the evidence offered by the Government was sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to conclude  that Paris was guilty of the conspiracy charged in the Second Superceding Indictment,  and that its instruction to  the jury was sufficient to ensure that the jury did not convict Paris based on a different conspiracy. 2. Sex Trafficking a. Congressional Authority to Enact 18 U.S.C. § 1591 Paris argues that Congress had no power to regulate sex trafficking where the recruiting, enticing, harboring,  transporting, providing or obtaining of the trafficked person was performed intrastate, and thus that 18 U.S.C. §  1591  is unconstitutional as applied  [*22] to him. In United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 115 S. Ct. 1624, 131 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1995), the Supreme Court identified  three categories of activity that Congress may regulate under the Commerce Clause: First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce. Second, Congress is empowered  to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate  commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate  [*23] activities. Finally, Congress' commerce                 Page 8 of 13   authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce,  i.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. at 558-559 (internal citations omitted). Both the Government and Paris agree that  the applicable test here is the third prong of Lopez. There are four relevant considerations in determining whether a law regulates an activity that has a substantial  effect on interstate commerce. These are: (1) the economic nature of the regulated activity; (2) a jurisdictional element limiting the reach of the law to a discrete set of activities that additionally has an  explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce; (3) express congressional findings regarding the effects upon interstate commerce of the activity in question;  and 4) the link between the regulated activity and interstate commerce. United States v. Gregg, 226 F.3d 253, 262 (3d Cir. 2000) cert. denied, 532 U.S. 971, 121 S. Ct. 1600, 149 L. Ed. 2d  467 (2001) (citing United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 610-612, 120 S. Ct. 1740, 146 L. Ed. 2d 658 (2000)). Section 1591 satisfies each of these considerations: First, commercial sex acts  [*24] are economic in nature.  Second, section 1591 has a jurisdictional element, requiring the jury to find that the activity affected interstate  commerce. Third, in enacting the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, Congress found that ""Trafficking in persons  substantially affects interstate and foreign commerce."" 22 U.S.C. § 7101 (b)(12). Fourth, as discussed more fully  below, there is a clear nexus between Paris's intrastate recruiting and obtaining of women to commit commercial  sex acts, the interstate aspects of Paris's business, and the interstate market for commercial sex. Cf. United  States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir. 2007) (finding section 1591 constitutional as applied to solely  intrastate activities). Accordingly, the Court finds that it was within Congress's power to regulate Paris's intrastate  recruiting and obtaining of women to perform commercial sex acts. b. Interstate Nexus for Sex Trafficking Paris argues that while the Government produced substantial evidence indicating that his prostitution business  involved considerable interstate contacts, this evidence was not sufficient to establish that his recruiting, enticing,  harboring, transporting, providing, or obtaining  [*25] women for that business itself affected interstate commerce. At trial, the Government introduced evidence that (1) Paris made cellular telephone calls in connection with his  business, (2) Paris accepted credit cards as payment for commercial sex acts and that the credit card processing  machines used interstate wire connections, (3) Paris operated his business out of hotels frequented by out-of-state  guests, and (4) Paris provided the victims with condoms that were manufactured out of state. This, and other evidence presented by the Government, was sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that Paris's  recruiting, enticing, harboring, transporting, providing, or obtaining women had a substantial affect on interstate  commerce.  First, procuring a women to engage in a commercial sex act contributes to an interstate market in  commercial sex, even when the procuring occurred intrastate. Cf. United States v. Evans, 476 F.3d at 1179-1180.  Second, as the Government's post-trial brief details, certain of Paris's activities, such as harboring women in hotels  that served interstate travelers, had a direct impact on interstate commerce. Third, the interstate aspects of Paris's  business were inextricably  [*26] linked to the intrastate aspects: Paris would not have needed to make cellular       Page 9 of 13   telephone calls, use hotel rooms, accept credit cards, or purchase condoms that had traveled in interstate  commerce if he were not also recruiting, enticing, harboring, transporting, providing, or obtaining women to engage  in commercial acts. See id. (holding that ""use of hotels that served interstate travelers and distribution of condoms  that traveled in interstate commerce are further evidence that [the defendant]'s conduct substantially affected  interstate commerce."") c. Sex Trafficking of Eileen K. Paris argues that because of the inconsistency  [*27] between Eileen's testimony and the testimony of Marianne  and Corrine, a reasonable jury could not have found that Eileen worked for Paris. The inconsistency between Eileen's testimony and the testimony of Marianne and Corrine was tangential to the  core issues of (1) whether Eileen performed commercial sex acts for Paris and (2) whether he knew she was  under eighteen at the time. Eileen testified that she worked for Paris and told him her age. Marianne confirmed that  Eileen had worked for Paris. Both girls testified that they had done a call for Paris together. A reasonable jury could  easily have concluded that Eileen was mistaken about the identity of Corrine's pimp, without being forced to  conclude that Eileen was also mistaken about the identity of her own pimp. Similarly, a reasonable jury also could  have reconciled Eileen's testimony with Marianne's. Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence from which a  reasonable jury could have found that Eileen worked for Paris. d. Sex Trafficking of Marianne C. Paris maintains that there was insufficient evidence that Paris knew that Marianne C. was under eighteen at the  time she worked for him.  Marianne testified that Paris had sex with her and saw her naked body in late 1999, when she was fourteen years  old. Paris also bought cigarettes for Marianne, knew that Marianne had young friends who were still in high school,  and never asked Marianne for her identification. The Court gave the jury a ""conscious avoidance"" charge,  and a  reasonable jury could have concluded that Paris either knew, or deliberately closed his eyes to the fact that  Marianne was substantially younger than eighteen at that time. Accordingly,  [*29] Paris's motion for a judgment of acquittal is denied as to Count Four. e. Sex Trafficking of Jennifer D. Paris maintains that Jennifer D. was not a credible witness and that there was no evidence that he used force,  fraud or coercion to cause Jennifer D. to engage in a commercial sex act. Melissa testified that when she and Jennifer first worked for Paris, they were shared by Forbes and Paris.  According to Jennifer, both men profited from their work performing commercial sex acts during this period.  Melissa and Jennifer both testified that Forbes kept them locked up and guarded, yelled at them, and was  physically violent. According to Melissa, Forbes would withhold heroin from Jennifer and her if they were not  working to Forbes's ""standard,"" but still required them to work while suffering from drug withdrawal. Melissa testified  that during this period she informed Paris of Forbes's treatment.        Page 10 of 13   According to Jennifer, during the period when she worked exclusively for Paris, if she refused to do a call, Paris  would withhold heroin from her, and cause her to become ""drug sick."" Jennifer also testified that Paris struck her in  the face when she refused to do a call.  Jennifer testified that  [*30] she felt that she could not leave Paris  because she was afraid of him. A reasonable jury could conclude from this that Paris recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, and  obtained Jennifer and benefitted financially from participation in a venture which has engaged in such acts knowing  that force, fraud, or coercion would be used to cause her to engage in a commercial sex act. f. Sex Trafficking of Melissa P. Paris maintains that there was no evidence that Paris used force to cause Melissa P. to engage in a commercial  sex act. As described above, the Government presented evidence that Paris arranged calls for Melissa and profited from  her work, knowing that she was being abused and held hostage by Forbes at the time. Melissa testified that Paris  promised to treat her well if she came to work for him. However, according to Melissa, Paris hit her when she  displeased  [*31] a customer, and she witnessed him abuse another woman during the time she worked for him.  According to Melissa, the physical abuse she experienced and witnessed caused her to feel less able to leave  Paris, and to fear the consequences she might incur if she disobeyed Paris or was caught attempting to escape.  Melissa also testified that Paris threatened to cause Melissa's younger sister to work for him if she left. Finally  Melissa testified that on one Paris caused her believe that he would murder her.  Accordingly, the Court finds that the Government presented evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude  that Paris was guilty of the sex trafficking of Melissa by fraud, force, or coercion. g. Other Counts The Court further finds that the Government presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to convict Paris of  use of an interstate facility to promote prostitution and money laundering. The Government elicited testimony from  Huchko  [*32] and Ireland that they called Paris's phone number to arrange commercial sexual intercourse (Counts  Eleven, Twelve, and Fourteen through Twenty-one), and that they paid for this service with credit cards (Counts  Twenty-two through Twenty-four). Paris stipulated that processing such credit card charges involved transmitting  information over interstate telephone wires. Through Agent Werth the Government also introduced evidence that  Paris deposited funds procured from his prostitution business into bank accounts and then withdrew the money to  pay the expenses of that business, including hotel rooms and cellular telephone bills. Accordingly, Paris's motion for  a judgment of acquittal is denied in its entirety. III. Rule 33 Motion Paris argues that he is entitled to a new trial because (1) he was not permitted to exercise peremptory challenges  on the basis of gender; (2) the jury was not instructed that it was obligated to agree unanimously that either force,  fraud, or coercion had been used to cause Jennifer D. and Melissa P. to engage in commercial sex acts; (3)  coercion was defined too broadly; and (4) the terms ""commercial sex act"" and ""fraud"" are unconstitutionally  vague. A. Standard      Page 11 of 13   ""Upon  [*33] the defendant's motion, the court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of  justice so requires."" Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a). ""The rule by its terms gives the trial court 'broad discretion . . . to set aside  a jury verdict and order a new trial to avert a perceived miscarriage of justice.'"" United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d  129, 133 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting United States v. Sanchez, 969 F.2d 1409, 1413 (2d Cir.1992) (alterations by the  Court)). In exercising its discretion conferred by Rule 33, the Court may weigh the evidence and evaluate the  credibility of witnesses. Sanchez, 969 F.2d at 1413 (citing United States v. Lincoln, 630 F.2d 1313, 1319 (8th  Cir.1980)). The burden of persuasion is on the defendant to demonstrate that a new trial is appropriate. United States v. Sasso,  59 F.3d 341, 350 (2d Cir.1995). ""Generally, the trial court has broader discretion to grant a new trial under Rule 33  than to grant a motion for acquittal under Rule 29, but it nonetheless must exercise the Rule 33 authority 'sparingly'  and in 'the most extraordinary circumstances.'"" Ferguson, 246 F.3d at 134 (quoting Sanchez, 969 F.2d at 1414).  ""The ultimate test on a Rule 33 motion is whether  [*34] letting a guilty verdict stand would be a manifest injustice.""  Ferguson, 246 F.3d at 134. B. Discussion 1. Peremptory Challenges Paris argues that he should have been permitted to exclude jurors on the basis of gender. At jury selection, the  Court ruled that Paris could not exclude jurors based solely on gender. Accordingly, Paris struck Juror 476, a male  juror, from the panel. At the time, counsel for Paris indicated that he would not have used a peremptory challenge  against this juror if he had been permitted to base it on gender. In Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986), the United States Supreme Court held  that the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution governs the exercise of peremptory challenges.  In Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.S. 42, 55, 112 S. Ct. 2348, 120 L. Ed. 2d 33 (1992), the Supreme Court reasoned  that a criminal defendant's racially discriminatory exercise of peremptory challenges harms the individual juror and  undermines public confidence in this country's system of justice. Thus, the Court held that the Equal Protection  Clause also bars a criminal defendant from excluding jurors on the basis of race. In J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S.  127, 146, 114 S. Ct. 1419, 128 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1994), the Court found that Batson also applied  [*35] to gender-based  exclusion of jurors. In J.E.B. the Court rejected the argument that ""women and men may have different attitudes  about certain issues justifying the use of gender as a proxy for bias"" and refused to ""accept as a defense to gender- based peremptory challenges 'the very stereotype the law condemns.'"" J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S.  127, 138, n.9, 114 S. Ct. 1419, 128 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1994). See also United States v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. 304,  314-15, 120 S. Ct. 774, 145 L. Ed. 2d 792 (2000) (""Under the Equal Protection Clause, a defendant may not  exercise a peremptory challenge to remove a potential juror solely on the basis of the juror's gender, ethnic origin,  or race."" (emphasis added)). Taken together J.E.B. and McCollum prohibit a criminal defendant from exercising  peremptories on the basis of gender. Accordingly, the Court finds that its ruling barring Paris from exercising peremptories solely on the basis of gender  did not produce a ""manifest injustice."" 2. Unanimity Paris argues that ""force, fraud and coercion"" are separate elements of the offense of sex trafficking, and thus  that the jurors should have been instructed that they were required to reach a unanimous determination about  which of these were used to cause Jennifer  [*36] and Melissa to engage in commercial sex acts. Jurors are required to unanimously conclude that the elements of an offense are satisfied, but are not required to  unanimously agree on which means a defendant used to commit a particular element. See e.g., Richardson v.  United States, 526 U.S. 813, 817, 119 S. Ct. 1707, 143 L. Ed. 2d 985 (1999). Force, fraud and coercion are  alternate means to accomplish a single element. See, e.g., United States v. Powell, No. 04-cr-885, 2006 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 28858, 2006 WL 1155947, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 28, 2006) (holding that ""fraud, force, or coercion"" are means  of accomplishing sex trafficking, not distinct elements); United States v. Marcus, 487 F. Supp. 2d 289, 308  Page 12 of 13   (E.D.N.Y.,2007) (describing ""force, fraud, or coercion"" as single element of § 1591); United States v. Jones, No.  1:05-cr-617, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51858, 2007 WL 2301420, at *6 (N.D. Ga., July 18, 2007) (same); United States  v. Baggett, 251 F.3d 1087, 1096 (6th Cir. 2001) cert. denied 534 U.S. 1167, 122 S. Ct. 1184, 152 L. Ed. 2d 126  (2002) (describing ""force, coercion, duress, or fraud"" as single element of interstate domestic violence offense);  United States v. Helem, 186 F.3d 449 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1053, 120 S. Ct. 595, 145 L. Ed. 2d 494  (1999) (same). Accordingly,  [*37] the jurors were not required to unanimously decide which of force, fraud, or coercion Paris  used to cause Jennifer and Melissa to commit commercial sex acts. 3. ""Coercion"" The Court instructed the jury that ""[t]he term 'coercion' means any threat of serious harm to or physical restraint  against any person; or, any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that failure to perform an  act would result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any person; or, any abuse or threatened abuse of  law or the legal process."" Paris contends that evidence that Paris threatened to report Melissa for outstanding  arrest warrants or bond violations if she did not continue working for him did not constitute abuse of the legal  process, but rather ""good citizenship."" Legal coercion may include threats to use legitimate legal process to cause another to commit commercial sex  acts the person otherwise would not have committed. Cf. United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931, 948, 108 S. Ct.  2751, 2762, 101 L. Ed. 2d 788 (1988) (citing threatening immigrant with deportation as example of legal coercion  that might cause involuntary servitude); United States v. Alzanki, 54 F.3d 994, 1005 (1st Cir. 1995)  [*38] (threat to  have domestic servant, who would have lost visa if discharged by employer, deported constituted legal coercion);  Kimes v. United States, 939 F.2d 776, 777 (9th Cir. 1991) (threats to have illegal aliens deported constituted legal  coercion). While it might have been lawful for Paris to threaten to report Melissa to authorities on legitimate arrest  warrants, it was not lawful for him to refrain from doing so on condition that Melissa continue to perform  commercial sex acts on his behalf. Furthermore, the Government presented substantial and credible evidence that  Paris used other forms of fraud, force and coercion to cause Melissa to commit commercial sex acts. Accordingly, the Government's evidence and argument that Paris used legal coercion to cause Melissa to engage  in commercial sex did not cause manifest injustice. 4. ""Commercial Sex Act"" Paris argues that the term ""commercial sex act"" is void for vagueness because it is broad enough to encompass  even legitimate modeling or acting in a romantic movie. Section 1591 defines ""commercial sex act"" as ""any sex  act, on account of which anything of value is given to or received by any person,"" but does not define ""any sex act."" Due  [*39] Process requires laws be sufficiently clear to ""give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable  opportunity to know what is prohibited"" and to ""provide explicit standards for those who apply them."" Grayned v.  City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-109, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1972) (upholding antinoise ordinance  that prohibited making noise that disrupted school session). ""In the absence of first amendment considerations,  vagueness challenges must be evaluated based on the particular application of the statute and not on the ground  that the statute may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others in situations not before the Court."" United  States v. Coonan, 938 F.2d 1553, 1561-1562 (2d Cir. 1991) (holding that ""enterprise"" element of RICO statute was  not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant). The vagueness doctrine ""is not a principle designed to  convert into a constitutional dilemma the practical difficulties in drawing criminal statutes both general enough to  take into account a variety of human conduct and sufficiently specific to provide fair warning that certain kinds of  conduct are prohibited."" Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U.S. 104, 110, 92 S. Ct. 1953, 32 L. Ed. 2d 584 (1972) (upholding  conviction for  [*40] failure to disperse). At trial, Marianne, Eileen, Jennifer and Melissa testified that the service they provided on behalf of Paris was sexual  intercourse, and that he knew that. Marianne testified that Paris showed her what her job would entail by having  sexual intercourse with her. Marianne, Melissa, and Jennifer testified that Paris provided them with condoms.  Page 13 of 13   Melissa testified that Paris would inform her whether a client expected oral or vaginal intercourse and described  specific incidents when Paris directed her to engage in vaginal or anal intercourse with customers. Two of Paris's  customers also testified that they used Paris's service to arrange for sexual intercourse. Conversely, Paris testified  that Paris Enterprises provided nude modeling and ""body rubs,"" not prostitution services. Paris admitted that  women working for him would have sexual intercourse with customers, but testified that this was not part of the  service he provided. Instead, according to Paris, sexual intercourse was a private matter between the woman and  the customer, and that women working for him would have sex with his customers for extra money or for  enjoyment. This case involves overwhelming evidence of  [*41] sexual intercourse, and indeed Paris only denies that such  intercourse was required. Accordingly, the conduct at issue in this case is within the heartland of the term ""sex act""  and Section 1591 provided fair warning that it applied to such conduct. 5. ""Fraud"" The Court instructed the jury that ""'fraud' means any deliberate act of deception, trickery or misrepresentation.""  Paris maintains that the Court should have used the common law definition of fraud, and that without such a  narrowed definition Section 1591 was unconstitutionally vague. At trial, the Government primarily presented  evidence that Paris used force and coercion to cause Jennifer and Melissa to perform commercial sex acts.  However, the Government also presented evidence that Paris initially induced Jennifer and Melissa to work for him  by promising to treat them well, pay them and supply them with drugs. This evidence of false promises falls within  the ordinary understanding of fraud. The jury was entitled to evaluate this evidence along with evidence that Paris  used force and coercion to determine that Paris compelled Melissa and Jennifer to perform commercial sex acts  that neither would have otherwise been willing to  [*42] perform. Accordingly, the Court finds that Paris has not sustained his burden of demonstrating that the interests of justice  require a new trial.",1
"Rivera v. United States, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13534","ORDER FEUERSTEIN, J. On May 26, 2011, petitioner Antonio Rivera (""petitioner"") was convicted, upon a jury verdict, of one (1) count of  conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by means of force, fraud and coercion in violation of, inter alia, 18 U.S.C. §§  371 and 1591(a) (2008) (count one of the superceding indictment); one (1) count of conspiracy to commit sex  trafficking in violation of, inter alia, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1594(c) and 1591(a) (2009) (count fourteen of the superceding  indictment); four (4) counts of sex trafficking by means of force, fraud and coercion in violation of, inter alia, 18  U.S.C. §§ 1591(a) and (b)(1) (2008) (counts two through five of the superceding indictment); two (2) counts of sex    Page 2 of 3   trafficking by means of force, fraud and coercion in violation of, inter alia, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a) and (b)(1) (2009)  (counts fifteen and sixteen of the superceding indictment); one (I) count of conspiracy to commit  [*2] forced labor  in violation of, inter alia, 18 U.S.C. §§ 371 and 1589 (2008) (count six of the superceding indictment); one (1) count  of conspiracy to commit forced labor in violation of, inter alia, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589(d) and 1594(b) (2009) (count  seventeen of the superceding indictment); seven (7) counts of forced labor in violation of, inter alia, 18 U.S.C. §  1589 (2008) (counts seven through thirteen of the superceding indictment); four (4) counts of forced labor in  violation of, inter alia, 18 U.S.C. § 1589 (2009) (counts eighteen through twenty-one of the superceding indictment);  one (I) count of conspiracy to transport and harbor aliens in violation of, inter alia, 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1) (count  twenty-two of the superceding indictment); seven (7) counts of transportation of aliens within the United States in  violation of, inter alia, 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1) (counts twenty-three through twenty-nine of the superceding  indictment); and seven (7) counts of alien harboring in violation of, inter alia, 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1) (counts thirty  through thirty-six of the superceding indictment). Petitioner has not yet been sentenced upon that conviction. On  November 9, 2011, petitioner filed the  [*3] instant petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (""Section 2255"")  challenging his conviction as procured in violation of, inter alia, his rights under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth  Amendments to the United States Constitution. Section 2255(a) provides, in relevant part, that ""[a] prisoner in custody under sentence of a [federal] court * * * may  move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence."" (emphasis added).  Section 2255(b) further provides, in relevant part, that ""[i]f the court finds that the judgment was rendered without  jurisdiction, or that the sentence imposed was not authorized by law or otherwise open to collateral attack, or that  there has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment  vulnerable to collateral attack, the court shall vacate and set the judgment aside***."" (emphasis  [*4] added). Since  petitioner has not been sentenced and, therefore, no judgment of conviction has yet been entered against him,  Section 2255 is, by its terms, inapplicable. See, e.g., United States v. McLaughlin, 89 F. Supp.2d 617, 629-30 (E.D.  Pa. 2000) (finding that an application pursuant to Section 2255 would be premature because the defendant was not  under any sentence of federal court); United States v. St. Pierre, 62 F. Supp.2d 1332, 1338 (M.D. Fla. 1999)  (holding that the court lacked jurisdiction to consider the matter as a Section 2255 motion because the defendant  had not yet been sentenced); United States v. Slay, 673 F. Supp. 336, 341-42 (E.D. Mo. 1987) (holding that Section  2255 does not apply to defendants who have not yet been sentenced). Moreover, the petition cannot be construed as having been brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (c) because,  inter alia, federal jurisdiction to hear habeas claims challenging the validity of a federal judgment of conviction or  sentence is limited to Section 2255 unless the petitioner can show that a Section 2255 motion is ""inadequate or  ineffective to test the legality of his detention."" Cephas v. Nash, 328 F.3d 98, 103-04 (2d Cir. 2003).  [*5] If such a  showing of inadequacy or ineffectiveness cannot be made, Section 2241 cannot be invoked. Id. Since petitioner has  an adequate and effective remedy available to challenge a judgment conviction once one has been entered against  him, e.g., a direct appeal and/or a properly filed application for relief under Section 2255, this Court lacks jurisdiction  to consider the instant petition as a Section 2241 petition. For the reasons set forth above, the Section 2255 petition is dismissed without prejudice as premature. SO ORDERED. SANDRA J.

"Wisdom v. Perez, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217366","MEMORANDUM & ORDER KIYO A. MATSUMOTO, United States District Judge: Petitioner  Atara  Wisdom  (""Petitioner"")  currently  incarcerated in the custody of the New York State  Department of Corrections and Community Supervision,  petitions for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28  U.S.C. § 2254. On July 10, 2014, Petitioner was  convicted after a jury trial of murder in the second  degree (N.Y. Penal Law § 125.25[1]). (See ECF No. 1,  Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus (""Pet.""), at 1; ECF  No. 5, State's Affidavit in Opposition (""State Opp.""), at  26.) On October 8, 2014, the trial court sentenced  Petitioner to an indeterminate prison term of 18 years to  life for the murder. (State Opp. at 26.) The Petitioner  claims that (1) her custodial statements were improperly  admitted as evidence in trial, (2) the trial court violated  her [*2]  rights to due process, to present a defense,  and to the effective assistance of counsel by requiring  defense counsel to interview a state's witness in the  presence of the prosecutor, (3) the trial court violated  her right to present a defense by precluding her from  admitting records and from cross-examining prosecution  witnesses on certain topics, and (4) the trial court  violated her due process right to a fair trial by admitting  Anthony Wilson's 911 call as a hearsay exception. (Pet.  at 42, 54, 60, 72.) For the reasons set forth below, the  petition is respectfully DENIED. BACKGROUND I. Factual Background At trial, the prosecution presented evidence showing  that on November 29, 2011, Petitioner stabbed Anthony  Wilson to death inside his studio apartment at 832  Bushwick Avenue in Brooklyn, New York. (State Opp. at  2.) In March 2012, DNA evidence recovered at the  scene was found to match the DNA profile of Petitioner,  and, following a search, NYPD detectives learned in      Page 2 of 16 July 2012 that Petitioner was staying at a women's  homeless shelter. (Id. at 3.) Detectives subsequently  brought Petitioner to the NYPD's 83rd Precinct on July  25, 2012, to conduct an interview, where the petitioner  was [*3]  advised of, and waived her Miranda rights and  agreed to speak with the Detective Christopher  Scandole. (Id. at 3-4.) Petitioner admitted to stabbing  Mr. Wilson, claiming that she had done so in self- defense, and was subsequently arrested after being  identified in a lineup by a witness who knew Mr. Wilson.  (Id. at 5-6, 16.) Following her arrest, Petitioner made  two further statements on the evening of July 25, 2012,  and gave an additional statement to Detective Scandole  the following morning, on July 26, 2012. (Id. at 16-18.) II. Pre-trial Proceedings A. Pre-trial Huntley/Wade Suppression Hearing On October 30, 2013, the Kings County Supreme Court  held a Huntley/Wade hearing regarding Petitioner's  motion to suppress her statements from July 26, 2012.  (ECF No. 5-1, Exhibit 1 to State's Opposition (""Ex. 1""),  at  9.)  Detective  Scandole  provided  testimony  recounting his interviews with Petitioner on July 25 and  July 26, 2012. (Id. at 10-22.) Detective Deborah  Batanjany also testified with respect to the lineup she  conducted on July 25, 2012. (Id. at 27-39.) The trial court determined that there were two issues to  be resolved in the hearing, including whether the  identification of Petitioner during [*4]  the lineup was  ""unduly suggestive in this case,"" and whether the  Petitioner voluntarily and knowingly waived her Miranda  rights during the interrogation. (Id. at 40-42.) The court, after reviewing the lineup photos and  Detective Batanjany's testimony, determined that there  was no serious issue regarding the suggestiveness of  the lineup to warrant suppressing the identification  testimony. (Id. at 41.) Based on the documented  Miranda form, the written statement read to and signed  by Petitioner, and a video statement where the  Detective provided Petitioner with another set of  Miranda warnings on July 25, 2012, the court ruled on  October 30, 2023, that Petitioner knowingly and    voluntarily waived her rights to remain silent and agreed  to speak with the police. (Id. at 41-42.) The court denied  Petitioner's motion to suppress in full. (Id. at 42.) B. Second Huntley Hearing On July 1, 2014, during trial, defense counsel made an  oral motion for a mistrial arguing that the testimony of a  prosecution witness regarding the use of Mr. Wilson's  Electronic  Benefits  Transfer  (EBT)  card  was  inadmissible for its prejudicial effect. (ECF No. 5-4,  Exhibit 4 to State's Opposition (""Ex. 4""), at 160.) The  defense [*5]  counsel made an alternative request to  strike the witness's testimony. (Id. at 162.) The trial court  denied the application for a mistrial and to strike the  testimony regarding the use of the EBT card but granted  a separate second Huntley hearing to determine the  admissibility of Petitioner's July 26 statements, in which  Petitioner stated, among other things, that she did not  use Mr. Wilson's benefits card. (Id. at 162-67.) During the second Huntley hearing before the trial court,  Detective Scandole testified that on the morning of July  26, 2012, he reminded Petitioner that she had waived  her Miranda rights the previous day, and asked if she  would be willing to speak with him further. (Id. at 165.)  Detective Scandole further testified that Petitioner  agreed to speak with him and provided further details  regarding her actions on the night of Mr. Wilson's death.  (Id. at 165-67.) The trial court also questioned Detective  Scandole regarding how Petitioner was advised of her  Miranda rights, and how Petitioner's interview on the  evening of July 25, 2012, concluded. (Id. at 168-70.)  Defense counsel cross-examined Detective Scandole  and asked if Petitioner stated on July 25 that ""she  didn't [*6]  want to speak anymore,"" to which Detective  Scandole answered: ""Correct."" (Id. at 173.) Upon  redirect questioning by the prosecution, Detective  Scandole clarified that Petitioner never asked for a  lawyer and did not say anything about not wanting to  speak with Detective Scandole on the morning of July  26, 2012. (Id. at 175.) The prosecution argued at the close of the hearing that  Petitioner's statements were admissible because she  had acknowledged that Detective Scandole provided  her with Miranda warnings on July 25, she did not  refuse to speak with Detective Scandole when he  reminded her of the Miranda warnings given on July 25  and asked on the morning of July 26 to follow up with  more questions, and because the police did not ""force[]  her to talk."" (Id. at 176.) The prosecution also argued  Page 3 of 16 that the video of Petitioner's statement on the evening of  July 25, 2012, showed that Petitioner was ""visibly  upset,"" which was the reason that the Assistant District  Attorney present asked if she wanted to stop the  interview at the time. (Id.) The court read in the relevant  portion of the video transcript to the record, which was  as follows: [A.D.A's ]QUESTION: You okay? You want to take  a minute? [*7]  You want us to stop for a second or  do you want to continue? You want to stop for a  second? [Petitioner]: All right. A.D.A. Purce: We're just going to hold out here for a  little bit. You just take your time, all right?  [Petitioner]: All right. [A.D.A. Purce: ] You know what, I think we're going to-we're going  to stop now, and if you want to continue, we'll talk in  a second, okay. You want us to stop right now? [Petitioner's] ANSWER: Yeah. A.D.A. Purce: All right, just stop the tape for now. There will be no further questions until we resume  the tape. (Id. at 178-79.) The trial court noted that the next day,  July 26, Detective Scandole reminded Petitioner of her  rights and asked if she wanted to continue, and that a  full recitation of the Miranda rights again was not  required. (Id. at 179.) Accordingly, the trial court ruled  that Petitioner voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently  made statements on July 26, 2012, to the police,  thereby rendering the statements admissible at trial. (Id.  at 181.) C. Admissibility of the 911 Call On June 30, 2014, the prosecution submitted a  Molineux application to admit a 911 call made by Mr.  Wilson at 12:37 A.M. on the early morning of the  stabbing. (ECF No. [*8]  5-2, Exhibit 2 to State's  Opposition (""Ex. 2""), at 2.) The 911 call was determined  to be 26 seconds long, and contained only the following  statement by Mr. Wilson: ""I got this girl in my house and  I don't know what's wrong with her, she's acting all crazy  and I want her out of my house."" (Ex. 4 at 131; Ex. 2 at  2-3). The prosecutor argued that the audio recording of  Mr. Wilson's 911 call was admissible under the present  sense impression or the excited utterance exception to  the hearsay rule. (Ex. 2 at 3.) Defense counsel objected  to the inclusion of the evidence, arguing that the  prejudice to Petitioner outweighed the probative value.  (Id. at 3.) Defense counsel further argued that there was  uncertainty about the context of the 911 call - whether  the call referred to the stabbing or a different matter.  (Id.) The prosecution responded by arguing that phone  records showed that, shortly after the 911 call, Petitioner  used Mr. Wilson's cell phone, including to call an  individual that the prosecution planned to call as a  witness. (Id. at 4-5.) The court admitted the 911 call  recording  under  the  present  sense  impression  exception. (Id. at 6.) III. Trial Jury selection for the trial against [*9]  Petitioner began  on June 26, 2014, and concluded on June 30, 2014, at  which point the trial began. (ECF No. 5-1, Exhibit 1 to  State's Opposition (""Ex. 1""), at 43; Ex. 2 at 292.)  Petitioner's trial defense was based upon justification  under N.Y. Penal Law § 35.15 Subsection 2B, relating  to the justified use of deadly force when a person  reasonably believes that the person they kill is  ""committing or attempting to commit a kidnapping,  forcible rape, forcible criminal sexual act or robbery.""  (ECF No. 5-7, Exhibit 7 to State's Opposition (""Ex. 7""),  at 25.) A. The Testimony of Prosecution Witness Matthew  Shepard During the trial, on July 9, 2014, the prosecution  obtained a material witness order to compel Matthew  Shepard to testify at trial. (Id. at 32.) Prior to Mr.  Shepard testifying, the trial court granted defense  counsel's request to confirm with Mr. Shepard that the  prosecutor had accurately represented Mr. Shepard's  unwillingness to speak with defense counsel. (Id. at 30.)  Defense counsel subsequently spoke with Mr. Shepard  but objected to the presence of a detective and the  prosecutor during the conversation. (Id. at 31.) Defense  counsel asked the trial court to direct the prosecutor to  permit a closed-door conversation [*10]  with the  witness, however, the prosecutor objected, stating that  defense counsel was not Mr. Shepard's lawyer, and Mr.  Shepard was the prosecutor's witness pursuant to a  material witness order signed by the trial court the  previous day. (Id. at 32.) The trial court ultimately  decided to allow the prosecutor to be present for  defense counsel's conversation with Mr. Shepard. (Id. at  Page 4 of 16 34.) Defense counsel objected to the condition and the  trial court acknowledged the objection. (Id.) Mr. Shepard testified at the trial following the dispute  over defense counsel being able to speak with him  alone. (Id. at 37.) Mr. Shepard testified that Petitioner  called him a few days after Thanksgiving in the early  morning hours from Mr. Wilson's cell phone number. (Id.  at 45-46.) Mr. Shepard testified that later that day,  following the call, he met Petitioner on DeKalb Avenue  in Brooklyn. (Id. at 45-47.) Mr. Shepard testified that  Petitioner arrived with three or four bags and explained  to Mr. Shepard that she and Mr. Wilson had an  altercation and that she was ""not going to pay rent and  fuck him too,"" and that she had ""poked"" him. (Id. at 47- 48.) Mr. Shepard testified that he was ""almost sure""  Petitioner [*11]  ""had a swelling up on her face, a little  bit,"" but did not see any blood on her. (Id. at 50.) Mr.  Shepard testified that he had had no further contact with  Petitioner after she left his apartment. (Id. at 51.) B. Trial Court's Exclusion of Victim's Medical  Records Also during the trial, on July 1, 2014, the trial court held  a Molineux hearing to discuss various evidentiary issues  raised by the parties. (Ex. 4, at 2.) Defense counsel  explained that he wanted to admit a certified copy of Mr.  Wilson's mental health medical records into evidence  and to call Mr. Wilson's physician to testify about the  use of Seroquel (which was not detected in Mr. Wilson's  toxicology report) and alcohol and their effects on  hallucinations. (Id. at 13-20.) Defense counsel explained  that Mr. Wilson's medical records would be used to  establish that Mr. Wilson had experienced hallucinations  in the past and was prescribed Seroquel. (Id. at 15-16.)  The trial court reviewed the records and declined to  admit the medical records, noting that that Mr. Wilson  was being treated for depression and not psychosis,  that there was no evidence that Mr. Wilson's reported  hallucinations were violent, that Mr. Wilson was  not [*12]  hearing voices, that there was no evidence  that Seroquel was prescribed to Mr. Wilson for  hallucinations or that failure to take Seroquel caused Mr.  Wilson to harm or want to harm Petitioner, and that  defense counsel was attempting to ""dirty the victim"" with  the evidence. (Id. at 13-17-20.) The trial court found that  Mr. Wilson was treated for depression and that the  defense theory was speculative, and that Petitioner  never told police that Mr. Wilson had been hallucinating.  (Id. at 15-20.) C. Defense Counsel's Motion to Dismiss At the close of the prosecution's case, defense counsel  moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the prosecution  failed to substantiate the crime of intentional murder in  the second degree. (Ex. 7, at 92-94.) The court denied  the defense counsel's motion to dismiss. (Id. at 96.) IV. Verdict and Sentence On July 10, 2014, the jury found Petitioner guilty of  murder in the second degree. (Ex. 7, at 220.) On  October 8, 2014, Petitioner was sentenced to 18 years  to life in prison for second-degree murder. (ECF No. 5- 6, Exhibit 6 to State's Opposition (""Ex. 6""), at 13.) PROCEDURAL HISTORY I. State-Murder Conviction Direct Appeal Petitioner, represented by counsel, appealed [*13]  her  conviction  to  the  Appellate  Division,  Second  Department, arguing that (1) the verdict was against the  weight of the evidence; (2) the trial court violated  Petitioner's right to due process, to present a defense,  and to the effective assistance of counsel in its decision  to allow the prosecutor to be present during defense  counsel's interview of Mr. Shepard; (3) the trial court  violated Petitioner's right to present a defense by  declining to admit Mr. Wilson's medical records and  medical testimony in evidence; (4) the trial court erred in  admitting Mr. Wilson's 911 call; (5) the trial court erred  by refusing to suppress Petitioner's July 26, 2012,  statement; and (6) the prosecutor's summation violated  Petitioner's right to a fair trial. (ECF No. 1-2 (""App. Div.  Appellant Brief""), at 3-4.) On August 29, 2018, the Appellate Division unanimously  affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence.  People v. Wisdom, 164 A.D.3d 928, 82 N.Y.S.3d 97 (2d  Dep't 2018). First, the Appellate Division concluded that  the prosecution's case was legally sufficient to disprove  the  defendant's  justification  defense  beyond  a  reasonable doubt and to establish the defendant's guilt  of murder in the second degree beyond a reasonable  doubt. Id. at 98. Second, the Appellate Division [*14]   agreed with the trial court's decision to deny  suppression of Petitioner's July 26, 2012, statement: After waiving her Miranda rights (see Miranda v.  Page 5 of 16 Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d  694), the defendant freely and voluntarily made a  videotaped statement at the police station on July  25, 2012, beginning at approximately 9:00 p.m. The  interview ended after approximately 30 minutes, not  because the defendant unequivocally invoked her  right to remain silent, but rather, to allow her to  compose herself. The idea for ending the interview  and stopping the videotape was that of the  Assistant  District  Attorney  (hereinafter  ADA)  conducting the interview. The ADA said, ""Let's stop  the tape for now,"" and ""there will be no further  questions until we resume the tape."" Questioning  resumed the following morning at approximately  10:00 a.m., at which time the defendant was  reminded of the rights she had been read the  previous day, and the defendant agreed to continue  answering more questions. During that session, the  defendant stated that after she stabbed the victim,  she took the victim's cell phone, keys, and wallet.  The wallet contained the victim's welfare benefit  card, but the defendant specifically denied ever  using the card. . . . The suppression [*15]  hearing testimony of a  detective who, in response to questions by defense  counsel that the defendant did not want to talk  anymore during the prior evening's videotaped  interview, answered, ""Right,"" and in another  instance said, ""Correct,"" does not require a different  result. This testimony does not change the fact that  there was no unequivocal invocation of the  defendant's right to remain silent at that time. The  suggestion that the detective's answers refer  instead to an unrecorded communication by the  defendant, despite the colloquy on the videotape  that there would be no further questioning until the  tape is resumed, is mere speculation and  conjecture that reads into the record information  that simply is not present, and provides no basis for  concluding  that  the  defendant's  10:00  a.m.  statement should have been suppressed. Id. at 98-99. Third, the Appellate Division agreed with  the trial court's determination to ""admit evidence of a  prior uncharged crime involving [Petitioner's] theft and  use of certain property that belonged to the victim, as it  completed the narrative and provided circumstantial  evidence of the date of the victim's death."" Id. at 99. The  Appellate Division found that the ""probative [*16]  value  of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect and the  court's limiting instruction was sufficient to avert any  potential prejudice."" Id. (citation omitted). Fourth, the  Appellate Division found that Petitioner's contention that  she was denied a fair trial by the admission of the 911  call was ""unpreserved for appellate review"" under N.Y.  Crim. Proc. Law § 470.05, but was nonetheless ""without  merit."" Id. Fifth, the Appellate Division found Petitioner's  contention that certain comments made by the  prosecutor during summation deprived her of a fair trial  was partially unpreserved for appellate review, but that  ""to the extent that the prosecutor exceeded the bounds  of permissible rhetorical comment or made other  improper remarks during summation, the remarks were  not so egregious as to have deprived the defendant of a  fair trial, and any other error in this regard was  harmless."" Id. at 100. Sixth, the Appellate Division found  that ""it was improper for the Supreme Court to condition  her ability to interview a prosecution witness upon the  interview occurring either in the presence of the  prosecutor or a detective"" but that ""the error was  harmless."" Id. Finally, the Appellate Division noted that  Petitioner's remaining [*17]  contention was ""without  merit."" Id. On February 14, 2019, the New York Court of Appeals  denied Petitioner's application for leave to appeal, in  which she raised the same arguments and incorporated  her briefs submitted to the Appellate Division. People v.  Wisdom, 32 N.Y.3d 1211, 99 N.Y.S.3d 227, 122 N.E.3d  1140 (N.Y. 2019) (Rivera, J.). II. Habeas Corpus Petition On May 14, 2020, Petitioner filed this petition, raising a  subset of the claims she raised on appeal: first, that the  trial court erred in refusing to suppress her July 26  statement and that the use of the statement prejudiced  her in trial, (Pet. at 42); second, that the trial court  violated her right to due process and to the effective  assistance of counsel by conditioning defense counsel's  ability to interview Mr. Shepard on the presence of  either a detective or prosecutor, (id. at 54); third, that the  trial court violated her right to present a defense by  declining to admit Mr. Wilson's medical records, (id. at  60); fourth, that the trial court violated her right to due  process by improperly admitting Mr. Wilson's 911 call at  trial, (id. at 72.). On  November  12,  2020,  Respondent  filed  a  memorandum of law in opposition to the petition. (State  Opp. at 1.) On January 13, 2021, Petitioner filed a reply  brief [*18]  in support of her petition. (ECF No. 7 (""Pet.  Reply""), at 1.) Page 6 of 16 STANDARD OF REVIEW The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of  1996 (""AEDPA"") requires a federal court reviewing a  state prisoner's habeas petition to give deference to a  state court's decision on the merits. 28 U.S.C. §  2254(d). A federal court may not issue a writ of habeas  corpus unless the state court's decision was ""contrary  to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly  established Federal law"" or was ""based on an  unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the  evidence presented in the State court proceeding."" Id.;  see also Johnson v. Williams, 568 U.S. 289, 292, 133 S.  Ct. 1088, 185 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2013); Chrysler v. Guiney,  806 F.3d 104, 116-17 (2d Cir. 2015). For the purposes of federal habeas review, ""clearly  established law"" means ""the holdings, as opposed to  the dicta, of [the Supreme] Court's decisions as of the  time of the relevant state-court decision."" Williams v.  Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed.  2d 389 (2000). A state court decision is ""contrary to"" or  an ""unreasonable application of"" clearly established law  if the decision: (1) is contrary to Supreme Court  precedent on a question of law; (2) arrives at a  conclusion different than that reached by the Supreme  Court on ""materially indistinguishable"" facts; or (3)  identifies  the  correct  governing  legal  rule  but  unreasonably applies it to the facts [*19]  of the  petitioner's case. Id. at 412-13. The court reviews the  last reasoned state court decision. Ylst v. Nunnemaker,  501 U.S. 797, 804, 111 S. Ct. 2590, 115 L. Ed. 2d 706  (1991); Jones v. Stinson, 229 F.3d 112, 118 (2d Cir.  2000). The state court's factual determinations are  presumed to be correct, and the petitioner bears the  burden of rebutting that presumption by clear and  convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1). ""In all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his  federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent  and adequate state procedural rule, federal habeas  review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can  demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice  as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or  demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result  in a fundamental miscarriage of justice."" Coleman v.  Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L.  Ed. 2d 640 (1991). A petitioner can seek federal habeas corpus relief only  after she exhausts state court remedies and gives the  state courts a fair and full opportunity to review the  merits of the claim. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1); O'Sullivan v.  Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842, 119 S. Ct. 1728, 144 L.  Ed. 2d 1 (1999). In other words, a petitioner must  present ""the essential factual and legal premises of [her]  federal constitutional claim to the highest state court  capable of reviewing it."" Jackson v. Conway, 763 F.3d  115, 133 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting Rosa v. McCray, 396  F.3d 210, 217 (2d Cir. 2005)). DISCUSSION I. Refusal to Suppress the July 26 Statement Petitioner renews her claim that the trial court should  have suppressed her [*20]  statement made on July 26,  2012, because she invoked her right to remain silent,  and the questioning detective subsequently failed to  fully readminister her Miranda rights. (Pet. at 42.) The  Appellate Division's decision rejecting Petitioner's claim  that the July 26, 2012, statements should have been  suppressed is entitled to AEDPA deference, and  Petitioner must show that the state court's decision was  either ""contrary to, or involved an unreasonable  application of, clearly established Federal law"" or was  ""based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in  light of the evidence presented in the State court  proceeding."" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). For the foregoing reasons, this Court finds that the  Appellate Division's decision was consistent with clearly  established federal law and was based on a reasonable  determination of the facts in light of the evidence  presented, specifically, from the video transcript of  Petitioner's questioning on the evening of July 25, 2012.  (Ex. 4 at 176-78.) A. Invoking the Fifth Amendment It is well-settled law that when an individual in custody  has shown that they intend to invoke their Fifth  Amendment right to remain silent, the interrogation must  cease. Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U.S. 96, 100, 96 S. Ct.  321, 46 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1975) (citing Miranda v. Arizona,  384 U.S. 436, 473-74, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694  (1966)). This right is invoked when the individual [*21]   indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during  questioning, that they wish to remain silent. Id. In a  parallel line of cases, the Supreme Court held that an  individual must unambiguously and unequivocally  invoke their right to counsel to prevent further police  Page 7 of 16 questioning. Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452, 462,  114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362 (1994) (explaining  that an individual in custody merely stating, ""[m]aybe I  should talk to a lawyer,"" is not a request for counsel.)  Subsequently, in Berghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U.S. 370,  130 S. Ct. 2250, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1098 (2010), the  Supreme Court clarified that this unambiguous standard  applies both to the invocation of an individual's right to  counsel and their right to remain silent. Id. at 381-82  (holding that had the petitioner stated ""that he wanted to  remain silent or that he did not want to talk with the  police . . . either of these simple, unambiguous  statements [] would have invoked his right to cut off  questioning""). Even prior to the Supreme Court's holding in Berghuis,  however, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals had  consistently required an unambiguous assertion of the  right to remain silent in cases where a defendant sought  to suppress statements made while in custody. In  United States v. Ramirez, 79 F.3d 298 (2d Cir. 1996),  the Second Circuit found that the defendant did not  unambiguously invoke his right to remain silent because  he continued [*22]  to answer questions by interrogating  officers after previously refusing to answer questions by  those officers. Id. at 303. In United States v. Plugh, 648  F.3d 118 (2d Cir. 2011), the only statements that the  defendant made to the interrogating officers were: ""I am  not sure if I should be talking to you,"" and ""I don't know  if I need a lawyer."" Id. at 121. In both cases, the Second  Circuit found that the statements did not expressly  invoke the defendant's right to counsel or right to remain  silent in a manner sufficient to cut off all further  questioning. Id. at 126; Ramirez, 79 F.3d at 303. Further, a court will assess the entire context of the  situation, including anything said by the Petitioner  before or after the statement that the petitioner alleges  invoked their right to remain silent. See Bradley v.  Meachum, 918 F.2d 338, 342 (2d Cir. 1990) (finding that  there was not an unambiguous invocation where the  petitioner stated he did not want to talk about the  alleged crime but continued to speak, denying the  officer's allegations and proffering explanations of his  whereabouts). Recently, a district court in the Eastern  District of New York applied the Berghuis standard to a  statement made by a defendant while in custody: ""I  don't want to talk and get myself into more trouble,  man."" See United States v. Ross, No. 21-CR-571 (BMC)  (LB), 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 169579, 2023 WL 6160436,  at  *10  (E.D.N.Y.  July  31,  2023),  report  and  recommendation adopted, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  169579, 2023 WL 6158840 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2023).  The court noted that [*23]  such a statement could have  been considered an unambiguous invocation of the right  to remain silent when considered alone, but that the  defendant continued to speak, stating: ""But I got a lot of  stuff going on. I don't know what the fuck is going on.  My whole life is fucked up."" Id. The court reasoned that  the defendant's subsequent statements turned what  may have been an unequivocal statement into an  ambiguous one. Id. As a result, the court found that the  defendant's statements were insufficient to invoke his  Fifth Amendment rights. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 169579,  [WL] at *11. When an individual in custody unambiguously and  unequivocally invokes the right to remain silent, the  admissibility of statements obtained by questioning  officers after this invocation depends on whether their  ""right to cut off questioning"" was ""scrupulously honored.""  Mosley, 423 U.S. at 104. After the invocation of that  right, however, there is no ""per se proscription of  indefinite duration upon any further questioning by any  police officer on any subject"" with that individual. Id. at  102-03. Accordingly, the Second Circuit has held that  when a person has invoked the right to remain silent,  questioning can resume after new Miranda warnings  have been administered and the right to remain silent is  otherwise [*24]   scrupulously  honored.  Perkins  v.  Herbert, 596 F.3d 161, 174 (2d Cir. 2010). B. Whether Petitioner Invoked the Fifth Amendment In contending that her July 26, 2012, statements should  be suppressed, Petitioner argues that she invoked her  Fifth Amendment right to remain silent when, on July 25,  2012, she ""agreed during the [ADA's] videotaped  interview about the stabbing that she wanted to 'stop  right now.'"" (Pet. at 42.) Petitioner refers to language  from Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602,  16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), cited in Mosley, which states  that the invocation of the right to remain silent can be  done ""in any manner, at any time prior to or during  questioning."" (Pet. at 44.) Petitioner contends that her  invocation was sufficient because she ""did not remain  mute or express uncertainty about wanting to stop"" or         Page 8 of 16 ""merely request a break."" (Id. at 44-45.) Petitioner also  argues that because she invoked her right to remain  silent, the investigators were accordingly ""required to re- read her rights before questioning her again."" (Id. at 46.) This Court finds Petitioner's argument that she invoked  her right to remain silent unpersuasive. The statements  Petitioner made on July 25, 2012, cannot be read in  isolation from the actual context of the interrogation. The  video transcript referenced by the trial court reflects the  following [*25]  conversation after Petitioner became  emotional: QUESTION: You okay? You want to take a minute?  You want us to stop for a second or do you want to  continue? You want to stop for a second? [Petitioner]: All right. A.D.A. Purce: We're just going to hold out here for a  little bit. You just take your time, all right? [Petitioner]: All right. You know what, I think we're going to-we're going  to stop now, and if you want to continue, we'll talk in  a second, okay. You want us to stop right now? [Petitioner's] ANSWER: Yeah. A.D.A. Purce: All right, just stop the tape for now.  There will be no further questions until we resume  the tape. (Ex. 4 at 178-79.) Courts in this District have previously found an  individual's invocation of the Fifth Amendment to be  ambiguous where they merely display reticence to  answering  questions,  they  remain  silent,  they  equivocate in exercising their rights, or they indicate that  they may not want to continue speaking, but  nevertheless  continue  speaking  and  answering  questions. See Lopez v. Keyser, No. 19-CV-2655  (ARR), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 219311, 2020 WL  6873427, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 23, 2020) (determining  that under Berghuis, the petitioner's reticence to answer  questions did not invoke his right to remain silent); see  also Festus v. Noeth, No. 17-CV-3941 (JMA), 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 224372, 2020 WL 7042666, at *11  (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 30, 2020) (reasoning that a petitioner's  silence did not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights,  especially in [*26]  light of the fact that the petitioner had  already waived his Miranda rights); Plugh, 648 F.3d at  125 (finding that although the petitioner refused to sign  a waiver of his Miranda rights, his concurrent     statements, such as ""I am not sure if I should be talking  to you,"" were too ambiguous to cut off further  questioning); Ross, 2023 WL 6160436, at *10-11  (finding that although the petitioner may have invoked  his right to silence, his actions in continuing to speak  with the questioning officers after doing so rendered his  invocation ambiguous). The Court finds that such  ambiguity also exists here. In this case, Petitioner waived her Miranda rights in  writing prior to speaking to officers during the July 25,  2012, questioning. (Ex. 4 at 168.) Further, Petitioner at  no point explicitly stated that she did not wish to speak  to the questioning officers any further. Rather, Petitioner  agreed with the ADA's suggestion to take a break and  resume questioning at a later time. (Id. at 178.) When  the ADA told Petitioner that ""there will be no further  questions until we resume the tape,"" Petitioner did not  object to continued questioning later. (Id. at 175.) The  next day, the questioning officer reminded Petitioner of  her Miranda rights and asked if she [*27]  wanted to  continue. (Id. at 175.) Petitioner agreed and continued  to answer questions. (Id. at 176.) Furthermore,  Petitioner does not suggest that she subsequently  invoked her Fifth Amendment rights at any point on July  26, 2012. Based  on  Petitioner's  mere  acquiescence  to  suggestions to pause questioning by the ADA, the fact  that she did not initiate the cessation in questioning  herself, and that after being reminded of her Miranda  rights administered the day before, she continued  answering questions the next day, a reasonable officer  would have understood only that the Petitioner agreed  to the ADA's suggested break from questioning at that  moment on July 25, 2012, and that it would resume at a  later time, not that she was unambiguously invoking her  right to remain silent. See Ramirez, 79 F.3d at 303  (when a suspect has ""waived [her] right to remain silent  and has answered some questions . . . [s]he must  articulate [her] desire to cut off questioning with  sufficient clarity that a reasonable police officer in the  circumstances would understand the statement to be  assertion of the right to remain silent"") (internal  quotation marks and citation omitted). Consequently,  this  Court  finds  that  the  Petitioner  did  not  unambiguously [*28]  invoke her right to remain silent  on July 25, 2012, and that the Appellate Division was  correct in finding no error in the trial court's decision to  admit the statement Petitioner made on July 26, 2012.  Because Petitioner's Miranda claim fails, it cannot be  the basis of federal habeas relief, and the Court  therefore denies habeas relief on this ground. Page 9 of 16 II. The Trial Court's Ruling Conditioning Defense  Counsel's Ability to Interview a Witness During Trial Petitioner asserts that the trial court erred when it  ""refused to allow defense counsel to interview [Witness  Matthew Shepard] alone."" (Pet. at 54.) Petitioner  contends that this interference violated ""[her] rights to  due process, to present a defense, and to the effective  assistance of counsel."" (Id.) The Appellate Division held  that ""it was improper for the [trial court] to condition  [Petitioner's] ability to interview a prosecution witness  upon the interview occurring either in the presence of  the prosecutor or a detective."" People v. Wisdom, 164  A.D.3d 928, 82 N.Y.S.3d 97, 100 (2d Dep't 2018).  Despite the fact that the condition was improper,  however, the Appellate Division found the error to be  harmless. Id. As such, the Appellate Division's merits- based decision rejecting the claim is entitled to [*29]   AEDPA deference and Petitioner must show that the  decision was ""contrary to, or involved an unreasonable  application of, clearly established Federal law"" or was  ""based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in  light of the evidence presented in the State court  proceeding."" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). A. Conditions on Access to Witnesses Second Circuit precedent clearly establishes that  ""constitutional notions of fair play and due process  dictate that defense counsel be free from obstruction,  whether it come from the prosecutor [or other officials]""  in  their  interviews  of  ""prospective  prosecution  witness[es]."" Int'l Bus. Machines Corp. v. Edelstein, 526  F.2d 37, 44 (2d Cir. 1975) (citing Coppolino v. Helpern,  266 F. Supp. 930, 935 (S.D.N.Y. 1967)); see also  United States v. Hyatt, 565 F.2d 229, 232 (2d Cir. 1977)  (""[W]e shall not tolerate the view that the government  has some special right or privilege to control access to  trial witnesses.""). Similarly, ""New York State courts have  consistently held that prosecutors may not refuse  defense  counsel  requests  for  interviews  with  prosecution witnesses, and that courts will enable these  interviews if necessary."" Schulz v. Marshall, 528 F.  Supp. 2d 77, 98 (E.D.N.Y. 2007), aff'd sub nom. Schulz  v. Marshal, 345 F. App'x 627 (2d Cir. 2009) (citing  several New York appellate and trial court decisions in  support). However, this right is not without limit, as courts are  permitted to, for example, limit the disclosure of the  identity or address of a confidential [*30]  informant pre- trial, unless their testimony is ""material to [the] defense.""  United States v. Saa, 859 F.2d 1067, 1073 (2d Cir.  1988); see also United States v. Heatley, 994 F. Supp.  483, 489 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (ordering the government to  disclose the identities of informants and cooperators to  the court a week before trial and make them available  for interviews as needed). Further, while not binding  authority from this Circuit, Respondent cites to a case  from the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in which a  court, confronted with facts similar to the instant case,  stated: Here, [defendant] does not allege that the  prosecution told [the witness] not to talk to  [defendant's] counsel or in any other way denied  [defendant] access to witnesses. Neither does  [defendant] allege that the Court in any way  prevented or limited his access to [the witness]  before or during trial, except at the moment she  was arriving to testify. Therefore, [defendant's]  argument that he was prevented from having a fair  opportunity  to  interview  [the  witness]  is  unpersuasive. United States v. Kemp, 379 F. Supp. 2d 690, 714 (E.D.  Pa. 2005), aff'd, 500 F.3d 257 (3d Cir. 2007) (trial  court's limitation on defense counsel's access to a  witness by requiring an FBI agent to be present to  protect the witness from harassment did not violate  defendant's constitutional rights). As such, not all  limitations on access to a witness prior [*31]  to or  during a trial necessarily constitute a constitutional  violation. B. Harmless Error On federal habeas review, unless the ""error 'had  substantial  and  injurious  effect  or  influence  in  determining the jury's verdict'"", a violation of a  petitioner's federal rights during her state criminal  proceeding is harmless. Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507  U.S. 619, 623, 113 S. Ct. 1710, 123 L. Ed. 2d 353  (1993) (quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S.  750, 776, 66 S. Ct. 1239, 90 L. Ed. 1557 (1946)). As  compared to direct review, a showing of harmlessness  on collateral review requires ""more than a 'reasonable  possibility' that the error was harmful."" Davis v. Ayala,  576 U.S. 257, 268, 135 S. Ct. 2187, 192 L. Ed. 2d 323  (2015) (quoting Brecht, 507 U.S. at 637). However, if a  ""conscientious judge [remains] in grave doubt about the  likely effect of an error on the jury's verdict"" — that is, ""in  the judge's mind, the matter is so evenly balanced that  [the judge] feels ... in virtual equipoise as to the  Page 10 of 16 harmlessness of the error,"" — then ""the uncertain judge  should treat the error, not as if it were harmless, but as if  it affected the verdict (i.e., as if it had a 'substantial and  injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's  verdict')."" O'Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, 435, 115  S. Ct. 992, 130 L. Ed. 2d 947, (1995) (quoting Brecht,  507 U.S. at 623). ""[I]n [section] 2254 proceedings[,] a  [federal] court must assess the prejudicial impact of  constitutional error in a state-court criminal trial under  the 'substantial and injurious effect' standard set forth in  Brecht, ... [*32]  whether or not the state appellate court  recognized the error and reviewed it for harmlessness  under the 'harmless beyond a reasonable doubt'  standard"" generally applicable on direct review. Fry v.  Pliler, 551 U.S. 112, 121-22, 127 S. Ct. 2321, 168 L. Ed.  2d 16, (2007) (quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U.S.  18, 24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967)). However, ""[w]hen a state court holds that a federal  constitutional violation tainted a defendant's trial but that  the violation as harmless"" the analysis of harmless error  becomes more complicated, as ""the state court has  adjudicated a constitutional claim on the merits."" Wilson  v. Capra, No. 15-CV-6495 (MKB), 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 257587, 2020 WL 10506052, at *21 (E.D.N.Y.  Oct. 12, 2020), aff'd, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 28979,  2023 WL 7179268 (2d Cir. Nov. 1, 2023) (internal  quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, the  AEDPA prohibits habeas relief unless the state court's  adjudication on the merits was ""contrary to, or involved  an unreasonable application of, clearly established  Federal law"" or was ""based on an unreasonable  determination of the facts in light of the evidence  presented in the State court proceeding."" 28 U.S.C. §  2254(d). ""[A] state-court decision [finding a federal  constitutional violation harmless] is not unreasonable if  'fairminded jurists could disagree on [its] correctness.'""  Ayala, 576 U.S. at 269 (quoting Harrington v. Richter,  562 U.S. 86, 101, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624  (2011)). A federal court ""may not grant [a petitioner's]  habeas petition, however, if the state court simply erred  in concluding that the errors were harmless; rather,  habeas relief [*33]  is appropriate only if the [state court]  applied  harmless-error  review  in  an  'objectively  unreasonable' manner."" Mitchell v. Esparza, 540 U.S.  12, 18, 124 S. Ct. 7, 157 L. Ed. 2d 263 (2003) (per  curiam) (quoting Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U.S. 63, 75,  123 S. Ct. 1166, 155 L. Ed. 2d 144 (2003)). ""While a  federal habeas court need not formally apply both  Brecht and AEDPA/Chapman, AEDPA nevertheless  sets forth a precondition to the grant of habeas relief.""  Ayala, 576 U.S. at 268 (internal quotation marks  omitted) (citing Fry v. Pliler, 551 U.S. 112, 119-120, 127  S. Ct. 2321, 168 L. Ed. 2d 16, (2007)). C. Defense Counsel's Attempted Interview Petitioner argues that because ""the [trial] court refused  to allow defense counsel to interview [Mr. Shepard]  alone,"" her counsel ""was unable to effectively prepare to  defend  Petitioner  and  attacked  [Mr.]  Shepard's  credibility before [Mr.] Shepard unexpectedly revealed  petitioner's outcry."" (Pet. at 54.) The Court finds that the  trial court's condition on defense counsel's access to the  witness just prior to testimony was harmless error and  did not have a ""substantial and injurious effect or  influence in determining the jury's verdict."" Brecht, 507  U.S. at 623 In Petitioner's case, Mr. Shepard had been disclosed as  a witness and thus was not a surprise witness, defense  counsel was not restricted by the court or prosecutor  from contacting the witness prior to trial, and Petitioner  does not allege that the prosecutor did anything to  dissuade [*34]  Mr. Shepard from speaking with defense  counsel. (State Opp. at 55; Pet. at 54.) Rather, defense  counsel sought to speak to Mr. Shepard after he had  been held on a material witness order to testify, and the  trial court granted defense counsel's request to interview  Mr. Shepard. (Ex. 7 at 30.) Defense counsel stated that  Mr. Shepard was willing to speak with him, but defense  counsel objected to the presence of a detective in the  room. (Id. at 31.) Defense counsel acknowledged ""there  is a matter of security"" but stated he should be able to  interview Mr. Shepard alone due to the fact that the  room had ""three detectives standing outside"" and was  ""on the 21st floor of a building which you can only get  down in the elevators."" (Id.) The prosecution objected to  defense counsel interviewing Mr. Shepard without a  detective in the room on the grounds that defense  counsel was ""not [Mr. Shepard's] lawyer."" (Id. at 32.)  Ultimately, the trial court ruled that a detective should  ""stand outside with the door open so he can hear what  you do and say."" (Id. at 32.) Defense counsel again  objected after being prevented from speaking with Mr.  Shepard with the door closed, and the Court again  denied the defense [*35]  request, and stated that the  prosecutor could be present if she desired. (Id. at 34.)  Ultimately, defense counsel again returned to Mr.  Shepard and stated to the witness that he was not  allowed to speak to him privately and that they would  ""speak on the stand."" (Id. at 35.) Defense counsel told  the court that he ""think[s] it's objectionable and I would  move for a mistrial."" (Id.) The trial court responded that  defense counsel ""may be right"" regarding the legal  Page 11 of 16 principle regarding access to a witness but nonetheless  proceeded with the trial. (Id. at 35-36.) Petitioner is correct in contending that courts do ""not  tolerate the view that the government has some special  right or privilege to control access to trial witnesses.""  United States v. Hyatt, 565 F.2d 229, 232 (2d Cir.  1977). It is also true, however, that a court may exercise  discretion to protect witnesses from harassment  immediately prior to testimony, see United States v.  Kemp, 379 F. Supp. 2d 690, 714 (E.D. Pa. 2005), or  issue a court order preventing contact with a witness by  a defendant to prevent harassment and intimidation, see  United States v. Soape, 169 F.3d 257, 270-71 (5th Cir.  1999). It is not clear from the record why the trial court in the  instant case required the presence of a detective or the  prosecutor during a defense interview with Mr. Shepard,  or whether the trial court was motivated [*36]  to prevent  intimidation of a witness who had required a material  witness order to secure his testimony. Similarly, the trial  court did not state whether the presence of a detective  was necessary for the safety of defense counsel, or to  prevent flight by the witness. Nonetheless, even though  the Appellate Court found, and this Court agrees, that  the trial court's conditions were improper, this Court  does not find that the trial court's condition on defense  counsel's ability to question Mr. Shepard had a  substantial  and  injurious  effect  or  influence  in  determining the jury's verdict, Brecht, 507 U.S. at 623,  and does not find that the condition rises to the level of  a constitutional violation. The Appellate Division's  conclusion that the trial court's condition was improper  but a harmless error, People v. Wisdom, 164 A.D.3d  928, 82 N.Y.S.3d 97, 100 (2d Dep't 2018), is not ""an  unreasonable application of[] clearly established Federal  law"" and, as such, is entitled to AEDPA deference, 28  U.S.C. § 2254(d). Accordingly, assuming that the  condition was improper, this Court will turn to the  Appellate Division's conclusion that any error was  harmless under the standard set out by People v.  Crimmins, 36 N.Y.2d 230, 326 N.E.2d 787, 791, 367  N.Y.S.2d 213 (N.Y. 1975) (explaining the New York  state appellate standard of review for constitutional  errors—which  mirrors  Chapman's  beyond  a  reasonable [*37]   doubt  standard—and  non- constitutional errors—which requires a showing of a  ""significant probability"" of acquittal by the jury had it not  been for the error). The Court agrees with the Appellate Division that the  trial court's condition on defense counsel's interview of  Mr. Shepard was harmless error, to the extent it was  error. The prosecution disclosed Mr. Shepard's grand  jury testimony to Petitioner prior to trial, and listed Mr.  Shepard as a witness at the beginning of trial. (State  Opp. at 55.) As such, defense counsel knew that Mr.  Shepard would be testifying, and what the contents of  his testimony would likely be. Furthermore, defense  counsel conducted an extensive and successful cross- examination of Mr. Shepard, which elicited Mr.  Shepard's statement that Wilson ""tried to take it, tried to  force his self on [Petitioner]."" (Ex. 7 at 62-63.) Petitioner  argues here, as she did before the Appellate Division,  that defense counsel ""may have been able to elicit  additional exculpatory evidence, such as [P]etitioner's  exact words to [Mr.] Shepard, given a fair and  meaningful opportunity to interview [Mr.] Shepard."" (Pet.  at 58; see also App. Div. Appellant Brief at 54.)  However, Petitioner [*38]  does not proffer any further  ""additional exculpatory evidence"" that Mr. Shepard  might have provided, or explain how Mr. Shepard's  ""exact words"" would have made a meaningful difference  in proving her justification defense. Petitioner also argues that defense counsel ""surely  would have done things differently"" and would have  refrained from impeaching [Mr.] Shepard's credibility if  defense counsel had known [Mr.] Shepard would state  Wilson had tried to ""force"" himself on Petitioner. (Pet. at  59.) As noted by Petitioner, defense counsel elicited Mr.  Shepard's criminal history and reminded Mr. Shepard  that he told ""[the D.A.] that you weren't paying attention  to what [Petitioner] was telling you."" (Ex. 7 at 57-61.)  However, defense counsel's cross-examination of Mr.  Shepard was not focused solely on impeaching Mr.  Shepard, but was also focused on eliciting evidence  supporting Petitioner's justification defense. Shortly after  impeaching Mr. Shepard, defense counsel asked  ""[Petitioner] did tell you she was hit by Anthony [Wilson],  right?"" (Id. at 61.) Subsequently, defense counsel asked  if ""[Petitioner told] you that Anthony [Wilson] tried to  rape her at that time?"" (Id. at 62.) Defense  counsel [*39]  clearly intended to use-and did use-his  cross-examination not just to impeach Mr. Shepard, but  also to elicit information that would be helpful to  Petitioner's justification defense. Immediately afterward,  defense counsel appeared quite pleased with the result  of that cross-examination, as well, noting that ""based  upon the testimony we heard this morning . . .  [Petitioner] has decided not to testify."" (Id. at 91.)  Defense counsel continued, stating that ""[w]e felt that  [Mr. Shepard] was a very strong witness for [Petitioner].""  (Id.) Page 12 of 16 In light of the facts of this case, the Court finds that the  Appellate Division was not unreasonable in deeming  any error related to defense counsel's access to Mr.  Shepard harmless. Defense counsel was able to elicit  information helpful to Petitioner on cross-examination,  and there is no evidence that further helpful information  might have been uncovered in a private interview of Mr.  Shepard just prior to his testimony. Furthermore, any  strategic error regarding impeachment of Mr. Shepard  was harmless. Though Mr. Shepard did offer testimony  helpful to the defense, he also offered testimony that  corroborated the prosecution's version of events, stating  that [*40]  ""[Petitioner] said, I'm not paying rent and  fucking him . . . [s]he said she poked him."" (Id. at 48.) As  such, a decision by defense counsel not to impeach Mr.  Shepard would also have carried strategic risks, given  his importance to the prosecution's case. Taken  together, the Court finds that to the extent there was an  error in conditioning defense counsel's access to Mr.  Shepard on the day of trial, it did not have a ""substantial  and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's  verdict."" Brecht, 507 U.S. at 623. Accordingly, the  Appellate Division's holding was not unreasonable, and  is entitled to AEDPA deference. III. The Trial Court's Decision to Admit the 911 Call  and Preclude Use of Mr. Wilson's Medical Records Petitioner contends that the trial court deprived her of  her right to a fair trial and to present a defense by  preventing defense counsel from admitting Mr. Wilson's  medical records relating to his mental health. (Pet. at  60-62.) Petitioner argues she was entitled to present  evidence showing Mr. Wilson was ""quarrelsome,  vindictive, or violent"" to demonstrate her state of mind.  (Id. at 61.) She also argues that she was entitled to  introduce documentary evidence-Mr. Wilson's medical  records-proving [*41]   Mr.  Wilson  was  exhibiting  aberrant behavior sufficient to cause fear and warrant a  forceful response. (Id. at 62.) Finally, Petitioner argues  that by preventing her counsel from cross-examining the  medical examiner, Mr. Wilson's sister, and Mr. Wilson's  friend about Mr. Wilson's psychiatric prescription and  substance abuse, her right to confrontation was  ""improperly curtailed."" (Id. at 67.) Petitioner also contends that the state court violated her  right to a fair trial by improperly admitting Mr. Wilson's  statements made in a 911 call under the present sense  impression exception to the rule against hearsay. (Id. at  72.) Petitioner argues that the call was inadmissible for  lack of contemporaneity and corroboration as required  under New York State Law, and further alleges that the  admission of the call into evidence removed reasonable  doubt that would have otherwise existed on the record,  resulting in the deprivation of a fundamentally fair trial.  (Id. at 73-78.) The Appellate Division dismissed Petitioner's claims  regarding the admission of medical records and cross- examination of witnesses as ""without merit."" People v.  Wisdom, 164 A.D.3d 928, 82 N.Y.S.3d 97, 100 (2d Dep't  2018). Regarding the admission of the 911 call, the  Appellate  Division  found  the [*42]   contention  ""unpreserved for appellate review"" but nonetheless  agreed with the trial court's ""determination to admit the  recording  under  the  present  sense  impression""  exception to the hearsay rule on the merits. Id. at 99.  The Appellate Division's merits-based decision rejecting  both claims is entitled to AEDPA deference, and as  such, Petitioner must show that the decision was  ""contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,  clearly established Federal law"" or was ""based on an  unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the  evidence presented in the State court proceeding."" 28  U.S.C. § 2254(d). A. Review of Trial Court Evidentiary Rulings Under  AEDPA In reviewing a habeas petition pursuant to the AEDPA,  courts in this Circuit have found that the ""unreasonable  application of the law"" prong cannot be satisfied by  showing a ruling was ""merely . . . incorrect or  erroneous."" Delancy v. Lee, No. 15-CV-891 (RRM)  (CLP), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 192295, 2019 WL  9051134 at *14 (citing Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362,  409-411, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2000)).  Rather, the ruling must be so unreasonable that it is  impossible for fair-minded jurists to disagree that it was               Page 13 of 16 in violation of Supreme Court precedent. Harrington v.  Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 101, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d  624 (2011). This is an intentionally high standard, as the  purpose of habeas relief is to ""guard against extreme  malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems, not a  substitute [*43]  for ordinary error correction."" Id. at 102  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Where a petitioner alleges an incorrect evidentiary ruling  at trial, this Court must first ascertain whether the state  court ruling was proper under state law; if the ruling  correctly applied the state evidentiary rule, there is no  constitutional violation. Delancey, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  192295, 2019 WL 9051134, at *17. Second, if this Court  finds the evidentiary ruling was made in error, it must  determine whether the error violated a constitutional  right. Id. For a ruling to rise to such a level, the error  must have deprived petitioner of a fundamentally fair  trial. Collins v. Scully, 755 F.2d 16, 18 (2d Cir. 1985).  Courts have clarified that such deprivation occurs when  the error in question has removed reasonable doubt that  was otherwise present in the context of the entire  record. Rosario v. Kuhlman, 839 F.2d 918, 925 (2d Cir.  1988) (citing United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 112- 13, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 49 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1976)). B. Admissibility of a Decedent's Mental Health  Records Under New York evidence law ""a defendant, in a  prosecution for homicide, may introduce evidence that  the deceased had a reputation as a 'quarrelsome,  vindicative or violent' person, provided that the  defendant was aware of this reputation at the time of the  incident."" People v. Miller, 39 N.Y.2d 543, 349 N.E.2d  841, 845, 384 N.Y.S.2d 741 (N.Y. 1976). However, this  is only applicable to the admission of medical records  when it can be shown the accused [*44]  had  knowledge of the decedent's psychiatric history at the  time of confrontation. People v. Trivette, 175 A.D.2d  330, 572 N.Y.S.2d 85, 87 (3d Dep't 1991). Without  establishing that the medical records are relevant to the  defendant's state of mind at the time of the  confrontation, medical records relating to the mental  health of the decedent are inadmissible. People v.  Adams, 272 A.D.2d 953, 708 N.Y.S.2d 766, 767 (4th  Dep't 2000). This applies to other forms of documentary  proof as well; ""[e]vidence of a conviction for a violent act  is, of course, acceptable documentary evidence that  would support the defendant's contention, provided he  was aware of the conviction at the time of the incident.""  Miller, 349 N.E.2d at 848. An exception to this rule  exists for toxicology reports of the decedent showing  use of intoxicants at time of death, which are admissible  regardless of the accused's knowledge. People v.  Chevalier, N.Y.S.2d 508, 509 (1st Dep't 1996), aff'd, 681  N.E.2d 1292 (N.Y. 1997). C. The Trial Court's Preclusion of Mr. Wilson's  Medical Records At trial, defense counsel sought to admit evidence of Mr.  Wilson's psychiatric health and past substance abuse,  requesting to: ""put a certified copy of [Mr. Wilson's medical]  records into evidence which will show what he said  to the doctor... if I don't have that physician, I want  to put on my expert, Dr. Siegel, he will -- who  can [*45]  talk about psychosis. I can ask him what  drugs are given for psychosis and he would  undoubtedly say he gives some of them and  Seroquel."" (Ex. 4 at 13, 14). The trial court denied counsel's  request, calling counsel's argument ""an inference and  then an inference upon an inference"". (Id. at 14). The  trial court further disagreed with defense counsel's  suggestion that the medical records showed that Mr.  Wilson was psychotic, finding after court review of the  medical records that Mr. Wilson's diagnosis was  ""depressive."" (Id. at 15.) Defense counsel subsequently  argued that it was possible that Mr. Wilson's failure to  take Seroquel might have caused him to have  hallucinations, or to attack Petitioner. (Id. at 16). The  trial court again found defense counsel's argument to be  speculative and stated that Mr. Wilson's medical records  did not show any evidence of violence or violent  hallucinations. (Id. at 16-17.) Ultimately, the trial court  ruled that defense counsel had ""no evidence at all that  the failure to take the Seroquel caused [Mr. Wilson] to  harm or want to harm [Petitioner]"" and thus the medical  records were not admissible. (Id. at 20). Under New York law, the only proper purpose for [*46]   which the records in question could be admitted by the  trial court would have been to illustrate an underlying  condition that Petitioner was aware of, and the impact of  that awareness on Petitioner's state of mind. See  People v. Miller, 39 N.Y.2d 543, 349 N.E.2d 841, 845,  384 N.Y.S.2d 741 (N.Y. 1976). Accordingly, what is  pertinent is whether Petitioner had actual knowledge of  Mr. Wilson's psychiatric history. This court finds no  evidence in the record indicating as much. Petitioner  argues that Mr. Wilson kept prescription bottles in plain  Page 14 of 16 view, asserting that ""[Petitioner] undoubtedly was []  aware of Wilson's psychiatric issues, given that she had  been living with him for about a month . . . ."" (Pet. at 63).  This argument, however, falls short of the required  factual support in the record; no evidence was  presented to the trial court that Petitioner observed Mr.  Wilson's medication or medical records, much less  researched the information on the bottles to ascertain  the myriad of psychiatric conditions Seroquel is  prescribed to treat. Furthermore, evidence admitted at  trial showed that the ""pill bottles [] were recovered from  under the bed,"" as opposed to being in plain sight. (Ex.  2 at 180.) Similarly, Petitioner's statement to police that  Mr. Wilson was saying [*47]  ""crazy shit,"" (id.), is not  sufficient to show prior knowledge of Mr. Wilson's  psychiatric history, both because it generally refers to  Mr. Wilson's statements during the altercation as  opposed to beforehand, and because it is ambiguous  enough that it simply indicates Mr. Wilson was saying  things Petitioner found disagreeable, rather than  reflective of an abnormal mental state. Petitioner asserts in the alternative, that the trial court  should have admitted Mr. Wilson's psychiatric records  into evidence in order to impeach his character, claiming  that the State put his character at issue when relying on  Mr. Wilson's statements made during his call to  emergency services. (Pet. at 65). Upon review of the  trial record, this court cannot identify any point at which  the argument regarding impeaching Mr. Wilson's  character was raised, and as such this argument was  not properly preserved under C.P.L. § 470.05(2).  However, the Appellate Division plainly stated its  intention to address the argument on its merits  regardless. See People v. Wisdom, 164 A.D.3d 928, 82  N.Y.S.3d 97, 100 (2d Dep't 2018) (""The defendant's  remaining contention is without merit.""). This court is  therefore obliged to contend with the substance of the  Petitioner's  argument,  rather  than  finding  it  procedurally [*48]  barred. See Jones v. Stinson, 229  F.3d 112, 118 (2d Cir. 2000) (""[W]e follow the  presumption established by the Supreme Court and ask  not what we think the state court actually might have  intended but whether the state court plainly stated its  intention.""). In evaluating the merits of the argument  regarding use of the medical records for impeachment,  this court finds that the Appellate Division was correct in  finding no error in the trial court's decision to exclude  Mr. Wilson's mental health records. Under New York law, it is recognized that mental health  history, including evidence of a history of delusions, is  particularly probative of a witness' credibility. People v.  Rensing, 14 N.Y.2d 210, 199 N.E.2d 489, 491, 250  N.Y.S.2d 401 (N.Y. 1964). However, the party seeking  to admit such evidence must have a ""good faith basis  for believing that the witness' mental condition affected  a material issue in the case, for example, [the witness']  ability to perceive or remember."" People v. Knowell, 94  A.D.2d 255, 464 N.Y.S.2d 525, 529 (2d Dep't 1983).  New York state courts typically only find an abuse of  discretion in precluding evidence of a witness' mental  health history when there is substantial, undisputed,  documentation of a testifying witness' mental illness,  such  as  multiple  hospitalizations,  diagnosis  as  paranoiac or schizophrenic, or involuntary commitment.  See  Rensing,  199  N.E.2d  at  491  (court,  in  reversing [*49]  conviction and granting a new trial, held  that the jury should have been made aware that a key  witness experienced, inter alia, ""visual and auditory  hallucinations with marked memory defect"" and had  been diagnosed with ""Paranoid Schizophrenia""); see  also People v. Knowell, 127 A.D.2d 794, 512 N.Y.S.2d  190, 192 (2d Dep't 1987) (finding that a court erred in  refusing to conduct an in camera inspection of  psychiatric records of a witness who ""had a lengthy  history of psychiatric problems, had been confined in  mental hospitals on several occasions in the recent past  and had been diagnosed as paranoiac""). These  circumstances simply do not exist in the instant case. Mr. Wilson's medical records, reviewed by the trial court,  spanned a three-month period - from September 6,  2011, through November 26, 2011. (ECF 1-7 (""Pet. Ex.  H"") at 11, 22.) Mr. Wilson was originally referred for  substance abuse treatment but was given a psychiatric  evaluation as part of his intake to the Chemical  Dependency program. (Id. at 11-14.) As later noted by  the medical provider who examined him, Mr. Wilson was  diagnosed with ""Major Depressive Disorder"" and was  taking ""Seroquel, Benadryl, and Prozac while enrolled in  [the] clinic."" (Id. at 23.) The medical provider also stated  in her notes [*50]  from her psychiatric evaluation that  Mr. Wilson ""[n]otes hallucinations to harm self or  others."" (Id. at 14). However, the medical provider also  noted that Mr. Wilson had ""no gross cognitive deficits,  [d]enie[d] both suicidal and homicidal ideation, [and  was] alert and oriented to time, place, and person."" (Id.)  Mr. Wilson was not diagnosed with a mental illness such  as paranoid schizophrenia, and no other annotations  regarding delusions, violence, or his ability to accurately  perceive events are present in his medical records.  Furthermore, Petitioner does not offer any evidence to  suggest that Mr. Wilson exhibited any hallucinatory  behavior in the month she lived with him, or on the night  when he called 911 on November 29, 2011, or that she  Page 15 of 16 was aware of his psychiatric evaluation. Accordingly, the  instant case is distinguishable from precedent cited by  Petitioner and noted above. As such, this court cannot  find that the trial court acted unreasonably in excluding  evidence of Mr. Wilson's mental health records for  purposes of impeachment. Considering Petitioner's  claim under the standards set out by the AEDPA, the  Court finds that the Appellate Division's rejection of this  claim  on [*51]   appeal  was  not  an  objectively  unreasonable  application  of  existing  federal  constitutional principles, and Petitioner's claim regarding  her right to present a defense is denied. D. New York State's Present Sense Impression  Exception For hearsay to be admissible under the present sense  impression exception under New York state evidence  law, a statement must be (1) ""made while the declarant  was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately  thereafter"" and must be accompanied by (2) ""some  independent verification of the declarant's descriptions  of the unfolding events."" People v. Vasquez, 88 N.Y.2d  561, 670 N.E.2d 1328, 1334, 647 N.Y.S.2d 697 (N.Y.  1996). The New York Court of Appeals has emphasized  that the level and nature of the corroboration required  ""will depend on the particular circumstances of each  case and must be left largely to the sound discretion of  the trial court."" People v. Brown, 80 N.Y.2d 729, 610  N.E.2d 369, 374, 594 N.Y.S.2d 696 (N.Y. 1993). The  inquiry must determine ""whether the corroboration  offered to support admission of the statement truly  serves to support its substance and content."" Vasquez,  670 N.E.2d at 1335. Brown serves as an example,  where  apprehension  of  a  suspect  matching  a  description in a 911 call was found to be sufficient  corroboration to admit the underlying 911 call. 610  N.E.2d at 374. New York courts have observed that  ""[t]he 'present sense impression' [*52]  exception has  been utilized mainly to introduce 911 calls made by  either the victim or witnesses while they observe events  as they are unfolding."" People v. Semple, 174 Misc. 2d  879, 666 N.Y.S.2d 900, 902 (Sup. Ct. 1997) (citing  People v. Hughes, 228 A.D.2d 618, 645 N.Y.S.2d 493  (2d Dep't 1996) and People v. Cook, 220 A.D.2d 522,  632 N.Y.S.2d 193 (2d Dep't 1995)). Once a New York trial court finds that the hearsay  statement qualifies for admission under the present  sense impression exception, it retains discretion to  refuse to admit the evidence if ""its probative value is  substantially outweighed by the danger that it will  unfairly prejudice the other side or mislead the jury.""  People v. Scarola, 71 N.Y.2d 769, 525 N.E.2d 728, 732,  530 N.Y.S.2d 83 (N.Y. 1988). As such, the decision to  admit evidence that satisfies the present sense  impression exception to hearsay is also reviewable by  the Appellate Division for abuse of discretion. People v.  Smith, 22 N.Y.3d 462, 982 N.Y.S.2d 809, 5 N.E.3d 972,  974 (N.Y. 2013) (stating that a court retains discretion  regarding excluding otherwise admissible evidence  ""when it reasonably finds that evidence to be more  prejudicial than probative""). E. The Trial Court's Ruling during the Molineux  Hearing Defense counsel objected to the admission of the 911  call during a Molineux hearing on the basis that it failed  to satisfy both requirements of the present sense  impression exception under New York State law, and  that its prejudicial effect would outweigh its probative  value. (Ex. 2 at 3, 6.) Specifically, defense [*53]   counsel argued: ""During the evening of this call we actually don't  know when this man is killed. Time of death was  never set, the date itself was never set. We don't  know what it refers to, whether it refers to this  incident or something else, and so absent any  background or testimony, it is just this man calling.  We don't know if there's an upsetment, an  intervening event, things calm down and something  happened. It's significant, there's nothing on the call  like look out or ouch or hearing anything, it  essentially just cuts off with that . . ."" (Id. at 3-4). The prosecutor responded that both medical  evidence and Mr. Wilson's phone records indicated that  the call was made shortly before his death, and that  phone records also showed Petitioner began using Mr.  Wilson's phone shortly after the 911 call was made. (Id.  at 4-5.) Specifically, the prosecution argued that Mr. Wilson's  phone was used to call a witness, Matthew Shepard,  following the 911 call, and that when Mr. Shepard  answered the call, expecting Mr. Wilson, it was  Petitioner calling. (Id. at 4.) The prosecution further  argued that Petitioner subsequently made ""third-party  admissions"" to Mr. Shepard that she was not going  to [*54]  give Mr. Wilson money and have sex with him,  and subsequently ""poked"" Mr. Wilson as a result. (Id. at  4-5.) Continuing, the prosecutor noted that the medical  examiner would be able to corroborate that the time of  Page 16 of 16 death was close in proximity to the time of the 911 call.  (Id. at 5.) After further argument from defense counsel  that there may have been intervening actions between  the call and the stabbing, the trial court ultimately ruled  that Mr. Wilson's call was admissible hearsay under the  present sense impression exception. (Id. at 6.) This Court finds that the trial court was not  unreasonable in its determination that Mr. Wilson's  statements were adequately contemporaneous and  corroborated. First, the trial court properly considered  extrinsic evidence that established the time of the call in  relation to Mr. Wilson's stabbing based on the proffered  medical examiner's evidence, as well as subsequent  phone calls from Mr. Wilson's phone that matched the  petitioner's pattern of phone calls from her own cell  phone in establishing the contemporaneity of the  statements. (Id. at 4-5). Furthermore, based on the  prosecution's characterization of Mr. Wilson's word  choices in describing the perceived [*55]  behavior on  the 911 call as occurring while he was speaking, the trial  court admitted the 911 call as a present sense  impression exception to the hearsay rule. (Id. at 2-4.)  The record sufficiently establishes that Mr. Wilson's  statements were made while the described event was  taking place. With respect to corroboration of the call's substance, the  trial  court  properly  considered  petitioner's  later  statements to Mr. Shepard, in which she acknowledged  that an argument took place between her and Mr.  Wilson. (Id. at 4-5.) Mr. Shepard's later testimony on the  stand confirmed that this corroboration occurred. (Ex. 7  at 47-48.) Moreover, Petitioner admitted during her July  26, 2012, interview that she took Mr. Wilson's cell phone  after she stabbed him. (Ex. 4 at 165-66.) This totality of  evidence  adequately  corroborates  Mr.  Wilson's  statements through independent means, as required  under New York law regarding the present sense  impression. Finally, this court does not find persuasive Petitioner's  claims that Mr. Wilson's statements were overly  prejudicial and should have been excluded. Once  properly admitted under the present sense impression  exception to hearsay, Mr. Wilson's statements [*56]   would have been admissible for the truth of the matter  asserted. Whether or not Petitioner was indeed ""acting  crazy"" shortly prior to Mr. Wilson's death would have  been highly probative of the veracity of her justification  defense. Furthermore, the fact that Mr. Wilson, the  declarant,  was  unavailable  weighs  in  favor  of  admissibility of the statement. See People v. Buie, 86  N.Y.2d 501, 658 N.E.2d 192, 195, 634 N.Y.S.2d 415  (N.Y. 1995) (holding that ""the present sense impression  exception does not require a showing of the declarant's  unavailability as a sine qua non to admissibility,""  although the trial judge may weigh the declarant's  availability in the ""traditional probativeness versus  undue prejudice calculus"" for determining admissibility). Based on the foregoing, this Court finds that the trial  court's decision to admit Mr. Wilson's 911 call was a  correct evidentiary ruling under New York State's  present sense impression exception to hearsay.  Accordingly, the Appellate Division's decision upholding  the  trial  court's  ruling  was  not  an  objectively  unreasonable  application  of  existing  federal  constitutional principles and Petitioner's due process  claim is denied.",0

I. INTRODUCTION 538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *49; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **89419 Page 15 of 43 Defendant Michael Jabaar Wilkins is charged with two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud, and coercion, four  counts of transportation of an individual with an intent to engage in prostitution, two counts of coercion and  enticement to travel in interstate commerce to engage in prostitution, one count of interstate travel and  transportation in aid of racketeering enterprises, and one count of assault. Superseding Indictment, Dec. 9, 2020,  ECF No. 61. A jury trial is scheduled to begin in this case on July 26, 2021. In brief, Mr. Wilkins stands accused of trafficking three victim-complainants from Norfolk, Virginia, to Washington,  D.C. to engage in prostitution and other commercial sexual acts. Id. The charged offenses occurred between 2011  and 2019, during which time Mr. Wilkins is alleged to have transported these complainants to ""the Track""— a  location in the District under investigation by the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (""MPD"")  and FBI Child Exploitation and Human Trafficking Task Force due to the prevalence of street- level commercial  sexual exploitation in the area. Mr. [**3]  Wilkins is also charged with assaulting one of the complainants while she  was working at the Track—an altercation that was caught on tape by a security camera. Before the Court are a number of motions from both parties. The Government has filed motions in limine seeking:  (1) the exclusion of any evidence of the complainants' other sexual behavior and sexual predisposition (ECF No.  27); (2) the preclusion of use of the victims' last names (ECF No. 28); (3) the introduction of business records  evidence (ECF No. 33); (4) the introduction of expert witness testimony (ECF No. 34); (5) the prohibition of  references to sentencing, the exclusion of witnesses from the courtroom during trial, the exclusion of evidence not  produced in reciprocal discovery, preclusion of self-serving hearsay, admission of jail call admissions, and  preclusion of Mr. Wilkins's counsel cross-examining government witnesses regarding inadmissible criminal  convictions (ECF No. 35); (6) the admission of electronic communications evidence (ECF No. 36); and (5) the  admission of other crimes evidence (ECF No. 40). Mr. Wilkins has also filed motions requesting: (1) that the Court  sever the assault charge in the indictment [**4]  (ECF No. 38), and (2) that the Court suppress evidence obtained   [*63]  from search warrants of two cell phones and Mr. Wilkins's Instagram account (ECF No. 39). A motions  hearing was held on March 31, 2021 to allow for oral argument on each of these motions. The Court addresses  each of the pending motions in turn. II.

The Government's Motion to Exclude Evidence of Victims' Other Sexual Behavior and Sexual Disposition The Court begins its analysis with the Government's Motion to Exclude Evidence of Victims' Other Sexual Behavior  and Sexual Disposition (""Gov't Rule 412 Mot.""), ECF No. 27. The Government intends to call three witnesses who  will testify that Mr. Wilkins sexually exploited them for financial gain. Gov't Rule 412 Mot. at 1; see also Hr'g Tr. at 9.  Pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 412 and 403, the Government has moved to preclude Mr. Wilkins from  eliciting testimony from these witnesses during cross-examination about their other sexual behavior or their sexual  dispositions, including any commercial [**6]  sex acts engaged in by the witnesses before or after being allegedly  exploited by Mr. Wilkins. Id. In response, Mr. Wilkins contends that the exclusion of this evidence with respect to the  complainants  [*64]  would violate his constitutional right to present a complete defense. Def.'s Opp'n to Gov't Mot.  in Lim. to Exclude Evid. Of Victims' Other Sexual Behavior and Alleged Predisposition Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid.  412 and Not. of Intent to Offer 412 Evid. (""Def.'s Rule 412 Opp'n"") at 4-6, ECF No. 45. HN3[ ] Federal Rule of Evidence 412 provides that, in a ""civil or criminal proceeding involving alleged sexual  misconduct,"" both ""evidence offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual behavior"" and ""evidence offered  to prove a victim's sexual predisposition"" is ""not admissible."" Fed. R. Evid. 412. The animating purpose behind  Rule 412 is ""to safeguard the alleged victim against the invasion of privacy, potential embarrassment and sexual  stereotyping that is associated with public disclosure of intimate sexual details."" Fed. R. Evid. 412 advisory  committee's note to 1994 amendment. In a criminal case, there are three exceptions to this rule of exclusion, but  the only one argued by Mr. Wilkins is that this evidence is of the type that its ""exclusion would violate the  defendant's constitutional [**7]  rights."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C). Specifically, Mr. Wilkins claims that excluding  evidence of the complainant's commercial sex work will abridge his constitutional right to present a complete  defense. See Def.'s Rule 412 Opp'n at 5-6. HN5[ ] A criminal defendant has a constitutional right to present evidence in his own defense. See Crane v.  Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 690, 106 S. Ct. 2142, 90 L. Ed. 2d 636 (1986). However, ""[a] defendant's right to present  relevant evidence is not unlimited, but rather is subject to reasonable restrictions."" United States v. Scheffer, 523                          538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *63; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **5 Page 17 of 43 U.S. 303, 308, 118 S. Ct. 1261, 140 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1998). For example, the guarantee that a criminal defendant  may present evidence in his own defense ""extends  [*65]  only to relevant evidence."" United States v. Libby, 475 F.  Supp. 2d 73, 91 (D.D.C. 2007); see also United States v. Solomon, 399 F.3d 1231, 1239 (10th Cir. 2005) (""[A]  criminal defendant does not have a constitutional right to present evidence that is not relevant and not material to  his defense.""). Furthermore, a defendant's right to introduce evidence must also ""bow to accommodate other  legitimate interests,"" which includes protecting a victim of sexual misconduct from harassment and unnecessary  invasions of privacy. See Michigan v. Lucas, 500 U.S. 145, 149-50, 111 S. Ct. 1743, 114 L. Ed. 2d 205 (1991). HN6[ ] In the context of Rule 412, federal courts have found that a victim's participation in prostitution either  before or after a defendant uses force, threats, fraud, or coercion to cause the victim to engage in prostitution is  irrelevant to the question of whether [**8]  the defendant committed the crime. See United States v. Cephus, 684  F.3d 703, 708-09 (7th Cir. 2012); see also United States v. Roy, 781 F.3d 416, 420 (8th Cir. 2015) (""The victim's  participation in prostitution either before or after the time period in the indictment has no relevance to whether [the  defendant] beat her, threatened her, and took the money she made from prostitution in order to cause her to  engage in commercial sex.""). For example, in Cephus, the Seventh Circuit held that a defendant convicted of sex  trafficking could not introduce evidence that one of his victims had previously engaged in prostitution because the  fact that the victim had previously participated in commercial sex work was irrelevant. 684 F.3d at 708. The court  noted that ""the fact that [the victim] had been a prostitute before"" had no bearing on whether the defendant had  beaten or threatened her during the time period in the indictment. Id. In finding prior involvement in prostitution  irrelevant, these cases thus recognize the illogical and impermissible assumption of the following inference: that  simply because the victim had previously engaged in prostitution, it was somehow less likely that she was coerced  or threatened to engage in prostitution on a later occasion. Mr. Wilkins contends that excluding evidence that the complainant [**9]  was involved in prostitution before  connecting with Mr. Wilkins would leave out a critical part of the story: the complainant knew Mr. Wilkins since she  was eight years old, they had an ""up and down friendship,"" and the complainant contacted Mr. Wilkins for protection  after she was assaulted by ""Keon"" for ""renegading""—i.e., engaging in commercial sex work in a prostitution zone  without having someone to vouch for her. See Def.'s Rule 412 Opp'n at 5. Thus, he claims that this evidence  ""crystalizes the notion that [the complainant] actively sought a way to stay in the sex trade rather than walking away  after she was assaulted by Keon, and is direct proof that her[] relationship with Mr. Wilkins was not the product of  coercion."" Id. at 6. The Government disputes this factual recitation, arguing that the complainant did not start  working for Mr. Wilkins until eighteen months after the assault Mr. Wilkins details. Gov't Reply to Def.'s Opp'n to  Gov't Mot. in Lim. to Excl. Evid. Of Victims' Other Sexual Behavior and Alleged Predisposition Pursuant to Fed. R.  Evid. 412 (""Gov't Rule 412 Reply"") at 4, ECF No. 57. Even accepting Mr. Wilkins's factual assertions as true,  evidence of the complainant's previous commercial sex [**10]  work is wholly irrelevant to whether Mr. Wilkins  coerced her to engage in prostitution during the time period alleged in the superseding indictment, because nothing  about the complainant's prior sexual behavior makes it more or less likely that Mr. Wilkins coerced her into traveling  in  [*66]  interstate commerce to engage in prostitution. The fact that the complainant ""sought a way to stay in the  sex trade"" at one point has no bearing on whether Mr. Wilkins coerced her to engage in prostitution on a later  occasion. Holding otherwise would permit the chain of inferences rejected by Cephus and Roy: that because the  complainant had previously engaged in prostitution, it is somehow less likely she would have been coerced by Mr.  Wilkins to engage in prostitution during the charged time period. Consequently, because evidence of the  complainant's prior involvement in prostitution is irrelevant to whether Mr. Wilkins coerced her to engage in  prostitution during the time period in the indictment, Mr. Wilkins does not have a constitutional right to present it.  See Libby, 475 F. Supp. 2d at 91. Thus, the Court grants the Government's Rule 412 motion in limine. Even if evidence that the complainant was involved in commercial sex work was [**11]  relevant and admissible  under Rule 412, the Court would still exclude the evidence under Rule 403. HN7[ ] Rule 403 excludes relevant  evidence ""if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the  issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of  cumulative evidence."" Fed. R. Evid. 403. The probative value of a piece of evidence ""may be calculated by  comparing evidentiary alternatives,"" Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 184, 117 S. Ct. 644, 136 L. Ed. 2d  574 (1997), and when evaluating whether to exclude evidence on grounds of unfair prejudice, the ""availability of  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *64; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **7 Page 18 of 43 other means of proof may . . . be an appropriate factor,"" id. (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 403 advisory committee's notes).  The crux of Mr. Wilkins's argument is that his longstanding personal relationship with the complainant negates the  contention that he coerced her into engaging in prostitution. See Def.'s Rule 412 Opp'n at 5-6. Mr. Wilkins is  certainly free to elicit testimony from the complainant about their longstanding friendship, and any outreach she  made to Mr. Wilkins concerning her personal safety. This would allow Mr. Wilkins the opportunity to present this  ""critical piece"" of his ""complete defense"" while avoiding disclosure of the complainant's other sexual [**12]   behavior. The Government does not oppose the admission of this type of testimony. See Hr'g Tr. at 12 (statement  of Government counsel indicating that ""had the victim approached the defendant and initiated contact in any way,  that's admissible""). Considering this evidentiary alternative that exists to demonstrate the relationship between Mr.  Wilkins and the complainant, and cognizant of the need to ""safeguard the alleged victim against the invasion of  privacy, potential embarrassment and sexual stereotyping that is associated with public disclosure of intimate  sexual details,"" Fed. R. Evid. advisory committee's note to 1994 amendment, the Court finds the probative value of  the complainant's other sexual behavior substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. Accordingly, the  Government's motion to exclude this evidence is granted. B. The Government's Motion to Preclude Use of Victim's Last Names The Government has also filed an unopposed motion, pursuant to the Crime Victims' Rights Act, to preclude the  use of the complainants' last names throughout the course of the trial. Gov't. Mot. to Preclude Use of Victims' Last  Names, ECF No. 28. It argues that this is necessary in order to prevent the complainants from [**13]  being subject  to ""harassment, humiliation and/or obstruction form the defendant, the media, and others . . . [and] to protect the  safety  [*67]  of these vulnerable witnesses."" Id. at 1. Mr. Wilkins does not oppose this request. See Hr'g Tr. at 18.  Accordingly, the Court grants the motion to allow each of the complainants to testify using only their first names,  and directs Mr. Wilkins's counsel to also refrain from using the complainants' full names during his cross- examination and argument. C. The Government's Motion to Admit Business Records The Government next provides notice of its intent to offer a variety of business records under Federal Rule of  Evidence 803(6), including records from ""hotels, online advertising websites, social media websites, cellular  telephone companies, internet service providers, DC License Plate Readers, and correctional facilities."" Gov't Mot.  to Introduce Evid. Pursuant to Fed. Rule Evid. 803(6) and 902(11) at 2, ECF No. 33. Instead of calling foundation  witnesses for each of the records, the Government intends to provide ""a written declaration from a custodian of the  records certifying that the records were made in accordance with the requirements of Rule 803(6),"" as per the  dictates of Rule 902(11). Id. The parties represented at the motions [**14]  hearing that they are largely in  agreement on this issue. The Court reiterates that the Government is to specify in the pretrial statement which  records they wish to introduce at trial, and must provide the relevant certifications to Mr. Wilkins's counsel so he  may raise objections as appropriate. D. The Government's Notice of Intent to Offer Expert Witness Testimony The Government next provides notice of its intent to offer the expert testimony of FBI Agent William B. Shute,  explaining that he will use cell site and GPS data records from two telephone numbers to prepare maps with plotted  cell site locations, which will correspond with ""the movement of these phones between Norfolk, VA and  Washington, D.C. during the time periods alleged in the counts charged in the Indictment."" See Gov't Rule 702 Mot.  at 2, ECF No. 34. Mr. Wilkins does not oppose the admission of Special Agent Shute's testimony. The Court  reminds the Government, as it stated on the record at the motions hearing, see Hr'g Tr. at 26, that they must  provide to Mr. Wilkins's counsel in a timely manner any data analysis or exhibits that Agent Shute is preparing for  trial. 538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *66; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **11 Page 19 of 43 E. The Government's Motion to Prohibit References to Potential [**15]  Penalties The Government next requests, as one part of their omnibus Motion in Limine (""Gov't MIL""), ECF No. 35, that the  Court prohibit Mr. Wilkins's counsel from introducing evidence, advancing arguments or questions, or otherwise  mentioning any potential penalties Mr. Wilkins may face if convicted. Id. at 1. HN8[ ] When a jury has no  sentencing function, it should not consider the question of punishment in arriving at its verdict. See Shannon v.  United States, 512 U.S. 573, 579, 114 S. Ct. 2419, 129 L. Ed. 2d 459 (1994) (noting that evidence relating to the  punishment and effect of a defendant's conviction are not probative as to innocence or guilt and can needlessly  confuse the jury); see also Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 2.505 (5th ed. 2011)  (instructing that the question of possible punishment is not for the jury). Mr. Wilkins does not contest the  Government's motion, and has made clear to the Court that he does not intend to advance any arguments related  to the potential penalties Mr. Wilkins may face. See Def.'s Opp'n to Gov't Mot. in Lim. at 2, ECF No. 48; see also  Hr'g Tr. at 27. Accordingly, (though perhaps a moot point), the Court will grant the Government's  [*68]  motion to  preclude the introduction of this type of evidence. F. The Government's [**16]  Motion to Permit Case Agent to Remain at the Government's Table but Exclude  Other Witnesses from the Courtroom During Trial The Government also requests, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 615(3), that the Court allow the case agent  for this matter, Detective Sullivan, to be present in the courtroom and remain at counsel table throughout trial, while  all other witnesses are excluded from the courtroom. Gov't MIL at 3. HN9[ ] Federal Rule of Evidence 615  provides that upon a party's request or by its own authority, a court ""must order witnesses excluded so that they  cannot hear other witness' testimony."" Fed. R. Evid. 615. But the rule exempts ""an officer or employee of a party  that is not a natural person, after being designated as the party's representative by its attorney."" Fed. R. Evid.  615(b); see also United States v. Lee, 834 F.3d 145, 162 (2d Cir. 2016) (affirming decision to exempt ATF special  agent because he was properly within Rule 615(b) exemption as a 'representative' of the government). Mr. Wilkins's  counsel made clear at the motions hearing that he does not oppose this request, which, as already explained, is  consistent with the governing Rules of Evidence. See Hr'g. Tr. at 27. Accordingly, Detective Sullivan will be  permitted to remain at the Government's table throughout trial, while the other witnesses will be excluded. G. The Government's [**17]  Motion to Exclude Evidence Not Produced in Reciprocal Discovery The Court turns next to the Government's request to exclude any evidence that Mr. Wilkins has not provided to the  Government in reciprocal discovery. See Gov't MIL at 4. HN10[ ] The Court reiterates that Rule 16(b)(1)(A)  imposes a ""reciprocal discovery requirement"" between the United States and a criminal defendant. See United  States v. Hardy, 586 F.3d 1040, 1043 (6th Cir. 2009). The Court accordingly orders that Mr. Wilkins comply with  these obligations regarding providing reciprocal discovery to the extent it exists. H. The Government's Motion to Preclude Mr. Wilkins from Introducing Self-Serving Hearsay The Government has also filed a general motion to alert Mr. Wilkins's counsel and the Court that it intends to  introduce multiple statements made by Mr. Wilkins as admissions by party-opponent pursuant to Federal Rule of  Evidence 801(d)(2), and seek to bar Mr. Wilkins from subsequently introducing any of his own statements, which  the Government contends remain barred as hearsay. Gov't MIL at 4. HN11[ ] The Court reminds both parties that  Federal Rule of Evidence 801 prohibits hearsay, which is defined as any ""out-of-court statement offered to prove  the truth of the matter asserted."" Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). While the Federal Rules of Evidence set forth various  exceptions to hearsay, self-serving [**18]  hearsay is not one of those. See United States v. Rivera-Hernandez, 497  F.3d 71, 82 n.5 (1st Cir. 2007) (internal citation omitted) (""To be received in evidence an admission . . . must be  contrary to that party's position at the time of the trial.""); United States v. Palow, 777 F.2d 52, 56 (1st Cir. 1985)  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *67; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **14 Page 20 of 43 (holding that Rule 801(d)(2)(A) excludes the introduction of self-serving statements by the party making them).  Consequently, Mr. Wilkins is prohibited from introducing self-serving hearsay statements, though the Court will, of  course, make these fact specific determinations as necessary if they arise during trial.  [*69]  I. The Government's Motion for Admission of Jail Call Admissions The Government has stated its intent to introduce admissions and statements captured during the defendant's  recorded jail calls as non-hearsay admissions of a party opponent under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2). Gov't  MIL at 6. During the motions hearing, Mr. Wilkins's counsel confirmed that he is in receipt of the jail phone calls in  question, and requested the specific phone calls the Government intends to introduce be identified. Hr'g Tr. at 29.  The Court directs the Government to do so, and also to provide Mr. Wilkins's counsel with the applicable log that  identifies which of the calls applies to each of the complainants. It will decline to rule further on this motion at  this [**19]  time. J. The Government's Motion for Preclusion of Mr. Wilkins's Counsel Cross-Examining Government  Witnesses Regarding Inadmissible Criminal Convictions The Government initially moved, prior to the filing of the superseding indictment, to preclude Mr. Wilkins's counsel  from cross-examining any Government witnesses regarding criminal convictions that are inadmissible under the  Federal Rules of Evidence. See Gov't MIL at 7. During the motions hearing both parties indicated that the criminal  histories of the three complainants had been provided to Mr. Wilkins's counsel, and the parties would work through  this issue and submit an update to the Court in their Joint Pretrial submission. See Hr'g Tr. at 33. Accordingly, the  Court takes no action on this motion at this time. K. The Government's Motion to Admit Electronic Communications The Government has also filed a motion stating its intent to introduce text messages and Instagram multimedia  messages between Mr. Wilkins and certain complainants. See Gov't Mot. Admit Electronic Evid., ECF No. 36. The  Government states that it is prepared to demonstrate the communications' relevancy and authenticity pursuant to  Federal Rules of Evidence 401 and 901, and invoke exemptions to [**20]  the rule against hearsay pursuant to  Federal Rule of Evidence 801 as needed. Id. The Court directs the parties to move forward with the exchange of  the proposed trial exhibits, so Mr. Wilkins's counsel can raise specific objections as warranted, which the Court can  then rule on as necessary. L. The Government's Motion to Introduce Various Rule 404(b) and Rule 609 Evidence The Government's final motion requests, pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 404(b) and 609, the admission of a  wide variety of evidence pertaining to Mr. Wilkins's past interactions with law enforcement and his past criminal  convictions. See Gov't Mot. in Lim. to Introduce Evid. Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)/609 (""Gov't 404(b) Mot.""),  ECF No. 40. HN12[ ] Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) prohibits the use of ""other crimes, wrongs, or acts . . . to  prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the  character."" Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(1). Prior bad acts are permitted, however, as evidence of ""motive, opportunity,  intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident."" Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(2). This  list of permitted uses in Rule 404(b) of other crimes evidence is not exhaustive. United States v. Miller, 895 F.2d  1431, 1435-36, 283 U.S. App. D.C. 9 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (citing United States v. Moore, 732 F.2d 983, 987 n.31, 235  U.S. App. D.C. 381 (D.C. Cir. 1984)). Importantly, ""Rule 404(b) is a rule of inclusion rather than exclusion,"" as it  prohibits only evidence ""which lacks any purpose but proving  [*70]  character."" [**21]  United States v. Bowie, 232  F.3d 923, 929-30, 344 U.S. App. D.C. 34 (D.C. Cir. 2000). In short, the rule operates as a prohibition on pure  propensity evidence that cannot serve any other probative purpose. 538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *68; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **18 Page 21 of 43 HN13[ ] To determine admissibility under Rule 404(b), courts conduct a two-part analysis. Miller, 895 F.2d at  1435. First, a court must consider whether the evidence proffered is ""probative of a material issue other than  character."" United States v. Clarke, 24 F.3d 257, 264, 306 U.S. App. D.C. 251 (D.C. Cir. 1994); Fed. R. Evid.  404(b). Next, if the evidence meets this threshold, the Court examines whether the probative value is ""substantially  outweighed"" by a danger of unfair prejudice such that the Court should exclude admission. Miller, 895 F.2d at 1435  (quoting Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 687, 108 S. Ct. 1496, 99 L. Ed. 2d 771 (1988)); see also Fed.  R. Evid. 403. Evidence is unfairly prejudicial if it prejudices a defendant's case ""for reasons other than its probative  value,"" United States v. Wallace, 124 Fed. Appx. 164, 167 (4th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted), such as by creating ""an  undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis,"" United States v. Gartmon, 146 F.3d 1015, 1021, 331  U.S. App. D.C. 74 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (quoting Old Chief, 519 U.S. at 180). HN14[ ] It must be noted, however, that Rule 404(b) applies only to extrinsic evidence of other crimes or bad acts  and is not required when the admissibility of ""intrinsic"" evidence is at issue. Bowie, 232 F.3d at 929. In this Circuit,  evidence is considered ""intrinsic"" when it is either ""part of the charged offense"" or an uncharged act ""performed  contemporaneously with the charged crime . . . [that] facilitate[s] the commission of the charged crime."" Id; see also  id. at 928-29 (rejecting [**22]  the approach of other Circuits that define intrinsic evidence to encompass any  evidence that ""explains the circumstances"" or ""completes the story"" as an impermissibly low threshold that would  allow for Rule 404(b) to be circumvented on a ""flimsy basis.""). Accordingly, any evidence of the crimes charged in  Mr. Wilkins's superseding indictment or evidence of crimes that occurred contemporaneously and to further the  charged offenses can be considered intrinsic, and is exempt from the Rule 404(b) analysis. See id. at 927  (""Evidence that constitutes the very crime being prosecuted is not [prior bad act evidence].""); see, e.g., United  States v. Alexander, 331 F.3d 116, 126, 356 U.S. App. D.C. 299 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (statement that Defendant ""'[has]  a gun on him now' constituted intrinsic, admissible evidence on [a] felon-in-possession charge"" (alteration in  original)); United States v. Coughlin, 821 F. Supp. 2d 35, 45 (D.D.C. 2011) (determining that evidence of the  defendant's medical and athletic activities constituted intrinsic evidence of the charged offense of making a  fraudulent claim to the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund). However, intrinsic evidence remains  [*71]   subject to a Rule 403 balancing analysis. See Fed. R. Evid. 403. The Government contends that much of the  evidence in dispute here is intrinsic evidence, rendering any Rule 404(b) analysis unnecessary. The Court reviews  each of the Government's [**23]  requested evidentiary admissions in turn. 1. Evidence of Mr. Wilkins's Alleged Acts of Physical and Sexual Violence The Government has moved to enter into evidence several instances of physical and sexual violence Mr. Wilkins  allegedly committed against one of the complainants, J.J. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 13-14. These incidents include (1) a  physical altercation in a hotel room in North Carolina where J.J. was knocked unconscious and woke up in an  Atlanta hospital with permanent injuries; (2) a January 10, 2013, assault that occurred in a Charlottesville, Virginia  hotel that apparently transpired after Mr. Wilkins demanded money from J.J. to pay bills for the mother of his child,  and when he found out that J.J. lied about not having money, he severely beat her; (3) a September 19, 2011,  assault that J.J. reported to the Virginia Beach Police Department that involved Mr. Wilkins forcing her out of a car  he was driving (by a hotel where she was engaging in commercial sex at his behest), after which he hit her in the  stomach, pulled her hair, and stole her purse; (4) a December 19, 2011, assault reported to the Montgomery  County Police that occurred at a Days Inn hotel after [**24]  J.J. told Mr. Wilkins she wanted to return to Norfolk,  Virginia and Mr. Wilkins assaulted her when she tried to leave, stealing her cash and cell phone; and (5) a February  16, 2013, attack that J.J. reported to the Norfolk Police Department, describing that Mr. Wilkins became physically          538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *70; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **21 Page 22 of 43 violent and cut her upper body when she refused to have sexual intercourse with him. Id. at 13-15. The Government  has stated its intent to have both J.J. testify to these incidents and also to call law enforcement to describe and  corroborate these various assaults. Id. at 12, 15. Mr. Wilkins, unsurprisingly, has moved to have this testimony excluded under both Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b)  and Rule 401. See Opp'n to Gov't Mot. in Lim. to Introduce Evid. Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) & 609 (""Def.'s  404(b) Opp'n"") at 8, ECF No. 64. He contends that there is not any connection between this violence—which he  seems to characterize as being of the domestic violence variety—and the charges of sex trafficking that are at issue  in this case. See Hr'g Tr. at 59. Consequently, he claims that this evidence can serve only as impermissible  character propensity evidence, since it is not relevant to the charged crimes, and must be barred due to its highly  prejudicial nature. [**25]  Id. He is particularly concerned about the introduction of testimony relating to the alleged  events of February 16, 2013, as he believes these events can be construed as an attempted rape, and thus would  be highly prejudicial if presented to a jury. Def.'s 404(b) Opp'n at 8-9. The Court, while acknowledging the likely powerful impact of this evidence, finds that Mr. Wilkins's argument  regarding the supposed limited relevance of these assaults to the charged offenses to misunderstand the relevant  law. Mr. Wilkins is charged with two counts of Sex Trafficking by Force, Fraud, or Coercion, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  § 1591(a)(1), among other related charges. See Superseding Indictment at 1. Accordingly, the jury will be tasked  with determining whether Mr. Wilkins used force, fraud, or coercion to cause the three complainants to engage in  commercial sex acts. HN15[ ] Coercion, for the purposes of this offense, is defined as ""(A) threats of serious harm  to or physical restraint against any person; (B) any  [*72]  scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to  believe that failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any person; or (C)  the abuse or threatened abuse of law or the [**26]  legal process."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(2). ""Serious harm"" is further  defined to include both physical and non-physical harm that is ""sufficiently serious, under all the surrounding  circumstances, to compel a reasonable person of the same background and in the same circumstances to perform  or to continue performing commercial sexual activity in order to avoid incurring that harm."" Id. § 1591(e)(5). HN16[ ] Given the realities of the different types of coercion sex trafficking victims are frequently subjected to,  courts have recognized that traffickers often force victims ""to continue prostituting by creating an environment of  fear and dependence through the use of threats of violence, actual violence, and various forms of manipulation  against them."" United States v. Scott, 434 F. App'x 103, 106 (3d Cir. 2011). When evaluating if a defendant exerted  coercive force over a complainant, juries are thus directed to evaluate the totality of a defendant's conduct toward a  trafficking victim, including any threats or specific instances of past violence that may have created a ""culture of  fear"" such that the victim's conduct was rendered involuntary. See, e.g., United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d 584, 600  (7th Cir. 2017) (finding that evidence of a defendant's rape of a sex trafficking victim was ""direct evidence of [the  defendant] coercing one of his victims [**27]  and exerting control over her. . . . [I]t [wa]s a key part of the message  from the defendant that 'I control you and can do as I please'""); United States v. Webster, No. 08-cv 30311, 2011  U.S. App. LEXIS 26438, 2011 WL 8478276, at *2 (9th Cir. Nov. 28, 2011) (finding that ""severe beatings"" were used  to create ""an environment of fear of physical harm"" that was ""more than sufficient"" to conclude the defendant  exercised coercion over sex trafficking victims for the purpose of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(2)(B)). Indeed, such a culture  of fear and coercion can be created even in the absence of a defendant's abuse of a specific victim, when the victim  is made aware of the defendant's history of physical or sexual violence against others. See United States v. Harris,  701 F.2d 1095, 1100 (4th Cir. 1983) (evidence that defendant beat other people—though not the victim—was  relevant because it contributed to a ""reign of physical terror""); United States v. Alzanki, 54 F.3d 994, 999 (1st Cir.  1995) (noting, in describing the facts, that ""[t]he climate of fear was enhanced"" due to the victim witnessing her  employer physically abusing his wife); Webster, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 26438, 2011 WL 8478276 at *2 (explaining  that defendant cultivated an environment of fear by ""severe beatings that [he] administered, which he had the other  women and girls attend and observe"" and ""naturally cause[d] the observers to infer that similar violence might be  inflicted on them if they disobeyed any of [his] rules.""). The Court can therefore [**28]  quickly dispose of Mr. Wilkins's argument that these violent episodes are somehow  irrelevant to the pending charges in this case. Indeed, several courts have considered this exact issue. In United  States v. Evans, a defendant also facing sex trafficking charges argued that the violent physical assaults he inflicted  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *71; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **24 Page 23 of 43 on his trafficking victims were not evidence of forced sex work but rather completely separate evidence of ""domestic  violence"" in their personal intimate relationship. 272 F.3d 1069, 1097 (8th Cir. 2001). The court summarily rejected  this argument, concluding that, ""these violent acts are relevant and probative of Mann Act violations because they  describe actions taken to control and discipline"" the women he sexually exploited and happened to also have  personal relationships with.  [*73]  Id; see also United States v. Nichols, No. 15-cr-756-1, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  15081, 2019 WL 398775, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 31, 2019) (rejecting defendant's argument that physical abuse ""was  related to personal matters, not [his prostitution] business.""). Accordingly, the Court finds that these past assaults constitute direct, intrinsic evidence of coercion that Mr. Wilkins  used to cause the complainants to engage in commercial sex acts. This violence is thus ""part of the charged  offense,"" Bowie, 232 F.3d at 929, and exempt from Rule 404(b). See, e.g., Carson, 870 F.3d at 600 (determining  that a past rape [**29]  of sex trafficking victim was not bad act evidence, but ""evidence of the very crime [of sex  trafficking by fraud, coercion, or force], pure and simple""); United States v. Washington, 810 Fed. Appx. 478, 481  (8th Cir. 2020) (finding that evidence of domestic assault of sex trafficking victim was directly relevant to the  question of whether the victim's conduct was voluntary or whether coercion or force was used, and thus properly  admitted as intrinsic evidence regarding a sex trafficking charge); Campbell, 764 F.3d at 888 (finding that evidence  of a ""pattern intended to cause a person to believe that failure to perform an act [of prostitution] would result in  serious harm"" to be intrinsic, direct evidence of coercion under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(2)(B) (alteration in original)). This evidence also passes the Rule 403 balancing test. For the reasons described above, this evidence is highly  probative as to the question of whether Mr. Wilkins used ""force, fraud, or coercion"" to get the complainants to  engage in sex work. While there is prejudice inherent in this evidence, it is only that which stems from the legitimate  probative force of the evidence and is directly related to the central question in this case. See Wallace, 124 Fed.  Appx. at 167. Thus, the probative value of this evidence is far from ""substantially outweighed"" by any unfair  prejudice. [**30]  The Court will accordingly allow J.J. to testify regarding these acts of physical violence, to help the  jury understand why she and the other complainants may have felt coerced into engaging in sex work at Mr.  Wilkins's insistence. The Court will also allow the introduction of corroborating testimony from law enforcement to  the extent it is necessary to support J.J.'s credibility. 2. Evidence of Mr. Wilkins's Access to Firearms The Government has also moved to introduce evidence that demonstrates that during the time of the charged  offenses, Mr. Wilkins had ready access to firearms. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 3. It seeks to accomplish this by  introducing testimony from both responding law enforcement and a complainant who witnessed a June 12, 2019  incident in Norfolk, Virginia, where Mr. Wilkins allegedly shot himself in the groin. Id. Mr. Wilkins opposes this  admission, arguing that this testimony is inadmissible under both Rule 402 and Rule 404(b), and furthermore, that  any argument the gunshot wound he suffered was ""self-inflicted"" is speculative. Def.'s 404(b) Opp'n at 4. The  Government responds by positing that evidence of Mr. Wilkins's gun possession is intrinsic to the charged crimes,  due to its theory [**31]  that the complainants engaged in commercial sex acts at  [*74]  Mr. Wilkins behest due to a  fear of him that was driven, in part, by his ready access to deadly firearms. See Gov't Reply to Def.'s Opp'n to  Introduce Evid. Pursuant FRE 404(b) & 609 (""Gov't 404(b) Reply"") at 3-4, ECF No. 66. The Court agrees that evidence of gun possession in this case is intrinsic evidence because it is ""part of the  charged offense."" Bowie, 232 F.3d at 929. This is because, mirroring in many ways the analysis this Court has  already conducted regarding Mr. Wilkins's past physical assaults of the complainants, evidence of Mr. Wilkins's  access to firearms constitutes a source of his potential coercion over the complainants. HN17[ ] The Government  must prove at trial that Mr. Wilkins used force, fraud or coercion to cause the three complainants to engage in  commercial sex acts and, as previously detailed, coercion includes ""any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause  a person to believe that failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any      538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *72; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **28 Page 24 of 43 person."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(2). Firearms are potentially deadly weapons. Evidence regarding Mr. Wilkins's access  to guns, therefore, goes directly to a possible coercive scheme he used to accomplish [**32]  a key element of the  charged offenses. Other courts have reached similar conclusions and allowed for the admission of evidence  demonstrating that sex trafficking victims were aware that the defendant owned or had access to firearms. See,  e.g., United States v. Lewis, 762 F. App'x 786, 798 (11th Cir.) (per curiam) (affirming district court's admission of  undated photograph of defendant holding a firearm, as it ""tended to corroborate [complainant's] testimony"" that she  was coerced into engaging in prostitution due to the defendant's habitual use of firearms) cert. granted, judgment  vacated on other grounds, 140 S. Ct. 613, 205 L. Ed. 2d 380 (2019); Nichols, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, 2019  WL 398775 at *12 (sustaining sex trafficking conviction based in part on victims' testimony that ""they knew [the  defendant] to own and carry guns"" thus contributing to coercive environment that caused complainants to engage in  sex work); United States v. Roach, 896 F.3d 1185, 1196 (10th Cir. 2018) (finding evidence that defendant  threatened victim with gun in lap ""showed that [he] used violence to coerce [a victim-witness] into prostitution""). Turning to the Rule 403 analysis, the Court finds that allowing the admission of testimony describing the entirety of  the June 12, 2019 incident does, however, pose a substantial risk of confusion of the issues such that even the  strong probative value of this evidence could be [**33]  substantially outweighed. See Fed. R. Evid. 403. In  particular, the evidence related to the specifics of Mr. Wilkins's injury—i.e., whether the injury was self-inflicted—  poses a heightened risk of unfair prejudice or confusion of the issues because it is unclear what exactly transpired,  and this lack of clarity could allow the jury to make improper and unnecessary inferences or simply generate  confusion. Furthermore, this issue is utterly tangential to the core issues before the Court in this case, and  admission of this fact risks allowing the trial to devolve into a mini-trial on the question of if Mr. Wilkins shot  himself—a question that is completely irrelevant to the case at hand. Indeed, even the Government admitted to   [*75]  the Court at the motions hearing that the question of who shot Mr. Wilkins (or if the wound was self- inflicted)  is ""not the issue here."" Hr'g Tr. at 50. Given that both parties appear to agree, the Court holds that only evidence of  Mr. Wilkins's gun possession or access as illustrated by the June 12, 2019 incident is admissible. The complainants  remain free to testify regarding their personal knowledge of Mr. Wilkins's gun access or possession to the extent it  informed their decisions [**34]  to engage in sex work at his command, and corroborating testimony from law  enforcement describing the June 12, 2019 incident is admissible as long as it stays within the parameters described  here. 3. Evidence of Mr. Wilkins's Access to and Distribution of Illegal Drugs The Government has also stated its intent to ""elicit evidence, corroborated by [Mr. Wilkins's] criminal record, that  [he] had access to, possessed, and distributed illicit narcotics throughout the period of time charged in the  Indictment."" Gov't 404(b) Reply at 10. Mr. Wilkins objects to this testimony, contending that this line of evidence is  not relevant to any issue other than his character and accordingly must be excluded. Def.'s 404(b) Opp'n at 6-7.  The Government argues in response that, as with gun possession and Mr. Wilkins's past assaults, this evidence is  intrinsic to the charged sex trafficking offenses such that Rule 404(b) does not apply. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 10-11.  The Court agrees in theory, though in light of the apparently limited relevance of the evidence and high risk of unfair  prejudice, the Court will impose significant restrictions on the admission of this category of evidence. In many ways this line of evidence [**35]  repeats the same analysis conducted regarding the evidence of Mr.  Wilkins's firearm use and alleged past assaults on the complainants. In sum, to the extent evidence of Mr. Wilkins's  access and provision of illegal narcotics to the complainants facilitated his ""coercive control"" over them, this  evidence would become part of the charged offense itself. See Bowie, 232 F.3d at 927 (""Evidence that constitutes  the very crime being prosecuted is not [prior bad act evidence]""). HN18[ ] Where sex trafficking victims had been  supplied drugs, evidence of a defendant's access to illegal narcotics has been found appropriately admissible for  this purpose. See, e.g., United States v. Campbell, 49 F.3d 1079, 1084 (5th Cir. 1995) (finding evidence of drugs  provided to complainants by defendant while defendant allegedly transported complainants involved in prostitution      538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *74; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **31 Page 25 of 43 to be ""relevant intrinsic evidence of how the actual violation occurred""); United States v. Betts, 911 F.3d 523, 530  (8th Cir. 2018) (finding evidence that defendants provided victim-complainants various drugs and alcohol intrinsic  evidence of how defendants ""controlled the girls' behavior""). Accordingly, evidence of Mr. Wilkins's provision of  illegal narcotics to the complainants would be properly admitted here as intrinsic evidence of any coercive force  used to compel the sex [**36]  trafficking crimes at issue. However, the admission of this evidence runs into trouble at the Rule 403 balancing stage, when the Court turns to  ""assess the probative value of the evidence as compared to the risk of unfair prejudice."" United States v.  Hitselberger, 991 F. Supp. 2d 108, 127 (D.D.C. 2014) (cleaned up) (quoting United States v. Larrahondo, 885 F.  Supp. 2d 209, 227 (D.D.C. 2012). First, admission of the entirety of the evidence the Government seeks to enter  into evidence contains content of marginal probative value. Simply because Mr. Wilkins has prior drug offense  arrests and convictions does not mean he was providing illegal narcotics to the complainants. Underlining  [*76]   the point, the Government has not made clear that any of the three complainants will testify that Mr. Wilkins  provided them with illegal drugs while they engaged in commercial sex work for his benefit. Further diminishing any  probative value of this evidence, at the motions hearing the Government conceded that while they intend to enter  into evidence Mr. Wilkins's felony conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine, this is not one of the  narcotics the three complainants are alleged to have used. Rather, one of the complainants had an underlying  heroin addiction, and the Government alleges that generally all the complainants used substances [**37]  such as  ""molly"" and marijuana to engage in commercial sexual activity. See Hr'g Tr. at 49. This discrepancy is telling, and  quite clearly diminishes the probative value of any admission of evidence of Mr. Wilkins's access to or distribution of  otherwise unrelated drugs. Against this limited probative value, the admission of evidence describing Mr. Wilkins's past drug-related offenses  presents a substantial risk of unfair prejudice. HN19[ ] The risk of unfair prejudice is high when it comes to  evidence of past convictions. See, e.g., United States v. Watson, 171 F.3d 695, 703, 335 U.S. App. D.C. 232 (D.C.  Cir. 1999) (evidence of past drug convictions ""invites the jury to infer that [a defendant] has a propensity for drug  offenses.""). The Court is concerned that the jury could infer culpability based on this evidence, and not the charges  actually at issue in this case. See, e.g., United States v. Ring, 706 F.3d 460, 472, 403 U.S. App. D.C. 410 (D.C. Cir.  2013) (noting evidence is unfairly prejudicial when it has ""an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper  basis""). In the absence of a stronger, relevant connection between the drugs Mr. Wilkins is alleged to have  previously trafficked in and those provided to the three complainants, the Court finds this evidence's probative value  is substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. To address [**38]  these concerns the Court will allow the admission of evidence that relates to Mr. Wilkins's use of  illegal drugs as a coercive tactic to force the complainants to engage in sex work for his benefit. This means the  complainants will be able to testify and describe any provision of illegal narcotics Mr. Wilkins provided them. See,  e.g., United States v. Lewis, No. 415-cr-196, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27236, 2017 WL 750456, at *4 (S.D. Ga. Feb.  27, 2017) (finding that testimony from alleged victims that defendant provided them ""with drugs to enable them to  engage in commercial sexual activity"" was admissible evidence). To the extent Mr. Wilkins has prior law  enforcement interactions that demonstrate his possession of those specific drugs, that evidence is admissible to  corroborate the veracity of the complainants' accounts. But any evidence of Mr. Wilkins's use or access to drugs he  is not alleged to have provided to the complainants—which the Court understands to encompass the majority of the  drug-related prior ""bad acts"" the Government currently seeks to enter into evidence—must be excluded as the risk  of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs any probative value this evidence can provide. 4. Unnamed Witness Testimony The Government has also moved to introduce testimony from an unnamed male witness [**39]  who will present  testimony regarding how Mr. Wilkins began to engage in the commercial sexual exploitation of women in 2011 or  2012, and went on to transport the three complainants to Washington D.C. from Norfolk, Virginia to engage in sex  work. Gov't Mot. 404(b) at 11-12. He also is prepared to testify that he knew Mr. Wilkins assaulted one of the  complainants  [*77]  when she ""got out of line"" and Mr. Wilkins ""had to correct her."" Id. at 12. 538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *75; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **35 Page 26 of 43 The Court begins by noting that it is generally unclear if the Government still intends to introduce this evidence. At  the time of the original briefing on this issue, the indictment had not yet been superseded, so the testimony of this  unnamed witness was to be admitted to discuss ""the defendant's commercial sexual exploitation of women other  than the victims who serve as the basis for the counts charged in the current Indictment."" Id. But the Superseded  Indictment now presumably includes these women as named complainants. At the motions hearing Mr. Wilkins's  counsel objected to the admission of this testimony to the extent it may be hearsay or that this unnamed witness  may not be competent to testify to these issues. Without more information, the Court [**40]  is not prepared to  make a ruling on this issue today but instead directs the Government to clarify its position as to the current status of  this witness and the content and basis for any testimony he may provide. 5. Mr. Wilkins's Prior Contacts with Law Enforcement The Government also seeks to introduce into evidence a number of specific incidents of Mr. Wilkins's prior contacts  with law enforcement that it argues are ""indicative of commercial sexual exploitation."" Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 7  (capitalization omitted). The proposed evidence includes five separate interactions between law enforcement and  Mr. Wilkins that occurred on December 10, 2011, January 25, 2015, June 18, 2018, August 3, 2019, and  September 12, 2019, all of which fall within the time period he is charged with the offenses in the Superseding  Indictment. See id. at 7-10. Mr. Wilkins opposes the introduction of this evidence on a variety of different grounds,  but he generally alleges that these interactions are relevant only to show bad character, and thus violate Rule  404(b). Def.'s 404(b) Opp'n at 5-6. In response, the Government contends that the evidence is intrinsic to the  charged offenses such that Rule 404(b) does not apply. Gov't [**41]  Reply at 6-7. They also argue that even if this  evidence is found to be extrinsic, under a Rule 404(b) analysis these interactions are still admissible as highly  probative evidence of Mr. Wilkins's intent and motive to engage in sexual exploitation, as well as his knowledge of  ""what was happening inside the hotels where he was frequently arrested."" Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 18. The Court  reviews each interaction in turn. a. December 10, 2011 Interaction On December 10, 2011, during the time period covered by Count I of the Superseding Indictment when Mr. Wilkins  was allegedly sex trafficking complainant J.J. in Washington D.C., Mr. Wilkins was arrested in the District for  possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 7. The Government intends to offer law  enforcement testimony that, prior to Mr. Wilkins's arrest, police officers observed him speak with two women who  were engaged in commercial sex work at the corner of 16th Street and New York Avenue, before he parked his  Cadillac with Virginia tag XEJ4403 in the parking lot of the Comfort Inn located at 1601 New York  [*78]  Avenue,  Northeast, Washington D.C. Id. at 8. A search of the vehicle Mr. Wilkins was driving by law enforcement  revealed [**42]  cocaine in the driver's side door panel. Id. The Government argues that this information is intrinsic, rather than extrinsic, evidence of the charged offenses.  Gov't 404(b) Reply at 6-7. HN20[ ] As has already been noted, evidence can properly be considered intrinsic in  this Circuit if it is either an act the defendant is charged with, or if it occurred contemporaneously with the charged  offenses. See Bowie, 232 F. 3d at 927 (""Evidence that constitutes the very crime being prosecuted is not [prior bad  act evidence]""). Mr. Wilkins is charged with trafficking J.J. during the time of this police encounter. Indeed, the  Government appears to contend that at the time of this arrest J.J. was working in the hotel while Mr. Wilkins waited  outside. See Gov't 404(b) Reply at 8. As a result, location and proximity evidence—namely, that Mr. Wilkins was  found waiting in the parking lot of a hotel known for ongoing prostitution activity while the woman he is alleged to  have trafficked was inside engaging in commercial sex work for his financial gain—appears to be ""part of the  charged offense"" of sex trafficking J.J., or at the very least evidence of ""acts performed contemporaneously with the      538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *77; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **39 Page 27 of 43 charged crime . . . [that] facilitate [**43]  the commission of the charged crime."" Bowie, 232 F.3d at 929. The Court  therefore agrees that information pertaining to Mr. Wilkins's whereabouts during his December 10, 2011 arrest  constitute intrinsic evidence and are exempt from Rule 404(b). See id. This is not, however, the end of the Court's review, as intrinsic evidence must still pass the requisite Rule 403  balancing test in order to be admitted at trial. HN21[ ] Rule 403 provides that a court ""may exclude relevant  evidence if [that evidence's] probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following:  unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting  cumulative evidence."" Fed. R. Evid. 403. After completing the balancing test, the Court concludes that the probative  value of admitting this encounter with law enforcement as evidence of Mr. Wilkins's physical location is not  substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, because it is only prejudicial for reasons related to its  probative value. See Wallace, 124 Fed. Appx. at 167 (noting that ""[u]nfair prejudice under Rule 403 does not mean  the damage to a defendant's case that results from the legitimate probative force of the evidence"" quoting Jack B.  Weinstein & Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 404.21(3)(b) [**44]  (Joseph M. McLaughlin, ed.,  2d. ed. 2002)); Fed. R. Evid. 403. And bad acts evidence is typically ""not barred by Rule 403 where such evidence  'did not involve conduct any more sensational or disturbing than the crimes with which [the defendant] was  charged.'"" United States v. Fuertes, 805 F.3d 485, 494 (4th Cir. 2015) (alteration in original) (citation omitted). That  said, admission of the specific details of Mr. Wilkins's arrest beyond his locational information could pose unfair  prejudice. The Court is particularly concerned that allowing in evidence of the cocaine found in Mr. Wilkins's car  would be unduly prejudicial, as it poses the risk of ""lur[ing] the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different  from proof specific to the offense charged."" Old Chief, 519 U.S. at 180. Mr. Wilkins is not charged with drug  offenses in this case, nor does the Government contend that any of the complainants were addicted to cocaine and  he used this dependency to maintain his climate of coercion over them. See Hr'g Tr. at 49; see also supra Section  III.L.3. This piece of evidence is therefore of limited probative value and is substantially out weighed [*79]  by the  risk of prejudice. Accordingly, the Court will limit the admission of testimony from the December 11, 2011 police  interaction to exclude any reference to the drugs found in his car. b. January 25, 2015 Interaction On January 25, 2015, Mr. Wilkins was arrested in yet another hotel parking lot—this time for trespass in the parking  lot of a Red Roof Inn in Virginia Beach— when law enforcement found him sleeping in his car. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at  8. Prior to arrest, Mr. Wilkins was observed deleting information off his phone and putting something into his mouth  as the officers approached. Id. The Government intends to introduce evidence that two of the complainants were  inside a hotel engaging in commercial sex acts while Mr. Wilkins sat outside in a car. Gov't 404(b) Reply at 5-6. The  Government contends that this evidence is also intrinsic to the crimes charged in the Superseding Indictment. Id. at  6-7. The Court agrees, and for the reasons detailed below will allow this evidence to be admitted, subject to certain  limitations. The Court again finds that the evidence that Mr. Wilkins was outside of a hotel—this time allegedly while two of the  complainants engaged in commercial sex inside with clients for his financial benefit— is not an ""other crime"" but  rather ""direct evidence of the fact in issue."" [**45]  Bowie, 232 F.3d at 929 (quoting United States v. Badru, 97 F.3d  1471, 1474-75, 321 U.S. App. D.C. 137 (D.C. Cir. 1996)). The main fact in issue in this case is whether Mr. Wilkins  trafficked the complainants as he is charged. See generally Superseding Indictment. Consequently, Mr. Wilkins's  location is offered as intrinsic evidence of the charged offenses themselves.         538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *78; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **42 Page 28 of 43 Having determined that this evidence can properly be considered intrinsic, the Court turns next to the Rule 403  balancing test. Fed. R. Evid. 403. The Court is again concerned that the probative value of this evidence—which as  articulated by the Government is focused primarily on the locational and proximity evidence it provides— is  substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair propensity prejudice that would accrue if the entirety of this  interaction was entered into evidence. As Mr. Wilkins articulates, ""it is a stretch to argue that the acts of 'deleting  information off of his phone' and 'putting something in his mouth' would qualify as. . . relevant to . . . the allegations  made in this case."" Def.'s 404(b) Opp'n at 5. And while of limited relevance, this information could confuse the jury  or allow them to make an improper inference about his behavior. In short, there is a very real risk it would lead to  unfair speculation and innuendo. This danger [**46]  can be appropriately mitigated by limiting the admission of this  police encounter to focus on Mr. Wilkins's location and proximity to the hotel at the time of this police interaction,  while barring any testimony describing how he allegedly placed something in his mouth while sitting in the car or  deleted information off his phone.  [*80]  c. August 3, 2019 Interaction The Government next seeks to admit evidence stemming from an encounter between Mr. Wilkins and an  undercover MPD officer that occurred on August 3, 2019. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 8-10. The officer in question was, at  the time, working undercover as a sex worker, and Mr. Wilkins approached her to purchase sex. Id. at 9. She asked  him to come back shortly and observed him circling the block in a green van for roughly 10-15 minutes. Id. When he  returned, he informed her he was a pimp, and asked her who she worked for and why she was out ""on his block.""  Id. Mr. Wilkins apparently became agitated and ""got in the undercover officer's face"" before walking away. Id.  Shortly thereafter, he approached her for a second time, asked why she was ""giving money away,"" and then tried to  grab her fanny pack. Id. He also chest bumped her after she requested [**47]  that he not touch her and invited her  into his green van to talk. Id. The undercover officer refused, and ultimately left the area. Id. at 9-10. The  Government intends to introduce testimony from this undercover member of the MPD's Human Trafficking Unit in its  case-in-chief. Id. at 10. The Court will again begin by first determining if this evidence can be considered ""intrinsic"" to the charged crimes.  The Government argues it is, because it arises out of the same series of transactions as the charged offense, is  necessary to complete the story, and is inextricably intertwined with evidence regarding the charged offense. Gov't  404(b) Reply at 5-6 (citing United States v. Troya, 733 F.3d 1125, 1131 (11th Cir. 2013)). But as this Court has  already noted, this is not the standard this Circuit uses to define intrinsic evidence—evidence that ""completes the  story"" or ""arises from the same general transactions"" is not enough to qualify the evidence as intrinsic. Bowie, 232  F.3d at 929 (""As we have said, all relevant prosecution evidence explains the crime or completes the story. The fact  that omitting some evidence would render a story slightly less complete cannot justify circumventing Rule 404(b)  altogether.""). HN23[ ] Under Bowie, intrinsic evidence is strictly limited to evidence that [**48]  is either (1) part of  the charged offense itself or (2) an uncharged act performed contemporaneously and to facilitate the charged  crime. Id. The Court lacks necessary information at this time to be able to determine if this interaction can properly  be classified as intrinsic evidence. As Mr. Wilkins notes, ""[t]here is no allegation that this interaction involved any of  the complaining witnesses involved in this indictment, or that they were even on the scene—and no allegation that  this encounter took place on a day when any offense charged in the indictment occurred."" Def.'s 404(b) Opp'n. at 6.  It is therefore unclear if this interaction was somehow part of the charged offenses or ""performed  contemporaneously"" to further any of the charged sex trafficking acts. See Bowie, 232 F.3d at 929. However, the Court need not decisively resolve this issue today. That is because this evidence is clearly admissible  under Rule 404(b) as evidence of intent, knowledge, and lack of mistake. See Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(2). The  Government bears the burden in this case of proving that Mr. Wilkins knew that force, fraud or coercion was used to  cause the three complainants to engage in commercial sex work, and that the other offenses were knowingly  committed. [**49]  The undercover officer's testimony about the events of August 3, 2019—that Mr. Wilkins  attempted to both set up a commercial sex date with her and recruit her, that he referred to himself as a ""pimp,"" and  that he was in the vicinity of the ""Track"" driving a vehicle later linked to the transportation of one of the  complainants—constitutes  [*81]  highly probative evidence on this question of Mr. Wilkins knowledge and intent  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *79; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **45 Page 29 of 43 regarding the crimes that he is charged with. The evidence also serves to undercut any claim of accident or  mistake. This evidence is probative on several material issues other than character, and consequently meets the  first prong of the Rule 404(b) test. Turning to the second prong of the Rule 404(b) analysis, the Court finds that this testimony easily survives the Rule  403 balancing test, as the probative value (as described above) far outweighs any unfair prejudice. Indeed, nothing  about this evidence appears unfairly prejudicial in the sense it would cause a jury to make an improper inference— the only negative inferences arise from legitimate inferences a factfinder could draw from this evidence. See  Wallace, 124 Fed. Appx. at 167. Accordingly, this interaction may be admitted into evidence in full. 6. Additional Police Interactions [**50]  In addition to these three incidents that Mr. Wilkins specifically opposed the admission of in his opposition, Mr.  Wilkins contends that all evidence of any other police encounters must be excluded as unfairly prejudicial under  Rule 403. Def.'s 404(b) Opp'n at 8. The other three incidents the Government seeks to enter into evidence occurred  on November 10, 2015, June 18, 2018, and September 10, 2019. The Court finds that two of these incidents very clearly constitute intrinsic evidence. First, on November 10, 2015,  Mr. Wilkins was arrested for Possession with Intent to Distribute Cocaine. Gov't 404(b) Reply at 6. The Government  has moved to introduce testimony from law enforcement officials who will state that they were called to a hotel  located in Chesapeake, Virginia, where they observed a silver Cadillac parked outside. Id. When they approached  the car, they smelled marijuana, and found additional narcotics inside both the Cadillac and Mr. Wilkins's rectum. Id.  The police also spoke with O.R., one of the complainants in this case who was present at the scene. Id. Mr. Wilkins  told the police at the time that he was at the hotel with O.R., who he referred to as his girlfriend, because  their [**51]  home was being fumigated. Id. On September 12, 2019, an undercover member of the MPD's Human Trafficking Unit observed one of the  complainants being dropped off at a hotel in the District by a green van—the same vehicle that she recognized from  when Mr. Wilkins had previously confronted her on the Track. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 10. The complainant was  subsequently arrested for ""Solicitation of Prostitution"" and went on to admit that she had been dropped off by her  ""pimp,"" who went by ""Lucky."" Id. at 10-11. Law enforcement found the vehicle in question, which was driven by Mr.  Wilkins, who agreed to a search of the vehicle. Id. at 11. The search turned up several purses, a bulk package of  Trojan condoms and various items of women's clothing. Id. Mr. Wilkins was not arrested, but the Government now  seeks to introduce testimony from the complainant and law enforcement officers describing the incident. Both incidents constitute direct evidence of whether Mr. Wilkins trafficked and transported the complainants as he is  charged and are accordingly intrinsic evidence. In seeming recognition of this fact, Mr. Wilkins does not dispute this  point and instead argues that all evidence of any other [**52]  police encounters must be excluded as unfairly  prejudicial under Federal Rule 403. Def.'s 404(b) Opp'n at 8. The Court is again primarily concerned about  prejudice stemming from the introduction of information regarding Mr. Wilkins's drug possession during the  November 10,  [*82]  2015 incident. As already discussed at length, see supra Section III.L.3, this evidence of Mr.  Wilkins's drug possession is of limited probative value given that it is not a drug he stands accused of providing to  the complainants, and the introduction of this fact carries a substantial risk of unfair prejudice. As a result, the Court  will again exclude any testimony from the November 10, 2015 incident as it relates to the cocaine found on Mr.  Wilkins's person. In contrast, the other information conveyed by testimony describing these two encounters is  closely related to the charged offenses and conveys limited prejudice outside the offenses themselves. HN24[ ] In  a Rule 403 analysis, ""it is a sound rule that the balance should generally be struck in favor of admission when the  evidence indicates a close relationship to the offense charged."" United States v. Day, 591 F.2d 861, 878, 192 U.S.  App. D.C. 252 (D.C. Cir. 1978). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the introduction of testimony discussing both  police interactions [**53]  are admissible, pursuant to the limitations outlined above. The final prior contact with law enforcement that the Government seeks to introduce at trial is less clearly intrinsic  evidence, but the Court finds it meets the necessary requirements for admittance under Rule 404(b). On June 18,  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *81; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **49 Page 30 of 43 2018, Mr. Wilkins was arrested in the District after being found operating a vehicle without a permit. Gov't 404(b)  Mot. at 8. Prior to his arrest, MPD officers observed Mr. Wilkins driving his vehicle around the ""Track"" and speaking  with various women known to be engaging in commercial sex work—testimony the Government now seeks to enter  into evidence. Id. This incident has many similarities to the August 3, 2019 police encounter already analyzed by  the Court above, and the Court again concludes that this testimony constitutes highly probative evidence on the  central question of Mr. Wilkins's knowledge and intent regarding the charged crimes, and can be used to refute any  allegation of accident or mistake—meaning it is a permitted use of other crimes evidence under Rule 404(b). It also  handily meets the Rule 403 balancing test. The Court does not think there will be substantial prejudice that accrues  to Mr. Wilkins from the jury [**54]  learning that he was driving in the District without a permit, and any other  prejudice caused by this testimony derives from the charged crime itself. Accordingly, this testimony can be  introduced in full. 7. Admissibility of Defendant's Prior Related Convictions The Government has moved to introduce a certified copy of Mr. Wilkins's past criminal convictions along with  accompanying law enforcement testimony including: • January 11, 2013 Conviction for Assault and Battery of a Family Member from Charlottesville Juvenile and  Domestic Relations Court; • January 22, 2015 Conviction of Possession of Marijuana from Virginia Beach Circuit Court; • November 10, 2015 Conviction for Possession with Intent to Distribute Cocaine, from Chesapeake Circuit  Court. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 17. The Government intends to introduce these three convictions both in its case-in-chief and as impeachment  evidence pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 609. Id. at 20. Mr. Wilkins argues that these three prior convictions  must be excluded as irrelevant, as they do not make the current charges more likely than they would be without  such evidence. Def.'s 404(b) Opp'n at 6-7.  [*83]  a. Introduction of Mr. Wilkins's Prior Convictions in the Government's Case-in-Chief [**55]  The Government has provided notice that it intends to introduce Mr. Wilkins's three previous convictions into  evidence in its case-in-chief. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 17-18. The Court will first address the two drug-related  convictions before turning to Mr. Wilkins's past assault conviction. Beginning with Mr. Wilkins's two drug offenses, one for marijuana possession and the other for possession of  cocaine with the intent to distribute, the Government appears to seek admission of this evidence under two  theories. It originally seemed to claim that this evidence fits into a non-specified Rule 404(b) category of relevant,  non-propensity evidence, id. at 17, before arguing for admission under an intrinsic evidence theory, Gov't 404(b)  Reply at 6. Based on the evidence currently before the Court, it is not inclined to allow the admission of Mr.  Wilkins's two previous drug-related convictions under either theory of admission at this time. The Court has already discussed the November 10, 2015 arrest in detail. See supra Section III.L.6. In short, the  Court concluded that testimony regarding Mr. Wilkins's proximity to a hotel with one of the complainants at the time  of his arrest constitutes direct evidence [**56]  of whether Mr. Wilkins trafficked and transported the complainants  as he is charged. However, the Court barred the introduction of testimony regarding the cocaine in Mr. Wilkins's  possession, as it found this evidence to be of limited probative value given that it is not a drug he stands accused of  providing to the complainants, and the introduction of this fact carries a substantial risk of unfair prejudice. Id. For  the same reasons the Court will bar the admission of the certified copy of Mr. Wilkins's conviction for this offense. Mr. Wilkins's January 22, 2015 Conviction of Possession of Marijuana proves a slightly more complicated scenario.  At the motions hearing, the Government represented that the complainants used marijuana, among other drugs, in  order to perform commercial sex work. Hr'g Tr. at 49. However, it has not been made clear to the Court that the  Government will argue that it was Mr. Wilkins who provided the complainants with the marijuana they used. This  fact is needed before the Court can properly reach a determination as to if this conviction constitutes intrinsic or  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *82; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **53 Page 31 of 43 Rule 404(b) evidence. This Court has already discussed in depth the way in which evidence of Mr. Wilkins's  drug [**57]  possession and access, to the extent it provides evidence of specific drugs he provided to the  complainants to coerce them to perform sex work for his benefit, can appropriately be considered ""part of the  charged offense."" See supra Section III.L.3. But before that conclusion can be reached, the complainants in this  case must testify that Mr. Wilkins actually provided them with marijuana for this purpose. If this occurs, the Court  believes this conviction would indeed constitute intrinsic evidence, and under Rule 403 the probative value of  evidence that Mr. Wilkins had access to certain drugs he provided to the complainants as the method of coercive  control would not be substantively outweighed by any danger of undue prejudice. Turning next to Mr. Wilkins's conviction for Assault and Battery of a Family Member, the Court begins by noting that  the Government did not specify the underlying offense for this conviction in its Rule 404(b) briefs. However, the  Government clarified the context of this offense in its Motion for a Order Prohibiting Contact with Victims and  Witnesses, ECF No. 71, confirming that this conviction relates to the previously described January 10, 2013  [*84]   altercation between J.J. and Mr. [**58]  Wilkins where he punched her several times, pushed her into various hotel  furniture, and stomped on her leg following a dispute over money. Id. at 7. Mr. Wilkins went on to plead guilty to the  charge of Assault on a Family Member for these acts. Id. at 8. The Court will allow the admission of this conviction in the Government's case-in-chief at trial. The Court has  already analyzed the events underlying this conviction, see supra Section III.L.1, and concluded that this evidence  of physical violence directed at J.J. by Mr. Wilkins constitutes intrinsic evidence of the coercion that Mr. Wilkins  used in order to persuade J.J. to engage in sex work for his benefit, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). It is thus  ""part of the charged offense,"" Bowie, 232 F.3d at 929, and exempt from Rule 404(b). This same analysis applies to  the admission of Mr. Wilkins's conviction for this assault. And the conviction's probative value is not substantially  outweighed by any unfair prejudice, meaning its admission is allowed under Rule 403. This evidence is highly  probative as to the crucial issue of whether Mr. Wilkins engaged in sex trafficking by coercion, as he is charged.  While there is of course a risk, as with the introduction of any past convictions, that [**59]  a jury could infer  culpability on the basis of this conduct instead of the offenses charged, the Court finds that this risk does not  outweigh—much less substantially outweigh—the very strong probative force of this evidence. See United States v.  Douglas, 482 F.3d 591, 601, 375 U.S. App. D.C. 499 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (noting that evidence of a previous arrest  ""almost unavoidably raises the danger that the jury will improperly conclude that because [the defendant] committed  some other crime, he must have committed the one charged"" but explaining that, without some ""compelling or  unique evidence of prejudice"" this danger alone ""cannot give rise to a per se rule of exclusion."" (internal quotation  marks and citations omitted)). Mr. Wilkins's conviction for Assault on a Family Member can accordingly be admitted. b. Evidence of Mr. Wilkins's Prior Convictions for Impeachment Purposes The Government has also stated its intent to introduce Mr. Wilkins's three prior convictions (listed above) along with  his January 11, 2003 conviction for Assault and Battery of a Law Enforcement Officer as impeachment evidence  regarding his character for truthfulness, should he choose to testify at trial. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 20. As explained  below, the Court will bar the introduction of all three [**60]  of Mr. Wilkins's prior convictions for the purposes of  impeachment. HN25[ ] Rule 609 governs the admission of prior felony convictions for the purposes of impeachment. Fed. R.  Evid. 609. In a criminal case in which the witness is a defendant, evidence of a previous felony conviction that  occurred within the past 10 years ""must be admitted . . . if the probative value of the evidence outweighs its  prejudicial effect to that defendant."" Fed. R. Evid. 609(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). In conducting this balancing test,  a court considers, among other factors, ""the nature of the crime, the time of the conviction, the similarity of the past  crime to the charged crime, the importance of the defendant's testimony, and the degree to which the defendant's  credibility is central to the case."" Jackson, 627 F.2d at 1209. The Court first reviews the type of crimes at issue, and whether these crimes—which include narcotics possession,  narcotics trafficking, and assault and battery—are probative as to Mr. Wilkins's truthfulness. HN26[ ] Felony  convictions naturally ""have some probative value on the issue of  [*85]  credibility."" United States v. Lipscomb, 702  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *83; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **56 Page 32 of 43 F.2d 1049, 1062, 226 U.S. App. D.C. 312 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (en banc). However, certain types of felony offenses, that  do not involve any false statement by the perpetrator, have been found to not be particularly probative of a  witness's [**61]  credibility. See, e.g., United States v. Holland, 41 F. Supp. 3d 82, 93 (D.D.C. 2014) (excluding  assault charge for impeachment purposes after concluding this conviction did not ""involve[] dishonest conduct or  false statements""); Lipscomb, 702 F.2d at 1071 (expressing skepticism that simple narcotics possession crimes  reflect strongly on credibility, compared to other crimes); United States v. Rosales, 680 F.2d 1304, 1306-07 (10th  Cir. 1981) (noting that convictions for violations of narcotics laws do ""not normally suggest the special probative  value on the issue of credibility contemplated by Fed. R. Evid. 609(a)(1)""); United States v. Belt, 514 F. 2d 837,  841, 169 U.S. App. D.C. 1 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (en banc) (noting that simple assault does not involve dishonesty or  false statement); Furtado v. Bishop, 604 F.2d 80,94 (1st Cir. 1979) (remarking that convictions for assault and  battery, among other crimes, were ""not particularly probative of credibility""). All three of Mr. Wilkins's previous  criminal offenses fall into these two categories of offenses, and the Government has not put forth any facts to  indicate that these crimes involved any false or dishonest statements. As a result, the probative value of Mr.  Wilkins's past convictions with regard to truthfulness appears to be minimal. Balanced against this negligible probative value is the significant risk of a prejudicial effect on the jury stemming  from the introduction of these past convictions. HN27[ ] As has been repeatedly noted, there [**62]  is a very real  risk that a jury will ""generaliz[e] a defendant's earlier bad act into bad character and tak[e] that as raising the odds  that he did the later bad act now charged."" Old Chief, 519 U.S. at 180. This risk is also heightened where, as here,  the impeached witness is also the defendant. See Lipscomb, 702 F.2d at 1063 (""There is less risk of prejudice  when a defense witness other than the defendant is impeached through a prior conviction because the jury cannot  directly infer the defendant's guilt from someone else's criminal record.""). Nor can this risk of prejudice be  appropriately limited by a limiting instruction, as the Government suggests. See Gov't 404(b) Reply at 14. As this  Court has previously recognized, ""[w]hen '[t]he jury is told to consider the defendant's prior conviction only on the  issue of credibility and not on the overall issue of guilt . . . the jury [is required] to perform a mental gymnastic which  is beyond, not only their powers, but anybody else's.'"" Holland, 41 F. Supp. 3d at 95 (quoting Lipscomb, 702 F.2d at  1069). Considering the limited probative value and very real risk of significant prejudice, the Court concludes that  the probative value of Mr. Wilkins's convictions for past drug possession, drug possession with intent to distribute,  and assault [**63]  do not outweigh the prejudicial effect of the introduction of this evidence. Consequently, this  evidence is inadmissible for the purposes of impeachment.  [*86]  The Government has also stated its intent to introduce Mr. Wilkins's eighteen-year-old conviction for Assault  and Battery of a Law Enforcement Officer. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 20. HN28[ ] Rule 609 provides additional limits on  the use of convictions older than ten years. Due to the increased possibility that such convictions are stale, they are  only admissible for impeachment if the ""probative value . . . substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect"" and ""the  proponent gives an adverse party reasonable written notice of the intent to use it."" Fed. R. Evid. 609(b) (emphasis  added). The Government cannot meet this burden here. For all the reasons previously discussed, a defendant's  previous assault conviction generally offers little in the way of probative value as to the question of the defendant's  credibility. See, e.g., Holland, 41 F. Supp. 3d 82 at 93; Belt, 514 F.2d at 841; Furtado, 604 F.2d at 94. Any probative  value is further undercut by the fact this conviction is 18 years old, making it the type of remote conviction that  Congress intended trial courts be ""extremely cautious"" about admitting into evidence. United States v. Pettiford, 238  F.R.D. 33, 39 (D.D.C. 2006) quoting United States v. Bibbs, 564 F.2d 1165, 1170 (5th Cir. 1977). When weighed [**64]  against the prejudicial effect of introducing past convictions that could cause the jury to infer  guilt solely based on this unrelated, previous conviction, the probative value is not ""substantially"" outweighed here.        538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *85; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **60 Page 33 of 43 Accordingly, Mr. Wilkins's prior January 11, 2003 conviction for Assault and Battery of a Law Enforcement Officer is  also barred for the purposes of impeaching Mr. Wilkins for truthfulness. M. Mr. Wilkins's Motion to Sever the Assault Charge Against Him The Court now turns to the pending motions filed by the Defendant, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Wilkins's first motion requests  an order from this Court severing the joinder of what he believes to be an unrelated and prejudicial charge against  him. Def.'s Mot. to Sever Counts (""Def.'s Sever Mot."") at 2, ECF No. 37. He posits that the assault charge is  factually unrelated and lacks any legal relevance to the other sex trafficking counts included in the indictment  against him. Id at 5. He also contends that the continued joinder of the assault charge will cause him prejudice at  trial. Id. at 6. The Government opposes this motion, arguing that the assault charge is of the same character as the  other charges, given that it concerns one of [**65]  Mr. Wilkins's alleged sex trafficking victims, and occurred during  the same time period he has been charged with providing for her sexual exploitation by force. Gov't Opp'n to Def.'s  Mot. to Sever (""Gov't Sever Opp'n"") at 4. For the reasons described below, the Court will deny Mr. Wilkins's Motion  to Sever. 1. Count 10 was Properly Joined Pursuant to Rule 8(a) HN29[ ] Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8 allows for the joinder of offenses when the offenses charged ""are of  the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or constitute parts  of a common [*87]  scheme or plan."" Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). The term ""similar character"" has been defined to  encompass items that are ""nearly corresponding, resembling in many respects, somewhat alike, or having a  general likeness to."" United States v. Treadwell, 566 F. Supp. 80, 86 (D.D.C. 1983); see also United States v.  Werner, 620 F. 2d 922, 926 (2d Cir. 1980) (same). The term ""transaction"" has been defined as ""a series of many  occurrences, depending not so much upon the immediateness of their connection as upon their logical  relationship."" Treadwell, 566 F. Supp. at 86. And offenses are considered to be ""connected together"" when there is  commonality of proof. United States v. Richardson, 161 F.3d 728, 734, 333 U.S. App. D.C. 178 (D.C. Cir. 1998). In  this Circuit, Rule 8 is construed liberally in favor of joinder. Id. at 733. Indeed, when claims can meet the above  definition, joinder is allowed ""even if the [**66]  claims are entirely unrelated to each other."" United States v. Gooch,  665 F.3d 1318, 1325, 398 U.S. App. D.C. 455 (D.C. Cir. 2012). All ten of the charges currently included in the superseding indictment against Mr. Wilkins, including the assault  charge, fall neatly within the confines of Rule 8(a). This is because all of these charges—including the alleged  assault— concern Mr. Wilkins's actions to advance the trafficking of the complainants for commercial sex work. The  alleged assault was not some unrelated event, as Mr. Wilkins contends, but was a physical attack by Mr. Wilkins on  L.H., one of the complainants he is accused of trafficking, occurred on ""the Track,"" or the area in the District where  Mr. Wilkins allegedly transported the complainants for the purpose of engaging in commercial sex work, and  happened during the same time period Mr. Wilkins is charged with obtaining and providing for the complainants'  sexual exploitation. Furthermore, audio captured on a security camera of the altercation indicates that the assault  was an instance of ""discipline"" by Mr. Wilkins to express his displeasure with L.H.'s behavior on the Track—  because she broke the rules by looking at another pimp. It can thus be fairly viewed as a tactic used by Mr. Wilkins  in order to get L.H. to engage [**67]  in commercial sex work. As a result, Mr. Wilkins's assertion that the assault  charge bears no factual or logical connection to the other charged conduct, Def.'s Sever Mot. at 4-5, does not hold  water. The Court accordingly concludes that this incident, ""has a general likeness to"" the other trafficking offenses  charged to be of a ""similar character,"" Werner, 620 F. 2d at 926. As such, joinder is permissible. 2. Severance Pursuant to Rule 14 is Not Appropriate     538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *86; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **64 Page 34 of 43 HN30[ ] Having concluded that the counts were properly joined, the Court must determine if severance is required  pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14, which allows for severance of counts upon a showing of  prejudice. Fed. R. Crim. P. 14. This is allowed even where joinder is otherwise proper. See United States v. Carson,  455 F.3d 336, 372, 372 U.S. App. D.C. 251 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Rule 14 states that if ""joinder . . . appears to prejudice  a defendant . . . the court may order separate trials of counts . . . or provide any further relief that justice requires.""  Fed. R. Crim. P. 14(a). The defendant carries the burden of demonstrating prejudice and that he will be unable to  have a fair trial unless the counts are severed. See Carson, 455 F.3d at 374. However, even when such a showing  is made, the grant of severance is not automatic—it remains within the discretion of the district court to determine if  severance is appropriate. See Gooch, 665 F.3d at 1326. And severance [**68]  is only proper when there is a  ""serious risk"" that without severance the jury will be unable to make ""a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.""   [*88]  Id. at 1336 (citing Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 539, 113 S. Ct. 933, 122 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1993)).  Absent this showing of substantial prejudice to the defendant, ""offenses properly joined under Rule 8 should be  jointly tried to conserve judicial resources, [alleviate] the burdens on citizens serving as jurors, and [to avoid] the  necessity of having witnesses reiterate testimony in a series of trials."" Treadwell, 566 F. Supp. at 86 (alterations in  original) (citing United States v. Clemente, 494 F. Supp. 1310, 1325 (S.D.N.Y. 1980)). Mr. Wilkins has not met this high bar here. He contends that trying the assault charge with the other sex trafficking  charges will create ""a very real likelihood for propensity prejudice . . . [that] would almost certainly lead to a rush to  judgment, juror bias against Mr. Wilkins, and ultimately a guilty verdict . . ."" Def.'s Sever Mot. at 6. He also claims  that he would have to present two separate and inconsistent defenses at trial (though he does not elaborate on this  point in any detail). Id. The Court finds that this is not enough to show prejudice so severe that in effect Mr. Wilkins  would be denied a fair trial, or that the failure to sever would somehow prevent the jury from being able [**69]  to  render a reliable verdict. This is because, even if the charges were severed as Mr. Wilkins requests, the separate juries would still be  presented with the same evidence in each trial through the operation of Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), creating  an ""unnecessary waste of judicial, prosecutorial and civic effort, resources and time."" Treadwell, 566 F. Supp. at 87  (rejecting similar request for severance where offenses charged were factually related). HN31[ ] As the D.C.  Circuit has noted, when a defendant objects to joinder because of criminal propensity prejudice, as is the case here,  ""the trial court should initially be guided by whether evidence of each crime could be admitted in a separate trial of  the other(s) under Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 404(b)."" United States v. Burkley, 591 F.2d 903, 920, 192  U.S. App. D.C. 294 (D.C. Cir. 1978). Under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), evidence of ""other crimes,"" such as  the assault, can be entered into evidence for select non-propensity reasons, such as motive, intent, knowledge,  common scheme or plan, or absence of mistake. Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). The assault fits into a number of these  categories—for example, it illustrates a method by which Mr. Wilkins enacted the ""common scheme or plan"" to  traffic the complainants, shows his intent to use coercive force, and the audio from the assault demonstrates his  knowledge of the sex work engaged in by the complainant. [**70]  Rule 404(b) evidence must also survive Rule  403's balancing test, which is accomplished here given that the probative value of this evidence is far from  substantially outweighed by any danger of unfair prejudice. Burkley, 591 F.2d at 919 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (citing Fed. R.  Evid. 403). As the Government argues, the assault demonstrates one particularly salient way that Mr. Wilkins ""used  persuasion, inducement, enticement, and coercion"" to intimidate victims. Gov't Sever Opp'n at 6. It is therefore  highly probative of, again, both the common scheme Mr. Wilkins enacted to accomplish the crimes and his intent to  commit the charged offenses. Moreover, even though the evidence is prejudicial, it is not unfairly prejudicial, given  that it is unlikely to cause the jury to make any improper inferences, and because this evidence is so closely  intertwined with the other charges brought against Mr. Wilkins. See United States v. Geddes, 844 F.3d 983, 990  (8th Cir. 2017) (""Though all Rule 404(b) evidence is inherently prejudicial, the test under Rule 403 is whether its  probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice."") (emphasis in original) (quoting   [*89]  United States v. Williams, 796 F.3d 951, 960 (8th Cir. 2015)). Consequently, the Court finds the highly  probative value of the assault to substantially outweigh any risk of unfair prejudice, meaning that even if Count 10  were severed, [**71]  evidence of the assault could be entered in both trials pursuant to Rule 404(b). As a result, the Court concludes that the use of severance here would be ""an extreme remedy that would require  wholesale duplication of effort and an unnecessary waste of judicial resources."" United States v. Worman, No. 07- 538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *87; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **67 Page 35 of 43 cr-40, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66028, 2008 WL 3984160, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 28, 2008). Mr. Wilkins's motion is  accordingly denied. N. Mr. Wilkins's Motion to Suppress Evidence Mr. Wilkins has also moved to suppress all evidence obtained from three different search warrants the Government  issued in this case, citing various Fourth Amendment violations. See Def.'s Mot. to Supp. Tangible Evid. & Mem. of  P. & A. in Supp. (""Def.'s Mot. Supp."") at 1, ECF No. 39. These three warrants include: (1) a warrant issued for Mr.  Wilkins's ZTE cellular phone, which was seized incident to his arrest for driving without a permit on June 18, 2018  and held by the MPD for 15-months before a search warrant was issued; (2) a warrant issued for Mr. Wilkins's  Samsung cellular phone seized incident to his arrest on November 5, 2019; and (3) a November 8, 2019 warrant  issued to Facebook for the Instagram account ""THEREAL_LUCKYCHARM."" Id. Mr. Wilkins argues first that the  prolonged, 15-month seizure of his ZTE phone was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 4. [**72]  He  also claims that the search warrants issued for the ZTE Phone and Instagram account failed to properly establish  probable cause. Id. at 6. Finally, he argues that all three warrants issued in this matter are so overbroad to  constitute prohibited ""general warrants."" Id. at 15. The Government opposes all three claims. See Gov't Opp'n to  Def.'s Mot. to Suppress Tangible Evid. (""Gov't Supp. Opp'n""), ECF No. 56. For the reasons listed below, the Court  finds that Mr. Wilkins's first argument is the only one with merit. a. Legal Standard HN32[ ] The Fourth Amendment guarantees that the ""right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,  papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated . . ."" U.S. Const. amend. IV.  When this guarantee is violated, courts will typically impose the exclusionary rule, which requires the suppression of  evidence obtained by unconstitutional means. United States v. Weaver, 808 F.3d 26, 33, 420 U.S. App. D.C. 254  (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citing Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 655, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081, 86 Ohio Law Abs. 513  (1961). This exclusion of evidence (though subject to several sizable exceptions), includes both ""the primary  evidence obtained as a direct result of an illegal search or seizure and . . . evidence later discovered and found to  be derivative of an illegality, the so-called fruit of the poisonous tree."" Utah v. Strieff, 579 U.S. 232, 136 S. Ct. 2056,  2061, 195 L. Ed. 2d 400 (2016) (internal [**73]  quotations omitted). HN33[ ] A seizure of property occurs ""when there is some meaningful interference with an individual's possessory  interests in that property."" United States v. Miller, 799 F.3d 1097, 1102, 419 U.S. App. D.C. 63 (D.C. Cir. 2015)  (citing United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 113, 104 S. Ct. 1652, 80 L. Ed. 2d 85 (1984)). The reasonableness  of such a seizure ""turns on the nature and extent of interference"" with the individual's possessory interests. Id. A  seizure can ""became unreasonable"" when ""its length unduly intrude[s] upon constitutionally protected interests.""  Jacobsen, 466 U.S. at 124 n. 25; see also United  [*90]  States v. Martin, 157 F.3d 46, 54 (2d Cir. 1998) (noting that  ""even a seizure based on probable cause is unconstitutional if police act with unreasonable delay in securing a  warrant.""). HN34[ ] The Supreme Court has described the assessment of probable cause for purposes of a search warrant  as ""a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit . . . there is a  fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place."" Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S.  213, 238, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983). It is the duty of a reviewing court ""to ensure that the magistrate  had a 'substantial basis for . . . conclud[ing]' that probable cause existed."" Id. at 238-39. When making this  determination, judges ""need not confine their evaluations within rigorous legalistic boundaries but instead may use  their common sense."" United States v. Davis, 617 F.2d 677, 692, 199 U.S. App. D.C. 95 (D.C. Cir. 1979). HN35[ ] It must be noted that [**74]  even when evidence is determined to have been gathered in violation of the  Fourth Amendment, this evidence is not necessarily automatically suppressed. If the officer gathering evidence had  an objectively reasonable reliance on a search warrant, the exclusionary rule will typically not apply. United States  v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 922, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984). This is because the ""exclusionary rule was  adopted to deter unlawful searches by police, not to punish the errors of magistrates and judges."" Massachusetts v.  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *89; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **71 Page 36 of 43 Sheppard, 468 U.S. 981, 990, 104 S. Ct. 3424, 82 L. Ed. 2d 737 (1984). That said, there are several exceptions to  this Leon good faith principle, one of which is that suppression is appropriate ""if the officers were dishonest or  reckless in preparing their affidavit or could not have harbored an objectively reasonable belief in the existence of  probable cause."" Leon, 468 U.S. at 926. b. The 15-Month ZTE Phone Seizure was Unreasonable On June 18, 2018, Mr. Wilkins was arrested in the K Street area of Washington D.C. for driving in the city without a  permit, a minor traffic violation. Def.'s Mot. Supp. at 1-2. The MPD officers subsequently seized his phone incident  to arrest. Id. at 2. The legality of the traffic stop and initial seizure of the ZTE phone are not in dispute. However,  while Mr. Wilkins was released the next day, his ZTE phone was logged as ""Evidence [**75]  or Suspected  Proceeds of Crime,"" and remained in MPD custody for the next fifteen months, until September 18, 2019. On  September 18, 2019, Detective Sullivan, a member of the MPD, applied for a warrant to search the ZTE phone.  Detective Sullivan took this action six days after the arrest of one of the complainants and her subsequent  identification of Mr. Wilkins as  [*91]  her pimp, ""Lucky,"" Gov't Supp. Opp'n at 6, after he inadvertently discovered  through a database check that Mr. Wilkins's ZTE phone was still in custody from the traffic stop over a year prior.  The warrant was granted the same day. Mr. Wilkins contends that the 15-month delay in obtaining a warrant for his ZTE cell phone was an unreasonable  seizure, and accordingly violative of the Fourth Amendment. Def.'s Mot. Supp. at 1. The Government counters that  this delay does not constitute ""meaningful interference"" with Mr. Wilkins's possessory interest in his phone. Gov't  Supp. Opp'n at 2. The Court is unconvinced. HN36[ ] To assess the reasonableness of a seizure, courts are required to ""balance the nature and quality of the  intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests  alleged to justify the intrusion."" [**76]  United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 703, 103 S. Ct. 2637, 77 L. Ed. 2d 110  (1983). When a delayed warrant is at issue, the Eleventh Circuit has identified several ""highly relevant"" factors to  consider when conducting this balancing test, which include: (1) the significance of the interference with an  individual's possessory interest; (2) the duration of the delay; (3) whether the individual consented to the seizure;  (4) the Government's legitimate interest in holding the property as evidence, and (5) whether law enforcement were  diligent in pursuing their investigation. United States v. Laist, 702 F.3d 608, 613-614 (11 Cir. 2012). While there is  no ""bright line past which delay becomes unreasonable . . . [w]hen police neglect to seek a warrant without any  good explanation for that delay, it appears that the state is indifferent to searching the item and the intrusion on an  individual's possessory interest is less likely to be justifiable."" United States v. Burgard, 675 F.3d 1029, 1033-34  (7th Cir. 2012). The Court begins with an evaluation of the extent of the Government's interference with Mr. Wilkins's possessory  interest in the ZTE phone. The interference by the Government was by all accounts, severe. The phone was seized  for fifteen months before a warrant was obtained. HN37[ ] ""The longer the police take to seek a warrant, the  greater the infringement on the person's possessory interest [**77]  will be, for the obvious reason that a longer  seizure is a greater infringement on possession than a shorter one."" Id. at 1033; United States v. Mitchell, 565 F. 3d  1347, 1350 (11th Cir. 2009) (noting that each day a warrant is delayed ""infringes [on the] possessory interests           538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *90; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **74 Page 37 of 43 protected by the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on 'unreasonable searches.'"") (quoting Jacobsen, 466 U.S. at  124). Delays in obtaining a warrant far shorter than the 15 months in this case have been found to be  unconstitutionally long. See, e.g., United States v. Pratt, 915 F.3d 266, 272 (4th Cir. 2019) (finding 31-day delay in  obtaining warrant following seizure of cell phone unreasonable); Mitchell, 565 F. 3d at 1350 (21-day delay in  obtaining warrant for seized computer unreasonable); compare with United States v. Stabile, 633 F.3d 219, 235-36  (3d Cir. 2011) (three-month delay in obtaining warrant for computer reasonable where defendant had consented to  seizure, did not request return of property, and Government provided reasonable explanation for delay). This factor  consequently generally weighs in favor of finding the Government interference here to be meaningful. The Court turns next to evaluate Mr. Wilkins's possessory interest in the ZTE phone. An individual's property  interest in their own cell phone can generally be assumed to be significant. As the Supreme Court has noted, ""[t]he  term 'cell [*92]  phone' is itself misleading shorthand; many of these devices are in [**78]  fact minicomputers that  also happen to have the capacity to be used as a telephone."" Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373, 393, 134 S. Ct.  2473, 189 L. Ed. 2d 430 (2014). This recognition of the capabilities of modern smartphones—which the  Government helpfully clarifies the ZTE phone in question was—means that they contain similar possessory  interests to that of an individual's personal computer. HN38[ ] And ""individuals may have a particularly powerful  possessory interest"" in their own computers, as they are ""relied upon heavily for personal and business use."" Laist,  702 F.3d at 614 (citing Mitchell, 565 F.3d at 1347). Accordingly, as a starting point, Mr. Wilkins appears to have a  strong possessory interest in his ZTE phone. Notably, Mr. Wilkins did not act to seriously diminish this strong possessory interest. He did not consent to the  seizure in any respect, as it was taken from him pursuant to his arrest for driving without a permit. HN39[ ] ""An  individual diminishes his [possessory] interest if he consents to the seizure or voluntarily shares the seized object's  contents."" Pratt, 915 F.3d at 271-72 (finding that defendant's possessory interest in his cell phone was not  diminished where he did not consent to seizure or voluntarily share the phone's contents) (citing United States v.  Christie, 717 F.3d 1156, 1162-63 (10th Cir. 2013)); see also Burgard, 675 F. 3d at 1034 (finding defendant ""had a  strong interest in possessing his cell phone"" [**79]  as ""[a]t no point before the seizure did he abandon the phone or  relinquish it to a third party.""). Nor was Mr. Wilkins afforded the opportunity to access the ZTE phone's contents to  save any critical information prior to the seizure. See Laist, 702 F.3d at 616 (finding possessory interest in the  contents of seized computer diminished where defendant ""was afforded the opportunity to remove whatever he  wanted to download from the computer and hard drives"" prior to seizure). The strongest argument that can be made that Mr. Wilkins had a diminished possessory interest is that he did not,  at any point during the 15-month seizure, specifically request the return of his property from the MPD. Such a  remedy was available to him pursuant to Rule 41(g) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure for the  District of Columbia. See Sup. Ct. R. Crim. P. 41(g) (""A person aggrieved by. . . [a] deprivation of property may  move for the property's return.""). The Government's balancing analysis relies almost exclusively on this omission to  argue that Mr. Wilkins's failure to demand the phone's return forfeited any and all possessory interest he previously  held in his phone. The Court is unconvinced that this single factor, without more, is enough to compel this outcome. HN40[ ] This is because evidence that an [**80]  individual has actively asserted their possessory claim to a piece  of property through requesting its return is only ""helpful, though not essential"" to the determination of one's  possessory interests. Burgard, 675 F.3d at 1033 (""[I]t can be revealing to see whether the person from whom the  item was taken ever asserted a possessory claim to it—perhaps by checking on the status of the seizure or looking  for assurances that the item would be returned. If so, this would be some evidence (helpful, though not essential)  that the seizure in fact affected [his] possessory interests."") (emphasis added). The Court does not find this non  essential fact particularly revealing here. Mr. Wilkins was not legally trained. The notion that he should have known  that he had the legal right to request the return of his phone (which, as discussed, had been logged as evidence   [*93]  and would have required prosecutor approval for release), or that he should bear the cost of obtaining legal  representation to take action in this regard is a high burden to place on an ordinary citizen to safeguard one's  Fourth Amendment rights. Furthermore, as the Government repeatedly emphasizes, Mr. Wilkins was apparently a  ""person of interest"" at the time of his arrest [**81]  for driving without a permit and subsequent seizure of the ZTE  phone. Gov't Supp. Opp'n at 12. If known, this would surely inspire hesitation on his part to undertake affirmative  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *91; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **77 Page 38 of 43 outreach to the MPD to inquire about his property. And such ""[a]n unwillingness to invite a criminal prosecution""  ""cannot [be] equat[ed]. . . [to] a voluntary abandonment of any interest."" Walter v. United States, 447 U.S. 649, 658  n.11, 100 S. Ct. 2395, 65 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1980). For this same reason the Court finds unpersuasive the Government's secondary argument that Mr. Wilkins  disclaimed his possessory interest by somehow voluntarily abandoning his phone—which by its own account, was  taken from his person following his arrest for driving without a permit, and then held in police files as ""evidence.""  This conclusion stretches reason. While, certainly, ""[o]fficers may lawfully seize property that has been voluntarily  abandoned, United States v. Griffith, 867 F.3d 1265, 1279, 432 U.S. App. D.C. 234 (D.C. Cir. 2017), the facts do  not indicate that Mr. Wilkins abandoned the ZTE phone. HN41[ ] ""Whether property has been abandoned is a  question of fact that turns primarily on whether the objective facts available to the investigating officers evidenced (i)  the suspect's denial of ownership, and (ii) that he physically relinquished the property in a way that demonstrated  abandonment."" United States v. Voice, 622 F.3d 870, 877 n.3 (8th Cir. 2010); see also [**82]  United States v.  Thomas, 864 F. 2d 843, 846, 275 U.S. App. D.C. 21 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (noting that abandoned property analysis for  Fourth Amendment purposes requires an inquiry into ""the intent of the person who is alleged to have abandoned""  the property, inferred from ""words spoken, acts done, and other objective facts.""). The Court has not been provided  any evidence that Mr. Wilkins's actions or comments at the time of his arrest indicated an intent to abandon his  phone. The Court concludes that Mr. Wilkins has a significant possessory interest in his ZTE phone, and that the  Government's interference with that interest was meaningful. Turning to the next factor in the analysis, the Court must balance Mr. Wilkins's strong possessory interest in the  ZTE phone against the Government's justification for the seizure to determine if the 15-month delay was  reasonable. The Government claims that the prolonged seizure was required due to the need to ""preserv[e]  evidence of sex trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation that is contained [*94]  in the ZTE Phone."" Gov't  Supp. Opp'n at 12. To support this claim, the Government argues that Mr. Wilkins was a person of interest to MPD  officers at time of initial arrest and seizure, and given the digital content of the data [**83]  contained on the ZTE  phone, there was a heightened interest in protecting this evidence from destruction. Id. This asserted interest falls  apart under close analysis. Mr. Wilkins was stopped and arrested for a traffic offense, not for anything related to sex  trafficking. His phone was seized incident to that arrest, as is apparently MPD policy for all arrests, and then tagged  as ""evidence."" But it is difficult to see how a cell phone could contain any evidence of the crime of driving without a  permit, or how there could be any valid fear of evidence destruction for this type of violation. Nonetheless, it was on  this basis that the ZTE phone was stored as ""Evidence or Suspected Proceeds of Crime"" for the next 15 months.  Detective Sullivan, the member of MPD leading the Human Trafficking Investigation and who later obtained the  warrant, was never even notified about the existence of the ZTE Phone, and only found out about it when he  ""discovered that phone was in MPD's possession"" when looking up various contacts with defendants. Supp. Gov't  Opp'n at 3. The state, in short, seems to have inadvertently retained the ZTE Phone for over 15 months with no real  justification—and certainly no [**84]  probable cause or reasonable suspicion— until it was rediscovered when it  could serve a useful purpose for law enforcement. This stands in stark contrast to nearly all of the other cases that have examined this issue of an extended seizure  prior to a warrant being issued. HN42[ ] The Government's interest in a seizure is strong when there is probable  cause to believe the seized item contains evidence of a crime. See Burgard, 675 F.3d at 1033. Accordingly, in all  cases that have excused an extended delay between a seizure and warrant—as well as others that have not—there           538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *93; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **81 Page 39 of 43 was at minimum probable cause to believe the item seized contained evidence of a crime. See, e.g., Mitchell 565  F.3d at 1351 (defendant admitted that computer seized contained child pornography); Laist, 702 F. 3d at 618  (probable cause for seizure present as agents directly observed child pornography on seized computer); Burgard,  675 F.3d at 1034 (defendant conceded ""police had probable cause to believe phone would contain evidence of a  crime""); Thomas v. United States, 775 Fed. Appx. 477, 490 (""very strong reasons"" including witness testimony  regarding computer's contents and law enforcement observations of computer to conclude it contained evidence of  a crime). In contrast, for the 15 months the ZTE phone was in custody, MPD did not have probable cause to believe  that [**85]  the phone contained evidence of a crime. The Court is deeply uncomfortable with the notion, seemingly  advanced by the Government, that law enforcement has the power to seize and indefinitely hold any property  merely on the Government's word that the property owner is a person of interest in some uncharged, unrelated  crime at the time of the seizure. Quite simply, this is not reasonable. Given this lack of a defensible state interest for  the ongoing seizure of the ZTE phone, the balancing test becomes one-sided in favor of finding the prolonged  seizure unreasonable. HN43[ ] In a similar vein, courts must consider the diligence with which law enforcement seek a warrant for seized  property. See Mitchell, 565 F.3d at 1352; Pratt, 915 F. 3d at 272 (relying heavily on fact that ""government has no  persuasive justification for the delay in obtaining a search warrant"" to find 31-day delay unreasonable). ""When  police neglect to seek a warrant  [*95]  without any good explanation for that delay, it appears that the state is  indifferent to searching the item and the intrusion on an individual's possessory interest is less likely to be  justifiable."" Burgard, 675 F.3d at 1033. Such is the case here, where the ZTE phone was essentially forgotten for 15  months. This factor also strongly [**86]  urges the Court to find the delay unreasonable. Balancing all these factors together, given Mr. Wilkins's relatively undiminished possessory interest in his ZTE  Phone and the Government's utter lack of justification for both the initial seizure and its lack of diligence in obtaining  a warrant, the Court concludes that the 15 month delay violates the Fourth Amendment. Perhaps anticipating this result, the Government urged the Court in both its briefs and at oral argument to apply the  Leon good faith exception to the exclusionary rule and decline to suppress the evidence derived from the search of  the ZTE phone. See Gov't Supp. Opp'n at 26; Hr'g Tr. at 43. Mr. Wilkins argues that the good-faith exception is  unavailable here. Def.'s Supp. Reply at 5-6. For the reasons listed below, the Court agrees with Mr. Wilkins and  finds the Good Faith exception inapplicable. HN44[ ] In Leon, the Supreme Court held a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule exists such that,  ""suppression is appropriate only if the officers were dishonest or reckless in preparing their affidavit or could not  have harbored an objectively reasonable belief in the existence of probable cause."" Leon, 468 U.S. at 926. The  Government argues that none of the exceptions [**87]  to the good faith rule apply to the instant case, meaning that  the ZTE Warrant need not be suppressed. But this analysis misunderstands the source of the constitutional  violation at issue. HN45[ ] The Leon good faith exception applies to defects that arise under the search warrant  process, not unconstitutional seizures. And the Supreme Court has held that the proper remedy for an  unreasonably long delay in obtaining a warrant following a seizure under the Fourth Amendment is suppression of  the evidence. Segura, 468 U.S. at 812; Burgard, 675 F.3d. at 1035. Procuring a late-obtained warrant cannot be  enough to remedy this type of unreasonable delay, because by merit of the type of violation at issue a warrant is  always eventually obtained—meaning under this logic the exclusionary rule could not ever operate to deter this  Fourth Amendment violation. See Burgard, 675 F. 3d at 1035 (noting the proper inquiry is ""not whether police  ultimately obtained a warrant; it is whether they failed to do so within a reasonable time.""). Indeed, the Seventh and Ninth Circuits, the only two courts that appear to have specifically addressed this issue,  have both declined to apply the good faith exception to cases of an unreasonably prolonged seizure. See, e.g.,  Burgard, 675 F. 3d at 1035 (""When an officer waits an unreasonably long time to obtain [**88]  a search warrant, in  violation of the Fourth Amendment, he cannot seek to have evidence admitted simply by pointing to that late- obtained warrant.""); United States v. Song Ja Cha, 597 F.3d 995, 1006 (9th Cir. 2010) (""[T]he exclusionary rule is  applicable where seizures are unconstitutionally long"" to ""deter unreasonable police behavior and to provide for  judicial determination of probable cause.""). HN46[ ] As the Ninth Circuit went on to explain, law enforcement are  presumed to be aware of the law that a seizure must last ""no longer than reasonably necessary for the police,  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *94; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **84 Page 40 of 43 acting with diligence, to obtain a warrant."" Id. at 1005 (citing Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326, 332, 121 S. Ct. 946,  148 L. Ed. 2d 838 (2001)). As a  [*96]  result, the application of the good faith exception would be inappropriate  because this type of Fourth Amendment violation is ""sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it""  and ""deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system."" Id. at 1004. An examination of the policy implications  of allowing the good faith exception here also helps to explain why the Court finds exclusion to be appropriate. As  the Burgard court aptly noted, allowing a ""good faith"" exception to apply ""would eliminate the [exclusionary] rule's  deterrent effect on unreasonably long seizures. Police could seize any item—a phone, a computer, a briefcase, or  even a house—for [**89]  an unreasonably long time without concern for the consequences, evidentiary and  otherwise."" 675 F.3d at 1035; Song Ja Cha, 597 F.3d at 1005 (""To create [such] an exception . . . would defeat the  purpose of the exclusionary rule . . .""). This fear is exactly what has materialized here, with law enforcement seizing  Mr. Wilkins's phone and holding it for well over a year until the search was ordered. Such an outcome cannot  possibly be in accord with the basic protections of the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, as a matter of both law and  policy, the Court finds that the Good Faith exception does not apply. Consequently, the Court will grant Mr. Wilkins's motion to suppress the tangible evidence obtained from the illegal  search of the ZTE phone. However, it appears that this finding may have little practical effect. The Government  represents that the warrant for Mr. Wilkins's ZTE phone bore no poisonous fruit, in that the Government did not rely  on any unique evidence found on the ZTE phone to obtain any subsequent warrants. Hr'g Tr. at 44. This is because  a warrant for one of the complainant's phones was authorized at the same time the warrant for the ZTE phone was  approved, and all of the relevant evidence from Mr. Wilkins's ZTE phone was also found [**90]  on the  complainant's phone. Id. Accordingly, the Government argues, there is no way the illegal ZTE search could have  tainted any subsequent evidence obtained in the case. Hr'g Tr. at 44. The Court is not so sure. Given the general  paucity of detailed information before the Court at this time, it will grant Mr. Wilkins's counsel the opportunity to  submit additional briefing on this topic to articulate what evidence, if any, should be excluded as fruit of the illegal  search of the ZTE phone. c. The Warrant to Search Mr. Wilkins's Instagram Account was Properly Supported by Probable Cause Mr. Wilkins also argues that the Facebook search warrant lacked probable cause. He alleges that neither the  warrant nor the accompanying affidavits indicate why the Government needed to search the entire Instagram  account to confirm that Mr. Wilkins owned and operated it, and that Detective Sullivan failed to provide any  ""concrete or reliable support"" for why he believed that searching the account would provide additional evidence of  Mr. Wilkins's alleged commercial sexual exploitation. Def.'s Mot. Supp. at 13-14. The Government, in response,  provides a list of facts included in the affidavit that they [**91]  believe demonstrates that probable cause existed to  search the account for evidence of sex trafficking. These facts include: (1) the target Instagram account's name is Thereal_luckycharm, and it bore a photograph of the defendant as  the profile picture; (2) the woman dropped off for a commercial sex ""date' with an undercover officer by the  defendant in September 2019 identified him as her pimp and said she knew him as ""Lucky""; and (3) based on  Detective Sullivan's training and experience, ""Pimps and their prostitutes are now meeting with  [*97]   increased regularity via social media like Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, and other popular social media  websites. Pimps use these websites to promote their lifestyles, wealth, and belongings as a way to recruit  females into their stable. Pimps use the social media accounts to directly message or contact potential  prostitutes to begin the recruitment process by applying pressure or attempting to sell the pimp lifestyle to the  victims."" Gov't Supp. Opp'n at 15-16. The Government also pointed to conversations between the @thereal_luckycharm and  an account previously used by a known trafficker, of which law enforcement had assumed control. Id. at 16.  The [**92]  conversations involved ""pimp slang terms,"" and @thereal_luckycharm provided a phone number to the  known trafficker. Id. The Court concludes that the combination of all of these facts taken together is more than  sufficient to establish probable cause that this Instagram account would contain evidence of crimes of sexual  exploitation. 538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *95; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **88 Page 41 of 43 HN47[ ] To determine whether a search warrant is supported by probable cause, courts must ask ""whether, given  all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit . . . there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime  will be found in a particular place."" Gates, 462 U.S. at 238. It is the duty of a reviewing court ""to ensure that the  magistrate had a 'substantial basis for . . . conclud[ing]' that probable cause existed.,"" Griffith, 867 F. 3d at 1271  (quoting Gates, 462 U.S. at 236). When making this determination, judges ""need not confine their evaluations within  igorous legalistic boundaries but instead may use their common sense."" Davis, 617 F.2d at 692 (quoting Gates, 462  U.S. at 236). They also may consider that, ""while each fact standing alone may be insufficient, the combination of  all the facts can establish probable cause."" United States v. Gilliam, 167 F. 3d 628, 633, 334 U.S. App. D.C. 391  (D.C. Cir. 1999). The Court concludes that the Government demonstrated probable cause in its warrant application by demonstrating  that there was a [**93]  ""substantial basis"" to believe that the Instagram account contained evidence of Mr. Wilkins's  alleged criminal activity. Detective Sullivan's experience regarding trafficking operations generally led him to believe  that Mr. Wilkins likely would have used Instagram to conduct his illegal activities. See United States v. Hodge, 246  F.3d 301, 307 (3d Cir. 2001) (magistrate judges are allowed to ""give considerable weight to the conclusions of this  experienced law enforcement officer regarding where evidence of a crime was likely to be found.""). This belief was  also supported by direct evidence from the investigation—messages between Mr. Wilkins and an account operated  by law enforcement that Mr. Wilkins believed belonged to a known trafficker. Especially given the evidence set forth  in the affidavit establishing probable cause that Mr. Wilkins had committed trafficking-related offenses, including  that he had transported women to the District to engage in commercial sex since 2017, and had exchanged  messages with a known trafficker through his Instagram, combined with Detective Sullivan's knowledge of how  traffickers use social media and the general ubiquity of social media to facilitate modern communication, the  Government established a fair [**94]  probability that evidence of trafficking-related offenses and/or identities of  other potential victims would be found in the searched Instagram account. Furthermore, because the Government  was only in possession of circumstantial evidence that pointed to Mr. Wilkins owning and operating the account, it  was perfectly reasonable  [*98]  for law enforcement to seek additional evidence that the account belonged to  him. The Government therefore has met the probable cause standard, and Mr. Wilkins's motion to suppress on  this ground is denied. d. None of the Warrants Were Fatally Overbroad Mr. Wilkins's final argument for suppression is that the ZTE Phone, Facebook, and Samsung warrants were all  overbroad and therefore prohibited under the Fourth Amendment. Def.'s Supp. Mot. at 15. HN48[ ] The Fourth  Amendment prohibits general search warrants and requires that a warrant describe, with particularity, the place to  be searched and the persons or things to be seized. U.S. Const. amend. IV. This requirement is intended to protect  people from ""general, exploratory rummaging in a person's belongings,"" Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443,  467, 91 S. Ct. 2022, 29 L. Ed. 2d 564 (1971), and to ensure that a search conducted by law enforcement be  ""carefully tailored to its justifications,"" Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 84, 107 S. Ct. 1013, 94 L. Ed. 2d 72  (1987). The Government successfully refutes Mr. Wilkins's argument [**95]  by demonstrating that the warrants  were appropriately tailored to the requirements of this case, with the information seized restricted to data related to  violations of specified statutes. Gov't Supp. Opp'n at 19-20.         538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *97; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **92 Page 42 of 43 In making his argument that the warrants at issue were overbroad, Mr. Wilkins relies heavily on United States v.  Winn, an out-of-Circuit district court case in which the defendant was charged with taking photos of young girls in  swimsuits using his cell phone. United States v. Winn, 79 F. Supp. 3d 904, 904 (S.D. Ill. 2015); Def.'s Supp. Mot. at  15. In that case, the Court found the warrant issued to obtain the defendant's relevant cell phone files fatally  overbroad. Winn, 79 F. Supp. 3d at 919. However, there are important differences between the warrant issued in  Winn and the warrants in this case. The Winn warrant authorized the seizure of ""any and all files"" related to the  Public Indecency charge brought against the defendant, including but not limited to the phone's calendar, phone  book, contacts, SMS messages, MMS messages, emails, pictures, videos, images, ringtones, and audio files, all  while the police only had probable cause to believe that photos and videos would be evidence of the crime. Id. The  Court accordingly held that the warrant was ""not as [**96]  particular as could be reasonably expected given the  nature of the crime and the information the police possessed."" Id. at 920. In short, the warrant was overbroad  because the police had enough information to more appropriately tailor the warrant to a specific type of files, and by  further refining the subject matter of the photos for which it was searching, and by the relevant timeframe, given that  the alleged criminal activity occurred only on a single day. Id.  [*99]  The facts of this case are inapposite. In the warrant applications, the Government identified with specificity  several types of records and information it sought—it did not make a request for ""any and all"" files in the overbroad  fashion that the Winn court prohibited. Gov't Supp. Opp'n at 20-21. Instead, the warrants limited the information to  be seized and searched to violations of specific statutes. See Matter of Black iPhone 4, 27 F. Supp. 3d 74, 78  (D.D.C. 2014) (indicating overbreadth concerns are appropriately addressed where the information to be seized is  limited to ""information only insofar as it pertains to violations of [two statutes].""). The warrants also indicated  parameters that the evidence retrieved must ""relat[e] to the identity or location of perpetrators, aiders and  abettors, [**97]  co-conspirators."" Gov't Supp. Opp'n Att. B (""ZTE Warrant Aff."") at 1b. HN49[ ] Courts have  frequently found that this level of specificity is permissible, especially when a comprehensive review of electronic  evidence is necessary for law enforcement to know exactly where the relevant evidence is located. See United  States v. Bishop, 910 F.3d 335, 336 (7th Cir. 2018) (rejecting overbreadth challenge to warrant and permitting  police to look at every file on a phone to decide which met criteria set forth in a warrant because ""[c]riminals don't  advertise where they keep evidence.""); Christie, 717 F.3d at 1165 (holding computer search warrant ""may pass the  particularity test if they limit their scope . . . to evidence of specific federal crimes.""); People v. Lopez, No. 341089,  2019 Mich. App. LEXIS 595, 2019 WL 1370716, at *5 (Mich. Ct. App. Mar. 26, 2019) (""When the search is limited to  evidence explicitly authorized in the warrant . . . it is reasonable for officers to search through the data and  applications on the phone to determine whether it contains the sought after evidence.""). Because Mr. Wilkins was  allegedly using his phone and Instagram accounts to conduct commercial sex trafficking, law enforcement had no  way of knowing exactly where evidence would be located. Unlike in Winn, the evidence that might be relevant could  not be confined to certain types of files. See 79 F. Supp. 3d at 919. Instead, [**98]  probative evidence could be  found, as the Government contends, ""in the defendant's contacts, call log, messages, GPS location data, etc."" Gov't  Supp. Opp'n at 23. Finally, Mr. Wilkins posits—with a noticeable lack of any supporting authority—that the lack of temporal limitation in  the warrant renders it fatally overbroad. Def.'s Supp. Mot. at 17. But, unlike in Winn, relevant evidence in this case  was not limited to a single day or narrow date range, see 79 F. Supp. 3d at 919; instead, the investigation into Mr.  Wilkins's commercial sexual exploitation scheme spanned almost a decade and involved a far more complex  investigation. Therefore, while a temporal constraint in Winn may have made sense to better ensure that that  search was ""carefully tailored to its justifications,"" Garrison, 480 U.S. at 84, such a constraint would make little  sense in this case given the duration of the alleged criminal activity and the complexity of the investigation. As a  result, the Court finds that the Instagram and Samsung Phone warrant requests were not overbroad and will deny  Mr. Wilkins's Motion to Suppress on this ground.",1
"State v. Braun, 20 Wn. App. 2d 756","¶1  [*759]  [**887] F, J. — [S]ex traffickers select victims who demonstrate vulnerabilities including homelessness, substance abuse,  mental health issues, and histories of physical, emotional or sexual abuse. A typical trafficker recruits victims  by telling them that he loves them, promising them a better life, providing them with shelter and drugs, and  lying to them about the nature of the job. … … . [T]raffickers control their victims through physical violence, sexual violence, psychological violence and  grooming. Traffickers … groom victims with promises and compliments, but escalate to physical abuse, sexual  assault and death threats. … They also use psychological violence such as tearing a victim [***2]  down, telling  them they are worthless, socially isolating them, and controlling them financially and by taking advantage of a  victim's drug dependency. … … [V]ictims often stay with their traffickers—or leave and then return—because they believe they have  nowhere to go; that there is no one else out there for them, and no other options for them; they feel ashamed  and guilty and stigmatized, thinking that they will not be accepted elsewhere. They are also afraid that if they  leave, the trafficker will find them and harm them even more egregiously. Testimony of Sharon Cooper in  United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d 584, 590-91 (7th Cir. 2017). ¶2 Appellant Lars Braun appeals his convictions, after a bench trial, for human trafficking and promoting  prostitution [*760] . Because overwhelming evidence supports a finding that his victim engaged in prostitution as  the result of Braun's manipulation, we affirm both convictions. We also reject Braun's contention that the trial court  violated the appearance of fairness doctrine. We grant Braun's request for resentencing because his offender score  included an earlier conviction for possessing a controlled substance. FACTS ¶3 This prosecution arises from the protracted, poignant, and pungent relationship between Jane, [***3]  a  pseudonym, and defendant Lars Braun. The four-year relationship included the performance of commercial sex  acts by Jane at the request of and for the financial gain and sexual enchantment of Braun. Braun's appeal raises  two principal questions: First, whether Braun, within the meaning of Washington's human trafficking statute,  meted “force, coercion, and fraud” against Jane in fulfillment of one of the crime's elements? Second, whether the  force, coercion, or fraud led to Jane's prostitution in satisfaction of a second element of the crime? Answers to  these questions require a review of the language, intent, and history behind RCW 9A.40.100, Washington's  trafficking statute. Answering the questions also necessitates a narrative of Jane's remarkable story, remarkable  not because of its singularity or the tragedy portrayed but because of the prevalence, yet hidden nature, of  trafficking and because of the story's example of how enduring manipulation can implausibly result in the control of  another's choices, even to the extent of causing the other to perform repulsive and dangerous acts. We  [**888]   glean the appeal's facts primarily from the trial testimony of Jane. ¶4 In February 2013, Jane began communicating [***4]  with Lars Braun over the Internet. Jane was then twenty  years old and married. Braun was in his early fifties and also married. Jane lived in Spokane, and Braun resided in  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *756; 502 P.3d 884, **884; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***1 Page 9 of 27   Ellensburg. Jane knew Braun's children through her husband,  [*761]  who socialized with the offspring. In her  cyber messages to Braun, Jane expressed concern about the methamphetamine intake of Braun's children. ¶5 At the same time that Jane started writing Lars Braun, she commenced abusing alcohol. Her alcohol use created  conflict in her marriage. ¶6 By April 2013, Lars Braun and Jane spoke by phone or communicated by e-mail several hours each day. Jane  then admired Braun, thirty years her senior, as an accomplished intellectual. Jane divulged her marital problems.  Braun advised Jane to engage in an extramarital affair. Braun expounded that he rekindled his marriage by  cheating on his wife. ¶7 In May 2013, Lars Braun and Jane met in person for the first time and interlocked in sexual intercourse inside a  Spokane hotel room. By May, Braun and his wife were in the process of divorce. Jane's husband soon learned of  her carnal encounter with Braun. Jane moved from her husband's residence and divorced him. ¶8 Lars Braun learned that Jane informed [***5]  Jane's husband of her sexual encounter with Braun. Braun grew  furious at Jane because he worried that his wife would also hear about the affair and use the tryst against him in  their divorce and child custody proceeding. Braun ceased speaking with Jane. ¶9 Alas, the lack of interaction between Lars Braun and Jane did not last. While Jane engaged in intimate relations  with another man, Braun called Jane. We do not know why Jane answered the phone during this rendezvous.  During the telephone conversation, Braun screamed at Jane. Braun called Jane “‘slut.’” Clerk's Papers (CP) at 253- 54. Braun's clamorous comments suggested to Jane that Braun was jealous. The remarks also surprised Jane  since Braun had told her he would never speak to her again. Braun and Jane spoke by phone on additional  occasions in the coming days. Jane repeatedly apologized to Braun. Braun revealed to Jane she was his girlfriend.  [*762]  ¶10 In early June 2013, Lars Braun invited Jane to visit him in Ellensburg, where he would introduce her to his  friends. Jane lacked a driver's license. So Jane traveled by bus from Spokane to Ellensburg to visit Braun. Braun  there purchased alcohol for Jane, since she remained below the legal age [***6]  to purchase liquor. Contrary to his  telephonic enticement, Braun hid his relationship with Jane from acquaintances in Ellensburg. He directed her to  use the name “Kathy,” and he informed others that “Kathy” and he shared a platonic relationship. During the first  visit, Braun permitted his seven-year-old son to enter the bed where Braun and Jane lay naked. ¶11 Dave, with an unidentified last name, also resided with Lars Braun in Ellensburg during Jane's early June 2013  visit. On one day, Braun left Jane alone with Dave, during which time Dave groped Jane. Dave informed Jane that  Braun gave him permission to have sex with her. Jane refused Dave's overture, after which Dave punched the bed  by her head. Jane ran into and locked herself in a bathroom, while crying hysterically. She texted Braun and  requested he return to the residence. Braun declined. When Braun eventually returned home, he accused Jane of  promoting the advance by Dave because of her suggestible behavior. Braun questioned Jane about why she did  not strike Dave if she objected to the housemate's advance. Braun volunteered that she encouraged Dave to  engage in sex with her. He instructed Jane not to report Dave to law enforcement. [***7]  Braun then initiated sex  with Jane. Jane never saw Dave again. ¶12 At 2:00 a.m. on the morning following Dave's sexual assault, Lars Braun deposited Jane at the Ellensburg  Greyhound station. Braun instructed Jane to leave Ellensburg. Jane lacked money for a ticket but, after pleading  with the bus driver, received a free ride to Spokane.  [**889]  ¶13 After her return to Spokane, Jane resided with her parents, but encountered difficulty living with them.  Weeks [*763]  later, Lars Braun offered to allow Jane to live with him in Ellensburg. Late in June 2013, Jane  returned to Ellensburg to reside with Braun indefinitely. She brought her personal belongings. In the coming  months, Braun supplied Jane alcohol, and Jane furnished Braun sex. Jane continued to employ the pseudonym  “Kathy” among Braun's acquaintances. 20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *760; 502 P.3d 884, **888; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***4 Page 10 of 27   ¶14 In September 2013, Jane's monogamous sexual relationship with Lars Braun shifted. Braun expressed his  desire for group sex for his impending birthday. Although Jane did not relish the idea of a quartet of bodies, she  employed the Internet to procure an encounter with an Ephrata couple. When Braun and Jane met the couple in  their Ephrata home, Braun pressured the woman to kiss and touch Jane. The woman refused [***8]  because of  Jane's reticence. Though the foursome engaged in sexual intercourse, the lethargic Braun quickly retired to the  couch to nap, while Jane continued the assignation with the couple. Braun later told Jane that she failed him  because of the unattractive, advancing age of the Ephrata woman. Braun's comment saddened Jane. ¶15 Lars Braun told Jane that the two should locate other individuals for group sex. Jane unearthed another man- woman couple in Yakima. When the four met, Braun directed Jane to please the man as he watched. During Jane's  encounter with the male, the male grew aggressive. Despite Jane's plea to Braun to stay near, he retreated with the  woman to another room. ¶16 Jane and Lars Braun resided together in Ellensburg from late June to December 2013. During these six  months, Jane relied exclusively on Braun for food and housing. Braun supplied Jane mass quantities of alcohol. ¶17 In December 2013, Lars Braun moved to Florida without Jane. Braun never told Jane the reason behind his  cross-continent move. Jane returned to Spokane and resided again with her parents. She missed and wanted  the [*764]  company of beau Braun. While in Florida, Braun lived with his friend, Susan. ¶18 Lars Braun and Jane [***9]  distantly communicated. Braun began entreating Jane to post Craigslist ads for  sex. Jane minded Braun. An individual responded to one advertisement and offered Jane money for sex. The offer  of remuneration surprised Jane. She asked Braun why somebody would pay money for sex. In response, Braun  encouraged Jane to market sexual performances for money. Braun spoke of dating a prostitute as tantalizing.  Braun explained to Jane that he would grow bored of their exclusive relationship without the thrill of other sexual  partners. He threatened to cheat on Jane if she refused to prostitute herself. Conversely, he promised to love and  cherish till death do them part if Jane fulfilled his directions to sell her body. ¶19 Jane engaged in sexual liaisons with those that responded to her Craigslist postings while Lars Braun resided  in Florida. Lars Braun reviewed the communications between Jane and the respondents to her ads. He instructed  her on the amount to charge, which sum depended on the duration of the encounter and the nature of the act. ¶20 On one occasion, Lars Braun requested that Jane send him a photograph of herself with the john. She  humored Braun and sent a photograph. On reviewing the photo, [***10]  an incensed Braun scolded Jane for  appearing to enjoy the assignation. ¶21 In June 2014, Jane moved to Florida to reside with Lars Braun, who continued to live with Susan. Susan soon  expelled Braun and Jane from her home. For two weeks, the reunified couple then slept on an air mattress in the  outdoors. Braun found employment at a pizzeria. His boss allowed him and, by extension, Jane to sleep at the  restaurant. In the daytime when Braun did not work, the couple resigned to Braun's vehicle. After residing in the  pizza parlor, Lars Braun and Jane next dwelled in a motel.  [*765]  ¶22 While reunited in Florida, Lars Braun and Jane abused alcohol, which led to verbal and physical altercations.  After fighting with Braun on one occasion, Jane exited Braun's vehicle and walked along the street. Police  approached her. A woozy Jane yelled at the officers. The officers detained Jane and placed her in jail.  [**890]  ¶23 On Jane's release from jail, Lars Braun drove her to their motel room. Jane retired to bed early that evening  because of her employment with Panera Bread. Her job duties required her to open the bakery at 6:00 a.m. Braun  shook Jane and called her vulgar names as she attempted to slumber. Braun grabbed Jane by her [***11]  throat  and straddled her. As Braun strangled Jane, he slowly released phlegm and spittle into her face. Jane constantly  feared Braun thereafter. 20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *763; 502 P.3d 884, **889; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***7 Page 11 of 27   ¶24 On a later occasion, while Jane and Lars Braun argued, Braun smashed Jane's Nintendo Wii against the  ground. The destruction of the game console aggravated Jane because she lacked possessions and her parents  had purchased the Wii for her as a gift. An altercation ensued, and law enforcement arrived to expel the couple  from the motel room. Braun pestered Jane while she packed her belongings, which act prompted officers to  threaten him with jail. Police ordered Braun to stay away from Jane's place of work. On an ensuing day, Braun  disregarded the officers' demand and approached Jane as she left work. Jane entered Braun's vehicle. ¶25 While in Florida, Jane twice left the company of Lars Braun. She returned each time. ¶26 We move forward to the summer of 2015. During this time while still in Florida, Lars Braun directed Jane to  dress in provocative outfits. The duo would cruise bars, where Braun asked men to come home with him and have  sex with Jane. Braun did not always ask men for money in exchange for the sex. Sometimes, he procured men to  fornicate [***12]  with Jane for his enjoyment and thrill. ¶27  [*766] Jane insists that she never wished to prostitute herself. She believed that her sexual performances  with others, however, gratified Braun. During trial, when asked by the prosecution whether she believed she had a  choice to participate in the sexual encounters, Jane responded no. When asked about her claimed lack of choice,  Jane testified: Because he—he would still—he would—I was gonna suffer. He would—he would ignore me or still try to  have sex with women and do that and have me do things I didn't want to do. And I never ever felt like I could  say no. And if I did say no, it certainly wasn't going to be respected. Report of Proceedings (RP) at 219. ¶28 When sober, Jane told Lars Braun that she could not engage in sex for money. Braun then provided Jane with  alcohol and drugs. He also promised to participate in the sexual acts with her. While under the influence, Jane  relented to engage in sex with others. Braun rarely kept his promise to partake in the encounter, however. The  money gained from Jane's tricks paid for motel stays, fuel, and alcohol. ¶29 For awhile in Florida, Lars Braun and Jane stayed in separate motel rooms because of their constant  quarreling. On one evening, Braun, wanting [***13]  to reconcile with Jane, invited her to join in sex. Jane agreed.  While the two entangled in bed, Braun announced his intent to anally penetrate Jane. Jane told him no.  Nevertheless, Braun forcibly penetrated Jane's anus. The anal incursion hurt Jane. She could not sit for days. ¶30 One evening while the couple rested in a Florida motel, Jane informed Lars Braun that she intended to call her  parents on the phone provided in their room, since her cell phone had broken. Jane intended to notify her parents  about Braun's forcing her to engage in sexual relations with strangers for money. Braun reacted by yanking the  phone cord from the wall. Jane threw the phone at Braun, who bled from the impact with the phone. Jane worried  that [*767]  Braun would hit her in retaliation. Braun told Jane that, if he was a woman and she a man, law  enforcement would jail her for her conduct. Braun's comment horrified a repentant Jane, who employed the motel  lobby phone to report, to law enforcement, her assaultive behavior. She also struck herself in the nose with a beer  bottle to demonstrate her remorse to Braun. Law enforcement journeyed to the motel and arrested Jane. ¶31 Jane spent thirty-five days in a Florida jail for [***14]  assaulting Lars Braun. The Florida court issued a no- contact order between the two. Apparently Florida correction officers do not enforce no-contact orders, because  Braun twice visited Jane in jail. During his first visit, Braun voiced his everlasting  [**891]  love for Jane. On the  second visit, Braun reported that he had been fired from his job and intended to return to Ellensburg. Braun asked  Jane to call him on her release from jail. ¶32 While Jane resided in the Florida jail, motel staff disposed of all of Jane's belongings, including her Social  Security card. Jane believes that Lars Braun permitted staff to discard her possessions. After release from  incarceration in July 2015, Jane journeyed by bus to Spokane. Once in Spokane, Jane's father drove her to  Ellensburg to reunite with Braun. 20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *765; 502 P.3d 884, **890; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***11 Page 12 of 27   ¶33 In Ellensburg, Lars Braun and Jane stayed at Bill Thulean's house. Both Braun and Jane then engaged in  recreational methamphetamine use. Before leaving Florida, Jane had used methamphetamine one time. While in  Ellensburg, Jane became addicted to the controlled substance. She relied on Braun for access to the drug. Braun's  primary source was Thulean. Braun commenced referring to Jane as his “‘little meth whore’” [***15]  and parceled  drugs to her if she performed sexually the way he desired. RP at 146. ¶34 Jane's prostitution continued in Ellensburg. Lars Braun dictated the clothes and makeup that Jane wore.  Braun allowed Jane to keep twenty percent of the money she earned from her services, but he otherwise kept  all [*768]  money earned. Jane's twenty percent of the earnings went to refining her looks and to the couple's food.  Braun did not permit Jane her own phone. ¶35 Lars Braun dictated the length and nature of Jane's profitable sexual activity. If the rendezvous lasted longer  than planned, Braun punished Jane by arranging encounters with violent johns. Braun would also shun Jane for  days. If Braun concluded that Jane immensely enjoyed herself during a sexual encounter, he punished her by  insisting on sex with him immediately thereafter. ¶36 Lars Braun sometimes arranged sexual encounters for Jane without her knowledge and while using her e-mail  account. He misrepresented to Jane the nature of upcoming trysts. Braun numbered the quantity of men with which  Jane engaged in sex. Periodically he announced the number to Jane, while labeling her a slut. ¶37 Lars Braun nicknamed Jane “whore,” “‘little floozy,’” [***16]  and “‘F toy.’” RP at 243. Acquaintances referred to  Jane as Braun's property, and men asked, in Braun's presence, for the services of Jane. Braun informed Jane that,  despite his loving devotion to her, no one else liked her because of her loose morals. Braun constantly told Jane  that the only valuable asset she had to offer to the world was her body. Braun isolated Jane from her parents by  insulting them to Jane and telling Jane that her parents were ashamed of her and wanted no contact with her.  Braun insisted that Jane owed him sexual favors because of her infidelities with others. ¶38 Lars Braun once drew a bucket with sperm dripping into the bucket. He labeled the bucket with Jane's name. A  confused Jane interpreted the amount of detail Braun drew on the dribbling picture as displaying his love for her. ¶39 Sometimes Lars Braun promised Jane that, if she did as requested, he would marry her, have children with her,  and start a family with her. Jane desperately wanted children. Once Lars Braun told Jane that, if she obeyed  him [*769]  one last time, he would not demand she perform sex with another again. The promise went unfulfilled. ¶40 Although many of Jane's sexual encounters resulted in monetary payment, [***17]  Lars Braun arranged for  some rendezvouses in exchange for other goods and services. Lars Braun allowed Bill Thulean to periodically  fornicate with Jane in exchange for drugs. Jane once trysted with a man in exchange for access to a shower. On  another occasion, Jane netted the duo a temporary residence with her services. At the arrangement of Braun, Jane  performed sexual turns for cigarettes and chewing tobacco. Jane once had intercourse with a man in exchange for  Braun engaging in sex with the man's wife. When Braun's boss caught him stealing money from work, the employer  agreed to withhold calling law enforcement in exchange for sexual encounters with Jane.  [**892]  ¶41 Some of Jane's sexual encounters caused her pain or placed her in danger. When Jane complained to Lars  Braun about pain from her sexual assignations, Braun would disburse unlawful medication to her. Jane then felt  loved. ¶42 Lars Braun once left Jane alone with a man after Braun tied her to a tree. She pleaded with Braun not to leave  her alone with the john. Braun left for over an hour while he ate at a Taco Bell restaurant. On another occasion,  while Jane lay roped to a bed, a man sharpened his machete nearby. When performing fellatio [***18]  on another  man, Jane could not breathe. The man's penis penetrated her throat far enough to choke her. She vomited and  needed to swallow her vomit while the male continued to orally penetrate her, despite her striving for his attention  by tapping him from behind and kicking her legs. 20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *767; 502 P.3d 884, **891; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***14 Page 13 of 27   ¶43 Lars Braun and Jane referred to one john as “‘Trailer Guy.’” CP at 266. When angry at Jane, Braun  occasionally threatened her: “‘trailer guy is coming over.’” CP at 266. On one day, Braun scheduled a tryst at a hotel  with Trailer Guy because of Braun's ire, and Jane begged Braun not to leave the hotel room because of the john's  past history of injuring her during their sexual encounters. Braun, [*770]  nonetheless, left Jane alone in the hotel  with the man he knew would hurt her physically. ¶44 On another occasion, Lars Braun arranged for Jane to trick with two men in exchange for money to repair his  truck. The second man in the pair violently held Jane's head down on the bed. Braun knocked on the door. Jane  yelled that she was unable to stand. The man ejaculated and then released Jane's head. A bleeding Jane rose and  opened the room door for Braun. She went to the bathroom to rest from the pain. Braun followed her, [***19]   stroked Jane, and announced: “‘Now it's my turn.’” CP at 267. When Jane did not respond, he angrily shouted: “You  just F'd them and you're not even paying any attention to me.” CP at 267. She told him that she was hurt and  bleeding. She knew, however, that, despite her pain, pleasing Braun held first priority. ¶45 On one occasion, Jane bled because of a rough rendezvous. Lars Braun, despite Jane's moans from pain,  insisted on sex with her that night. ¶46 At an unidentified time, Lars Braun posted an advertisement on Craigslist for sex with two women, Jane and  another girlfriend of Braun's. The advertisement included the acronym BOGO, shorthand for “buy one, get one  free.” Jane met the other woman and concluded that the lady suffered a developmental disability. She expressed to  Bill Thulean and Braun the unseemliness of employing the lady as a prostitute. The two men laughed in response.  Jane and the second woman engaged in two encounters with men. Braun also directed the lady to have oral sex  with him and with Thulean. ¶47 Jane sometimes engaged in consensual bondage with Lars Braun. He liked to tie her to a bed. Braun permitted  others to enter the room and see Jane naked while she was restrained. ¶48 During [***20]  the pair's stay in Ellensburg in 2015-16, police occasionally responded to vociferous arguments  between the two. Because of the presence of illegal drugs in [*771]  her vicinity, Jane each time refrained from  informing law enforcement about Braun's use and abuse of her. One day in Ellensburg, during a time when the  couple occupied Lars Braun's truck, Braun slapped Jane in the face. The police responded. Jane asked law  enforcement not to press charges, however, because all of her belongings were in Braun's truck. She feared  Braun's fury if authorities arrested him. ¶49 In 2017, Lars Braun and Jane resided in Braun's deceased father's Colfax home. Braun continued to require  Jane to perform sex with others, but now without pay. The sex was only for Braun's titillation. Jane still believed she  had no choice but to obey.  ¶50 During the time in Colfax, Jane, as the result of methamphetamine use, became emaciated and decreased to  ninety pounds. She suffered from bladder infections and thinning hair. Jane experienced multiple seizures.  Nonetheless, Braun continued to schedule sexual encounters for her. The couple received methamphetamine in  return.  [**893]  Braun occasionally tied Jane to the bed and allowed his son [***21]  to view her naked. ¶51 While the couple resided in Colfax, the pair traveled to the Carolinas, where Lars Braun bought a vehicle with  money he had inherited from his father. While returning to Washington State with the purchased vehicle and at an  unidentified location, Jane suffered a seizure. A nurse, who fortuitously witnessed the convulsion, directed Jane to  the nearest hospital. While in the hospital lobby, Jane experienced another seizure, was taken to the emergency  room, and was admitted to neurology for observation. After twenty-four hours, Jane departed from the hospital, and  the couple resumed their journey to Colfax. ¶52 During the same transcontinental journey, while the two traveled in New Mexico, Lars Braun received news that  his son had died by drug overdose. The couple spent that night in a New Mexico hotel and planned to travel directly  to Pullman the next day for the son's funeral. When Jane [*772]  awoke the next morning, she felt dizzy, could  barely walk, and noticed a large blister on her face. Jane ambulated to the hotel lobby, asked the desk clerk to  summon an ambulance, and collapsed on a sofa. 20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *769; 502 P.3d 884, **892; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***18 Page 14 of 27   ¶53 New Mexico emergency responders ferried Jane to a hospital, where medical staff performed blood [***22]   work. A physician diagnosed Jane with Stevens-Johnson syndrome as a result of an adverse reaction to her  phenytoin, an antiseizure medication. Stevens-Johnson causes the epidermis, the top layer of the skin, to die and  separate. The hospital airlifted Jane to an Amarillo hospital for further treatment. Lars Braun continued on his  journey to Pullman for his son's funeral. Four days later, Jane's parents retrieved her from the Texas panhandle and  drove her to their Spokane home. Her mother described her appearance as that of a cancer patient. ¶54 On the day Jane returned to Spokane in April 2017, Lars Braun texted her to inform her that he had garnered  methamphetamine. The two rendezvoused in a Spokane hotel room and got high on meth. While together in the  room, Jane spied Braun's phone and discovered that he had been messaging a prostitute in Lewiston. Jane then  recognized her triviality to Braun. With this epiphany, she ended her relationship with Braun and returned to her  parents. ¶55 Lars Braun continued to text Jane. He pleaded with her to visit him and promised he would dispense drugs for  her. Braun offered to return Jane's personal possessions to her if she met him alone. Jane refused. [***23]  Lars  Braun e-mailed Jane's mother. He wrote the mother that, if Jane reported his conduct to anyone, Braun would  inform others of the number of people with whom Jane had sex. Braun continued with unreturned texting to Jane  until January 2018. PROCEDURE ¶56 The State of Washington charged Lars Braun with one count each of human trafficking in the first  degree, [*773]  human trafficking in the second degree, promoting prostitution in the first degree, and promoting  prostitution in the second degree. The State alleged that Braun committed all four crimes in Washington State  between July 1, 2015 and April 3, 2017. ¶57 Before trial, Lars Braun moved the trial court to dismiss the human trafficking charges. Braun argued that his  alleged conduct did not amount to “force, fraud, or coercion,” an element of Washington's trafficking statute,  RCW 9A.40.100. The trial court denied the motion. In so ruling, the court reasoned that the word “force,” as used in  the statute, included nonphysical force such as psychological pressure. Because RCW 9A.40.100 does not define  “force,” the trial court used one of many dictionary definitions to demarcate the word. ¶58 On June 8, 2020, during a pretrial hearing, the superior court judge commented about Washington [***24]   Governor Jay Inslee's order regarding COVID-19 and the judge's own mask-wearing policy: You're [everyone in the courtroom] certainly free to wear a mask in here. It's encouraged by everyone.  Please feel free. … But, I'm not requiring people, adults, to comply with the governor's order [regarding   [**894]  masks]. It's not my order to enforce. But certainly it's a good idea. RP at 50. ¶59 During the June 8, 2020 hearing, the State requested a continuance due to Seattle Police Detective Maurice  Washington's unavailability to testify as a human trafficking expert. The State informed the court that, due to riots  in Seattle over George Floyd's death, Detective Washington's superior ordered him to remain in Seattle. The trial  court denied the State's continuance motion. In return, Lars Braun motioned for the exclusion of Detective Maurice  Washington's testimony rather than allow him to testify remotely. The court reserved ruling on Braun's motion. ¶60  [*774] On June 11, 2020, the case proceeded to a bench trial. At the beginning of trial, the trial judge reiterated  his mask-wearing policy: My policy is—is slightly different than the governor's policy. He wants everybody who is indoors to be  wearing a mask at all [***25]  times. Even if they sit—sit—social distancing guidelines are met. I think adults  are able to run their own lives, and so I'll let you folks decide how you want to do it in this courtroom. RP at 67-68. Near the close of the State's case, the trial court granted Lars Braun's motion to exclude Detective  Maurice Washington's testimony regarding human trafficking. 20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *772; 502 P.3d 884, **893; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***21 Page 15 of 27   ¶61 Before the superior court judge delivered its decision, the judge commented about COVID-19 and pandemics in  general: The world is sure in a turmoil right now, isn't it, with Covid 19, with the unprecedented—which means “never  happened before”, not in my lifetime, not in the lifetime of my parents, who are both in their 80s. Theoretically it  happened in 1917. We don't really know because the newspaper reporting back then was somewhat  sensationalized; similar to today. But the public health response to that crises was different than this one. RP at 295. The judge also mentioned the uncertainty in the judicial system resulting from the perceived pandemic: Thus, we're here. We're doing a bench trial for Mr. Braun, not a jury trial, because we can't say when we're  going to have the ability to bring jurors back into the courthouse. Wow. Wow. Uncertainty. [***26]  RP at 295-96. ¶62 Before rendering his decision, the superior court judge discussed the George Floyd protests occurring in  Seattle in May and June 2020: This very case is touched by another crisis that's going on 105 miles away from here in Seattle right this very  minute. There are blocks, city blocks, of the largest city in our State that [*775]  are in anarchy. There is no law.  Or perhaps there is law; it's just not the law that we're used to. Someone else is deciding what the law is, not  us, as the people who are in charge of the sovereign. So I've been thinking about these things a lot. RP at 296 (emphasis added). We have blocks and blocks in Seattle this second that caused it so a witness couldn't come to this trial  because he's a police officer and he can't break away to come down here. He's got—he's got to police the City  of Seattle. And it's not going so well if people don't want to follow the rules. Psychologically. Right? RP at 298 (emphasis added). ¶63 The trial court found Lars Braun guilty of human trafficking in the first degree and promoting prostitution in  the first degree. The court acquitted Braun of the lesser included offenses of second degree human trafficking and  second degree promoting prostitution. ¶64 The trial court [***27]  entered findings of fact and conclusions of law. Lars Braun does not challenge any of the  findings of fact. We, however, quote those findings relevant to his use of force and his forceful conduct causing  Jane to engage in sexual acts. We repeat some of the facts already written because Braun contends the findings do  not support his conviction for human trafficking and we wish to meet this contention. ¶65 The trial court found, among other facts:  [**895] While living in Florida, they [Lars Braun and Jane] … had several violent encounters where the  police were called. CP at 257. While drunk, the defendant … on one occasion strangulat[ed] her [Jane]. While he was on top of her, he spit  phlegm and saliva all over her face, refusing to let her sleep, every time she would fall asleep, he would wake  her up, even though she had to be at work at 4 a.m. the next morning. From this point [*776]  forward, she was  afraid of the defendant, this event always in her mind. CP at 258. On one occasion in Florida when they were fighting, he told her he was going to “F-[her] in the ass right  [there].” She told him no, but he forced his penis into her anus with no lubrication. It was very painful for her. CP at 258 (alterations in original). One [***28]  time in their truck in Ellensburg, he slapped her in the [face] … . CP at 261. 20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *774; 502 P.3d 884, **894; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***25 Page 16 of 27   There were particular Johns who were mean to the victim, including one they referred to as “Trailer Guy,”  and he [Lars Braun] would threaten her [Jane] by saying, “trailer guy is coming over,” if he [Braun] were [sic]  angry at her. One time he arranged a meeting at a hotel with trailer guy because he was angry at [Jane] and  she begged him not to leave the hotel room because she was afraid of how Trailer Guy always physically hurt  her during their sexual encounters, but the defendant left her alone in the hotel with the man he knew would  hurt her physically. CP at 266. The victim [Jane] became completely dependent upon the defendant. All of her belongings were in his truck.  She did not drive. She felt that she had no choice but to do what he wanted, if she did not, she would suffer. CP at 266. On one occasion, the defendant arranged for [Jane] to have sex with two men in exchange for money to  repair their truck. The defendant told her she had to do it because they needed the money to fix the truck. In  the encounter with the second man, he was very violent to the victim and took longer than the defendant was  expecting. [***29]  The man was holding [Jane]'s head down on the bed and the defendant came and knocked  on the [*777]  door [Jane] yelled to him that she could not get up. The man ejaculated and the victim got up  and let the defendant into the room. She went to the bathroom where she was bleeding from the violent  encounter with the [j]ohn and in a lot of pain. The defendant started touching her saying, “Now it's my turn.”  When she did not respond, he got angry and yelled at her, “You just F'd them and you‘re not even paying any  attention to me.” She told him that she was hurt and bleeding. She knew that no matter how she felt, making  the defendant happy was the priority. CP at 267. In December 2016 or January 2017, the defendant's father died, and [Jane] and the defendant moved into  his deceased father's house in Colfax, Washington. At that point, the defendant continued to advertise and  offer [Jane] to people for sexual encounters, but no longer got money; he just forced her to have sex with  strangers for his own sexual gratification. Even without them paying him, [Jane] believed that she had no  choice but to continue to have sex with the strangers who the defendant arranged for and did not believe she  could [***30]  say no. CP at 268 (emphasis added). The defendant would tie [Jane] to the bed in the bedroom in Colfax. CP at 269. The court also found: While they were together, [Jane] believed she could not live without him based on what he had told her while  they were together and the way he controlled her money, drugs, food, and every facet of her life. She believed  that no one else would be willing or able to love her because he repeatedly told her that. … In their time   [**896]  together, her self-esteem was completely destroyed. CP at 270. ¶66 The trial court entered the following conclusions of law, some which could also be read in part as findings of  fact or mixed findings and conclusions:  [*778] 3.1. On or between July 1, 2015 and April 3[, 2017], the defendant: 3.1.1. Recruited, transported, transferred, provided, obtained, bought, purchased, and/or received by any  means [Jane] knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that force, fraud, or coercion would be used to  cause [Jane] to engage in a sexually explicit act or a commercial sex act; or 3.1.1.1. The force/fraud/coercion used to include [sic] during the hundreds of incidents of sexual  trafficking described by [Jane]. 3.1.1.2. The defendant lied to her about [***31]  what was happening 3.1.1.3. The defendant bound the victim (tied her up) 20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *776; 502 P.3d 884, **895; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***28 Page 17 of 27   3.1.1.4. The defendant exerted psychological force through controlling her money, her phone, her drugs,  her transportation, and her self-esteem 3.1.1.5. There was evidence of physical coercion as well, including an immediate threat to physically harm,  restrain, or destroy [Jane]'s property 3.1.1.6. The victim was afraid of the defendant … . 3.2. That these acts or this venture involved sexual motivation 3.2.1. The evidence supporting sexual motivation include that the first time she had sex with someone she  did not want to was for his Birthday in September of 2013 and from that point forward he would tell her  consistently and repeatedly that it turned him on for her to be with a promiscuous woman, and 3.3. That any of these acts occurred in the State of Washington. . … 4.1. That on or between July 1, 2015—April 3, 2017, the defendant 4.1.1. [K]nowingly advanced prostitution by compelling [Jane] by threat or force to engage in prostitution  or profited from prostitution resulting from such threat or such force, and 4.1.2. That any of these acts occurred in the State of Washington. CP at 272-74 (emphasis added).  [*779]  ¶67 The trial [***32]  court conducted a sentencing hearing. The court calculated Lars Braun's offender score at  one, based on his sole prior conviction for possession of a controlled substance. The trial court imposed a sentence  of 184 months' confinement for the human trafficking charge and 34 months' confinement for the promoting of  prostitution charge. The sentences run concurrently. LAW AND ANALYSIS ¶68 On appeal, Lars Braun challenges his two convictions and his sentence. Braun also objects to the superior  court judge's comments about COVID-19 and the George Floyd protests. He asserts that those remarks establish  an appearance of unfairness that infected the entire proceeding. We begin by analyzing the validity of Braun's  conviction for human trafficking. Human Trafficking ¶69 Lars Braun contends on appeal that the trial court misconstrued the word “force” used within RCW 9A.40.100,  Washington's human trafficking statute, and the misinterpretation renders the statute void for vagueness. In turn,  Braun maintains that, under a correct construction of RCW 9A.40.100, the State presented insufficient evidence to  show he violated the statute's element of the imposition of force, coercion, or fraud against the victim. Finally,  according to Braun, [***33]  the State failed to prove that any force, fraud, or coercion caused Jane to engage in  commercial sex. Before deciphering RCW 9A.40.100 and before deciding whether sufficient evidence supports a  conviction, we outline the legislative history and the purpose behind RCW 9A.40.100.

The federal statute and numerous state statutes in general penalize one who recruits, harbors,  transports, transfers, provides, obtains, or receives by any means another person knowing that force, fraud, or  coercion will be used to cause the person to engage in forced labor, involuntary servitude, a sexually explicit act,  or a commercial [***34]  sex act. Marjorie A. Shields, Annotation, Validity, Construction, and Application of State  Statutes Proscribing Human Trafficking, 101 A.L.R.6th 417, 417 (2015). The federal statute reads: Whoever knowingly … in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, … recruits, entices, harbors,  transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any means a person … knowing,  or … in reckless disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of force, fraud, … or any combination of  such means will be used to cause the person to engage in a commercial sex act, … shall be punished as  provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). ¶72 In 2003, Washington became the first state to outlaw human trafficking. BB,W DC,SCCST:RC APAST (RCW 43.280.091), at 4 (2014) [https://perma.cc/LR7X-QSZH];  L 2003, ch. 267, § 1 (codified as RCW 9A.40.100). The Washington Legislature adopted the measure in  response to the murders of Filipina mail-order brides in Washington State in the 1990s and early 2000s. Velma  Veloria, The Road to H.B. 1175: Making Human Trafficking [*781]  a Crime in the State of Washington, My Story,  9SJ.S.J. 549, 549-50 (2011). ¶73 Washington's statute, RCW 9A.40.100, declares, in relevant part: (1) A person is guilty of trafficking [***35]  in the first degree when: (a) Such person: (i) Recruits, harbors, transports, transfers, provides, obtains, buys, purchases, or receives by any means  another person knowing, or in reckless disregard of the fact, (A) that force, fraud, or coercion as defined in  RCW 9A.36.070 will be used to cause the person to engage in: (I) Forced labor; . … (III) A sexually explicit act; or (IV) A commercial sex act, or … (ii) Benefits financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a venture that has engaged in  acts set forth in (a)(i) of this subsection; and (b) The acts or venture set forth in (a) of this subsection: . … (ii) Involve a finding of sexual motivation under RCW 9.94A.835. (Emphasis added.) The state act differs from the federal statute in that the state statute omits the phrase “threats of  force” from the list of methods employed to cause the victim to engage in commercial sex. ¶74 For purposes of the prosecution of Lars Braun, the State sought to prove the crime's elements of (1) recruiting,  harboring, transporting, transferring, obtaining, purchasing, or retaining Jane (2) while knowing or in reckless  disregard of the fact (3) that force, fraud, or coercion will be used (4) to cause Jane [***36]  to engage in (5) forced  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *780; 502 P.3d 884, **897; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***33 Page 19 of 27   labor, a sexually explicit act, or a commercial sex act (6) with a sexual or financial motivation. This appeal focuses  on the second, third, and fourth elements. Braun does not challenge  [**898]  the [*782]  sufficiency of evidence for  purposes of elements one, five, and six. Force ¶75 The third element of RCW 9A.40.100 identifies three nouns, “force,” “fraud,” and “coercion,” as the cause for  commercial sex. Despite the inclusion of the terms “fraud” and “coercion” in the statute, the parties focus on the  word “force” and dispute the meaning of the term in the context of the statute. ¶76 The trial court found that Lars Braun engaged in all three activities: force, fraud, and coercion. Thus, we might  limit our review to whether the evidence supported a conviction for the use of “fraud” or “coercion” and thereby  avoid defining “force,” while circumventing a weighing of the sufficiency of evidence for a finding of force. HN1[ ]  Following a bench trial, when a single offense can be committed by alternative methods, a conviction may rest on  proof that the crime was committed by any one of the means charged. State v. Munson, 120 Wn. App. 103, 107, 83  P.3d 1057 (2004). We proceed to assess the sufficiency of evidence of force anyway for two reasons. First, we  question [***37]  whether RCW 9A.40.100 presents alternative means. Second, Braun challenges the sufficiency of  evidence under each potential means and claims insufficient evidence established causation under either of the  three nouns. We, however, avoid definitively circumscribing “force” because, under any of the definitions forwarded  by the parties, the evidence supports the trial court's finding. ¶77 The parties may assume that RCW 9A.40.100's employment of the disjunctive “or” when listing “force,” “fraud,”  and “coercion,” suggests that the statute creates alternative means for committing the crime. We question whether  “force” should be isolated and construed separately from the other methods of triggering commercial sex. Courts  sometimes read the disjunctive “or” as denoting an [*783]  alternative means crime. HN2[ ] Nevertheless, the use  of “or” does not always signify alternate means. State v. Barboza-Cortes, 194 Wn.2d 639, 643-44, 451 P.3d 707  (2019). Instead, courts ask whether each noun describes distinct acts that amount to the same crime. State v.  Sandholm, 184 Wn.2d 726, 732, 364 P.3d 87 (2015). The more varied the criminal conduct, the more likely the  statute describes alternative means. State v. Barboza-Cortes, 194 Wn.2d 639, 644 (2019). When the statute  describes minor nuances inhering in the same act, the more likely the various alternatives are merely facets of the  same criminal conduct. State v. Sandholm, 184 Wn.2d 726, 732 (2015). ¶78 Generally [***38]  the three words “force,” “fraud,” and “coercion” connote divergent acts, but we notice a  common theme among these three nouns in the milieu of human trafficking. HN3[ ] Trafficking comprises the  concept of a human being's will being subjugated to the will of another. United States v. Lewis, 644 F. Supp. 1391,  1403 (W.D. Mich. 1986), aff'd sub nom. United States v. King, 840 F.2d 1276 (6th Cir. 1988). In the context of  sexual trafficking, the victim believes that she lacks a viable alternative but to perform services for the master.  Force, coercion, and fraud all lead to a vanquished independence and destroyed spirit and generally combine to  effectuate sexual trafficking. Thus, we could analyze the appeal as if force, coercion, and fraud all equate to  usurping one's willpower. ¶79 Neither RCW 9A.40.100 nor a related statute defines “force.” Lars Braun argues that the trial court committed  legal error when construing the word “force” in the trafficking statute to include nonphysical force. Even if we  adopted Braun's reading of the statute as requiring physical force, the overwhelming, if not undisputed, facts show  that Lars Braun employed corporeal force against Jane and that he knew force would compel her to engage in  commercial sex. WA[1][ ] [1] ¶80 To repeat, Lars Braun does not challenge any of the trial court's findings of fact as  unsupported [***39]  by the evidence.  [*784]  Instead, Braun argues that the findings do not support the trial court's  conclusions of law that he committed the crime. HN4[ ] We treat unchallenged findings as verities on appeal.  State v. Allen, 138 Wn. App. 463, 468, 157 P.3d 893 (2007).  [**899]  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *781; 502 P.3d 884, **897; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***36 Page 20 of 27   ¶81 The trial court entered many findings of fact about Lars Braun imposing physical force on Jane. Braun and  Jane had violent encounters, during which someone summoned law enforcement. Braun strangulated Jane. Braun  anally raped Jane. Braun slapped Jane in the face. Braun tied Jane to a tree and left her alone with a john while he  ventured to Taco Bell for more than one hour. Braun tied Jane to the Colfax bed and other divans of repose. WA[2,3][ ] [2, 3] ¶82 HN5[ ] Physical assaults by the defendant on the victim constitute force for purposes of  human trafficking. United States v. Wilkins, 538 F. Supp. 3d 49, 73 (D.D.C. 2021). Lars Braun's assaults on Jane  led to sex with Braun, not only commercial sex with johns. The defendant may be both the perpetrator of the  force, fraud, or coercion and the beneficiary of the sexual act. Ardolf v. Weber, 332 F.R.D. 467, 475-76 (S.D.N.Y.  2019). ¶83 Lars Braun employed physical violence perpetrated by other men to compel sexual performances from Jane.  When Jane perturbed Braun, Braun solicited violent men to engage with Jane. Trailer Guy physically hurt Jane, and  Braun issued threats of trysts with sex with [***40]  Trailer Guy. When having intercourse for truck repairs, a man  violently struck the bed next to Jane's head. The language of the human trafficking statutes allows for a conviction  even when the defendant did not personally use force, fraud, or coercion as long as he knew someone would use  such means. United States v. Todd, 627 F.3d 329, 336 (9th Cir. 2010) (Smith, J., concurring). ¶84 The only Washington reported decision applying RCW 9A.40.100, State v. Clark, 170 Wn. App. 166, 283 P.3d  1116 (2012), did not need to identify the nature or demarcate the extent of force needed for a conviction. Since  RCW 9A.40.100 echoes the federal human trafficking statute and because  [*785]  State v. Clark provides limited  guidance, we review federal cases to assist in determining whether evidence supported a finding or conclusion of  force against Jane. In his brief, Lars Braun often relies on federal decisions. The Washington antitrafficking statute  references federal trafficking statutes in its legislative history. See FB.R.SH.B. 1175 58th  Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2003), http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2003-04/Pdf/Bill%20Reports/House/1175- S.FBR.pdf?q=20210128094842. ¶85 The conduct of Johnelle Lewis Bell, in United States v. Bell, 761 F.3d 900 (8th Cir. 2014), parallels the facts  behind the prosecution of Lars Braun. A jury convicted Bell of, among other crimes, sex trafficking [***41]  in  violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Bell met victim Jennifer Olewnik at a bar. Bell informed Olewnik that he was going  through a divorce, and the two began an intimate relationship. Bell asked Olewnik if she was interested in working  as a prostitute. Bell assured Olewnik that the two would continue with a committed, intimate relationship despite  her trade. He would care for her and help her regain custody of her daughter, and they would beget children  together. With these assurances, Olewnik agreed to prostitute herself. Bell advertised for Olewnik‘s services on  the Backpage website. Bell later began physically assaulting Olewnik. When Olewnik refused to prostitute at a  truck stop, Bell told Olewnik she lacked a choice and struck her with a belt. Olewnik complied. Bell repeated this  conduct with three other women, one to whom he wrote poetry expressing his love. When Olewnik discovered that  Bell engaged in sex with one of the other women, she confronted Bell and threatened to call law enforcement. Bell  slapped Olewnik in the face and choked her. On one occasion, Bell beat Olewnik for falling asleep while performing  a trick. Bell insisted that Olewnik perform anal sex with johns. Olewnik performed sex, [***42]  at the request of  Bell, so that the money earned would purchase narcotics for both of them. At trial, Olewnik announced her [*786]   continuing love for Bell and her hope he would fulfill his promises to her. ¶86 On appeal, Johnelle Lewis Bell argued that the government presented insufficient evidence to convict him of  trafficking. He contended that no evidence showed that he knew that force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion  would compel Olewnik and the other victims to perform commercial sex acts. He contended that the women  engaged in the sex acts because of their love for him. According to Bell, the fact that two of the  [**900]  women left  his company established that he did not force them against their will to perform. ¶87 The federal circuit court, in United States v. Bell, concluded that the government proved force, under the  federal human trafficking statute, because Bell physically assaulted the women when they disobeyed him. The  assaults caused the women to perform more sex acts for Bell. 20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *784; 502 P.3d 884, **899; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***39 Page 21 of 27   ¶88 In United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d 584 (7th Cir. 2017), McKenzie Carson trafficked a seventeen-year-old girl  in part by isolating her from her mother and not allowing her to access a phone. Carson manipulated three other  women, who were drug users, desperate for drugs, and homeless. [***43]  When entreating her to traffic her body,  Carson promised one woman, Veronica Del Valle, that she could keep all money she made. Carson instead kept  almost all of Del Valle's money. He supplied her drugs. He took her cell phone. He beat her with belts, slapped her  face, gave her black eyes, and anally raped her. Carson warned Del Valle not to leave him or he would kill her  children. ¶89 On appeal, in United States v. Carson, McKenzie Carson contended that the women willingly agreed to work  for him as prostitutes. They turned to him for emotional support. The court did not deem the women's repeated  turning to Carson for support important. Victims of sex trafficking may make decisions that look voluntary at times due to the incredible weight of  coercion and [*787]  force upon them. And they may make some decisions along the way that are truly  voluntary. Those decisions do not take away from the fact that they have been held hostage, coerced, forced,  or threatened to engage in commercial sexual acts. Sometimes that coercion and force may be subtle,  leading a fact-finder to have to decipher whether the mens rea has been met. But this is not such a case. There  is nothing subtle about rape, beatings, death threats, and taking [***44]  women's clothes and phones so that  they cannot readily escape. Carson kept these victims under his control by using a tightly woven web of rape,  physical assault, threats, manipulation, isolation, and fear. United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d at 591. ¶90 McKenzie Carson, like Lars Braun, also claimed that he did not know the women worked for him from force.  The court answered: Had Carson truly subjectively believed (whether correctly or not) that the victims were voluntarily working for  him as prostitutes, he would have had no reason to rape, beat and threaten them, to take their telephones,  clothing, shoes and control their access to drugs. United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d at 594. ¶91 Lars Braun's relationship with Jane included bondage. Jane in fact consented to some bondage acts, but she  testified that Braun went beyond her consent. Braun argues that this encroachment on consent constituted a mere  betrayal in their relationship, rather than force supporting a conviction for human trafficking. He also complains  that the legislature never intended RCW 9A.40.100 to apply to domestic violence offenses and ordinary  prostitution offenses. ¶92 In United States v. Marcus, 487 F. Supp. 2d 289 (E.D.N.Y. 2007), vacated, 538 F.3d 97 (2d Cir. 2008), rev'd  and remanded, 560 U.S. 258, 130 S. Ct. 2159, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1012 (2010), the complaining witness began a  consensual bondage, dominance, and sadism relationship with Glenn Marcus. Marcus later [***45]  employed force  and coercion to prevent  [*788]  her from leaving and to engage in sexual conduct that Marcus and others  photographed and placed on a website. Marcus derived financial benefit from the photographs. The court rejected  Marcus' contention that Congress did not intend the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to apply to conduct that  occurred within an intimate, domestic relationship. ¶93 Lars Braun contends that the State may not rely on any assaults that occurred in Florida. He does not cite any  authority for this argument, however. We anticipate that any court faced with this contention would rule to the  contrary as long as at least one of the acts of assault occurred in the home state or if the assaults in another state  led to commercial sex in the home state. We do not  [**901]  address the argument because some of the physical  force and much of the prostitution occurred in Washington State. Coercion 20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *786; 502 P.3d 884, **900; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***42 Page 22 of 27   WA[4][ ] [4] ¶94 We also conclude that sufficient evidence supports a conviction of Lars Braun for human  trafficking based on his use of coercion within the meaning of RCW 9A.40.100. Another statute, RCW 9A.36.070,  defines “coercion” as follows: (1) A person is guilty of coercion if by use of a threat he or she compels or induces a person to engage in  conduct which the latter [***46]  has a legal right to abstain from, or to abstain from conduct which he or she  has a legal right to engage in. (2) “Threat” as used in this section means: (a) To communicate, directly or indirectly, the intent immediately to use force against any person who is  present at the time; or (b) Threats as defined in RCW 9A.04.110[28] (a), (b), or (c). (Emphasis added.) In turn, RCW 9A.04.110 defines the term “threat” as used in RCW 9A.40.100: (28) “Threat” means to communicate, directly or indirectly the intent:  [*789] (a) To cause bodily injury in the future to the person threatened or to any other person; or (b) To cause physical damage to the property of a person other than the actor; or (c) To subject the person threatened or any other person to physical confinement or restraint. HN6[ ] Since RCW 9A.36.070(2)(b) incorporates the definition in RCW 9A.40.110, the threat, for a human  trafficking conviction, need not be of immediate force but can include threats of bodily injury in the future. ¶95 We look to State v. Clark, 170 Wn. App. 166 (2012), and federal decisions to confirm the use of coercion. In  Clark, this court found the State proved coercion because of the repeated beatings by DeShawn Clark of the  victim, which led to the victim fearing for her safety if she did not obey Clark's commands. The court found  coercion even though the victim [***47]  left Clark's company and voluntarily returned because of love. According  to one federal decision, the opportunity to escape, and even a successful escape, does not preclude a finding of  involuntary servitude. United States v. Mussry, 726 F.2d 1448, 1454 (9th Cir. 1984). ¶96 When enacting the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, Congress desired the means of compelling commercial  sex to apply to not only overt beatings but more subtle means designed to cause victims to believe that serious  harm will result to themselves or others if they leave the defendant. United States v. Marcus, 487 F. Supp. 2d 289,  301 (E.D.N.Y. 2007). Congress intended to reach cases when the trafficker holds another in a condition of servitude  through nonviolent coercion. United States v. Dann, 652 F.3d 1160, 1169 (9th Cir. 2011); United States v. Bradley,  390 F.3d 145, 150 (1st Cir. 2004); United States v. Marcus, 487 F. Supp. 2d 289, 302 (E.D.N.Y. 2007). The  methods of subjugating people's wills now include subtle, more effective forms of coercion. United States v.  Mussry, 726 F.2d 1448, 1452 (9th Cir. 1984). A pattern intended to cause a person  [*790]  to believe that failure to  perform an act of commercial sex would result in serious harm constitutes evidence of coercion. United States v.  Campbell, 6 F.4th 764, 775 (8th Cir. 2014) (as amended July 26, 2021). The phenomenon that force leads to  coercion because of the atmosphere of ongoing beatings illustrates the proximity of the concepts of force and  coercion in the context of human trafficking. ¶97 The federal appeals court, in United States v. Bell, 761 F.3d 900 (8th Cir. 2014), discussed above, agreed that  the government proved force because Johnelle Lewis Bell physically assaulted [***48]  the women when they  disobeyed him. The court also found that Bell coerced them into sex acts by implied threats of more assaults. WA[5][ ] [5] ¶98 Lars Braun supplied alcohol and methamphetamine to Jane in order to procure and market her  sexual services. When Jane became addicted to methamphetamine, Braun withheld dispensing of the  [**902]   drug until Jane performed. In United States v. Mack, 808 F.3d 1074 (6th Cir. 2015), the court affirmed a conviction  of a defendant who coerced the victims into prostituting themselves by initially supplying them with drugs under the  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *788; 502 P.3d 884, **901; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***45 Page 23 of 27   false pretense they were free. HN7[ ] Supplying of drugs shows manipulation and control of the victim. United  States v. Betts, 911 F.3d 523, 530 (8th Cir. 2018); United States v. Campbell, 49 F.3d 1079, 1084 (5th Cir. 1995). Fraud ¶99 RCW 9A.40.100 does not define “fraud” for purposes of human trafficking. This court, when reviewing another  criminal statute, declined to define “fraud” because of the word's common understanding. State v. Stacy, 181 Wn.  App. 553, 572, 326 P.3d 136 (2014). HN8[ ] Federal cases examining human trafficking by fraud require  “material misrepresentations” used to compel the victim. United States v. Maynes, 880 F.3d 110, 113 (4th Cir.  2018). A false statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence or is capable [*791]  of influencing the  intended target. United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509, 115 S. Ct. 2310, 132 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1995). ¶100 The federal circuit court, in United States v. Bell, 761 F.3d 900 (8th Cir. 2014), previously outlined, ruled that  Johnelle Bell also used fraud because he misrepresented his love for his three victims and his intent to care [***49]   for each to the exclusion of the others. Bell preyed on vulnerable women. In United States v. Mack, 808 F.3d 1074  (6th Cir. 2015), the court affirmed a conviction of a defendant who led victims into prostituting themselves by initially  supplying them with drugs under the false pretense the substances were free. WA[6][ ] [6] ¶101 Lars Braun defrauded Jane by manipulation, false promises, and lies to induce her to engage in  prostitution. He told Jane she was his girlfriend, but then hid their relationship from his acquaintances. Braun  promised her that he would love her if she had sex with other people for money. Braun told her that, if she  performed as he desired, he would marry her and beget children with her, both events that she desperately desired.  Based on his representations, Jane believed Braun loved her. Braun deceptively used Jane's e-mail address to  procure johns. He did not inform Jane of the parameters of sex he promised the johns. Braun deceived Jane about  advertisements he posted offering her for sex exploits. He told her that no one else valued her and then isolated  her. The evidence amply supported the trial court's finding and legal conclusion of fraud. Causation ¶102 Next Lars Braun contends that insufficient evidence supported the trial court's [***50]  conclusion that any  force, fraud, or coercion caused Jane to participate in commercial sexual acts. Stated differently, according to  Braun, the evidence lacked a connection between his violence, threats of violence, and misrepresentations  sufficient to compel Jane to engage in prostitution.  [*792]  ¶103 To repeat, Lars Braun does not challenge any findings of fact. The trial court's findings mention Jane's initial  hesitancy in performing sex for money; Braun's early insistence that Jane prostitute herself or else he would cheat  on her; his promise to love her if she garnered profits through sex; Jane's later constant fear of Braun because of  his violence; Braun's demand that she incur income to pay for the couple's food, gas, lodging, and copious amounts  of alcohol; Braun's withholding of methamphetamine and food until she completed a trick; Jane's refusal to report  Braun to law enforcement because of the anger that would result; Braun's misrepresentation of a john's expected  sex acts before she serviced the john; his pressuring her for sexual favors because she had been sexually active  with others; and Braun's grabbing of Jane on one occasion when she hid in a back room from a man seeking  favors. [***51]  ¶104 Jane obeyed Braun's demands because of fear of the resultant trouble. When Jane disobeyed one of Braun's  rules, Braun ignored her for days, engaged in sex with other women, and yelled at her. Jane became completely  dependent on Braun for food, alcohol, and her drug of choice, and Braun withheld these needs and desires from  Jane. Jane could not drive. Braun possessed all of her belongings. He took all of her money. In  [**903]  short, like  other victims of human trafficking, the force, fraud, and coercion caused Jane to rigorously obey Braun‘s whims,  including participation in commercial sex. She had no choice. 20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *790; 502 P.3d 884, **902; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***48 Page 24 of 27   WA[7][ ] [7] ¶105 Lars Braun's argument of lack of causation fails to recognize the unspeakable ruin he wreaked  on another human being's life. He instead challenges this court to, before affirming his guilt, dissect individual acts  of sex performed by Jane and then identify one act of force, fraud, or coercion that caused that discrete act. But  human trafficking does not lend itself to this atomization of cause and effect. The victim engages in all of her acts  because of the triumph by the pimpish padrone over her personality, autonomy, spirituality, humanity, individuality,  and free [*793]  choice. This triumph results [***52]  from the trafficker's masterminding a sweeping environment of  force, coercion, cheating, dishonesty, degradation, and self-loathing. In this opinion, we outlined the prosecution's  extensive facts to demonstrate the ability of one man, through persistent domineering and deceptive demeanor, to  control another's willpower. ¶106 HN9[ ] Given the realities of various forms of coercion to which sex traffickers subject their victims, courts  recognize that traffickers often force victims to continue prostituting by creating an environment of fear and  dependence through the use of threats of violence, actual violence, and various forms of manipulation against  them. United States v. Wilkins, 538 F. Supp. 3d 49, 72 (D.D.C. 2021). When evaluating if a defendant exerted  coercive force over a complainant, the trier of fact should evaluate the totality of a defendant's conduct toward a  trafficking victim, including any threats or specific instances of past violence that may have created a culture of  fear that renders the victim's acts involuntary. United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d 584, 600 (7th Cir. 2017). ¶107 Lars Braun anally raped Jane on one occasion. In United States v. Carson, the court recognized the  defendant's rape of the victim as evidence that the defendant's conduct led to sex acts performed by the victim. The  rape sent the message that “‘I control [***53]  you and can do as I please.’” United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d at  600. WA[8][ ] [8] ¶108 HN10[ ] RCW 9A.40.100 does not require that the State prove that any sexual act actually  occurred. Because the statute employs the future tense, the sex act is not an element of the offense. United States  v. Maynes, 880 F.3d 110, 114 (4th Cir. 2018). The offender completes the crime when he recruits, entices, harbors,  transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains, patronizes, or solicits a person knowing, or in reckless  disregard thereof, that means of force, fraud, or coercion of such means will be used to cause the person to  engage in a commercial sex act. United States  [*794]  v. Maynes, 880 F.3d 110, 114 (4th Cir. 2018). A defendant  commits the crime of trafficking even if the commercial sex act comes in the future as long as he knew that force,  fraud, or coercion would be employed to cause the victim to engage in the act. United States v. Todd, 627 F.3d  329, 334 (9th Cir. 2010). Lars Braun recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, advertised, and maintained Jane  while knowing that he and others would impose force, coercion, and fraud on her for her sexual favors. ¶109 United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d 584 (7th Cir. 2017), earlier reviewed, answers Lars Braun's contention that  the State failed to prove causation. McKenzie Carson also argued that the evidence did not support a finding that  the women engaged in commercial sex due to force. The court replied: No rational person could witness such force [***54]  and coercion, let alone inflict it himself, without  knowing or recklessly disregarding the fact that the threats and force of threats and coercion, or any  combination of them, caused these women to engage in commercial sex acts. United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d at 594. Vagueness ¶110 Lars Braun next contends that, if this court applies a definition of “force” in RCW 9A.40.100 that includes  emotional manipulation, the statute becomes unconstitutionally vague as applied. Because we do not adopt any  definition of force that includes  [**904]  nonphysical force, we need not address this contention. Promotion of Prostitution WA[9][ ] [9] ¶111 Lars Braun requests reversal of his conviction for promoting prostitution in the first degree  because the State presented insufficient evidence that he used “threat or force” to induce Jane into prostitution,  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *792; 502 P.3d 884, **903; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***51 Page 25 of 27   as required by [*795]  RCW 9A.88.070. RCW 9A.88.070 governs first degree promoting prostitution. The statute  reads, in relevant part: (1) A person is guilty of promoting prostitution in the first degree if he or she knowingly advances  prostitution: (a) By compelling a person by threat or force to engage in prostitution or profits from prostitution which  results from such threat or force. (Emphasis added.) RCW 9A.04.110 defines “threat”: (28) “Threat” means to communicate, directly [***55]  or indirectly the intent: (a) To cause bodily injury in the future to the person threatened or to any other person; or (b) To cause physical damage to the property of a person other than the actor; or (c) To subject the person threatened or any other person to physical confinement or restraint; or . … (j) To do any other act which is intended to harm substantially the person threatened or another with respect  to his or her health, safety, business, financial condition, or personal relationships. ¶112 HN11[ ] To prove a threat, the State need not present evidence of an explicit communicated threat. Threats  can include nonverbal threats. State v. Pinkney, 2 Wn. App. 2d 574, 579, 411 P.3d 406 (2018). WA[10][ ] [10] ¶113 The State's argument of sufficiency of evidence for promoting prostitution mirrors its  contention in favor of affirming Lars Braun's guilt for human trafficking. According to the State, Braun employed  threats of force and the withholding of food and drugs to prompt Jane to engage in acts of prostitution. On one  occasion, he destroyed her property in order to gain control over her activities. For many of the same reasons that  we rule that the evidence suffices to convict Braun of human trafficking, we hold that the evidence supports his  conviction for promoting prostitution. [***56]   [*796]  ¶114 In State v. Simon, 64 Wn. App. 948, 831 P.2d 139 (1991), aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 120  Wn.2d 196, 840 P.2d 172 (1992), the court considered force applied by Simon to the victim, when she mentioned  leaving him, sufficient for a conviction of promoting prostitution. A law enforcement officer also testified to the  unwritten rules between a pimp and a prostitute whereby the latter receives physical punishment for leaving the  pimp. Appearance of Fairness ¶115 Lars Braun asserts that the trial judge violated the appearance of fairness doctrine when uttering comments  from the bench. Before trial, the judge mentioned Governor Jay Inslee's order regarding COVID-19. Nevertheless,  the trial judge gave everyone a choice of whether to wear a mask while in the courtroom. The court questioned the  occurrence of the 1917 pandemic. Thereafter, the trial judge lamented the George Floyd protests in Seattle. After  informing courtroom attendees that they need not obey the governor's order, the judge complained of anarchy and  the lack of law. He ended by commenting that he had often pondered those subjects recently. Lars Braun argues  that, based on the totality of the trial judge's statements, the judge viewed this case as an opportunity to reassert  law and order during uncertain [***57]  and chaotic times by convicting him. ¶116 All of the trial court's comments occurred before the court's ruling. Lars Braun did not object, before the trial  court's verdict, to any impartiality of the judge. Nor does he claim manifest constitutional error on appeal. We  recognize the peril of impugning a judge's impartiality while the case pends before him or her. Nevertheless, we  question whether Braun preserved this challenge for appeal. The State, however, does not ask that we decline  review of the issue.  [**905]  20 Wn. App. 2d 756, *794; 502 P.3d 884, **904; 2022 Wash. App. LEXIS 99, ***54 Page 26 of 27   WA[11-15][ ] [11-15] ¶117 HN12[ ] The federal and state constitutions guarantee a criminal defendant's right to  be tried and sentenced by [*797]  an impartial court. U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV; Wash. Const. art. I, § 22; State v.  Solis-Diaz, 187 Wn.2d 535, 539, 387 P.3d 703 (2017). The law requires more than an impartial judge. The law  demands that the judge also appear to be impartial pursuant to the appearance of fairness doctrine. State v. Solis- Diaz, 187 Wn.2d 535, 540 (2017). A judicial proceeding is valid if a reasonably prudent, disinterested observer  would conclude that the parties received a fair, impartial, and neutral hearing. State v. Solis-Diaz, 187 Wn.2d at  540. The party asserting a violation of the appearance of fairness must show a judge's actual or potential bias.  State v. Solis-Diaz, 187 Wn.2d at 540. In determining a judge's impartiality, this court uses an objective test that  assumes a reasonable observer knows and understands all [***58]  the relevant facts. State v. Solis-Diaz, 187  Wn.2d at 540. ¶118 In State v. Solis-Diaz, 187 Wn.2d 535, 541 (2017), forwarded by Lars Braun, the Washington Supreme Court  remanded to the trial court for resentencing before a different judge to determine whether Guadalupe Solis-Diaz  should be considered for an exceptional mitigated sentence on the basis of Solis-Diaz's youth. The record reflected  the trial court's frustration and unhappiness at the Court of Appeals requiring him to address anew whether Solis- Diaz should be considered for an exceptional downward sentence. The judge's remarks at the first resentencing  strongly suggested that, regardless of the information presented in mitigation, he was committed to the original  standard range sentence of 1,111 months. ¶119 Lars Braun's trial judge never uttered any comments that showed prejudgment of the guilt of Lars Braun. He  never suggested that he wished to make an example out of Lars Braun. He indicated no frustration in the state of  the law being applied to the prosecution. Despite complaining of Detective Maurice Washington's inability to be  present in Ellensburg, the trial judge granted Braun's motion to exclude Washington's testimony on human  trafficking. The judge also suggested that adults should be free to make [*798]  decisions [***59]  without  restraints from the government. We conclude that Braun has not demonstrated the trial judge's actual or potential  bias. WA[16,17][ ] [16, 17] ¶120 A judge's public comments on the administration of the criminal justice system and  rampant crime do not create reasonable cause for doubting the judge's partiality. United States v. Sevilla-Oyola,  854 F. Supp. 2d 164, 167-68 (D.P.R. 2012), vacated in part, 753 F.3d 309, superseded on reh'g, 770 F.3d 1 (1st  Cir. 2014). HN13[ ] To violate the appearance of fairness doctrine, the judge's comments instead must directly  relate to the pending action. In re Boston's Children First, 244 F.3d 164, 168-69 (1st Cir. 2001). Offender Score WA[18,19][ ] [18, 19] ¶121 The trial court sentenced Lars Braun with an offender score of one based on an earlier  conviction for possession of a controlled substance. Braun now contends that this controlled substance conviction  should not count toward his offender score in light of State v. Blake, 197 Wn.2d 170, 481 P.3d 521 (2021). He  requests resentencing with an offender score of zero. The State agrees. ¶122 HN14[ ] In State v. Blake, 197 Wn.2d 170 (2021), the Washington high court held that Washington's strict  liability drug possession statute, RCW 69.50.4013(1), violates due process under both the state and federal  constitutions. The court found the statute unconstitutional and applied its ruling retroactively. Therefore, we accept  the State's concession that Braun's conviction for possession of a controlled substance may not impact his offender  score.",1
"United States v. Bhula, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183076","MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER THIS MATTER is before the Court following a James hearing held on June 28, 2021, and September 9, 2021. The  Court took this matter under advisement [*2]  following the hearing on September 9, 2021. Having reviewed the  pleadings, the Court finds that the Government's Motion to Introduce Co-conspirator Statements (Doc. 134) is well- taken, and therefore, GRANTED IN PART. The Court finds that the Defendant Patel's motion to exclude co- conspirator statements and for Pre-trial hearing (Doc. 151) is not well-taken, and therefore, is DENIED IN PART. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183076, *183076 Page 6 of 17   BACKGROUND A grand jury charged Defendants in a ten-count superseding indictment with conspiracy to commit sex trafficking  in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1594(c), four substantive counts of sex trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a)(1)  and (b)(1) and 1591(a)(2) and (b)(1), interstate and foreign travel and transportation in aid of racketeering  enterprises in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1952(a)(3)(A), conspiracy in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, maintaining a drug- involved premises in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 856(a), maintaining a drug-involved premises within 1,000 feet of a  school in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 860(a); and conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. §  1956(h). Doc. 67 (""Superseding Indictment""). The substantive counts also allege aiding and abetting in violation of  18 U.S.C. § 2. Id. The Government asserts that the Defendants conspired to coerce women to engage in commercial sex acts. 18  U.S.C. §§ 1591(a). As part of the conspiracy, the defendants allegedly [*3]  charged the women fees for their  ""dates"" or visitors, and withheld their rooms and drugs until they paid the fees for their ""dates."" The Government moved to admit 11 categories of co-conspirator statements. The Defendants filed written  objection, mostly focusing on whether a conspiracy existed and whether the individual defendants were part of that  conspiracy. The written objections were as follows. Mr. Patel did not have any objections to the admission of any specific  statements, but rather asserted that (1) no conspiracy existed and (2) he was not the part of any conspiracy if it did  exist. Mr. Bhula and Mr. Craft contested whether a conspiracy existed. They also objected to the admission of some  of the specific statements, which the Court addresses below. Mr. Craft requested additional clarity on the specific  statements the Government would seek to admit at trial. Mr. Craft also requested that the full context for the  statements be provided. On May 24, 2021, the Court directed the Government to produce the particular statements it would seek to admit in  categories 9 and 10, and provide explanations for why each statement was admissible. Doc. 200. These were the  only categories in which [*4]  the government had not already provided specific statements they sought to introduce  into evidence. The Government produced those statements in a 31 page supplement and explained why they were  admissible. Doc. 201. No written objections were filed contesting the admissibility of the specific statements. At the  September 9, 2021 hearing, Mr. Craft requested that the Court direct the government to issue the same order for all  11 categories of statements. The Court finds this unnecessary, as the Government adequately set out the proposed  statements for admission and explained why they are admissible. The Court set the Government's motion for an evidentiary James hearing. At the June 28, 2021 hearing the Court  issued the following oral ruling, finding that a conspiracy existed and the defendants were part of that conspiracy: THE COURT: Thank you. The threshold question the Court has to determine by a preponderance of the  evidence is whether the United States has proven that a conspiracy existed; and if that is proven, who was  involved in the conspiracy. Counsel for the defense, all of you certainly argue that the second prong of the  statute, that there was no threats of force, fraud, or [*5]  coercion that were used. First of all, let me say that coercion does not have to be an overt act. It can be a condition of a system or a  structure set up that, through the debt bondage and through the drugs, creates more of a subtle or subjective  type of coercion. Nonetheless, it's coercion that forces these women into a vicious cycle that they cannot  extricate themselves from. Certainly, a certain type of person is maybe knowingly recruited, maybe enticed,  certainly harbored, under the facts that were presented today before the Court, and maintained, along with  transport provided or obtained, as required by the statute. I am going to find by a preponderance of the evidence, based on what we heard today in court, and regardless  of the probable cause determination to bind over as to each of these four clients, Mr. Craft, Mr. Hill, Mr. Bhula,  and Mr. Patel. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183076, *2 Page 7 of 17   There was the testimony and there was admission, the plea of Willie Horton, to a conspiracy with these other  four defendants that we are talking about today. Mr. Horton, in his statements, implicated all of them, no matter  what their level, whether their level of participation was large or small. Not only do we have the plea of Mr. Horton [*6]  and his statements implicating them all, we also have  statements of Jane Does 1, 2, and 3 that corroborated all or portions of the statements given by Mr. Horton.  We also have comments from others, including hotel records and phone records and e-mails — text messages,  not e-mails -- text messages that corroborate different portions of the statements of Mr. Horton. That being said, the Court has found probable cause that a conspiracy exists. Doc. 209 at 248-249. The Court found that a conspiracy existed and the defendants were part of that conspiracy.  Id. On September 9, 2021, the Court held oral argument on the remaining issue, whether the specific statements were  admissible as co-conspirator statements in furtherance of the conspiracy, or whether they were admissible on  another basis. Following oral argument, the Court took this matter under advisement. At oral argument, Defendant Patel conceded that the proposed statements were admissible after the Court found  that a conspiracy existed. Doc. 209 at 251-252. Defendant Bhula noted that a large number of statements were  allegedly his own statements. Defendant Bhula did not object to his own statements or business records coming in.  Doc. [*7]  209 at 252. At the hearing, Mr. Bhula acknowledged that many of these objections were based on the  contention that no conspiracy existed. Mr. Bhula did not object to the introduction of his own statements if proper  foundation was laid at trial. Moreover, Mr. Bhula acknowledged that some of his objections were addressed by the  supplemental briefing ordered by the Court, in which the Court directed the Government to give specific statements. At oral argument, Mr. Hill requested that the Court not allow in the co-conspirator statements until a conspiracy is  established at trial. Mr. Hill also noted that many of the documents are arguably admissible as business records,  and should therefore not be admitted as co-conspirator statements. Mr. Patel filed his own Motion for Limitation of Alleged Co-conspirator Statements and for Pre-trial Hearing on their  Admissibility (Doc. 151). This motion appears to be in the nature of a response or objection to the Government's  motion to introduce co-conspirator statements. Mr. Patel largely argued that no conspiracy exited or alternatively he  was not part of any conspiracy. The Court therefore finds this motion is ready for ruling following the September [*8]  9, 2021 hearing. LEGAL STANDARD HN1[ ] Hearsay is a statement that ""the declarant does not make while testifying at the current trial or hearing""  and ""a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement."" Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)(1)- (2). ""But testimony not offered to prove the matter asserted that is 'offered instead for relevant context or  background' is not hearsay."" United States v. Becknell, 601 F. App'x 709, 712 (10th Cir. 2015) (unpublished  opinion) (quoting United States v. Hinson, 585 F.3d 1328, 1336 (10th Cir. 2009) ). Questions and comments do not  constitute hearsay if they are not offered to prove the truth of the matter but are offered to show their effect on the  other person in the conversation and provide context. See United States v. Smalls, 605 F.3d 765, 785 n. 18 (10th  Cir. 2010). HN2[ ] Although hearsay statements are generally not admissible at trial, see Fed. R. Evid. 802, a statement that  ""was made by the party's coconspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy"" is not hearsay, and therefore  may be admissible. Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). For a statement to be non-hearsay under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), the  district court must first find the following elements by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) a conspiracy existed; (2)  the declarant and the defendant were both members of the conspiracy; and (3) the statements were made during  the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. United States v. Rutland, 705 F.3d 1238, 1248 (10th Cir. 2013).  The elements of conspiracy, in turn, [*9]  are: (1) there was an agreement to violate the law; (2) the declarant knew  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183076, *5 Page 8 of 17   the essential objective of the conspiracy; (3) the declarant knowingly and voluntarily took part in the conspiracy; and  (4) the coconspirators were interdependent. Id. at 1249 (citing United States v. Ailsworth, 138 F.3d 843, 850-51  (10th Cir. 1998) ). The government, as the proponent of the evidence, has the burden of proving the relevant  preliminary facts. United States v. Perez, 989 F.2d 1574, 1580 (10th Cir. 1993). HN3[ ] The government does not have to prove an express or formal agreement was made; rather, it merely has  to show the coconspirators tacitly came to a mutual understanding. Rutland, 705 F.3d at 1250. ""The existence of a  conspiracy may be inferred from circumstantial evidence."" United States v. Martinez, 825 F.2d 1451, 1452 (10th  Cir. 1987). Interdependence means the coconspirators were united in a common goal or purpose. Ailsworth, 138  F.3d at 851. The trial witness need not be a co-conspirator, so long as the declarant is a co-conspirator with the  defendant against whom the statement is being offered. See United States v. Williamson, 53 F.3d 1500, 1519 (10th  Cir. 1995) (""in deciding whether statements are admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), the appropriate focus is on  whether the statements were 'made by' a member of the conspiracy, and not on whether the statements were  'made to' a member of the conspiracy""). One cannot conspire solely with government informants or agents. United  States v. Wells, 739 F.3d 511, 528 (10th Cir. 2014). HN4[ ] When making a determination under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), the court ""may [*10]  consider both independent  evidence and the statements themselves."" Rutland, 705 F.3d at 1248. To satisfy Rule 801(d)(2)(E), the United  States need show only that there is ""some independent evidence linking the defendant to the conspiracy."" Martinez,  825 F.2d at 1453 (relying on Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 107 S. Ct. 2775, 97 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1987) ).  ""[S]uch independent evidence may be sufficient even it is not 'substantial.'"" United States v. Owens, 70 F.3d 1118,  1125 (10th Cir. 1995) (quoting United States v. Rascon, 8 F.3d 1537, 1541 (10th Cir. 1993) ). Independent  evidence is any ""evidence other than the proffered [coconspirator] statements themselves,"" and may include ""an  out-of-court statement by a coconspirator to a government agent during an investigation."" Owens, 70 F.3d at 1125  (quoting Martinez, 825 F.2d at 1451). HN5[ ] With regard to the third element under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), ""in furtherance"" means that the statements are  ""intended to promote the conspiratorial objectives."" Rutland, 705 F.3d at 1252 (quoting United States v. Townley,  472 F.3d 1267, 1273 (10th Cir. 2007) ). Examples of statements the Tenth Circuit has held to be in furtherance of a  conspiracy include statements explaining events of importance to the conspiracy, statements between  coconspirators which provide reassurance, which serve to maintain trust and cohesiveness among them, or which  inform each other of the current status of the conspiracy, statements identifying a fellow coconspirator, and  discussions of future intent that set transactions to the conspiracy in motion or that maintain the flow of  information [*11]  among conspiracy members. Id. (internal quotations and citations omitted). HN6[ ] Additionally,  statements identifying members of a conspiracy, discussing particular roles of other coconspirators, and avoiding  detection by law enforcement personnel are made ""in furtherance of"" a conspiracy. Williamson, 53 F.3d at 1520. ""A  coconspirator statement is made during the course of the conspiracy it if is made before the objectives of the  conspiracy have either failed or been achieved."" Owens, 70 F.3d at 1126 (quoting Perez, 989 F.2d at 1579).  ""[P]revious statements made by co-conspirators are admissible against a defendant who subsequently joins the  conspiracy."" United States v. Brown, 943 F.2d 1246, 1255 (10th Cir. 1991). HN7[ ] Rule 801(d)(2)(E) requires the trial court to make findings on the record regarding the required elements  before admitting coconspirator's out of court statements. See Perez, 989 F.2d at 1581. The ""strongly preferred  order of proof"" in determining the admissibility of an alleged coconspirator's statement is to first hold a hearing  outside the presence of the jury to determine whether the party offering the statements has established the  existence of a conspiracy by a preponderance of the evidence. United States v. Urena, 27 F.3d 1487, 1491 (10th  Cir. 1994). At the hearing, the district court has discretion to consider ""any evidence not subject to a privilege,  including both the coconspirator statements the [*12]  government seeks to introduce at trial and any other hearsay  evidence, whether or not that evidence would be admissible at trial."" Owens, 70 F.3d at 1124. It is, however, permissible for a court provisionally to allow in the evidence with the understanding that the offering  party will present evidence during the course of trial that will prove the existence of the predicate conspiracy.  Rutland, 705 F.3d at 1248 n.3 (explaining that it was permissible for trial court to admit coconspirator statements  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183076, *9 Page 9 of 17   provisionally, conditioning admission on government's promise to develop proof of conspiracy through later  testimony, but noting Tenth Circuit has repeatedly mentioned its strong preference for James proceedings); Owens,  70 F.3d at 1123 (explaining that district court may make findings under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) either by holding James  hearing outside presence of jury or may provisionally admit evidence with caveat that evidence must ""connect"" up  during trial). DISCUSSION The Government moved to admit certain statements by co-conspirators and certain documents. The Government  asserts that the statements are admissible because they (1) are not hearsay, (2) are co-conspirator statements  under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), or alternatively (3) are business records. HN8[ ] Under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), a statement is not considered hearsay if [*13]  the court finds that ""(1) a  conspiracy existed; (2) both the declarant and the defendant against whom the declaration is offered were members  of the conspiracy; and (3) the statement was made in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy."" United  States v. Eads, 191 F.3d 1206, 1210 (10th Cir. 1999). As noted above, at a prior hearing the Court concluded that (1) a conspiracy existed and (2) the Defendants were  members of that conspiracy. At issue here is whether the (3) specific statements were made in the course of and in  furtherance of the conspiracy pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), or whether the statements are admissible  under another theory. The Defendants' objections largely focused on (1) whether a conspiracy existed or (2) whether they were part of the  conspiracy. The Defendants' objected to some statements, as explained below. The Court finds that many of the  statements discussed below are admissible because they are (1) not for the truth of the matter asserted and not  hearsay; are (2) co-conspirator statements FRE 801(d)(2)(E), or (3) are business records excepted from hearsay  rules. I. Category I: Mr. Bhula's statements regarding Jane Doe's rent fees. The Government sought to introduce statements by Mr. Bhula to an undercover officer (""UC""). These statements  generally [*14]  addressed Jane Doe 1's rent fees. The Government asserted that it would seek to introduce the following. First, on August 18, 2018, after being  introduced to Mr. Bhula by Jane Doe 1, the UC informed Mr. Bhula that he would cover Jane Doe 1's expenses: • Mr. Bhula told the UC that Jane Doe owed approximately $81. The UC paid Bhula $100. Second, on August 31, 2018, the UC contacted Mr. Bhula in order to again pay Jane Doe 1's fees: • Mr. Bhula stated that Jane Doe 1 owed $104 because she had accumulated late charges on her account. • The UC told Bhula (1) he knew that they charged a per visitor fee and (2) stated ""I don't want her to get  charged for me coming to see her, I mean I know her other guys, she's gotta pay for that. But we're kind of like  business partners, and so I'm here for that, so I don't want her to get docked."" • Mr. Bhula (1) wrote the UC's name on Jane Doe 1's room ledger, (2) told the UC he would not charge Jane  Doe 1 for the UC's visits, and (3) that rent was due every day at 11AM. • The UC the asked whether rent would change if Jane Doe 1 had ""dates"" prior to 12 AM: ""If she has a date  before 12, does that add onto it, like if she has someone see her before that? Is it—should [*15]  I tell her to  chill out?"" 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183076, *12 Page 10 of 17   • Bhula responded that if visitors were in her room for an extended period of time she would likely be charged,  but that he and the staff don't always know when she has visitors, and she is charged only if management sees  it. Third, on September 12, 2018, the UC again inquired about Jane Doe 1's rent: • Bhula stated that she owed $102. • The UC paid Bhula $150.00 for Jane Doe 1's rent. • Bhula then stated the Jane Doe 1 would owe $13.50 for the following day, due by noon. • Bhula also stated, ""we try to help the girls,"" and that short or unobserved visits were not assessed a fee. • Bhula then clarified that if someone visits the room for an extended period, such as an hour or two, then the  girl would be charged. • The UC then said, ""and then that's, she told me its ten bucks then?"" • Bhula confirmed it was $10.00. See Doc. 134 at 11-13. Mr. Craft objects, asserting that the Court should not allow in statements by Jane Doe 1 and the UC, who are not  co-conspirators. The Government asserts that it is proffering Defendant Bhula's statements as co-conspirator or  conversations with Mr. Bhula and is not proffering statements between Jane Doe 1 and the UC. Doc. 153 at 5. Mr. [*16]  Craft appears to assert that these statements were not related to the conspiracy, because they merely  address rent. Doc. 150 at 10. The Court finds that Mr. Bhula's statements were made in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy, as  they are statements which facilitated the conspiracy by collecting proceeds of the alleged illegal activity. HN9[ ] Statements made by non-conspirators, such as the UC, Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, A.L., and B.L. may be  admissible to provide context to the co-conspirator statements, and may not be for the truth of the matter asserted.  United States v. Becknell, 601 F. App'x 709, 712 (10th Cir. 2015) (""testimony not offered to prove the matter  asserted that is ""offered instead for relevant context or background"" is not hearsay.), citing United States v. Hinson,  585 F.3d 1328, 1336 (10th Cir.2009). For example, a UC's question may provide necessary context for an admitted  statement by a co-conspirator. ""'One useful clue' in distinguishing hearsay from permissible background information  is 'whether the purported background evidence is necessary for the government to be able to tell a coherent story  about its investigation.'""

Nov. 18, 1996) (statements of confidential  informant captured on audiotape and videotape offered only for context for statements of defendant and his  coconspirators were not hearsay as they were not offered for truth of the matter asserted). II. Category II: Statements by Bhula and Craft to the UC regarding management structure and payments. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183076, *15 Page 11 of 17   On March 4, 2019, the UC rented a room at the Best Choice Inn. The UC attempted to rent a specific room for one  week. Due to the Best Choice Inn's policy against long term rentals, the employee on duty told the UC to speak with  Mr. Bhula, who would not be at the Hotel until the following day. On March 5, [*18]  2019, the UC spoke with Mr.  Bhula: • Bhula told the UC that when he was not at the Best Choice, ""YN"" was in charge. ""YN"" is the alias of co- defendant Jonathan Craft. • Bhula also told the UC that the person working the front desk the day prior, who he rented the room from,  subsequently told Bhula that the UC was an ""undercover cop."" • Bhula and the UC laughed about it Later that day, the UC asked if he could rent room #204 for additional days: • Bhula stated that he did not normally rent rooms #201-#207 for extended periods because he wanted to  keep the ""riff-raff"" away from the office. • Bhula agreed to rent #204 to the UC until the coming Saturday. The UC paid an additional $124.00 to cover the additional time. The UC then asked Bhula how to get a hold of Craft  if Bhula was not around. The UC mentioned to Bhula that he had another business partner (UC2) who would be  coming to see him: • Bhula stated that Craft was on his way. Bhula called Craft into the office, and introduced him to the UC. • Craft stated he was the night manager. • The UC told both Bhula and Craft that he (the UC) was expecting several visitors. • Craft pointed to a sign taped to the office window that explained that each [*19]  visitor would incur an  additional charge. • Craft explained that if the UC paid $20.00 right then, he would not bother him about visitors for the rest of the  day. • The UC attempted to hand Craft a $20 bill • Craft pointed to Bhula and said, ""give it to him and everything is A-ok."" • The UC confirmed, that the additional $20 was ""for visitors and stuff."" • Craft responded with, ""right."" The UC2 arrived at the Best Choice Inn and joined the UC, Bhula, and Craft in the office: • Craft stated he was the ""night manager"" and was responsible for the Best Choice Inn when Bhula was gone. • Craft stated he could be reached by dialing 112. • Craft further stated that he was always present at the Best Choice and it was his responsibility to keep order  and monitor activities at the hotel. See Doc. 134 at 13-15. These statements are admissible for several reasons. HN10[ ] First, ""statements identifying members of a  conspiracy are statements in furtherance of a conspiracy, as are statements discussing the particular roles of other  coconspirators."" United States v. Williamson, 53 F.3d 1500, 1520 (10th Cir. 1995) (internal citations and quotations  omitted). Second, the statements directly lead to the collection of a fee. Finally, the Government gives sufficient  context for these [*20]  statements, thus the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that it was made in the  course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183076, *17 Page 12 of 17   Mr. Bhula argues that some statements by the UC are in narrative form and inadmissible hearsay. The Court  disagrees, and concludes they are admissible non-hearsay for context and background and were not for the truth of  the matter asserted. III. Category III: Mr. Bhula allowed UC, UC2, and others to conduct business in the hotel. On March 5, 2019, UC and UC2 conducted a drug deal in the office of the Best Choice Inn, in front of Mr. Bhula.  The UC took out a plastic bag containing apparent cocaine in Mr. Bhula's presence and examined the different  bundles. After placing the apparent cocaine into a paper bag, the UC spoke to Bhula to confirm that UC2 could be  there: • The UC said to Bhula, ""so if he (UC2) has any problems, he comes and sees you?"" • Bhula replied in the affirmative. • The UC stated, ""Everything good? He knows YN now?"" • Bhula replied in the affirmative. At some point during this interaction, the UC handed UC2 $2,500, also in plain view of Mr. Bhula. After UC2 left: • the UC told Bhula that he would be having visitors so he could, ""get rid [*21]  of this stuff,"" referencing the bag  of drugs he had appeared to have purchased in the office of the Best Choice. • Bhula acknowledged the UC's plans with no objection. On March 8, 2019, the UC had another interaction with Bhula. The UC asked Bhula if a girl could use the room  when he was not present: • The UC stated, ""If I'm not in my room, can I let someone else use my room if I square up with you? It's a girl,  she's good ... But how would I make it good with you?"" • Bhula stated that she could, as long as Bhula knew who she was and had her name on the UC's ledger. • The UC stated the girl would likely have several visitors and would be ""taking care of business."" The UC then  asked Bhula if the UC could pay her visitor fees. • Bhula said ""yes."" • The UC asked Rocky if ""YN"" (Craft) kept track of visitor fees. • Bhula said, ""yes."" • The UC then stated, ""I'll let you know before that would happen, and I'll let him know too. Because I don't  want to be on a bad side with you guys... I wanted to make sure that that was cool...I thought that would be a  good way to let her take care of some of her problems, but I didn't want to do anything until I talked to you and  to YN and make sure everybody was [*22]  cool. She's a nice girl, real quiet, not gonna be a problem, because  I know you don't like the riff-raff upstairs."" • Bhula agreed to allow this proposed arrangement to happen. See Doc. 134 at 15-16. Mr. Bhula argues that the drug ""ruse far exceeds the bounds of what is appropriate under Fed. Rule 801(d)(2)(E).""  Bhula Resp. 9. Specifically, he alleges that there ""is no evidence that [he] saw this fake drug deal or that if he did  see it, that he understood what was occurring."" Id. For his part, Mr. Craft argues that Mr. Bhula's actions are not an  adoption of the UC's statements/actions. Craft Resp. 11. The Court disagrees with Defendants. With respect to the ruse drug transaction, the UC recorded the interaction. If  Mr. Bhula saw the deal go down, his approval is admissible as a 14 coconspirator statement. Clearly, the  Government gives sufficient context for these statements, thus the Court can determine by a preponderance of the  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183076, *20 Page 13 of 17   evidence that it was made in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. Furthermore, the UC's statements  are admissible non-hearsay because they are not being introduced for the truth of the matter asserted. These  statements are being introduced to show context for the conversation [*23]  and Mr. Bhula's knowledge of what  occurred in the hotel. Moreover, if the undercover officers testify at trial, the tape-recorded conversation is not  problematic because they would be available for cross-examination. See United States v. Townley, 472 F.3d 1267,  1274 (10th Cir. 2007). Defendants appear to assert that Mr. Bhula did not say anything in the March 8, 2019 conversation. The UC may  testify as to what he heard Mr. Bhula say, and the Government represents it will provide the audio recording for the  jury to consider. IV. Category IV: Mr Bhula's statements to A.L. about the online reviews and the rent fees. The Government asserts it intends to put forth evidence that Bhula expressed concern over the online reviews of  the Best Choice Inn to A.L, which generally were negative and indicated that the hotel was a destination for drugs  and commercial sex transactions: • Bhula asked A.L if he/she would write a good review for the hotel. • A.L. instead suggested that the hotel management stop charging fees and just refuse to allow visitors. • Bhula told her that he did not want to do that and would continue to allow the visitors and charge fees. See Doc. 134 at 16-17. Mr. Craft objects, asserting that this statement does not further the conspiracy and [*24]  is  irrelevant. The government asserts that Mr. Bhula's statement is admissible because it suggests Mr. Bhula was attempting to  conceal the conspiracy. Online users including law enforcement could see the reviews, which then could lead to an  investigation. See United States v. Alcorta, 853 F.3d 1123, 1139 (10th Cir. 2017) (""When a conspiracy is ongoing,  statements that relate to 'avoiding detection by law enforcement personnel' can be in furtherance of the  conspiracy."" (citation omitted)); see also United States v. Wolf, 839 F.2d 1387, 1393 (10th Cir. 1988)  (""[C]oncealment of the crime done in furtherance of the main criminal objectives of the conspiracy falls within the  coconspirator exception.""). The Court therefore finds that this statement is in the course of and in furtherance of the  conspiracy. A.L was an employee of Best Choice Inn. A.L.'s statements are not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but  to show Mr. Bhula's knowledge of the prostitution and drug dealing and intent to conceal the conspiracy.  Alternatively, A.L.'s statement is not hearsay and is necessary to provide context to Mr. Bhula's statement. V. Category V: Mr. Bhula's Statement to B.L. that he was worried he could get in trouble by allowing victims  to work out of his hotel. B.L. lived periodically at the Best Choice Inn. Defendants [*25]  charged her $69 a night, or $240 a week to stay at  the hotel. Defendants assessed a $10 fee for every visitor that she had to her room who stayed longer than ten  minutes. The Government offers the following statement: • Bhula told B.L. that he was worried that he could get in trouble for allowing the sex workers to work out of  the Best Choice Inn. See Doc. 134 at 17. Mr. Craft objects, asserting that it does not further the conspiracy. The Court disagrees. As noted above, Bhula's statement furthers the conspiracy because it implicitly conveys to B.L. that she needs to  keep quiet about the prostitution, therefore protecting the integrity of Defendants' scheme. See Alcorta, 853 F.3d  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183076, *22 Page 14 of 17   at 1139 (""When a conspiracy is ongoing, statements that relate to 'avoiding detection by law enforcement  personnel' can be in furtherance of the conspiracy."" (citation omitted)); see also Wolf, 839 F.2d at 1393  (""[C]oncealment of the crime done in furtherance of the main criminal objectives of the conspiracy falls within the  coconspirator exception.""). Therefore, this statement was made in the course of and in furtherance of the  conspiracy. VI. Category VI: Mr. Horton's and Mr. Craft's text messages to Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2. Under category six, the Government [*26]  seeks to admit numerous text messages from Mr. Craft and Mr. Horton  to Jane Does 1 and 2. Doc. 134 at 17-28. The Government explained why each statement was in the course of and  in furtherance of the conspiracy. Id. The Court has reviewed each statement text message provided by the Government. Doc. 134 at 17-28. Mr. Bhula  asserts that he was not aware of what was happening between Jane Does and his co-defendants. As noted above,  however, the Court has found that a conspiracy existed and Mr. Bhula was part of the conspiracy. Mr. Craft asserts  that the text messages were not in furtherance of the conspiracy. In some of the text messages, a defendant told a victim that she could not go back into her room because she owed  fees for visitors, or ""dates"". This furthers the conspiracy because it communicates to the victim the consequences of  not paying her fees and causes her to engage in additional commercial sex acts to pay the owed fees. In some  text messages, Defendants facilitated the victims' access to narcotics. In some statements, a defendant stated how  much a victim owed. These statements included agreements to provide transportation or facilitate commercial sex  acts. They also included [*27]  statements in which a victim said she was locked out of her room or was sick from  withdrawal. In response, Mr. Craft allegedly told her that she could not get back into her room without paying her  fees. Some text messages show a romantic relationship with the victims, which goes to the Defendants'  maintenance of the victims. The text messages demonstrate an intent to obtain fees and sell drugs and provide a  live look into the day to day operation of the conspiracy. The Court has reviewed each text message, Doc. 134 at 17-28, and finds by a preponderance of the evidence that  the text messages were made in in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy and are therefore admissible  under FRE 801(d)(2)(E). Moreover, to the extent the Government still seeks to admit Mr. Horton's text messages, those text messages are  admissible as co-conspirator statements. He was clearly a co-conspirator, as shown by the evidence presented at  the June 28, 2021 hearing and his factual plea admission. To the extent the Government offers the non-conspirator portion of the conversations, those may be admissible.  The questions and statements by Jane Doe 1 and 2 are necessary to provide context to the admitted co- conspirator [*28]  statements and are not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. VII. Category VII: Statements to the victims about how much money they needed to pay to get back in to  their rooms. The Government seeks to admit statements regarding how much money the victims had to pay to get back in to  their rooms. The co-conspirators allegedly charged fees for visitors to the rooms of Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2. As  noted above, some of the co-conspirators actively facilitated the victims' ""dates"", monitored their ""dates,"" and  charged fees based on the number of ""dates."" The Court notes that statements between a victim and an  undercover officer are not admissible under FRE 801(d)(2)(E). See Doc. 134 at 28. However, statements by a co- conspirator to a victim regarding how much money the victims owe to get back into their rooms are in the course of  and in furtherance of a conspiracy and are admissible co-conspirator statements. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183076, *25 Page 15 of 17   VIII. Category VIII: Orders to the victims that they were not allowed to take narcotics off the premises, and  were required to limit outcalls during the state police saturation in May 2019 The Government plans to introduce testimony that Defendants Horton and Craft advised the victims to (1) [*29]  not  take drugs off the premises and (2) do ""in calls"" rather than ""out calls."" Doc. 134 at 28-29; Doc. 153 at 12. These  statements were allegedly in response to a law enforcement saturation event that occurred during 2019. Id. HN11[ ] As stated above, statements made to conceal a conspiracy are made in furtherance of that conspiracy. See  Alcorta, 853 F.3d at 1139 (""When a conspiracy is ongoing, statements that relate to 'avoiding detection by law  enforcement personnel' can be in furtherance of the conspiracy."" (citation omitted)); see also Wolf, 839 F.2d at  1393 (""[C]oncealment of the crime done in furtherance of the main criminal objectives of the conspiracy falls within  the coconspirator exception.""). The Court agrees that the defendants' statements are in the course of and in  furtherance of the conspiracy, and admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). IX. Category IX: Business Records. The Government asserted that it intended to introduce business records, which show how the business was run  and how visitor fees were levied. The Government also possessed lease documents, mortgage records, and  documentation regarding the purchase of the hotel by Mr. Patel and the subsequent lease to Mr. Bhula. Doc. 134 at  29. Because the Government did not initially identify [*30]  these records, the Court directed the Government to identify  these documents, provide them, and explain their admissibility. Doc. 200. The Government produced a supplement  with the documents attached and explained why the documents are admissible. See Doc. 201 at 32. The  Government asserted that these records were admissible as business records under FRE 803(6), as co-conspirator  statements pursuant to FRE 801(d)(2)(E), or alternatively under the scope of agency exception pursuant to FRE  801(d)(2)(D). The Court notes that no defendant objected to the supplement, and no Defendant asserted that a specific business  record was inadmissible. The parties do not appear to dispute that these documents are admissible as business  records. Therefore, the Court finds the business records admissible under the business record exception. Alternatively, they are admissible as co-conspirator statements. These documents contain Best Choice Inn branded  room balance sheets featuring the room number, renter name, date and amounts owed and paid. The records also  include the related sheet stubs that correspond to the room folders, a sample weekly rate sheet on Best Choice Inn  stationary, daily record sheets tracking visitors and extra fees, signed [*31]  visitor policy signs, and sheets  maintaining a record of the total number of fees levied against tenants for visitors featuring the names of co- conspirators and commentary. See Doc. 201, Suppl., Exs. B—G. In totality, these documents furthered the  efficiency and profitability of the conspiracy. Thus, they are admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) because  they are made in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. X. Statements found in the co-defendants' phones that were made to further the conspiracy. The Government asserted that it intended to introduce any statement in any phone belonging to the defendants that  furthered the conspiracy. As above, the Court directed the Government to produce each statement it intends to  introduce at trial and state why that statement was admissible. Doc. 200. The Government filed a supplement complying with the Court's order. It identified the text messages it intends to  introduce and explained why each statement was in the course of or in furtherance of the conspiracy. Doc. 201. None of the Defendants objected to the Government's supplement. Although Mr. Patel stated he was not part of the  conspiracy, Doc. 204, none of the other Defendants filed an objection or [*32]  stated why the specific statements  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183076, *28 Page 16 of 17   text messages by the Defendants were not admissible as co-conspirator statements. Therefore, these statements in  the Government's supplement (Doc. 201) appear to be admissible without objection. Alternatively, the Court finds that the co-conspirator statements in the text messages were made in the course of  and in furtherance of the conspiracy. Doc. 201. The Court has read each text message and statement. Id. The  Government set forth each text message and its context. It has also explained why each statement is admissible.  Id. The Court need not repeat the Government's well-reasoned and well-supported arguments, especially when the  Defendants do not object or point out any specific reasons why the statements should not be admitted. The text  messages demonstrate an intent to obtain fees. They also were made to facilitate the day to day operations of the  conspiracy, and were made in an effort to conceal the conspiracy. In some text messages, the co-conspirators  talked about securing drugs for the addicted victims to maintain their dependence on the co-conspirators. Some text  messages also addressed locking them out of the room, forcing them to engage [*33]  in sex acts to obtain the fees  to access their room. Text messages about apparent romantic interests between co-conspirators and victims may  be relevant to how they maintained and recruited the victims. Therefore, the Court finds by a preponderance of the  evidence that the text messages were made in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy and are therefore  admissible under FRE 801(d)(2)(E). At oral argument, Mr. Hill argued that two statements were arguably not in furtherance of the conspiracy. See Doc.  201 at 11, 12. Those statements regarded whether Mr. Hill was available to work that day. The Court finds that  those statements were in furtherance of the conspiracy. The Government also seeks to introduce statements by A.L, an apparent member of the conspiracy. A.L. was an  employee of the hotel. Doc. 209 at 45. At the direction of co-conspirators and as part of the conspiracy, A.L.  apparently monitored fees and fines, which furthered the interest of the conspiracy. Doc. 201 at 29. Moreover, she  apparently seized items from a victim's room, so that they could be resold to the victims. This served to both coerce  the victims into sex trafficking and furthered the financial goal of the conspiracy. [*34]  Therefore, A.L. was a  member of the conspiracy and her text messages furthered the conspiracy. Alternatively, her statements are  admissible for necessary context to the admitted co-conspirator statements and are not offered for the truth of the  matter asserted. The Government requests that the Court admit the non-conspirator part of the conversations listed in Doc. 201  which accompany the co-conspirator statements. Doc. 201 at 1. Defendants did not object. HN12[ ] Generally,  questions or comments made by others in a conversation with a co-conspirator may be admissible where they are  not provided for the truth of the matter asserted and provide context to understand a co-conspirator's statement.  Becknell, 601 F. App'x at 712 (""'One useful clue' in distinguishing hearsay from permissible background information  is 'whether the purported background evidence is necessary for the government to be able to tell a coherent story  about its investigation.'""); See Cesareo-Ayala, 576 F.3d at 1129 (finding that statements that ""may well support an  assertion of the prosecution"" are not hearsay under Rule 801(c) because they were not admitted for their truth, but  rather to establish that a business relationship existed between the declarants and to put the defendant's  statements [*35]  in context). Orders and questions are not hearsay because they are not offered for the truth of the  matter asserted. The non-conspirator portion of a conversation with a co-conspirator is not hearsay as it is not  offered for the truth of the statement or question, but instead to make a co-conspirator's statements intelligible.  Such statements are offered for their effect and to provide context. United States v. Smalls, 605 F.3d 765 (10th Cir.  2010). The Defendants did not respond to say which statements by non-conspirators are inadmissible hearsay. Therefore,  the Court concludes that where the Court admits co-conspirator statements in Doc. 201, the accompanying  conversation is also admissible as the non-conspirator statements or questions are (1) not assertions, (2) not for the  truth for the matter asserted and instead are (3) offered for necessary context. XI. Category XI: Mr. Patel's statements that the Best Choice Inn was a business, and he didn't care what  people did there as long as they paid him. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183076, *32 Page 17 of 17   The Government asserts it will introduce evidence that, when confronted by an employee about the drug use and  prostitution at the Best Choice Inn, Defendant Patel responded that he did not care what the victims did as long as  they paid him. [*36]  Doc. 134 at 30. The Government plans to introduce evidence to provide context, including  testimony that Defendant Patel managed the hotel in the same manner as Mr. Bhula prior to Mr. Bhula taking over.  This comment is made in furtherance of the conspiracy, because it attempts to conceal the conspiracy. HN13[ ] Co-conspirator statements made before a defendant joins the conspiracy are admissible. United States v.  Brown, 943 F.2d 1246, 1255 (10th Cir. 1991). Mr. Craft asserts that the conspiracy did not exist at the time the statement was made. The government represents  that the conspiracy began in September or October 2017 when Mr. Patel purchased the hotel. The Government  represents that this comment was made sometime when Mr. Patel was on site directly running the hotel, between  September 2017 to March 2018. During that time, he was training Mr. Bhula, and Mr. Bhula was in contact with Mr.  Horton. The Government represents it will present evidence that Mr. Patel ran the hotel in the same manner as Mr.  Bhula. He observed when the sex trafficking victims had ""dates"" and assessed a $10 fee per ""date."" When they  could not pay the fees, he locked them out of their rooms. Therefore, the Court finds Mr. Craft's objection not well  taken. XII. Defendant Patel's [*37]  motion for limitation of alleged co-conspirator statements (Doc. 151). Defendant Patel filed a motion for limitation of alleged co-conspirators statements. Doc. 151. This motion was in the  nature of a response to the Government's motion to admit co-conspirator statements. Mr. Patel requested a pretrial  hearing, asserted that no conspiracy existed, and asserted that he was not a member of any conspiracy. The Court held a pretrial hearing as requested by Mr. Patel. Based on the record created at the hearing on June 28,  2021, and the Court's oral ruling at the hearing that (1) a conspiracy existed and (2) the defendants were part of  that conspiracy, the Court denies Mr. Patel's motion. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Government's Motion to Admit Co-Conspirator Statements (Doc. 134) is  GRANTED IN PART. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Mr. Patel's Motion for Limitation of Alleged Co-conspirator Statements and for  Pretrial Hearing (Doc. 151) is DENIED IN PART. /s/ Kea W. Riggs KEA W. RIGGS UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183076, *35",1
"United States v. Raniere, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 33949","SUMMARY ORDER UPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the  October 7, 2020 and October 30, 2020 judgments of the District Court be and hereby are AFFIRMED. On March 13, 2019, a federal grand jury returned a Second Superseding Indictment (""Indictment"") charging  Defendant Keith Raniere with, inter alia, racketeering, sex trafficking, and a forced-labor [*2]  conspiracy involving  multiple victims. The Indictment also charged Defendant Clare Bronfman and others with a number of related  crimes. The Government alleged that Raniere was the founder of a self-styled executive coaching and self-help  organization called NXIVM, and that Bronfman served on NXIVM's executive board. It further alleged that Raniere  maintained a rotating group of female NXIVM members with whom he had sexual relationships. These women were  barred from both having sexual relationships with anyone but Raniere and disclosing their relationship with Raniere  to others. As alleged, members of Raniere's ""inner circle"" would recruit vulnerable members of NXIVM to a secret society  called ""DOS,"" an acronym for ""Dominus Obsequious Sororium,"" a phrase that roughly translates to ""Lord/Master of  the Obedient Female Companions."" DOS was run as a pyramid organization, with Raniere on the top, followed by  first-line ""masters,"" and then ""slaves."" Apart from Raniere, all other DOS members were women. DOS ""masters""  would recruit ""slaves"" to the organization, who were required to deposit ""collateral"" to show their commitment to the  organization in the form of, inter alia, sexually explicit [*3]  photographs and videos depicting the slaves in  compromising positions, letters accusing loved ones of wrongdoing, and credit card authorizations. DOS ""masters""  would give their ""slaves"" assignments, which included uncompensated labor like buying groceries, cleaning, and  organizing. DOS ""masters"" would also give their ""slaves"" assignments to engage in sexual acts with Raniere. DOS  ""slaves"" who failed to comply with their ""masters'"" assignments risked the release of their ""collateral."" Page 6 of 13   Following a six-week jury trial, Raniere was convicted on all counts submitted to the jury. He now raises various  challenges to his convictions. Separately, Bronfman—who pleaded guilty to two counts prior to the commencement  of Raniere's trial—brings a challenge to the procedural reasonableness of the District Court's imposition of an 81- month sentence for her crimes. We assume the parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on  appeal. Raniere's appeal as it concerns his convictions for sex trafficking, attempted sex trafficking, and sex  trafficking conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591—including both his challenges to the relevant jury  instructions and his sufficiency-of-the-evidence [*4]  arguments—is addressed in an opinion entered this same day.  We write separately here to address Raniere's remaining claims as well as Bronfman's appeal, and address each in  turn. I. RANIERE'S APPEAL A. Sufficiency-of-the-Evidence Challenges Raniere first argues that insufficient evidence was presented to the jury to sustain his convictions for various counts.  HN1[ ] Where, as here, claims of insufficiency are preserved below, we review those claims de novo. United  States v. Capers, 20 F.4th 105, 113 (2d Cir. 2021). A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence at trial  ""face[s] a heavy burden because we must sustain the jury's verdict if, crediting every inference that could have  been drawn in the government's favor and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any  rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt."" Id. (cleaned  up). ""A court may enter a judgment of acquittal only if the evidence that the defendant committed the crime alleged  is nonexistent or so meager that no reasonable jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."" Id. (quoting United  States v. Atilla, 966 F.3d 118, 128 (2d Cir. 2020)). We address Raniere's numerous sufficiency claims below. a. Forced Labor and Forced Labor Conspiracy, in Violation [*5]  of 18 U.S.C. § 1589 (Count 3 and  Racketeering Act 10B) In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence on the forced labor conspiracy charge (Count 3) and the racketeering  act of forced labor of Nicole (Act 10B), Raniere argues (1) that the ""acts of service"" that Nicole conducted for  Allison Mack were ""isolated personal favors and kind gestures"" that do not rise to the definition of ""labor or  services"" used in the statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1589; and (2) that Nicole had ""knowingly consented to these types of  activities as part of her membership in DOS."" Raniere's Br. 33. We find neither argument convincing.             Page 7 of 13   As to the first argument—that Nicole's ""acts of service"" do not rise to the level of ""labor or services"" as that term is  used in Section 1589—we begin by looking to the ""ordinary meaning"" of the statutory phrase ""labor or services.""  United States v. Marcus, 628 F.3d 36, 44 (2d Cir. 2010). HN2[ ] Labor includes the ""expenditure of physical or  mental effort especially when fatiguing, difficult, or compulsory."" Id. at 44 n.10 (quoting Merriam-Webster's Third  New International Dictionary Unabridged (2002)). Here, evidence presented to the jury showed that DOS ""slaves""  were coerced into providing uncompensated work by the threat of the release of their ""collateral."" In particular, the  Government offered evidence [*6]  at trial that Nicole provided uncompensated work for Mack, including  transcribing tapes and reviewing articles. [Gov. App'x 786.] Thus, we conclude that ""the plain meaning of the  forced labor statute unambiguously applies to [Raniere's] conduct."" Id. at 45. The second argument—that Nicole had consented to the labor—is also unconvincing. ""The fact that [Nicole's]  enslavement arose from her initial participation in consensual [DOS] activities does not require"" us to infer, much  less conclude, that Nicole consented to all of the labor she subsequently undertook. See id. At trial, the  Government presented evidence that Nicole was required to produce ""collateral,"" including in the form of sexually  explicit videos of herself, letters in which she falsely accused her father of sexual abuse, and credit card  authorization forms, which she feared would be released if she failed to comply with Mack's directives. [Gov. App'x  738-40.] Upon review of the record, we conclude that the jury was presented with ample evidence showing that  Nicole's labor was nonconsensual. There is therefore no basis for overturning the forced labor or forced labor  conspiracy convictions. b. Sexual Exploitation of a Child, [*7]  in Violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2251 (Racketeering Acts 2 and 3) Raniere argues that the Government failed to prove the racketeering acts of child exploitation of Camila  (Racketeering Acts 2 and 3), principally pointing to the fact that Camila did not testify at trial. Raniere argues that, at  most, his possession of explicit photographs dated November 2, 2005 and November 24, 2005 shows that he was  guilty of mere possession of child pornography. He argues that no evidence was presented specifically showing that  he ""employ[ed], use[d], persuade[d], induce[d], entice[d], or coerce[d]"" Camila to engage in sexually explicit  conduct, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2251. See Raniere's Br. 36-37. We do not agree. Even without Camila's testimony, the jury was presented with ample evidence showing that  Raniere began sexually abusing Camila in September 2005. See, e.g., Gov. App'x 710-1-10-4, 1171, 1268 (emails  and text messages between Camila and Raniere referring to the beginning of their sexual relationship as around  September 2005); Gov. App'x 416-17 (testimony from Daniela that she had spoken to Raniere about his sexual  relationship with Camila at some point before the fall of 2006). Moreover, the jury was shown messages between  Camila and Raniere specifically [*8]  referencing Raniere's creation and possession of the November 2005  photographs. See, e.g., Gov. App'x 1173. And the electronic folder containing the photographs of Camila also  contained nude photographs of other women with whom Raniere had a contemporaneous sexual relationship. In  sum, the jury was presented with sufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Raniere was  guilty of sexually exploiting Camila. c. Conspiracy to Alter Records for Use in an Official Proceeding, in Violation of 18 U.S.C. §  1512(c)(1)(Racketeering Act 6)  Next, Raniere argues that the Government did not prove the existence of a conspiracy to alter records for use in an  official proceeding (Act 6). He concedes that the Government offered evidence that Mark Vincente, one of Raniere's  alleged co-conspirators, altered or arranged for the alteration of certain video tapes—which were produced in  discovery as part of a federal civil action, NXIVUM Corp., et al., v. Ross Institute, et al., No. 06-CV-1051 (D.N.J.)— at Raniere's direction. Raniere's Br. 40. But he argues that the Government did not provide sufficient evidence to  prove that Vicente acted with the requisite intent. We disagree. HN3[ ] For the Government ""to satisfy the element of intent,"" [*9]  it ""must show a 'nexus' between the defendant's  act and the judicial proceedings; that is, there must be 'a relationship in time, causation, or logic' such that the act  Page 8 of 13   has 'the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due administration of justice.'"" United States v. Desposito,  704 F.3d 221, 230 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting United States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593, 599-600, 115 S. Ct. 2357, 132 L.  Ed. 2d 520 (1995)). At trial, Vincente testified that he knew the deleted content of the tapes would have been  damaging to NXIVM in an ongoing ""legal action"" and that he understood the alteration of the videos to be ""illegal.""  Gov. App'x 178-79, 182. The jury was thus presented with sufficient evidence to conclude that the intent element  was satisfied. d. Identity Theft Conspiracy, in Violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028 (Racketeering Act 11) Raniere also challenges the sufficiency of the Government's evidence as to Racketeering Act 11, which charged  Raniere with conspiring to commit identity theft in connection with tax evasion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028(a)(7)  and 1028(f). In particular, the Government charged Raniere with using the credit card of Pamela Cafritz—his long- term partner who had since died—in order to evade his tax obligations. [Gov. App'x 17.] Raniere argues that the  Government offered no evidence that he had a substantial tax debt or that he ever failed to pay his taxes, as  required to prove a substantial [*10]  violation of the tax evasion statute. Raniere's Br. 43-44; see also United  States v. Litwok, 678 F.3d 208, 215 (2d Cir. 2012) (listing elements of a substantive violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7201). Raniere misapprehends the import of the identity theft statute. HN4[ ] Section 1028 prohibits ""knowingly . . .  us[ing], without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit, or to aid or  abet, or in connection with, any unlawful activity that constitutes a violation of Federal law . . . ."" 18 U.S.C. §  1028(a)(7) (emphasis added). As the District Court explained in its jury instructions, ""the Government does not  need to prove that [Raniere] or a co-conspirator actually committed tax evasion."" Jury Charge at 108, United States  v. Mack, No. 18-CR-204 (NGG) (E.D.N.Y. June 18, 2019), ECF No. 728. Upon review of the record, we conclude  that the Government offered sufficient evidence from which the jury was able to conclude that Raniere entered into  a conspiracy to use Cafritz's credit card with the intent to commit, or to aid or abet, or in connection with, tax  evasion. e. Racketeering and Racketeering Conspiracy, in Violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) (Counts 1 and 2) Finally, Raniere argues that his conviction for a racketeering conspiracy (Count 1) and substantive racketeering  (Count 2) cannot be sustained because (1) there was insufficient evidence that Raniere's ""inner [*11]  circle""  constituted an enterprise for RICO purposes and (2) the Government failed to demonstrate a ""pattern"" of related  racketeering activities as opposed to isolated and sporadic offenses. Raniere's Br. 15-16. We are not convinced by  either argument. HN5[ ] The RICO statute prohibits persons ""employed by or associated with any enterprise . . . to conduct or  participate . . . in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity . . . ."" 18 U.S.C. §  1962(c). Raniere first argues that there was insufficient evidence that Raniere's ""inner circle"" was an ""enterprise"" for RICO  purposes. In particular, he argues that the ""inner circle"" did not share a ""common purpose"" other than a vague  commitment and loyalty to Raniere. Raniere's Br. 47-48. But the Indictment alleges that the purpose of the  enterprise was ""to promote [Raniere] . . . and to recruit new members into the Pyramid Organizations [i.e., NXIVM  and DOS],"" whereby existing members of the enterprise ""expected to receive financial opportunities and personal  benefits, including increased power and status within the Enterprise."" Gov. App'x 2-3, ¶ 4 (emphasis added). The      Page 9 of 13   Government presented evidence at trial that members of the [*12]  enterprise recruited members into Raniere's  organizations and received such benefits. [See, e.g., Gov. App'x 198.] To the extent that Raniere objects to the informal nature of the ""inner circle's"" membership, see, e.g., Raniere's Br.  49 (arguing that the inner circle ""was nothing more than a hodgepodge of people from a wider community""),  HN6[ ] the Supreme Court has rejected the argument that RICO enterprises must have formal membership or  structural requirements, instead emphasizing the ""breadth of the 'enterprise' concept in RICO."" Boyle v. United  States, 556 U.S. 938, 948-49, 129 S. Ct. 2237, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1265 (2009); see also 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4) (defining  enterprise as including ""any . . . group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity""); United States v.  Eppolito, 543 F.3d 25, 49 (2d Cir. 2008) (""An 'individuals associated in fact' enterprise, 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4), may  continue to exist even though it undergoes changes in membership.""). Upon review of the record, we are satisfied  that the evidence presented at trial established that the ""inner circle"" was an enterprise for purposes of the RICO  statute. Next, Raniere argues that the Government failed to establish a ""pattern of racketeering activity"" as that term is used  in Section 1962(c). HN7[ ] The statute requires that there be ""at least two acts of racketeering activity"" within ten  years. 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5). ""[C]riminal conduct forms [*13]  a pattern of racketeering activity under RICO when it  'embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of  commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.'"" United  States v. Daidone, 471 F.3d 371, 375 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 240, 109  S. Ct. 2893, 106 L. Ed. 2d 195 (1989)). Relatedness includes both horizontal relatedness—that the predicate acts  are related to each other—and vertical relatedness—that the predicate acts are related to the enterprise. Id. ""[B]oth  the vertical and horizontal relationships are generally satisfied by linking each predicate act to the enterprise."" Id. at  376. Here, the evidence presented at trial permitted the conclusion that the eleven predicate acts listed in the Indictment  were linked to the enterprise. In arguing otherwise, Raniere arbitrarily groups the eleven predicate acts into three  sub-groups: (1) the DOS Acts (Acts 9 and 10); (2) the sexual exploitation and possession of child pornography of  Camila (Acts 2, 3, and 4); and (3) non-DOS Acts (Acts 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 11). Raniere's Br. 55-63. But this grouping  does not defeat the conclusion that each of these acts was linked to the enterprise. See United States v. Burden,  600 F.3d 204, 216 (2d Cir. 2010) (HN8[ ] ""Horizontal relatedness requires that the racketeering predicate  acts [*14]  be related to each other. However, that relationship need not be direct; an indirect relationship created  by the relationship of each act to the enterprise will suffice."" (citing United States v. Polanco, 145 F.3d 536, 541 (2d  Cir. 1998))). In sum, we find that there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to sustain Raniere's RICO  convictions. B. Rule 403 Challenges Raniere next challenges the District Court's decision to allow the introduction of three categories of evidence: (1)  communications between Raniere and Camila; (2) evidence that Camila, Daniela, and Marianna had abortions after  being impregnated by Raniere; and (3) photographs of women's genitalia taken by Raniere. [Raniere's Br. 64.] He  argues that these materials should have been excluded as unduly prejudicial under Federal Rule of Evidence 403.  We disagree. HN9[ ] Rule 403 allows a court to ""exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a  danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay,  wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence."" We have frequently noted that HN10[ ] we review a  district court's balancing under Rule 403 for abuse of discretion. See, e.g., United States v. Polouizzi, 564 F.3d 142,  152 (2d Cir. 2009). ""The 'decision to admit or exclude evidence will not be overturned unless [*15]  we conclude  that the court acted arbitrarily or irrationally.'"" Id. (quoting United States v. Thai, 29 F.3d 785, 813 (2d Cir. 1994)). Page 10 of 13   a. Communications Between Raniere and Camila Raniere first challenges the admission of WhatsApp messages between Raniere and Camila, which he argues were  of minimal probative value, contained ""gratuitous sexually-graphic conversations,"" and portrayed Raniere as  ""manipulative, controlling[,] and emotionally abusive."" Raniere's Br. 68, 71. But as Raniere himself acknowledges,  the communications are ""relevant to support the [G]overnment's claim that [Raniere] began a sexual relationship  with Camila when she was 15 years old and that [he] was the architect of DOS."" Id. at 71 (citation omitted). These  communications were highly probative of Raniere's relationship with Camila, whom the Government argued was  both a victim of Raniere's child exploitation and a ""slave"" in DOS. Accordingly, the District Court's decision to admit  these communications was far from ""arbitrar[y] or irrational[]."" Polouizzi, 564 F.3d at 152 (quoting Thai, 29 F.3d at  813). b. Abortion Evidence Raniere next challenges the District Court's decision to admit evidence—in the form of testimony, medical records,  and ultrasound images—that Daniela, Camila, and Marianna had obtained abortions, arguing [*16]  that such  evidence was prejudicial, cumulative, and minimally probative. Raniere's Br. 74. But the abortion material was  probative of Raniere's sexual relationship with Camila when she was a minor and to show that Cafritz—who was a  member of the charged enterprise and helped procure the abortions—facilitated the abuse of Camila and Daniela.  We see no error in the District Court's decision to admit the abortion evidence. c. Photographs of Women's Genitalia Finally, Raniere challenges the District Court's decision to admit 167 photographs of women's genitalia recovered  from a hard drive also containing explicit images of Camila taken when she was a minor. He argues that the  evidence was cumulative and highly prejudicial. Raniere's Br. 78. But elsewhere, Raniere argues that the existence  of explicit images of Camila on the hard drive is not sufficient to establish that it was Raniere who took the  photographs of Camila. See id. at 35. Thus, even he must concede that the ""timeframe in which the . . . photos  w[ere] taken shed[s] some light on the question of whether [Raniere] was responsible for taking the Camila photos.""  Id. at 77. The existence of the photographs of other women's genitalia—women with whom [*17]  Raniere had a  contemporaneous sexual relationship—was probative of whether Raniere had taken the photographs of Camila and  whether he had had a sexual relationship with her while she was a minor. The District Court did not err in deciding  to admit the evidence. C. Other Trial-Related Challenges Raniere also raises two separate challenges concerning trial orders. We address each below. a. Prohibition on the Use of Full Names Prior to the commencement of trial, upon motion by the Government, the District Court ordered that ""testifying  victims"" were to be identified by ""a nickname, first name, or pseudonym only"" and that ""non-testifying DOS victims""  were to be ""referred to solely by first name or nickname"" during trial. Memorandum & Order at 40, Mack, No. 18- CR-204 (May 6, 2019), ECF No. 622. Raniere argues that this decision violated his rights under the Confrontation     Page 11 of 13   Clause of the Sixth Amendment and his due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. [Raniere's Br. 85-86.] We  disagree. HN11[ ] A defendant's constitutional right to confront witnesses includes the right to ""ask the witness who he is  and where he lives,"" because, ""when the credibility of a witness is in issue,"" these questions are ""the very starting  point in 'exposing falsehood and bringing out the truth' through cross-examination."" [*18]  Smith v. State of Illinois,  390 U.S. 129, 131, 88 S. Ct. 748, 19 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1968) (quoting Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 404, 85 S. Ct.  1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965)); see also Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 689, 51 S. Ct. 218, 75 L. Ed. 624  (1931). The Second Circuit has explained that there are ""two central interests"" safeguarded by Smith and Alford.  ""First, the defense needs testimony as to a witness' [identity] on cross-examination so that the defense can obtain  this information which may be helpful in investigating the witness out of court or in further cross-examination.""  United States v. Marti, 421 F.2d 1263, 1266 (2d Cir. 1970). ""Second, the defense may need the witness to reveal  his address [or other identifying information] in court because knowledge of the [identifying information] by the jury  might be important to its deliberations as to the witness' credibility or his knowledgeability."" Id. HN12[ ] That said, a district court's decision to limit the scope of cross-examination is reviewed for abuse of  discretion. United States v. White, 692 F.3d 235, 244 (2d Cir. 2012). Trial judges have ""wide latitude . . . to impose  reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice,  confusion of the issues, the witness' safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant."" Delaware  v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986). And ""[e]ven if a reviewing court finds  error, a new trial is not required if the error was harmless."" White, 692 F.3d at 244. Here, in granting the Government's request to prohibit the use of full names, the District [*19]  Court reasoned that  requiring victims to provide their names in public ""could chill their willingness to testify, for fear of having their  personal histories publicized."" Memorandum & Order at 32, Mack, No. 18-CR-204 (May 6, 2019), ECF No. 622. It  also found that Raniere failed to present a particularized need for the witnesses' last names to be disclosed, since  he already knew the identity of the individuals and could articulate no reason why disclosing last names would help  the jury assess the witnesses' credibility. As for Raniere's contention that the withholding of the witnesses' last  names bolstered their credibility by effectively endorsing their status as victims, the District Court correctly  addressed this concern with an appropriate jury instruction. Id. at 32-34. Under these circumstances, where neither  of Marti's two ""central interests"" are implicated, the District Court's decision was justified, and we see no error in it.  421 F.2d at 1266; see also Marcus, 628 F.3d at 45 n.12 (rejecting a similar challenge to a lower court's ""decision  permitting two of the Government's witnesses to testify using only their first names"" on due process grounds). b. Termination of Cross-Examination Raniere also argues that the District Court's improperly terminated Lauren [*20]  Salzman's cross-examination,  again allegedly violating his Sixth Amendment right to confront his accuser and his Fifth Amendment right to due  process. We conclude that—even assuming the District Court erred in its termination of the cross-examination—any  such error was harmless. During the lengthy cross-examination of Lauren Salzman—a cooperating Government witness who had previously  pleaded guilty to racketeering charges—the District Court ordered that the cross-examination end, saying in front of  the jury: ""[t]hat's it. We are done."" Gov. App'x 396. After the jury was excused, defense counsel objected and the  District Court explained that counsel had gone ""way over the line,"" and that he ""kept coming back"" to a line of  questions concerning whether Lauren Salzman had actually had the requisite mental state to have committed the  crimes to which she had pleaded guilty. Id. The District Court explained that it would not tolerate ""someone hav[ing]     Page 12 of 13   a nervous breakdown on the witness stand,"" noted that Lauren Salzman was ""a broken person,"" and expressed  concern over Lauren Salzman's ""composure."" Id. at 396-97. Here, any arguable error was harmless. Raniere vaguely asserts that he was precluded from crossing Lauren  Salzman [*21]  on a range of topics, including: (1) the impact of her potential jail term on her decision to cooperate;  (2) ""certain other facts"" she learned in discovery that caused her to change her view of Raniere and DOS; (3)  ""certain specific portions"" of recordings she heard of meetings between Raniere and other DOS members; and (4)  ""other aspects"" of her plea agreement and her cooperation. Raniere's Br. 81. But Raniere fails to provide any  further detail about these potential questions or explain how the inability to address them—after an already lengthy  cross-examination that included many questions on related topics—deprived him of his ability to test the veracity of  Lauren Salzman's testimony. See, e.g., United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 313 (2d Cir. 2006). Furthermore, after the District Court terminated counsel's cross-examination of Lauren Salzman and at the close of  the Government's case-in-chief, the Government stated—and Raniere's counsel confirmed—that the Government  had ""offered to the defense to make any of its witnesses available"" to testify at Raniere's case-in-chief, ""including  Lauren Salzman,"" and that Raniere had not elected to avail himself of that opportunity and declined to put on a  case. Gov. App'x 976. Under these particular [*22]  circumstances, we conclude Raniere ""suffered no harm"" from  the District Court's prior decision to cut off Lauren Salzman's cross-examination. Cf. United States v. Barbarino, 612  F. App'x 624, 627 (2d Cir. 2015) (summary order) (concluding that any error in limiting defendant's cross  examination of a witness was harmless where ""[t]he Government offered to make [the witness] available for further  cross-examination by telephone"" and ""Barbarino has not identified other questions he was prevented from asking  on cross-examination""). II. BRONFMAN'S APPEAL On April 19, 2019, Bronfman pleaded guilty to two counts: (1) conspiracy to conceal, harbor, and shield from  detection one or more aliens for financial gain, in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(v)(I) and (a)(1)(B)(i); and (2)  unlawful transfer and use of a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit and in connection  with attempted tax evasion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028(a)(7), 1028(b)(1)(D), and 1028(c)(3)(A). At sentencing,  the District Court determined that the applicable advisory Guidelines sentencing range was 21 to 27 months'  imprisonment and imposed a sentence of, inter alia, 81 months' imprisonment. Bronfman now argues that the  District Court committed procedural error. HN13[ ] We review a district court's imposition of a sentence under a ""deferential abuse-of-discretion [*23]   standard."" United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 189 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc) (quoting Gall v. United States, 552  U.S. 38, 41, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445 (2007)); see also In re Sims, 534 F.3d 117, 132 (2d Cir. 2008)  (describing the abuse-of-discretion standard). The imposition of a sentence outside of the advisory Guidelines  range does not alter the standard of review. Gall, 552 U.S. at 49. At root, we evaluate the sentence imposed for  ""reasonableness,"" a concept which includes ""the procedures used to arrive at the sentence (procedural  reasonableness) . . . ."" United States v. Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d 265, 278 (2d Cir. 2012). Procedural error includes  ""failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to  consider the § 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately  explain the chosen sentence."" Gall, 552 U.S. at 51. Bronfman principally argues that the District Court committed procedural error by relying on a ""clearly erroneous  finding""—namely that Bronfman was aware of, or willfully blind to, Raniere's abuses in DOS. Bronfman's Br. 22. We  disagree. The District Court explicitly stated that it ""agree[d] with Ms. Bronfman that the available evidence does not  establish that she was aware of DOS prior to June 2017 or that she directly or knowingly funded DOS or other sex     Page 13 of 13   trafficking activities."" Sp. App'x 104. It acknowledged, however, that her ""crimes [*24]  were not committed in a  vacuum."" Id. And it found ""most troubling"" that when, in 2017, Bronfman was ""confronted with information about  DOS . . . she doubled down on her support of Raniere and pursued her now familiar practice of attacking his  critics."" Id. at 118-19. The District Court referred to a December 2017 public statement that Bronfman released in  which ""she falsely characterized DOS as a 'sorority' that 'truly benefited the lives of its members.'"" Id. at 122-23.  And it discussed Bronfman's contribution of $13.8 million to an irrevocable trust to pay for the legal fees of Raniere  and her other co-defendants. Id. at 124. It is in this context that the District Court stated that Bronfman had a  ""pattern of willful blindness when it comes to Raniere and his activities,"" and that although Bronfman may not have  known of DOS before 2017, ""she did not want to know either."" Id. at 125-26. A full reading of the District Court's  lengthy statement (which covers thirty pages of the transcript) shows that it was primarily concerned with  Bronfman's actions after she found out about DOS in June 2017, including her reinvigorated support of Raniere. Bronfman also argues that the District Court ignored disparities between her sentence and the [*25]  sentences  imposed on her co-defendants—Mack, Lauren Salzman, and Kathy Russell—in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6).  HN14[ ] Section 3553(a)(6) requires a district court to consider ""the need to avoid unwarranted sentence  disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct."" But as we have  made clear, while ""[S]ection 3553(a)(6) requires a district court to consider nationwide sentence disparities,"" it  ""does not require a district court to consider disparities between co-defendants."" United States v. Ghailani, 733 F.3d  29, 55 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting United States v. Frias, 521 F.3d 229, 236 (2d Cir. 2008)). In any event, Bronfman's  conduct—before and after her indictment—readily distinguishes her from Mack, Salzman, and Russell, two of whom  cooperated with the Government and received sentencing reductions pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e). Finally, Bronfman argues that even compared to defendants nationwide, her 81-month sentence was excessive.  She points to certain statistics showing that of 27 defendants convicted of both 8 U.S.C. § 1324 and 18 U.S.C. §  1028 offenses nationwide, none received an above-Guidelines sentence. Bronfman's Br. 27. She has filed a motion  to supplement the record with the reports she relied on in arriving at that conclusion, ECF No. 183, and that motion  is hereby GRANTED. Even so, as the District Court pointed out, ""the context of Ms. Bronfman's [*26]  criminal  conduct places her in an[] all together different category from other defendants convicted of the same offenses."" Sp.  App'x 129. Upon review of the record, including the material contained in ECF No. 183 and its supporting  documents, we find that the District Court acted well within its discretion in arriving at its conclusion.",1
"United States v. Gemma, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155800","OPINION AND ORDER August 27, 2020 O'TOOLE, S.D.J. The petitioner, Michael Gemma, was convicted of one count of sex trafficking a child by force, fraud, or coercion  in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) and one count of transporting a minor to engage in prostitution in violation of 18  U.S.C. § 2423(a). He was sentenced to concurrent terms of 240 months' imprisonment on each of these counts  followed by five years of supervised release. His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. Gemma now moves to  vacate his conviction and sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. He advances four grounds for relief, each of  which is premised on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Post-conviction relief pursuant to § 2255 is an extraordinary remedy that is available only if the defendant can make  ""a sufficient showing of fundamental unfairness."" Singleton v. United States, 26 F.3d 233, 236 (1st Cir. 1994).  Strickland v. Washington creates a strong presumption [*2]  of reasonable professional assistance of counsel. 466  U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). To succeed on his claim, Gemma must show that his counsel's  performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that ""there is a reasonable probability that, but  for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different."" Id. at 688, 694; see  Page 2 of 2   also Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 112, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624 (2011) (""The likelihood of a different  result must be substantial, not just conceivable.""). Gemma claims that he was prejudiced by several alleged errors on the part of his counsel. However, each of his  proposed grounds for habeas relief fails for the same reason—Gemma was not prejudiced by his counsel's  reasonable decision not to raise meritless arguments. This Court well recalls the vigorous defense effort mounted  by his trial counsel. Additionally, the First Circuit already considered and rejected many of the arguments that  Gemma raises on direct appeal. See United States v. Gemma, 818 F.3d 23 (1st Cir. 2016). Those arguments that  the appellate court did not consider lack merit for substantially the reasons asserted by the government in its  opposition to the present motion. (See Gov.'s Opp. to Pet. Filed Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 at 8-14 (dkt. no.  286).) Accordingly, Gemma's Motion Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct [*3]  Sentence by a Person  in Federal Custody (dkt. no. 266) is DENIED. His Motion for Discoverable Materials Pursuant to Rule 6 of the Rules  Governing 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (dkt. no. 268), Motion for Leave to Amend or Otherwise File a Supplement to  Petitioner's Motion Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 After Completion of Discovery (dkt. no. 269), and Motion  Requesting an Evidentiary Hearing Pursuant to Petitioner's Motion Under 28 U.S.C. §2255 (dkt. no. 270) are also  DENIED. Because the petitioner has not ""made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right"" no certificate of  appealability shall issue. See 28 USC Sec. 2253(c)(1-2). It is SO ORDERED. /s/ George A. O'Toole, Jr. Senior United States District Judge  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155800, *2",1
"United States v. Lacey, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112853","WO ORDER Pending before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Compel Production of Brady Material. (Doc. 777, ""Mot."" or  ""Motion"".) The Government responded, (Doc. 810, ""Resp.""), and Defendants replied, (Doc. 825, ""Reply"").  Defendants requested oral argument, but the Court elects to resolve the motion without it. See L.R. Civ 7.2(f). After  considering the motions, their attached exhibits, and relevant case law, the Court enters the following Order: I. BACKGROUND Defendants are former officers, executives, and employees of Backpage.com, a classified advertisement website  that specialized in ""adult"" services and largely served as a forum for soliciting prostitution. (See [*5]  generally     2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112853, *3 Page 3 of 13   Doc. 230, ""Superseding Indictment"" or ""SI"".) On July 25, 2018, a federal grand jury returned a 100-count  Superseding Indictment against Defendants alleging their commission of numerous criminal acts—conspiracy,  violations of the Travel Act, and money laundering—in the operation of Backpage.com (""Backpage""). The instant dispute is far from fresh. Defendants' Motion relates to a previous order issued by the Honorable Steven  P. Logan, United States District Judge of the District of Arizona. (Doc. 339, ""J. Logan Order"".) At core, that order  concerned Defendants' attempt to compel the Government to sift through voluminous, previously disclosed  discovery, and furnish Defendants with an itemized list of exculpatory documents pursuant to Brady v. Maryland,  373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963) and Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154, 92 S. Ct.  763, 31 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1972). (Id. at 1-2.) After reviewing the relevant precedent, Judge Logan concluded that the  Government was ""under no obligation to identify Brady or Giglio material within voluminous discovery"" and denied  the motion. (Id. at 5.) In so doing, Judge Logan reminded the Government to abide by earlier stipulations and ""turn  over any Brady/Giglio material it comes across in the future to Defendants within 10 days."" (Id. at 6.) That order did  not end the parties' [*6]  disagreements over what Brady required. In subsequent correspondence with the  Government, Defendants identified thirty-one (31) categories of information they believed the Government was  required to disclose to satisfy its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215  (1969) and Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). (Mot., Ex. 1.) Unsatisfied  with the Government's response, Defendants sought the Court's intervention and filed the current motion. II. LEGAL STANDARD As a general rule, a defendant has no constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case. Weatherford v. Bursey,  429 U.S. 545, 559, 97 S.Ct. 837, 51 L.Ed.2d 30 (1977). But under Brady v. Maryland and its progeny, a prosecutor  has an obligation, imposed by the Due Process Clause, to disclose ""evidence favorable to an accused upon  request . . . where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment."" 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.  Ed. 2d 215. Favorable evidence is ""any evidence"" that ""tend[s] to call the government's case into doubt"" including  ""both exculpatory and impeachment material that is relevant to either guilt or punishment."" Milke v. Ryan, 711 F.3d  998, 1012 (9th Cir. 2013) (citing Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 280, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999)).  The failure to disclose such evidence violates due process ""irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the  prosecution."" Strickler, 527 U.S. at 280, 119 S.Ct. 1936 (quoting Brady, 373 U.S. at 87). ""[E]vidence is material only  if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the [*7]  result of the  proceeding would have been different."" United States v. Cano, 934 F.3d 1002, 1022 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting  United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). Unlike other discovery obligations, the duty to disclose Brady material is an affirmative, self-executing duty that  exists irrespective of a defendant's request. Paradis v. Arave, 240 F.3d 1169, 1176 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing United               2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112853, *5 Page 4 of 13   States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985)). But Brady does not oblige the  government ""to produce information which it does not possess or of which it is unaware."" Sanchez v. United States,  50 F.3d 1448, 1453 (9th Cir. 1995). Nor does it require the government to open its files merely because a defendant  requests or ""permit a defendant to sift through information held by the government to determine materiality."" United  States v. Lucas, 841 F.3d 796, 807 (9th Cir. 2016); see also Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U.S. 545, 559, 97 S.Ct.  837, 51 L. Ed. 2d 30 (""There is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case, and Brady did not  create one.""). Instead, Brady imposes a duty on the government to turn over only material, exculpatory or otherwise  helpful to the defense, in its possession. ""Possession,"" however, is not limited to a prosecutor's personal  knowledge. Browning v. Baker, 875 F.3d 444, 460 (9th Cir. 2017), cert. denied,     U.S.     , 138 S.Ct. 2608, 201  L.Ed.2d 1014 (2018); United States v. Bryan, 868 F.2d 1032, 1036 (9th Cir. 1989). That is because prosecutors'  ""unique position to obtain information known to other agents of the government,"" obliges them to ""disclos[e] what  [they] do not know but could have learned. Carriger v. Stewart, 132 F.3d 463, 480 (9th Cir. 1997) (en banc); see  also Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 437, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995) (describing the individual  prosecutors ""duty to learn of any [*8]  favorable evidence known to [those] acting on the government's behalf""). This  requirement extends to information held by subordinates, see Kyles, 514 U.S. at 438; United States v. Price, 566  F.3d 900, 908-09 (9th Cir. 2009), and at times, information held by other executive branch agencies, see United  States v. Santiago, 46 F.3d 885, 893 (9th Cir. 1995); United States v. Jennings, 960 F.2d 1488, 1490-91 (9th Cir.  1992). Ultimately, these duties are unequivocally the Government's alone. ""It is the government, not the defendant  or the trial court, that decides prospectively what information, if any, is material and must be disclosed under  Brady."" Lucas, 841 F.3d at 807 (emphasis in original). III. DISCUSSION Defendants accuse the Government of withholding approximately forty-two separate categories of Brady material.  Outside of rehashing a dormant discovery dispute, Defendants argue (1) that the Government misunderstands its  Brady obligations in the context of a pretrial request; (2) that its obligations require disclosure of materials in  possession of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (""NCMEC""); and (3) the Attorneys General of  California and Texas—organizations that they argue function as an arm of the government. (Mot. at 14-17.) Before parsing Defendants individual claims, [*9]  the Court briefly addresses the circumstances underlying this  Motion and the effects of resolution of other discovery disputes on the Motion. First, as a procedural matter, the  Motion violates orders of this Court. In August 2018, Defendant Padilla moved to compel the government to furnish  Defendants with an itemized list identifying specific Brady and Giglio materials within the Government's voluminous  production of discovery materials. As discussed previously, by that time the Government's discovery productions  were extensive, (see generally Doc. 294), and the Court subsequently affirmed that the Government had no  obligation to itemize Brady and Giglio material. (Doc. 339 at 5-6.) Since then, the Government has disclosed vast  amounts of additional material in more functional format. Discovery disputes in this case have been numerous,  constant, and consuming—to date, the Court has considered seven separate motions to compel, (see e.g. Docs.              2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112853, *7 Page 5 of 13   352, 400, 643, 662, 665, 740, 777), and their associated responsive motions. To better manage the emergent  discovery disputes, the Court assumed a more active role in managing discovery and, in an August 19, 2019  motions hearing, (considering Doc. [*10]  679, ""Motion for Sanctions"", Doc. 561, ""Motion to Dismiss"", Docs 662,  665 ""Motions to Compel,"" and Doc. 531, ""Motion for Discovery""), the Court expressly ""prohibit[ed] the parties from  filing any further motions to compel or motions for discovery until the parties contact the Court to discuss,"" (Doc.  728 at 2)—a prohibition Defendants ignored entirely in filing the instant Motion. The imposition of sanctions, to  include possible dismissal of Defendants' Motion, is justified on this ground alone. See State Farm Fire and Cas.  Co. v. ex rel. Rigsby, 137 S.Ct. 436, 444, 196 L.Ed.2d 340, 85 USLW 4011 (2016) (""District courts have inherent  power, moreover, to impose sanctions short of dismissal for violations of court orders."") (citing Chambers v.  NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43-46, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991). Without condoning their documented  disregard for this Court's instructions, the Court nonetheless considers the merits of Defendants' arguments to  ensure that this issue is not further delayed. Second, many of Defendants' requests are now moot. Defendants also seek production of ""any and all witnesses,  documents and information"" along three broad categories: (1) Backpage ads reported to NCMEC; (2) exculpatory  information relating to Backpage's moderation practices and alleged mens rea; and (3) information related to user  posts (or attempts) of lawful adult [*11]  categories. (See Mot. at 9.) The Court finds those requests satisfied by  Government disclosures subsequent to the filing of this Motion. (See Doc. 839.) Much of the material requested by  the Motion is either currently impossible to produce or material that Defendants now possess. For example,  Defendants request for disclosure of every ad ever posted on Backpage is largely moot. (See Mot. at 8-9.) Because  Backpage users regularly posted ads for ""lawful adult services,"" Defendants argue that ""each and every such ad"" is  Brady material insofar as it contradicts the Government's position that the ""vast majority"" of Backpage ads were for  illegal prostitution. (Id.) But Defendants now have ""each and every such ad""—at least those that still exist. As the  Court previously found after carefully considering Defendants' first motion to compel discovery, (Doc. 643):  ""Defendants possess all the ad data held on Backpage at the time of seizure"" and ""are further aware of cost-free,  effective tools to analyze the data."" (Doc. 839 at 15.) And because ""Backpage did not use versioning . . .  Defendants cannot expect to find all historical versions"" versions of Backpage ads ""if later deleted."" (Id. at 15-16.) In  many [*12]  ways, the Government's disclosures have far exceeded what Brady requires. The Government's  disclosures allow Defendants to identify every Backpage ad reported to NCMEC, exculpatory information related to  Backpage's moderation practices, and user post information related to ads posted in lawful adult categories. Thus,  Defendants have both the material (in a searchable format) and the means to ""search for exculpatory . . . practices.""  (Id. at 15 (finding that ""[c]ombined with the earlier hot document production . . . the Government's disclosures meet  their Rule 16 obligations."")). With that understanding, the Court considers Defendants' request for the categories of  Brady material the Government has allegedly withheld. a. Brady's Materiality Requirement Failure to disclose information only constitutes a Brady violation if the requested information is material to the  defense. Sanchez v. United States, 50 F.3d 1448, 1454 (9th Cir. 1995). So, to compel contested Brady disclosures  Defendants must establish the requested information is ""material."" The parties disagree over just what ""material""  means in the context of a pretrial motion. Citing Brady's standard definition of materiality, the Government contends  ""[t]he test . . . is whether the requested evidence [*13]  might affect the outcome of the trial."" (Resp. at 3 (citing  United States v. Alvarez, 358 F.3d 1194, 1211-12 (9th Cir. 2004)); see also United States v. Nagra, 147 F.3d 875,  881 (9th Cir. 1998) (discussing Brady's pre-trial disclosure requirements) (quoting United States v. Hanna, 55 F.3d       2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112853, *9 Page 6 of 13   1456, 1459 (9th Cir. 1995)). Defendants argue that definition conflates a post-trial with a pretrial materiality  standard, (see Reply at 3 (citing United States v. Acosta, 357 F. Supp. 2d 1228 (D. Nev. 2005) and United States v.  Sudikoff, 36 F.Supp.2d 1196 (C.D. Cal. 1999)), and instead urge the Court to adopt the more expansive standard  articulated in United States v. Sudikoff which interprets Brady to require ""disclosure of exculpatory information that  is either admissible or is reasonably likely to lead to admissible evidence."" 36 F.Supp.2d at 1200. Effectually, this  means producing any evidence that ""will 'assist [Defendants] in formulating a defense.'"" (Reply at 4 (citing Soto- Zuniga, 837 F.3d at 1003).) This incongruity reflects a tension inherent in applying Brady's materiality standard—a backwards looking standard  that contemplates a post-trial judicial decision—to a pretrial prosecutorial judgment. See Agurs, 427 U.S. at 108  (finding a ""significant practical difference"" between pretrial and post-trial application of the ""inevitably imprecise""  Brady standard). Unsurprisingly, trial courts have wrestled with applying Brady materiality standard's in the pretrial  context—with uneven results.See e.g., United States v. Lischewski, No. 18-cr-00203-EMC-1, 2019 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 86432, 2019 WL 2211328, at *2 (N.D. Cal. May 22, 2019) (finding [*14]  it ""clear that a defendant must do  more than provide mere speculation that Brady material exists, but it is not clear that the Court must apply the post- trial materiality standard when reviewing a motion to compel Brady material""); United States v. Heine, 314 F.R.D.  498, 504 (D. Or. 2016) (defining materiality according to ""Ninth Circuit law"" as ""whether the requested evidence  might affect the outcome of the trial"") (emphasis added); Acosta, 357 F.Supp.2d at 1243 (characterizing Sudikoff as  ""a significant departure from the Supreme Court's articulation of the prosecutor's constitutional Brady obligations"" to  emphasize ""[t]he Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit have held prosecutors must turn over material exculpatory  evidence in pretrial discovery, not all exculpatory evidence however insignificant.""); Sudikoff, 36 F.Supp.2d at 1200  (rejecting materiality as applied in the appellate context in favor of a pretrial standard requiring disclosure of  ""evidence that may reasonably be considered favorable to the defendant's case and that would likely lead to  admissible evidence"") (citing Bagley, 473 U.S. at 696); United States v. McVeigh, 954 F. Supp. 1441, 1449-50 (D.  Colo. 1997) (""[t]here is no established procedure for due process disclosures required by Brady . . . [because] it is  not possible to apply the materiality standard . . . before the outcome of the trial is known""). The Ninth Circuit's guidance on this narrow issue is somewhat vague. The Ninth Circuit has recognized that the  ""significant practical difference between the pretrial decision of the prosecutor and the post-trial decision of the  judge"" is borne from unease in relying on a ""trial prosecutor's speculative prediction[s] about the likely materiality of  favorable evidence."" United States v. Olsen, 704 F.3d 1172, 1183 n.3 (9th Cir. 2013) (noting trial courts' divergent  approaches) (quoting United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 108, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 49 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1976)). The  circuit once noted Sudikoff with approval, but stopped short of explicitly adopting Sudikoff's exceptionally broad  conception of pretrial materiality.See United States v. Price, 566 F.3d at 913 n.14 (""For the benefit of trial                  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112853, *13 Page 7 of 13   prosecutors . . .we note favorably the thoughtful analysis set forth by two district courts in this circuit: '[T]he  materiality standard usually associated with Brady . . . should not be applied to pretrial discovery of exculpatory  materials. . . ."") (quoting Acosta, 357 F.Supp.2d at 1239-40) (alterations in original). What is clear since that  thoughtful approval, however, is that ""[t]he mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information"" might help a  defense or affect the outcome of a trial, ""does not establish 'materiality' in the constitutional sense."" [*16]  Olsen,  704 F.3d at 1184 (quoting Barker v. Fleming, 423 F.3d 1085, 1099 (9th Cir. 2005)). As other courts have recognized, this nod to Sudikoff does not obviate a district court's mandate to follow settled  Ninth Circuit law. See e.g., United States v. Heine, 314 F.R.D. 498, 504 (D. Ore. 2016); United States v. DeLeon,  No. CR 15-4268 JB, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17811, 2017 WL 2271430, at *48 (D.N.M. Feb. 8, 2017); United States  v. Inzunza, No. 03cr2434 JM, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34593, 2004 WL 7334066, at *3 (S.D. Cal. Jul. 8, 2004); see  also United States v. Hopkins, 427 U.S. 123, 125, 96 S. Ct. 2508, 49 L. Ed. 2d 361 (1976) (""[C]ourts should refrain  from legislating by judicial fiat."") (citation omitted). ""[I]n a case like this, in which the defendant requests specific  evidence under Brady, he must show that it is material."" Alvarez, 358 F.3d at 1211-12. The clunky application of  Brady's materiality standard-- whether the requested evidence might affect the outcome of the trial""—in the pretrial  context may counsel more expansive Government disclosure where doubt exists as to the usefulness or  impeachment value of evidence, but does not transform Brady into an expansive discovery device. Id.; see also  United States v. Michaels, 796 F.2d 1112, 1116 (9th Cir. 1986) (finding a district court did not abuse its discretion in  denying a pretrial request for specific Brady material because ""in a case in which a specific request is made, 'the  test for materiality is whether the requested evidence might affect the outcome of [*17]  the trial.'"") (quoting United  States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 104, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1975)). Thus, the Court cannot adopt  Defendants' position that, in the pretrial context, Brady compels the Government to produce any material that a  defendant believes will assist formulation of a defense. And regardless, Defendants' broad requests speculating  that Brady material exists does not satisfy another baseline Brady requirement. ""'Mere speculation about materials  in the government's files' [does] not require the district court to make those materials available, or mandate an in  camera inspection."" United States v. Mincoff, 574 F.3d 1186, 1200 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Michaels, 796 F.2d at  1116); see also Lucas, 841 F.3d at 808 (""to challenge the government's representation that it does not have Brady  evidence, [a defendant] must do more than speculate that Brady material exists""). ""The mere possibility that an item  of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of trial, does not  establish 'materiality' in the constitutional sense."" Agurs, 427 U.S. at 109-10 (internal quotations and citations  omitted), reversed on other grounds by Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481. Of course, where doubt exists as to the materiality of favorable evidence, the Government should resolve such  doubts in favor of full disclosure. See Olsen, 704 F.3d at 1183 n.3; U.S. v. Van Brandy, 726 F.2d 548, 552 (9th Cir.  1984) (emphasis added) (citing Agurs, 427 U.S. at 104). But that does not ""alter the fundamental [*18]  construct of  Brady."" Lucas, 841 F.3d at 809. It remains the case that the prosecutor, not a defendant, ""make[s] judgment calls  about what would count as favorable evidence"" and that ""the character of a piece of evidence as favorable will often  turn on the context of the existing or potential evidentiary record."" Kyles, 514 U.S. at 439. This responsibility does  not, as Defendants seem to imply, translate into an ""open file policy.""Weatherford, 429 U.S. at 559; see also              2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112853, *15 Page 8 of 13   Kyles, 514 U.S. at 439 (recognizing that Brady ""requires less of the prosecution than the ABA Standards for  Criminal Justice, which call generally for prosecutorial disclosures of evidence tending to exculpate or mitigate"").  Insofar as Defendants' disclosure requests rely on application of their chosen pretrial materiality standard, the  requests will be denied. b. Possible Brady Material Possessed By NCMEC Defendants seek to bring materials in possession of the NCMEC under the Government's Brady umbrella because  NCMEC, they argue, is an agent and arm of the government, serves a traditional police function and, here,  operated as a member of the Government's ""prosecution team""  for Brady purposes. (Mot. at 14-15.) They first  point to cases from other circuits finding that NCMEC acted [*19]  as a government entity or agent for Fourth or  Sixth Amendment purposes and ask the Court to hold similarly concerning Brady. Defendants then highlight facts  that purportedly establish this. (Mot. at 16.) The Government counters that NCMEC is a private, non-profit  organization beyond the scope of Brady's disclosure requirements. And while, admittedly, NCMEC was found to  have acted as a government entity or agent in other cases, the Government contends such cases are factually  distinguishable, limited to Fourth and Sixth Amendment inquiries, and do not incorporate recent responsive  statutory amendments. (Resp. at 6-7.) The Government argues that Defendants' position is premised on an  unjustifiable expansive reading of case law ""which no court has endorsed."" (Id. at 6.) The Government is correct— Defendants offer little to persuade the Court to extend out-of-circuit rulings to hold that NCMEC is a governmental  entity for Brady purposes or show that NCMEC's involvement in the instant investigation triggers the Government's  Brady obligations. At the outset, the Court reiterates that Brady does not require a prosecutor ""to produce information which it does  not possess or of which it is unaware."" Sanchez v. United States, 50 F.3d 1448, 1453 (9th Cir. 1995). Instead,  prosecutors are obligated to turn [*20]  over only material, exculpatory or otherwise helpful to the defense, that it  has in its possession. What is in a prosecutor's ""possession"" extends beyond what the prosecutor personally knows  to include information held by subordinate investigating police officers or other executive branch agencies  participating in an investigation. See Cano, 934 F.3d at 1023. An agency's participation in an investigation is  sufficient, but not necessary, to establish that the Government has access the agency's information. United States  v. Santiago, 46 F.3d 885, 893-94 (9th Cir. 1995). So while there remains ""no obligation to turn over documents  maintained by independent third parties who are not part of the investigation team,"" United States v. Lankford, No.  10-CR-00398 AWI BAM, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74221, 2013 WL 2295988 at *1 (E.D. Cal. May 24, 2013) (citing  Santiago, 46 F.3d at 894), courts may deem the Government has ""knowledge and access"" of materials held by  separate governmental divisions with no responsibility for the investigation or prosecution of the crime in question.  See e.g., Santiago, 46 F.3d at 893-94. United States v. Blanco, 392 F.3d 382, 393-94 (9th Cir. 2004) (finding the  prosecution had knowledge and access of material in custody of the investigating agency); United States v. Wood,                2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112853, *18 Page 9 of 13   57 F.3d 733, 737 (9th Cir. 1995) (holding that an ""agency charged with administration of the statute, which has  consulted with the prosecutor in the steps leading to prosecution, is to be considered as part of the prosecution in  determining [*21]  what information must be made available to the defendant charged with violation of the statute."").  This factual determination is necessarily made case-by-case and agency-by-agency. W.R. Grace, 401 F.Supp.2d at  1078. Broadly, Defendants make three related claims: (1) that NCMEC is a governmental entity; (2) that, in relation to this  case, NCMEC acted as an agent of the government and/or (3) acted as a member of the prosecution team.  Defendants support their position with four out-of-circuit cases—United States v. Ackerman, 831 F.3d 1292 (10th  Cir. 2016); United States v. Cameron, 699 F.3d 621 (1st Cir. 2012); United States v. Keith, 980 F.Supp.2d 33 (D.  Mass. 2013); and United States v. Coyne, Nos. 5:16-cr-154-01, 5:17-cr-21-01, 387 F. Supp. 3d 387, 2018 WL  8667649 (D. Vt. 2018). Chief among them is United States v. Ackerman. The Ackerman court recognized that  NCMEC's authorizing statutes mandated collaboration with all levels of law enforcement and granted the  organization law enforcement powers that extended far beyond those enjoyed by primary citizens, to conclude that,  in the Fourth Amendment context, NCMEC is a governmental entity, and, at minimum, served as a government  agent in that case. Id. at 1296-1302. Defendants' arguments largely rehash Ackerman's analysis. Compare Mot.  at 15-16 (providing five justifications to assert NCMEC is an agent of the government) with Ackerman, 831 F.3d at  1296-99 (listing the same). But as the Government's emphasizes, [*22]  the NCMEC functions cited by  Defendants, and which in Ackerman ""illustrat[ed] and ""confirm[ed] the special law enforcement duties and powers  [NCMEC] enjoys""—primarily, the CyberTipline—are not at issue here. Ackerman, 831 F.3d at 1296-99. Thus, while  much of the Ackerman court's reasoning remains generally relevant, its specific application outside the Fourth  Amendment context to the instant prosecution is more questionable. Put otherwise, ""just because an entity is a  government entity or agent for purposes of a Fourth Amendment analysis does not necessarily mean that it is part  of the prosecution team for discovery purposes in a particular case."" United States v. Rosenschein, No. 16-4571  JCH, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90607, 2019 WL 2298810, at *6 (D.N.M. May 30, 2019). At the least, this distinction  gives the Court pause before adopting Ackerman's holding wholesale in the Brady context. This is especially so  when, unlike in Defendants' cases, there is little to indicate that the prosecution of Backpage directly implicated the  investigatory functions (like the CyberTipline) that in Ackerman confirmed NCMEC's ""special law enforcement  duties."" Ackerman, 831 F.3d at 1296. And Defendants do not identify any additional statutory functions—outside of  those operative in Ackerman [*23]  but not at issue here—to persuade the Court to hold that NCMEC is a  governmental entity for Brady purposes. A quick look at the Superseding Indictment further undermines  Defendants' argument here. As the Government observes, the Superseding Indictment scarcely mentions  NCMEC—the organization appears in a mere four of 211 paragraphs within the 92-page, 100-count Superseding  Indictment. At most, the Superseding Indictment shows NCMEC's involvement in a handful of previous attempts to  persuade Backpage executives to adopt safeguards to combat sex trafficking. (SI ?? 89, 97, 134, 140.) Not once  does the Superseding Indictment implicate the statutory functions central to Ackerman's holding. Nor do  Defendants address the effect of post-Ackerman changes to NCMEC's authorizing statutes. See The               2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112853, *20 Page 10 of 13   CyberTipline Modernization Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-395, 132 Stat. 5287 (Dec. 21, 2018) (emphasizing  NCMEC serves it's ""clearinghouse role as a private, nonprofit organization""); The Missing Children's Assistance  Act, Pub. L. No. 115-267, § 2, 132 Stat. 3757-3760 (Oct. 11, 2018) (setting forth NCMEC's statutory duties and  responsibilities). The facts matter here. W.R. Grace, 401 F.Supp.2d at 1078. That NCMEC generally fit the definition of a  government agent or [*24]  entity in other cases does not, contrary to Defendants' position, automatically place  NCMEC within the ambit of the Government's Brady requirements in this case. The Government's Brady  requirements are not limitless. Even assuming Defendants are correct to characterize NCMEC as a government  entity, the Government's Brady obligation to ""learn of any favorable evidence known to [those] acting on the  government's behalf"", Kyles, 514 U.S. at 437, only extends to those entities ""participating in the same investigation  of the defendant""—something Defendants fail to establish. Bryan, 868 F.2d at 1036. What Defendants offer to  prove NCMEC's participation is weak. Namely, Defendants cite: (1) the public statements of NCMEC's former  President urging the Department of Justice to prosecute Backpage; (2) NCMEC's voluntary compliance to the  Government's request for information; and (3) the fact that four current or former NCMEC employees are listed as  possible Government witnesses. (Mot. at 16-17.) First, Defendants argue the statements of NCMEC Co-founder and Director John Walsh from a DOJ-sponsored  event confirm that NCMEC acted as ""an arm of the government with respect to this specific case."" (Reply at [*25]  5  (emphasis in original)). Mr. Walsh's comments alone are insufficiently probative of NCMEC's degree of participation  to merit the imposition of expansive discovery obligations on the prosecution nor are they properly attributable to  the government merely because the government sponsored the event. Rather, his remarks focus on NCMEC's  mission  generally.  (See  Reply.  at  5  (citing  Video  of  Oct.  4,  2019  Event,  available  at  https://www.justice.gov/opa/video/lawful-access-summit).) Where the comments do implicate Backpage.com, Mr.  Walsh focuses on NCMEC's congressional advocacy designed to shed light on Backpage's alleged illegal activities.  The Court cannot draw any conclusions from NCMEC seeking congressional action on an issue that falls squarely  within nonprofit mission to ""lead[] the fight against abduction, abuse and exploitation."" NCF MAEC, https://www.missingkids.org/ (last visited June 26, 2020). Only one brief  comment indicates any NCMEC involvement in this case. And while, admittedly, Walsh's laudatory representation  that a single employee ""helped [the Government] prepare the case"" might indicate some NCMEC involvement in  the instant prosecution, [*26]  it hardly indicates the level of that involvement. (Reply at 5.) The degree of NCMEC's                  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112853, *23 Page 11 of 13   involvement is pivotal to this inquiry. A single off-hand comment by a former NCMEC executive is insufficient to  support expanding the Government's Brady obligations as Defendants request. Second, Defendants fail to show how complying with the Government's request for information transforms an entity  into ""agent of the government."" (Mot. at 17.) Mere compliance with a government request for information that  squarely falls within NCMEC's nonprofit mission does not indicate an agency relationship with the government in a  specific case. See United States v. DiTomasso, 932 F.3d 58, 69 (2d Cir. 2019) (holding that NCMEC's ""forwarding  of reports to law enforcement"" was no foundation the ""contention that there was an action by NCMEC that violated  [defendant's] Fourth Amendment rights""). Lastly, Defendants' remaining justification—that an identifying former NCMEC employees as possible witnesses  makes NCMEC an arm of the Government—is not supported. Of course, the inclusion of witnesses in some  instances could add weight to a well-developed argument supported by probative facts indicating that an  organization like NCMEC acted as an arm of the government. But here, Defendants' [*27]  argument is not well  developed and is lacking facts. Like each argument Defendants raise, the Government's inclusion of four current or  former NCMEC employees as possible witnesses is not, by itself, sufficiently probative to deem information held by  NCMEC is within the knowledge and access of the Government. Non-profit organizations like NCMEC ""do not become government entities simply because they are engaged in  work of public significance,"" have a mission coextensive with a government investigation, and then cooperate with  that investigation. United States v. Coyne, 387 F.Supp.3d 387, 397 (D. Vt. 2018). Without more to establish  NCMEC's participation in the instant investigation and affirm the materiality of the information sought, the Court will  not order the Government to search a non-profit organizations coffers for Brady material neither party knows exists.  It remains the case that ""a federal prosecutor need not comb the files of every federal agency which might have  documents"" regarding the defendant. Zuno-Arce, 44 F.3d at 1427. c. Brady Material Held by the California and Texas Attorneys General In the closing paragraphs of their motion, Defendants tack on a final, sparsely worded request for disclosure of any  Brady evidence in possession of the Attorneys General [*28]  of the States of California and Texas. (Mot. at 17.) As  discussed, the Government is required to disclose materials beyond that in physical possession of the prosecution  team itself. See United States v. Bryan, 868 F.2d 1032, 1036 (9th Cir. 1089) (citing United State v. Robertson, 634  F.Supp. 1020 (E.D. Cal. 1986), aff'd, 815 F.2d 714 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 912, 108 S. Ct. 258, 98 L. Ed.  2d 215 (1987) (""Limiting 'government' to the prosecution alone unfairly allows the prosecution access to documents  without making them available to the defense."")). But a prosecutor is ""under no obligation to turn over materials not  in its control,"" United States v. Aichele, 941 F.2d 761, 764 (9th Cir. 1991), including materials held exclusively by  state agencies. The Ninth Circuit has consistently held ""that prosecutors are never deemed to have access to  material held by state agencies."" U.S. v. Santiago, 46 F.3d 885, 894 (9th Cir. 1995) (citing Aichele, 941 F.2d at  764). Normally, the federal government's Brady obligations do ""not extent to 'files that were under the exclusive  control of state officials,'"" Amado v. Gonzalez, 758 F.3d 1119, 1137 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Benn v. Lambert, 283  F.3d 1040, 1061 (9th Cir. 2002)), but in special circumstances, federal prosecutors can be so obligated. For  instance, when federal and state authorities pool investigative energies to a considerable extent and state  investigators function as agents of the federal government under the principles of agency law, a court may require  federal prosecutors to disclose related Brady material. See United States v. Naranjo, 634 F.3d 1198, 1212 (11th  Cir. 2011) (citing United States v. Antone, 603 F.2d 566, 569-70 (11th Cir. 1989)).     2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112853, *26 Page 12 of 13   As far as the Court can tell, [*29]  this is not a like circumstance. Defendants cite no case law or substantively  address the Government's response on this matter. Instead, Defendants point to a single DOJ press release that  praises state law enforcement for its assistance. Defendants claim this ""admission of partnership"" throws open the  doors of discovery and obliges the Government to produce any Brady material in the possession of those state law  enforcement agencies. (Mot. at 17.) It does not. Defendants' claims are unavailing. Defendants brief argument  cites no other facts indicating the state agencies pooled their investigative resources with the prosecution or  functioned as agents of the federal government. (Reply at 6.) Instead, they imply that it is Government's burden to  deny their unsupported allegations. (Id.) That is simply not the case. Given the paucity of evidence supporting  Defendants' claim and the clear weight of case law against granting their request, the Court concludes that  Defendants fail to adequately challenge the Government's representation that it has complied with its Brady  obligations regarding the Attorneys' General of Texas and California. See Lucas, 841 F.3d at 808. This does not, of  course, affect the Government's [*30]  continuing duty to comply with its Brady obligations, prior stipulations, and  representations to this Court. See United States v. Fort, 478 F.3d 1099, 1100 (9th Cir. 2007) (order denying reh'g  en banc) (clarifying that ""evidence gathered by state and local actors becomes subject to the disclosure obligation  established by Rule 16 when it passes into federal possession for the purposes of a federal prosecution of the  same defendants for the same acts that were initially subject to the state or local investigation""); see also United  States v. Cerna, 633 F.Supp.2d 1053, 1060 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (""When state police gives a federal investigator  access to its files for the purpose of pulling items of interest to a federal investigation, Brady requires that the  prosecution team review as well for Brady materials within the same universe of files.""). d. Defendants' Specific Requests The above debate obscures the fact that the Government has already responded to Defendants' request for the  disclosure of thirty-one categories of Brady materials. (Mot. at 10-14; Resp., Exh. A.) Finding many of these  responses infirm, (Reply at 7), Defendants take particular issue with specific responses where they conclude the  Government has improperly restricted production to only material relevant ""to the defenses that the government  has [*31]  decided Defendants can assert,"" (see Resps. 1, 2, 6, 10, 11, 13, 24, 27), or responses where the  Government improperly ""qualif[ies] its duty to disclose by what it understands to be its 'obligations under Rule 16,  Brady, and 18 U.S.C. § 3500' (see Resps. 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29.)."" (Reply at 7- 8.) Accordingly, their defense ""will not be limited to asserting only those defenses approved by the government""  and, ""[c]onsequently, the government must produce any evidence that may 'assist in formulating a defense' even if  the government disagrees about the viability of a defense."" (Reply at 7.) As discussed, the Court does not endorse  Defendants' view of Brady's pretrial materiality obligations and, while counseling the Government to err on the side  of disclosure where doubt exists as to the usefulness of possible favorable evidence, finds the Government  responses satisfactory. (See Resps. 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29.) Furthermore, while  some of Defendants' requests seek access to specific material they believe in the Government's possession, the  remaining requests are both overbroad and unsupported. Such conclusory allegations do not satisfy [*32]  the  threshold showing of materiality required under Brady. Merely alleging the Government has failed to disclose  favorable evidence is not enough; such a rule ""would impose an impossible burden on the prosecutor and would  undermine the interest in the finality of judgments."" Bagley, 473 U.S. at 675 n.7. Defendants' also ask this Court to ignore well-settled precedent. ""It is the government, not the defendant or the trial  court, that decides prospectively what information, if any, is material and must be disclosed under Brady."" Lucas,         2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112853, *28 Page 13 of 13   841 F.3d at 807. Contrary to Defendants' representations, Brady's constitutional mandates are self-executing and  fall exclusively within the province of a prosecutor. Paradis, 240 F.3d at 1176. Brady is not an evidentiary rule  granting broad powers to a defendant. Weatherford, 429 U.S. at 559; see also Bagley, 473 U.S. at 675 n. 7 (holding  a defendant's right to disclosure of favorable evidence does not ""create a broad, constitutionally required right of  discovery.""). Defendants cite no case that ""alter[s] th[is] fundamental construct of Brady, which makes a prosecutor  the initial arbiter of materiality and disclosure."" Lucas, 841 F.3d at 809 (citing Ritchie, 480 U.S. at 60). True, the  Government cannot restrict Defendants strategy of defense, but it remains a prosecutor's duty to comply with Brady  and prospectively decide what [*33]  information is material. This discretionary obligation may be vexing to  Defendants and difficult to administer for the Government, but Defendants simply do not provide enough to rebut  the Government's positions regarding its Brady compliance. Although the lack of support for their challenge to  Government's representations on all the above questions is fatal to Defendants Motion, the Court leaves the  Government with a cautionary note—it is the Government that is best placed to understand the degree to which  NCMEC and state law enforcement was involved in the investigation of this case. The continuing duty to meet the  minimum constitutional standards of due process enshrined by Brady belongs to the Government. It is there too,  that the risks of incomplete disclosure squarely fall.",0
"Vidal v. Galaxy 2439 Enters., LLC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217264","MEMORANDUM OPINION SHIPP, District Judge This matter comes before the Court upon the Motion to  Dismiss Plaintiff Leslie Vidal's (""Plaintiff"") Complaint  (ECF No. 1), jointly filed by Defendants Galaxy 2439  Enterprises, LLC (""Galaxy"") and Genesis Biotechnology  Group,  LLC  (""Genesis"")  (hereinafter  collectively  ""Defendants""). (ECF No. 5). Plaintiff opposed the Motion  (ECF No. 8), and Defendants replied (ECF No. 9). The  Court has considered the parties' written submissions  and decides the Motion without oral argument, pursuant  to Local Civil Rule 78.1. For the reasons set forth below,  Counts One, Three, and Four against Genesis are  dismissed  with  prejudice;  Count  Two  against  Defendants is dismissed with prejudice; and Counts  One, Three, and Four against Galaxy are dismissed  without prejudice. I. BACKGROUND A. Statement of Facts On or about February 22, 2021, Defendants hired  Plaintiff [*2]   as  a  part-time  Human  Resources  Consultant to assist ""Defendants in its [sic] review of  current Human Resources practices, and assist with  Defendants' launch of its [sic] new professional  employer organization division, Professional Core  Solutions."" (Compl. ¶¶ 9-10, ECF No. 1.) Around May  2021, Defendants promoted Plaintiff to a full-time  ""Human Resources & Business Development Manager.""  (Id. ¶¶ 12-13 .) Plaintiff alleges that, throughout her employment, she  ""continuously  raised  concerns,  objections,  and  complaints to her supervisors regarding . . . Defendants'  unlawful, discriminatory employment practices."" (Id. ¶       Page 2 of 11 14.) Plaintiff asserts that she raised, disclosed, and  reported the following concerns to employees in  Defendants' Human Resources Department: (1) failure  to follow standardized hiring procedures; (2) improper  payment of hourly employees; and (3) inconsistencies  in employee discipline and performance processes,  such as that ""female employees and employees in  racially protected classes were severely disciplined for  infractions  or  performance  concerns  and  white  employees were not severely disciplined, if at all."" (Id.  ¶¶ 15, 18, 20.) Despite such reports, Plaintiff states  that [*3]  Defendants did not take any action to address  the improper behavior. (Id. ¶¶ 16-17, 19, 20-21.) On or about June 28, 2021, Defendants had a job fair to  recruit employees for various positions; Plaintiff, as the  Human  Resources  and  Business  Development  Manager, ""was tasked with . . . attempting to match  each candidate with an open position."" (Id. ¶¶ 23-24.)  Based on an executive's (the ""Executive"") request ""that  Plaintiff direct all candidates [with hospitality experience]  to her job station first,"" Plaintiff ""directed [to the  Executive] a Black male job fair attendee . . . who  indicated that he had experience in the hospitality  industry."" (Id. ¶¶ 25-26.) Plaintiff [*4]  asserts that as  she approached the Executive with the Black job fair  attendee, the Executive ""began to make a shooing  gesture toward Plaintiff stating kilo, I am not going to  interview him,' or words to that effect."" (Id. ¶ 27.) Plaintiff  states that she informed several employees about the  Executive's conduct, which ""she believed . . . constituted  discrimination."" (Id. ¶ 28.) In turn, Plaintiff alleges that a                                       Human Resources Generalist ""informed Plaintiff that  [the Executive] had exhibited racially discriminatory  behavior in the past."" (Id. ¶ 29.) The next day, Plaintiff had a phone call with Defendants'  Human Resources team wherein the team members  discussed how they were ""pleased with the outcome of  the job fair and had deemed it a success."" (Id. ¶ 30.)  Later that day, Plaintiff alleges that the Black job fair  attendee called and stated that ""he believed that [the  Executive] refused to interview him . . . because he is  Black.""  (Id.  ¶¶  31-32.)  Plaintiff  then  informed  Defendants' Senior Human Resources Manager and  Human  Resources  Director  of  the  Executive's  supposedly discriminatory conduct at the job fair and the  job fair attendee's complaint. (Id. ¶ 33.) Plaintiff alleges  that the [*5]  Senior Human Resources Manager  responded that the Executive ""previously exhibited  discriminatory behavior in Defendants' workplace,"" and  ""that [the Executive] is not an 'FIR expert.'"" (Id. ¶ 34.)  Plaintiff further states that the Senior Human Resources  Manager  ""refused  to  commit  to  conducting  an  investigation,"" because ""the matter 'was quite sensitive'  due to [the Executive's] position within the company,  and her romantic relationship with [the CEO]."" (Id. ¶  36.) On June 30, 2021, Defendants' Human Resources  Director and Chief Legal Officer held a meeting with  Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 38.) Plaintiff states that she reiterated the  alleged discriminatory conduct she observed, including  the Executive's conduct at the job fair and Defendants'  hiring, payroll, and disciplinary practices. (Id. at ¶¶ 39- 40.) Plaintiff alleges the Human Resources Director and  Chief Legal Officer ""instructed [her] to keep the  substance  of  her  complaints  and  the  meeting  confidential."" (Id. ¶¶ 39-41.) Plaintiff asserts that, at the  end of that same day, Defendants terminated her ""for  'poor performance,' for 'not meeting goals set for the job  fair,' and finally because the discrimination concerns  raised by Plaintiff [*6]  were investigated and 'did not  line up.'"" (Id. ¶ 42.) Plaintiff states that she had ""not  been told previously that there were any issues with her  job performance."" (Id. ¶ 43.) B. Procedural History     Page 3 of 11 This is not the first time Plaintiff has litigated the  circumstances leading to her termination. On June 24,  2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint in New Jersey Superior  Court against Defendants, along with their CEO, Human  Resources Director, and Senior Human Resources  Manager. (See generally N.J. Super. Ct. Compl., ECF  No. 5-2., Ex. B.) The state complaint pled essentially the  same facts as Plaintiff pleads in this case Plaintiff  claimed that she was terminated after complaining to  Defendants' Human Resources Department about  supposed unlawful practices in hiring, payroll, and  discipline, as well as at the job fair incident. (Compare  Compl. ¶¶ 9-46 with N.J. Super. Ct. Compl. ¶¶ 21-32.)  Plaintiff asserted three counts in her state court  complaint: (1) retaliation under the Conscientious  Employee Protection Act (""CEPA""); (2) retaliation under  the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (""NJLAD"");  and (3) associational discrimination and wrongful  discharge under the NJLAD. (See generally N.J. Super.  Ct. Compl.) On October 27, 2022, the state [*7]  court entered a  consent order dismissing with prejudice Count Three of  Plaintiffs complaint. (Oct. 27, 2022 N.J. Super. Ct.  Consent Order, ECF No. 5-2, Ex. C.) The state court  also dismissed with prejudice Plaintiffs complaint in its  entirety as to Genesis, its CEO, and its Senior Human  Resources Manager. (Id.) The state court reserved  decision on whether Plaintiff stated a claim for retaliation  under CEPA or the NJLAD against Galaxy and its  Human Resources Director. (Id. at 46.) On December 12, 2022, the state court dismissed  Counts One and Two of Plaintiff's state law complaint  against Galaxy and its Human Resources Director  without prejudice. (Dec. 12, 2022 N.J. Super. Ct. Order,  ECF No. 5-2, Ex. C.) The court found Plaintiff's CEPA  claim failed because ""[her] references to unspecified  employment practices [were] insufficient to support the  assertion that [she] had a reasonable belief that any law  was being violated."" (Id. at 49.) The state court found  Plaintiff's NJLAD claim also failed because ""[her]  allegations  [were]  not  enough  to  support  [her]  conclusion that the executive refused to interview the  [j]ob [f]air [a]ttendee because he was Black."" (Id. at 50.) On April 4, 2023, Plaintiff [*8]  filed a complaint in this  Court. (ECF No. 1.) Defendants moved to dismiss  Plaintiff's complaint for failure to state a claim upon  which relief may be granted, pursuant to Federal Rule of  Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (ECF No. 5.) Plaintiff opposed   (ECF No. 8), and Defendants replied (ECF No. 9). II. LEGAL STANDARD A district court conducts a three-part analysis when  considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).  Malleus v. George, 641 F.3d 560, 563 (3d Cir. 2011).  First, the court must identify ""the elements a plaintiff  must plead to state a claim."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.  662, 675, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009).  Second, the court must identify and accept as true, all of  the plaintiff's well-pleaded factual allegations and  ""construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the  plaintiff."" Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210  (3d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). The court can discard  bare  legal  conclusions  or  factually  unsupported  accusations that merely state the defendant unlawfully  harmed the plaintiff. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citing  Twombly v. Bell Atl. Corp., 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.  Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). Third, the court  must determine whether ""the [well-pleaded] facts  alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show that the  plaintiff has a 'plausible claim for relief.' Fowler, 578  F.3d at 211 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679). A facially  plausible claim ""allows the court to draw the reasonable  inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct  alleged."" Id. at 210 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). On  a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the ""defendant bears the burden  of showing [*9]  that no claim has been presented.""  Hedges v. United States, 404 F.3d 744, 750 (3d Cir.  2005) (citing Kehr Packages, Inc. v. Fidelcor, Inc., 926  F.2d 1406, 1409 (3d Cir. 1991)). III. DISCUSSION Plaintiff asserts four Counts against Defendants: (1)  retaliation under 42 U.S.C. § 1981; (2) violation of  CEPA; (3) wrongful termination in violation of New  Jersey public policy pursuant to Pierce v. Ortho  Pharmaceutical Corp., 84 N.J. 58, 417 A.2d 505 (1980);  and (4) violation of the NJLAD. (See Compl. ¶¶ 47-79.)  Each claim stems from Plaintiff's allegation that  Defendants fired her because she ""made complaints  about unlawful human resources practices and racial  discrimination in the workplace."" (See Compl. ¶¶ 48, 60,  66, 72.) A. Claim Preclusion  Page 4 of 11 i. Claims Against Genesis The Court first addresses the question of whether the  previous dismissal of Plaintiff's claims in state court has  preclusive effect in this proceeding. See Giordano v.  Saxon Mortg. Servs. Inc., No. 12-7937, 2013 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 202677, 2013 WL 12158378, at *5 (D.N.J. Oct.  31, 2013) (""Judicial estoppel is a fact-specific, equitable  doctrine, applied at courts' discretion."" (citing New  Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749, 121 S. Ct.  1808, 149 L. Ed. 2d 968 (2001)). Pursuant to the Full  Faith and Credit Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1738, federal courts  must ""give preclusive effect to state-court judgments  whenever the courts of the State from which the  judgments emerged would do so."" Allen v. McCurry, 449  U.S. 90, 96, 101 S. Ct. 411, 66 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1980)  (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1738); see also Adelphia Gateway,  LLC v. Pa. Env't Hearing Bd., 62 F.4th 819, 825 (3d Cir.  2023). Federal courts must ""look to the law of the  adjudicating state"" to determine whether a prior state  court judgment has preclusive effect. Greenleaf v.  Garlock, Inc., 174 F.3d 352, 357 (3d Cir. 1999). In New  Jersey,  the  claim  preclusion  doctrine  gives  preclusive [*10]  effect ""to a prior judgment if a particular  issue, although not litigated, could have been raised in  the earlier proceeding."" Bd. of Trs. of Trucking Emps. of  N. Jersey Welfare Fund, Inc. v. Centra, 983 F.2d 495,  504 (3d Cir. 1992). In other words, claim preclusion bars  consideration of any claims a plaintiff actually brought or  ""could have asserted in the previous lawsuit."" Beasley v.  Howard, 14 F.4th 226, 231-32 (3d Cir. 2021). Claim preclusion requires: ""(1) a final judgment on the  merits in a prior suit involving (2) the same parties or  their privies and (3) a subsequent suit based on the  same causes of action."" United States v. Athlone Indus.,  Inc., 746 F.2d 977, 983 (3d Cir. 1984); Pittman v. La  Fontaine, 756 F. Supp. 834, 841 (D.N.J. 1991) (""To  invoke preclusion, it is required that the subsequent  action must involve substantially similar or identical  causes of action, issues, parties and relief as were  involved in the prior action.""). First, here, there was a final judgment on the merits in  which the state court dismissed all claims against  Genesis with prejudice. (N.J. Super. Ct. Consent Order  45-46.) See Dowdell v. Univ. of Med. & Dentistry, 94 F.  Supp. 2d 527, 533 (D.N.J. 2000) (finding that under  New Jersey law, ""dismissal with prejudice 'constitutes  an adjudication on the merits as fully and completely as  if the order had been entered after a trial.""' (quoting  Feinsod v. Noon, 261 N.J. Super. 82, 617 A.2d 1234,  1235 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1992))). Second,  Genesis was a defendant in the state suit and is also a  defendant in the instant action. Id. at 536 n.10 (finding  the second factor satisfied when ""[Noth parties in the  present [*11]  action were engaged in the state suit."").  Third, Plaintiff's current suit against Genesis is based on  the same causes of action as her previous state action.  To find two causes of action the same, a court must  analyze: (1) whether the wrong for which redress is sought is  the same in both actions (that is, whether the acts  complained of and the demand for relief are the  same)[;] (2) whether the theory of recovery is the  same[;] (3) whether the witnesses and documents  necessary at trial are the same[;] and (4) whether  the material facts alleged are the same. Pittman, 756 F. Supp. at 841 (citing Culver v. Ins. Co. of  N. Am., 115 N.J. 451, 559 A.2d 400, 405 (N.J. 1989)).  Plaintiff's Complaint in this action and her complaint in  the state action both assert claims under the theory that  Plaintiff  was  wrongfully  terminated  based  on  Defendants' retaliation, and both complaints seek relief  through damages. See Dowdell, 94 F. Supp. 2d at 540  (finding that the wrong for which redress is sought is the  same in federal court as it was in state court when  ""termination and its surrounding events served as the  basis for both [plaintiff's] state and federal complaints"").  Plaintiff pleads the same material facts as she did in her  dismissed state action, which would require the  assessment of the same evidence and possible  witnesses. [*12]  The Court, accordingly, finds that  claims under CEPA and the NJLAD against Genesis,  which were brought in state court, must be dismissed.                   Page 5 of 11 See id. (precluding plaintiff's claim because the plaintiff  ""raise[d] claims predicated on events indistinguishable  from those raised in his state complaint.""). Further, Plaintiff had the opportunity to plead her § 1981  and Pierce claims against Genesis in New Jersey state  court, which had jurisdiction to hear all of Plaintiff's  claims brought in this federal action, but failed to do so.  See Marina Bay Towers Urb. Renewal II, L.P. v. City of  N. Wildwood, No. 09-369, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60147,  2009 WL 2147356, at *3 (D.N.J. July 14, 2009) (""[C]ivil  rights claims based on federal law can be brought and  heard in state court."" (citing Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S.  455, 458-59, 110 S. Ct. 792, 107 L. Ed. 2d 887 (1990))).  Claim preclusion thus bars Plaintiff's remaining claims  as to Genesis. See In re Dex Media, Inc., 595 B.R. 19,  33 (D. Del. 2018) (""Claim preclusion 'bars not only  claims that were brought in the previous action, but also  claims that could have been brought.' (quoting  Elkadrawy v. Vanguard Grp., Inc., 584 F.3d 169, 173  (3d Cir. 2009))); Dowdell, 94 F. Supp. 2d at 540 (""The  mere fact that [plaintiff] predicates his instant claims on  Title VII, rather than the NJLAD, does not bar preclusion  of these claims.""); Davis v. U.S. Steel Supply, 688 F.2d  166, 175 (3d Cir. 1982) (precluding plaintiff's § 1981  claim because a nearly identical claim was brought in  state  court  pursuant  to  a  municipal [*13]   antidiscrimination  ordinance  and  dismissed  with  prejudice). Finally, finding that the claims against Genesis are  precluded does not violate any due process concerns.  See Pittman, 756 F. Supp. at 845 (""[E]ven where . . . a  prior decision meets a state's requirements for claim  preclusion, the prior decision will not be given preclusive  effect if due process was not provided by the state  forum in which the claim was previously litigated."");  Kremer v. Chem. Constr. Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 482, 102  S. Ct. 1883, 72 L. Ed. 2d 262 (1982) (finding that the  state must satisfy applicable requirements of the Due  Process Clause, and that ""other state and federal courts  are not required to accord full faith and credit"" if the  state judgment is ""constitutionally infirm""). Based on the  record, the Court cannot find any due process violations  or concerns arising out of the state action. (See  generally Oct. 27, 2022 N.J. Super. Ct. Consent Order;        Dec. 12, 2022 N.J. Super. Ct. Order.) Moreover, Plaintiff  has not alleged that she did not have a full and fair  opportunity to litigate in state court. See Peduto v. City  of N. Wildwood, 878 F.2d 725, 726 (3d Cir. 1989)  (finding that appellants were not denied due process of  law in state court because they were afforded ""a full and  fair  opportunity""  and  appellants  never  alleged  otherwise). Nor did Plaintiff object to the state court  dismissing all claims against Genesis with prejudice—in  fact, she consented to that dismissal. (Oct. 27, [*14]   2022 N.J. Super. Ct. Consent Order 2.) See Nanavati v.  Burdette Tomlin Mem? Hosp., 857 F.2d 96, 111 (3d Cir.  1988) (finding no due process violation where plaintiff  did not object to dismissal of complaint, file an appeal,  or move to reconsider). The Court therefore dismisses Plaintiff's Complaint with  prejudice in its entirety as to Genesis under the claim  preclusion doctrine. ii. Claims Against Galaxy Claim preclusion does not bar Plaintiffs claims against  Galaxy because the state court dismissed Plaintiffs  claims against Galaxy without prejudice. (Dec. 12, 2022  N.J. Super. Ct. Order.) Dismissal without prejudice ""is  neither final nor appealable because the deficiency may  be corrected by the plaintiff without affecting the cause  of action."" Borelli v. Reading, 532 F.2d 950, 951 (3d Cir.  1976). The Court, accordingly, addresses each Count  remaining against Galaxy. B. CEPA Claim Against Galaxy Plaintiff asserts that she was wrongfully terminated by  Defendants for engaging in a protected activity. (Compl.                Page 6 of 11 ¶¶ 55-64.) Plaintiff alleges Defendants' retaliation and  adverse treatment of Plaintiff are in violation of CEPA.  (See id.) Defendants counter that Plaintiff's CEPA claim  is barred by the statute of limitations. (Defs.' Moving Br.,  14-18, ECF No. 5-1; Defs.' Reply Br. 1-13, ECF No. 9.) i. Statute of Limitations [*15]  Although a motion to dismiss is generally not the proper  vehicle for asserting a time bar, the Third Circuit permits  a defendant to assert a statute of limitations defense via  a motion to dismiss if ""the time alleged in the statement  of a claim shows that the cause of action has not been  brought within the statute of limitations."" Viney v.  Jenkintown Sch. Dist., 51 F. Supp. 3d 553, 555 (E.D.  Pa. 2014) (quoting Robinson v. Johnson, 313 F.3d 128,  135 (3d Cir. 2002)); Oshiver v. Levin, Fishbein, Sedran  & Berman, 38 F.3d 1380, 1384 n.1 (3d Cir. 1994)  (finding that an exception exists ""where the complaint  facially shows noncompliance with the limitations period  and the affirmative defense clearly appears on the face  of the pleading.""). Defendants assert that that is the  case here, and Plaintiff does not allege that the dates  set out in the Complaint are insufficient to examine the  timeliness of her claims; instead, Plaintiff relies upon the  equitable tolling doctrine to assert that her CEPA claim  should not be dismissed. (Defs.' Moving Br. 17-18; Pl.'s  Opp'n Br. 16, ECF No. 8-1.) Plaintiff alleges in her Complaint that Defendants  discharged her on June 30, 2021. (Compl. ¶ 42.) The  parties do not dispute that the statute of limitations for a  CEPA claim is one year. N.J.S.A. 34:19-5. (See Pl.'s  Opp'n Br. 13-16; Defs.' Moving Br. 17-18.) When an  employer wrongfully terminates an employee, the  statute of limitations [*16]  begins to run on the date of  actual discharge. See Farneski v. County of Hunterdon,  916 F. Supp. 2d 573, 588 (D.N.J. 2013) (citing Alderiso  v. Med. Ctr. of Ocean Cnty., Inc., 167 N.J. 191, 770  A.2d 275 (N.J. 2001)); Jones v. Jersey City Med Ctr., 20  F. Supp. 2d 770, 773 (D.N.J. 1998) (dismissing a CEPA  claim brought two years after discharge). The one-year  statute of limitations for Plaintiffs CEPA claim is thus  June 30, 2022. See N.J.S.A. 34:19-5. Plaintiff timely  filed a CEPA claim in New Jersey Superior Court on  June 24, 2022, which the court dismissed without  prejudice against Galaxy on December 12, 2022. (See  N.J. Super. Ct. Compl.; Dec. 12, 2022 N.J. Super. Ct.  Order.) On April 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed her Complaint in  this Court, well after CEPA's one year statute of  limitations expired. (See Compl.) The Court, therefore,  can conclusively determine that the applicable one-year  statute of limitations bars Plaintiffs claim and finds  Defendants' statute of limitations defense at the motion  to dismiss stage to be proper. Plaintiffs CEPA claim is  thus barred unless the equitable tolling doctrine applies. ii. Equitable Tolling Equitable tolling allows a plaintiff to bring suit ""after the  statutory time period for filing a complaint has expired if  [the plaintiff has] been prevented from filing in a timely  manner due to sufficiently inequitable circumstances.""  Seitzinger v. Reading Hosp. & Med. Ctr., 165 F.3d 236,  240 (3d Cir. 1999) (emphasis added). These inequitable  circumstances are ""narrowly [*17]  defined."" Fahey v.  Hollywood Bicycle Ctr., Inc., No. 08-3573, 2009 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 22179, 2009 WL 749856, at *4 (D.N.J. Mar.  18, 2009) (quoting R.A.C. v. P.J.S., Jr., 192 N.J. 81, 927  A.2d 97, 107 (N.J. 2007)). Specifically, the Third Circuit  has held that ""equitable tolling may be appropriate[:] . . .  (1) [if] the defendant has actively misled the plaintiff[;]  (2) if the plaintiff has 'in some extraordinary way' been  prevented from asserting [her] rights[;] or (3) if the  plaintiff has timely asserted [her] rights mistakenly in the  wrong forum."" United States v. Midgley, 142 F.3d 174,  179 (3d Cir. 1998) (quoting Kocian v. Getty Refin. &  Mktg. Co., 707 F.2d 748, 753 (3d Cir. 1983)). Plaintiff invokes the doctrine of equitable tolling to  prevent her CEPA claim from being dismissed as time  barred. (Pl.'s Opp'n Br. 13-16.) Plaintiff states that her  claims  in  state  court  were  ""dismissed  on  procedural/pleading grounds,"" but were filed in this  Court with additional federal civil rights claims. (Pl.'s  Opp'n Br. 16.) Plaintiff does not assert that she was  actively misled by Defendants, was prevented from  asserting her rights in an extraordinary way, or timely  asserted her rights in the wrong forum. Instead, Plaintiff  argues equitable tolling should apply because she  timely filed her CEPA claim in state court without  ""sle[eping] on her rights."" (Id.) Plaintiff fails to allege a valid basis for equitable tolling  on her CEPA claim. As noted, Plaintiff has not alleged  any  inequitable  circumstances  or  improper [*18]   conduct by Defendants in the state action or the instant  case. See Midgley, 142 F.3d at 179 (""Absent a showing  of intentional inducement or trickery by the defendant, a  statute of limitations should be tolled only in the 'rare  situation where equitable tolling is demanded by sound  legal principles as well as the interests of justice.'""  (quoting Alvarez-Machain v. United States, 96 F.3d  1246, 1251 (9th Cir. 1996))). The state court dismissed  Page 7 of 11 Plaintiff's CEPA claim for failure to state a claim, not for  any technical errors involving jurisdiction or venue. See  Schmidt v. Celgene Corp., 425 N.J. Super. 600, 42 A.3d  892, 900 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2012) (finding that  ""the primary purpose of these equitable doctrines  avoiding a technical defeat of a meritorious claim on  which the doors of the courthouse have been shut—was  not implicated"" because plaintiff's initial CEPA claim was  dismissed on the merits rather than on jurisdictional  grounds); but see Galligan v. Westfield Ctr. Serv., Inc.,  82 N.J. 188, 412 A.2d 122 (N.J. 1980) (granting  equitable tolling to plaintiff's claim that was misfiled and  dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in  federal court). It was Plaintiff who chose to commence  litigation in state court only six days before CEPA's  statute of limitations ran. See Gonzalez v. Portfolio  Recovery Assocs., LLC, No. 13-1350, 2013 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 135909, 2013 WL 5334075, at *3 (D.N.J. Sept.  20, 2013) (declining to apply equitable tolling because  ""[plaintiff] chose to file his first complaint just two months  before the statute of limitations ran . . . . That [*19]  the  statute of limitations ran while the state-court motion to  dismiss was pending cannot be blamed on [d]efendant;  [d]efendant did nothing to mislead [p]laintiff or prevent  [p]laintiff from exercising his rights.""). Plaintiffs mere  assertion that Defendants received timely notice of the  potential claim is insufficient to overcome the hurdles for  equitable tolling to apply. See Midgley, 142 F.3d at 179  (""Federal courts invoke the doctrine of equitable tolling  'only  sparingly.'  (citations  omitted)).  The  Court,  accordingly, dismisses Plaintiffs CEPA claim against  Galaxy with prejudice. C. 42 U.S.C. § 1981 Claim Against Galaxy                   Count One of Plaintiffs Complaint asserts a retaliation  claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 based on her termination  after she raised complaints regarding ""unlawful human  resources practices and racial discrimination in the  workplace."" (Compl. ¶ 48.) Specifically, Plaintiff alleges  she engaged in protected conduct when she made  separate complaints to Defendants regarding their: (1)  engagement in disparate disciplinary treatment towards  women and minority employees; and (2) discriminatory  refusal to hire a Black job applicant. (See id. ¶¶ 47-54;  Pl.'s Opp'n Br. 9-10.) ""The Supreme Court has established that § 1981  protects [*20]  individuals against retaliation."" Curry v.  Devereux Found., 541 F. Supp. 3d 555, 559 (E.D. Pa.  2021) (citing CBOCS, 553 U.S. at 451). 42 U.S.C. §  1981 further prohibits retaliation against individuals who  help others ""suffering direct racial discrimination.""  CBOCS, 553 U.S. at 452. To maintain a prima facie § 1981 retaliation claim,  Plaintiff must adequately allege that: (1) she engaged in  a protected activity; (2) she suffered an adverse  employment action by Defendants, her employer; and  (3) a causal connection exists between the protected  activity and the adverse employment action. See Est. of  Oliva ex rel. McHugh v. New Jersey, 604 F.3d 788, 798  (3d Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). The Third Circuit then  utilizes a burden-shifting framework: if the plaintiff  succeeds in establishing a prima facie case, the burden  shifts to the defendant ""to articulate some legitimate,  nondiscriminatory [or nonretaliatory] reason for the  employee's rejection[;]"" if the defendant successfully  carries this burden, the plaintiff then must have an  opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the  evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the  defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext  for retaliation. See Jarmon v. Trader Joe 's Co., No. 21- 3889, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38448, 2023 WL 2402874,  at *3 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 8, 2023) (first alteration in original)  (quoting Shaner v.

Thurston, 469 U.S.  111, 121, 105 S. Ct. 613, 83 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1985)). Importantly, ""[t]he Supreme Court has held that in  employment discrimination cases, a plaintiff is not  required to establish a prima Ade case at the pleadings  stage."" Kelly v.

LEXIS  20501, 2012 WL 529548, at *4 (D.N.J. Feb.17, 2012)).  ""[S]tating . . a claim requires a complaint with enough  factual matter (taken as true) to suggest the required  element . . . The complaint must state enough facts to  raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal  evidence of the necessary element."" Id. (quoting  Wilkerson v. New Media Tech. Charter Sch. Inc., 522  F.3d 315, 321-22 (3d Cir. 2008) (emphasis in original)). ""In a retaliation case[,] a plaintiff must demonstrate that  there had been an underlying § 1981 violation.""  Castleberry v.

(quoting Daniels v. Sch. Dist. of Phila., 776  F.3d 181, 193 (3d Cir. 2015))). The Court, therefore,  first considers whether Plaintiff adequately alleges that  there is an underlying § 1981 violation. See id. For the  two events at issue, Plaintiff appears to allege that §  1981's guarantee that all persons are entitled to the  same ""full and equal benefit"" of the law was violated  because Galaxy, an employer, [*22]  discriminated and  disparately treated employees and a job applicant  differently based on race and/or sex. (See Compl. ¶ 21.)  See also 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a); Est. of Oliva, 604 F.3d at  798. i. Disparate Treatment         Plaintiff alleges that ""while reviewing Defendants'  Human  Resources  practices,  [she]  identified  inconsistencies  in  the  employee  discipline  and  performance processes; specifically, Plaintiff's review  identified that female employees and employees in  racially protected classes were severely disciplined for  infractions  or  performance  concerns  and  white  employees were not severely disciplined, if at all.""  (Compl. ¶ 20.) Plaintiff states that she ""reasonably  believed that Defendants' practices of disparate  treatment towards employees based [on] sex and/or  race were unlawful"" and reported them to Defendants'  Human Resources Department. (Id. ¶¶ 21, 22).  Defendants argue that Plaintiff ""fails to plead any facts  supporting the reasonableness of [the] allegation,  including who these employees were, what positions  they held, what they were disciplined for, and how  exactly they were treated disparately."" (Defs.' Moving  Br. 11-12; see also Defs.' Reply 1 3-14.) As previously set forth, ""a plaintiff establishes a [§ 1981]  retaliation claim if she [*23]  shows that she had a  reasonable belief that her employer was engaged in an  unlawful employment practice and that the employer  retaliated against her for protesting against that  practice."" Curry, 541 F. Supp. 3d at 560 (quoting  Drinkwater v. Union Carbide Corp., 904 F.2d 853, 865  (3d Cir. 1990)). Yet, a ""§ 1981 cause of action in the  employment  context  which  is  based  on  racial  discrimination must set forth facts to establish that the  allegedly disparate treatment was the result of  'intentional' or 'purposeful' discrimination."" Hicks v.  Arthur, 843 F. Supp. 949, 954 (E.D. Pa. 1994) (quoting  Weldon v. Kraft, 896 F.2d 793, 796 (3d Cir. 1990)); see  also Brown v. Joel Tanis & Sons, Inc., No. 13-02984,  2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95149, 2016 WL 3951378, at *4  (D.N.J. July 21, 2016). ""A § 1981 plaintiff cannot satisfy  the 'purposeful' criterion with 'vague and conclusory  allegations' in the complaint."" Id. (citing Armstrong v.  Sch. Dist. of Phila., 597 F. Supp. 1309, 1312 (E.D. Pa.  1984). With Plaintiff's allegations accepted as true, this Court  finds that Plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts to survive  the motion to dismiss. Plaintiff fails to provide any facts  from her review of Defendants' Human Resources  practices  that  suggest  intentional  or  purposeful  discrimination. For example, despite stating that she  ""identified"" such concerns through her review, Plaintiff  fails to list any inconsistencies in the employee  discipline and performance process, the number of  employees who were treated disparately, or what  infractions or performance concerns were addressed  Page 9 of 11 with the disparately treated employees. [*24]  See Lara,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 158267, 2020 WL 5211206, at *9  (denying a motion to dismiss in part because the plaintiff  cited specific interactions and comments made by  defendants, which suggested a plausible claim for  disparate treatment based on race-based discrimination  and retaliation); Warrick v. N.J. Off. of Att'y Gen., No.  20-14274, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96999, 2022 WL  1763855, at *5 (D.N.J. May 31, 2022) (finding that the  plaintiff pled sufficient facts for a disparate treatment  claim  because  the  amended  complaint  alleged  ""numerous examples of, for instance, [d]efendants  promoting white colleagues within four years and  promoting African American employees within twenty- one years""). Here, Plaintiff's pleadings amount only to  vague and conclusory allegations that fail to raise a  reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal  evidence of a necessary element. ii. The Executive's Conduct Plaintiff next alleges that the Executive's refusal to  interview  a  job  applicant  constitutes  illegal  discriminatory conduct because Plaintiff reasonably  believes the Executive based her decision on racial  discrimination. (Compl. ¶¶ 25-35.) Defendants again  state that Plaintiff ""fails to plead sufficient facts to  establish an underlying violation."" (Defs.' Moving Br. 13;  see also Defs.' Reply Br. 14.) To establish a discrimination claim under § 1981, ""a  plaintiff must show (1) [*25]  that he [or she] belongs to  a racial minority; (2) an intent to discriminate on the  basis of race by the defendant; and (3) discrimination  concerning one or more of the activities enumerated in §  1981."" Castleberry, 863 F.3d at 266 (citing Est. of Oliva,  604 F.3d at 797). The Court, accepting all reasonable inferences as true,  does not identify any factual support to suggest or  satisfy the second prong—that the Executive refused to  interview the job applicant because he was Black. (See  Compl. ¶¶ 25-34.) Plaintiff relies only upon her and the  job applicant's belief that the Executive declined to  interview the Black job applicant because of his race.  (Id. ¶ 28.) Without more factual detail, Plaintiff fails to  adequately allege an underlying § 1981 violation.      ""[S]uch allegations are conclusory since [Plaintiff] fails to  allege facts to show that [the Executive's] actions were  somehow connected to any protected category, let  alone [to the job applicant's] race."" Mudie v. Phila. Coll.  of Osteopathic Med., 577 F. Supp. 3d 375, 381 (E.D.  Pa. 2021) (finding that plaintiff's allegations that are  ""race-related are bald legal conclusions and lack factual  support"" because ""[plaintiff] fail[ed] to provide facts to  show that [d]efendants' actions were related to her race,  as opposed to some other reason or due to a  personality conflict); Curry, 541 F. Supp. 3d at 562  (finding [*26]  that an employee's direct comments such  as ""angry Black woman"" was enough to allow  discovery); Savage v. Temple Univ. - of Commonwealth  Sys. of Higher Educ., No. 19-6026, 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 111715, 2020 WL 3469039, at *6 (E.D. Pa. June  25, 2020) (finding that plaintiff made ""legal conclusions,  not factual allegations,"" which are not ""consider[ed] . . .  in deciding a motion to dismiss[,]"" because plaintiff ""pled  that he was terminated and discriminated against]  because of his race.""); Doe v. Triangle Doughnuts, LLC,  472 F. Supp. 3d 115, 137 (E.D. Pa. 2020) (finding that  plaintiff's allegations failed to state enough facts to raise  a reasonable expectation that discovery would reveal  evidence of discriminatory intent, despite plaintiff's  allegation that a racial comment was made at her). The Court finds that Plaintiff fails to state a claim for  retaliation because she has not adequately alleged that  there was an underlying § 1981 violation of sex and/or  race discrimination, even under the more deferential  pleading standard applicable to discrimination claims.  See Castleberry, 863 F.3d at 267; Triangle Doughnuts,  472 F. Supp. 3d at 136. The Court, accordingly,  dismisses Plaintiffs § 1981 claim against Galaxy without  prejudice. D. NJLAD Claim Against Galaxy              Page 10 of 11 Under Count Four, Plaintiff asserts that ""Defendants'  decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment is a  retaliatory action and constitutes a violation of the  [NJLAD]."" (Compl. ¶ 76.) In short, Plaintiff alleges a  claim [*27]  of retaliation under the NJLAD against  Galaxy. The NJLAD makes it illegal for an employer to terminate  an employee on the basis of race, national origin, sex  and other protected characteristics. Victoria v. Fluor  Enters. Inc., No. 13-7587, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  134574, 2015 WL 5822056, at *6 (D.N.J. Oct. 2, 2015)  (citing N.J.S.A. 10:5-12). The factors to establish a  prima facie case of retaliation under the NJLAD are the  same as those required under § 1981. Mann v. Prince  Telecom, LLC, No. 12-6263, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  104699, 2013 WL 3884189, at *5 (D.N.J. July 26, 2013).  The analysis for Plaintiffs NJLAD claim against Galaxy  is, thus, also the same. See Venson v. Pro Custom  Solar, LLC, No. 19-19227, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  205438, 2021 WL 4963294, at *3 (D.N.J. Oct. 25, 2021)  (finding plaintiff's failed to articulate a claim of retaliation  under § 1981, and thus ""their claims of retaliation under  the NJLAD are also futile."") This Court, accordingly,  adopts the analysis previously provided for Plaintiffs §  1981 claim and dismisses Plaintiffs NJLAD claim  without prejudice. E. Pierce Claim Against Galaxy Plaintiffs Complaint asserts a Pierce claim for common  law wrongful termination under Pierce v. Ortho  Pharmaceutical Corp., 84 N.J. 58, 417 A.2d 505, 512  (1980). (Compl. ¶¶ 65-70.) Plaintiff alleges that she was  discharged in retaliation for making complaints about  alleged unlawful racial discrimination and Human  Resources procedures. (Id. at 68.) Defendants move to  dismiss Plaintiffs Pierce claim for failure to identify any  clear mandate of public policy. (Defs.' Moving Br. 22.)  Defendants assert that even if such a mandate is  identified, Plaintiff [*28]  cannot support that such a  policy was violated or that she sufficiently expressed  more than just her ""vague concerns."" (Id.) Where a plaintiff bases her common law Pierce claim on  the public policy of the NJLAD and asserts a claim  under both, the former claim is subsumed by the latter.  See, e.g., Campbell v. Sedgwick Detert, Moran &  Arnold, No. 11-642, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126480,  2011 WL 5248150, at *3 (D.N.J. Nov. 2, 2011) (citation  omitted); Rodriguez v. Springhill Suites by Marriott, No.  13-6841, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16605, 2014 WL  575529, at *2 (D.N.J. Feb. 10, 2014) (""New Jersey  courts and courts interpreting New Jersey law have held  that common law claims for wrongful discharge in  violation of public policy are preempted when a statutory  remedy under the NJLAD exists."" (quoting Santiago v.  City of Vineland, 107 F. Supp. 2d 512, 567 (D.N.J.  2000))); N.J.S.A. § 10:5-13(b) (""All remedies available in  common law tort actions shall be available to prevailing  plaintiff's [under the NJLAD].""). The only exception to  when a Pierce claim is not preempted as coterminous  with the NJLAD is if the cause of action finds its basis in  the New Jersey State Constitution. Campbell, 2011 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 126480, 2011 WL 5248150, at *3. Here,  Plaintiff does not cite or refer to the New Jersey State  Constitution; thus Plaintiffs Pierce claim is coterminous  with her NJLAD claim and must be dismissed. See  Schanzer v. Rutgers Univ., 934 F. Supp. 669, 679  (D.N.J. 1996) (dismissing plaintiff's Pierce claim  because the ""NJLAD provides the full panoply of rights  and remedies that are available under the common  law.""); Santiago, 107 F. Supp. 2d at 568 (dismissing  plaintiff's common law Pierce claims [*29]  because they  ""are duplicative of the cause of action under the NJLAD  and therefore are preempted by the statute.""); see also  Rodriguez, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16605, 2014 WL  575529, at *2 (""To the extent [p]laintiff may allege that  the NJLAD supplies the clear mandate of public policy,  a common law claim for wrongful discharge cannot be  predicated on the policy expressed through the NJLAD  in light of the statutory remedy available.""). For the reasons stated above, Plaintiff's Pierce claim  against Galaxy is dismissed without prejudice.",0
"United States v. Raniere, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 262782","MEMORANDUM & ORDER NICHOLAS G. GARAUFIS, United States District Judge. On June 19, 2019, following a six-week trial, a jury convicted Defendant Keith Raniere of racketeering, racketeering  conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, forced labor conspiracy, sex trafficking conspiracy, and two counts of sex  trafficking. (Jury Verdict (Dkt. 735).) On October 27, 2020, this court sentenced Raniere principally to a 120-year  term of imprisonment. (Stc'g Mem. (Dkt. 966) at 18-19.) At that time, the court directed the Government to submit  any claims of restitution within 90 days. (Id. at 20; Tr. of Oct. 27, 2020 Stc'g of Keith Raniere [*2]  (""Stc'g Tr."") (Dkt.  1002) at 154.) On January 27, 2021, the Government provided the court with copies of the restitution requests it had received from  putative victims, a letter setting forth its proposed methodology for evaluating those requests, and its  recommendations regarding restitution. (See Jan. 27, 2021 Letter re Restitution (""Gov't Restitution Ltr."") (Dkt. 997);  Page 2 of 15   Ex. A. to Restitution Ltr. (""Gov't Recommendations"").) In an order dated January 27, 2021, the court acknowledged  receipt of the Government's submission and indicated that it would award restitution after the Defendant had an  opportunity to respond. (See Jan. 27, 2021 ECF Order.) Raniere filed a response on March 23, 2021. (See Raniere  Letter in Reply to Gov't's Request for Restitution (""Raniere Restitution Ltr."") (Dkt. 1018).) The court has reviewed the parties' submissions and has made certain factual and legal determinations, as set forth  below, that will guide the terms of its forthcoming restitution order. The court has also identified certain issues that  warrant further briefing and, where available, supplemental evidence. Accordingly, the court DIRECTS the parties to  submit supplemental letter briefs, along with [*3]  any necessary exhibits and affidavits, and for the Government to  submit a revised set of restitution recommendations that are consistent with the findings of fact and legal  conclusions set forth below. BACKGROUND Raniere was convicted of seven counts of conviction, as follows: • Count One: Racketeering Conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(d) and 1963(a). (Presentence  Investigation Report (""PSR"") ¶ 2.) • Count Two: Racketeering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c) and 1963(a). (PSR ¶ 3.) • Count Six: Conspiracy to provide and obtain forced labor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1594(b). (PSR ¶ 20.) • Count Seven: Wire Fraud Conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1349 and 1343. (PSR ¶ 21.) • Count Eight: Sex Trafficking Conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1594(c) and 1591(b)(1). (PSR ¶ 22.) • Count Nine: Sex Trafficking of Jane Doe 5, in violation of trafficking of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a)(1), (a)(2), and  (b)(1). (PSR ¶ 23.) • Count Ten: Sex Trafficking of Jane Doe 8, in violation of trafficking of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a) and (b)(1). (PSR ¶  24.) The two racketeering counts of conviction are predicated on numerous indictable acts including, inter alia, sexual  exploitation of a minor, Jane Doe 2; identity theft and conspiracy to commit identify theft of multiple individuals  (Jane Doe 1, James Loperfido, Edgar Bronfman, Sr., Jane Doe 3, and Jane Doe 7); trafficking and document [*4]   servitude of Jane Doe 4; and sex trafficking and forced labor of Jane Doe 5. (PSR ¶¶ 4, 6-7, 9-11,13-15, 17-27.)  Counts Six, Seven, and Eight concern conspiracies by Raniere and his co-defendants to obtain labor, assets, and  the performance of sexual acts from lower-ranking members of a secret organization known as ""DOS."" (PSR ¶¶ 20- 22.) Counts Nine and Ten concern the sex trafficking of two individual lower-ranking DOS members. (PSR ¶¶ 23- 24.) To date, 100 putative victims have submitted requests for restitution, including Jane Doe 2, Jane Doe 4, Jane Doe  5, Jane Doe 8, and James Loperfido, as well as several additional lower-ranking members of DOS, and many  individuals who were not affiliated with DOS but who nonetheless claim that they were harmed by Raniere and his  co-defendants' criminal conduct. (See Gov't Restitution Ltr.)     Page 3 of 15   LEGAL STANDARD In evaluating restitution claims, the court recognizes that ""the Government bears the burden of proving a victim's  actual loss by a preponderance of the evidence."" United States v. Finazzo, 850 F.3d 94, 117 (2d Cir. 2017). The  Second Circuit has ""never used the term 'actual' in this context to mean 'mathematically precise'"" or ""adopted a  one-size-fits-all standard of precision for application in restitution [*5]  cases."" United States v. Gushlak, 728 F.3d  184, 195 (2d Cir. 2013). Rather, what is required is ""only a reasonable approximation of losses supported by a  sound methodology."" Id. at 196. Two statutes relevant to this case provide for mandatory restitution for victims of certain crimes. First, the  Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (""TVPA"") provides for mandatory restitution for ""the full amount of the  victim's losses"" for crimes including forced labor, sex trafficking, and document servitude. 18 U.S.C. § 1593(b)(1).  In Raniere's case, counts Six (forced labor conspiracy), Eight (sex trafficking conspiracy), Nine (sex trafficking of  Jane Doe 5), and Ten (sex trafficking of Jane Doe 8) are covered offenses that give rise to mandatory restitution  under the TVPA, as is Racketeering Act Nine (forced labor and document servitude of Jane Doe 4). The TVPA  defines ""victim"" as ""the individual harmed as a result of a crime under this chapter."" Id. § 1593(c). Under the TVPA, victims are entitled to full compensation for ""any costs incurred, or that are reasonably projected  to be incurred in the future, by the victim, as a proximate result of the offenses involving the victim,"" including, inter  alia, ""medical services relating to physical, psychiatric, or psychological care,"" ""lost income,"" [*6]  and ""reasonable  attorneys' fees."" Id. §§ 1593(b)(3), 2259(c)(2). A victim's compensable losses under the TVPA also include ""the  greater of the gross income or value to the defendant of the victim's services or labor or the value of the victim's  labor as guaranteed under the minimum wage and overtime guarantees of the Fair Labor Standards Act."" Id. §  1593(b)(3). Second, the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act of 1996 (""MVRA"") requires that defendants convicted of certain  crimes, including crimes of violence or offenses against property that cause a ""physical injury or pecuniary loss"" to  ""an identifiable victim,"" ""make restitution to the victim of the offense."" 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(a)(1), (c). The MVRA  applies to certain of Raniere's crimes of conviction, including racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, and wire fraud  conspiracy. (See PSR ¶ 166.) The MVRA defines ""victim"" as ""a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an  offense for which restitution may be ordered including, in the case of an offense that involves as an element a  scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity, any person directly harmed by the defendant's criminal conduct  in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern."" Id. § 3663A(a)(2). ""In restricting its definition of 'victim' [*7]  to  persons proximately harmed by the defendant's acts, the MVRA aims to limit restitution to those harms that have a  sufficiently close connection to the conduct at issue."" United States v. Thompson, 792 F.3d 273, 277 (2d Cir. 2015).  Thus, the MVRA's ""definition of 'victim' governs the calculation of the reimbursable loss itself."" Id. ""[C]ourts have uniformly read [the MVRA] to provide for restitution payable by all convicted co-conspirators in  respect of damage suffered by all victims of a conspiracy, regardless of the facts underlying counts of conviction in  individual prosecutions."" United States v. Boyd, 222 F.3d 47, 50 (2d Cir. 2000). However, the MVRA ""does not  authorize the court to order a defendant to pay restitution to any person who was not a victim"" of an offense of  conviction. United States v. Reifler, 446 F.3d 65, 121 (2d Cir. 2006). ""While the language [in the MVRA's definition  of 'victim'] expands what it is that will give rise to compensable loss when a scheme, conspiracy or pattern is  involved, the reference point to which such conspiracy is tied remains the 'offense' of which the defendant has been      Page 4 of 15   convicted."" In re Local #46 Metallic Lathers Union & Reinforcing Iron Workers & Its Associated Benefit & Other  Funds, 568 F.3d 81, 87 (2d Cir. 2009). In other words, conduct committed ""in the course of the scheme or  conspiracy [may] be considered as a basis for determining compensable harm"" only if the ""scheme, conspiracy, or  pattern of criminal activity"" that encompasses [*8]  that conduct is an element of the offense of conviction. Id. Where more than one defendant has contributed to a victim's loss, ""the court may make each defendant liable for  payment of the full amount of restitution or may apportion liability among the defendants to reflect the level of  contribution to the victim's loss and the economic circumstances of each defendant."" 18 U.S.C. § 3664(h). If a  defendant owes restitution to multiple victims, ""the court may provide for a different payment schedule for each  victim"" based on the victims' economic circumstances and the nature and extent of their losses. Id. § 3664(i). DISCUSSION The Government recommends that the court award restitution to 25 of the 100 putative victims who submitted  claims in connection with this case. (See Gov't Recommendations.) The Government identifies 18 of those 25  claimants as victims under § 1593 of the TVPA. The other claimants, including the seven to whom the Government  recommends that restitution be awarded and 75 more to whom the Government recommends that no award be  made, are not identified as victims under the TVPA. (Id.) The court considers first which of the claimants are entitled  to restitution under the TVPA and, for those who are eligible victims, [*9]  which of their losses are recoverable. It  then conducts a similar analysis with respect to the MVRA. A. Restitution Pursuant to Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 1. Identification of Relevant Victims The TVPA defines ""victim"" as ""the individual harmed as a result of a crime under this chapter."" 18 U.S.C. § 1593(c).  The Government identifies 18 of the 100 individuals who have submitted requests for restitution as victims within  the meaning of Section 1593 of the TVPA. Raniere was convicted of two separate counts of sex trafficking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591, pertaining to  victims Jane Doe 5 (""Nicole"") and Jane Doe 8 (""Jay""). Because sex trafficking in violation of § 1591 is a covered  crime under the TVPA, Jane Doe 5 and Jane Doe 8 are plainly entitled to restitution under § 1593. Additionally,  Raniere's conviction for racketeering was predicated, in part, on the trafficking for labor and services and  document servitude of Jane Doe 4 (""Daniela"") - conduct that is criminal under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1590 and 1592. The  court requests that the parties' supplemental letter briefs address the question of whether a victim of a predicate  racketeering act that is a covered offense under § 1593 is a victim within the meaning of the TVPA. Assuming, for  now, that victims of covered offenses are entitled to restitution under [*10]  § 1593 even if such offenses were not  crimes of conviction themselves, but rather were committed in furtherance of a racketeering enterprise, the court  finds that Jane Doe 4 is entitled to restitution under § 1593. Raniere was also convicted of sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy, in connection with his role  in a scheme that used coercive and illegal means to compel lower-ranking DOS members to engage in  uncompensated labor and sexual activity. Those conspiracy crimes are covered offenses under the TVPA. The  testimony at Raniere's trial made clear that lower-ranking DOS members (referred to as ""slaves"") performed unpaid  labor and, in some cases, engaged in sexual activity, and that they did so at the direction of higher-ranking DOS  members (""masters""), in response to acute social, financial, and emotional pressures designed and imposed by  Raniere and his co-conspirators. In convicting Raniere of these crimes, the jury determined that the defendants'     Page 5 of 15   conduct met the elements of federal forced labor and sex trafficking offenses. Accordingly, the court finds that all  lower-ranking DOS members who performed uncompensated labor and services or who engaged in sexual activity,  in connection [*11]  with their membership in DOS and at the direction of higher-ranking DOS members, are victims  of a covered offense under the TVPA and are entitled to restitution under § 1593. Thus, in the court's view, a putative victim is entitled to recover under § 1593 if the court finds by a preponderance  of the evidence that: (1) she was a lower-ranking ""slave"" member of DOS between February 2016 and June 2017;  and (2) in connection with her membership in DOS and at the behest of a higher-ranking DOS ""master,"" she either  performed unpaid labor or services, engaged in sexual activity, or both. All restitution claimants who meet these  criteria are statutorily entitled to recover the full amount of their losses under the TVPA. a. Victims Entitled to Restitution Under TVPA The court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the following individuals are victims of sex trafficking  offenses, forced labor offenses, or both, and that they are therefore entitled to restitution under the TVPA. Daniela [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] (""Jane Doe 4,"" ""Daniela""): As stated above, Racketeering Act  Nine, which the jury found the Government had proved in support of Count Two, for racketeering, charged Raniere  with the document [*12]  servitude and trafficking for labor and services of Jane Doe 4. Assuming that victims of  predicate racketeering acts that are covered offenses under § 1593 may receive restitution under the TVPA, the  court finds that Jane Doe 4 is a victim within the meaning of that statute. Nicole [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] (""Jane Doe 5,"" ""Nicole""): As stated above, Raniere's conviction on  Count Nine concerned his sex trafficking of Jane Doe 5. The court therefore finds that she is a victim of a  qualifying offense under the TVPA. [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] (""Jane Doe 8,"" ""Jay""): As stated above, Raniere's conviction on Count Ten  concerned his sex trafficking of Jane Doe 8. The court therefore finds that she is a victim of a qualifying offense  under the TVPA. [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] (""Jane Doe 6,"" ""[TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]""): According to  testimony at trial, Jane Doe 6 was recruited into DOS by Lauren Salzman and served as Salzman's slave. (Tr. of  Keith Raniere Trial (""Trial Tr."") at 1601:19-25, 1722:25-1723:10, 1770:21-1771:2.) She submitted ""collateral"" in  connection with her membership in DOS, including financial assets and naked photographs. (Id. at 1723:21- 1724:21.) She was branded on her [*13]  pelvic area with the DOS brand. (Id. at 1753:23-1754:19.) The court  therefore finds by a preponderance of the evidence that Jane Doe 6 was a lower-ranking member of DOS during  the relevant period. Salzman also testified that, in connection with her membership in DOS, that Jane Doe 6 sometimes functioned as a  ""personal assistant"" for her, but that she preferred for Jane Doe 6 to perform ""executive level administrative type  work for DOS,"" such as conducting legal research and reviewing legal contracts. (Id. at 1673:6-1674:20.)  Accordingly, the court also finds by a preponderance of the evidence that Jane Doe 6 performed uncompensated  labor and services in connection with her participation in DOS. The court determines that Jane Doe 6 is a victim of  a qualifying offense under the TVPA. Sylvie [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] (""Sylvie""): Sylvie testified at trial regarding her recruitment into DOS  and her submission of collateral, including naked photographs and a letter with the potential to disrupt close family  relationships, in connection with her membership. (Id. at 211:4-20, 213:3-214:15, 215:21-24.) The court finds by a  preponderance of the evidence that she was a lower-ranking DOS member [*14]  during the relevant period. Sylvie  also testified that she was assigned by her DOS master to seduce Raniere, and that she had sexual contact with    Page 6 of 15   Raniere pursuant to that assignment. (Id. at 219:13-220:6, 252:6-254:15.) The court therefore finds by a  preponderance of the evidence that Sylvie engaged in sexual activity in connection with her role in DOS. The court  determines that Sylvie is a victim of a qualifying offense under the TVPA. India [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] (""Additional Jane Doe 7,"" ""India,"" ""Additional DOS Victim 1""):  Multiple trial witnesses identified Additional Jane Doe 7 as a member of DOS: a slave who reported to Allison Mack  and who recruited Jane Doe 8 and served as her master. (See id. at 4197:6-10, 4197:16-18, 4267:23-25, 4325:3- 4328:3, 4333:20-4334:4, 5097:20-21.) The court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that Additional Jane Doe  7 was a lower-ranking member of DOS during the relevant period. Lauren Salzman testified that Allison Mack informed her that she expected Additional Jane Doe 7 to begin having  sexual contact with Raniere in her capacity as Mack's slave. (Id. at 1794:1-8.) In a March 3, 2016 email exhange,  Raniere wrote to Mack to confirm that [*15]  ""[Additional Jane 7] know[s] [that] to complete her [sic], she needs to  take all of her clothes off while I am clothed, pose in the most revealing way, and have me take a picture of her with  her phone to be immediately sent to you as proof."" (Id. at 5099:7-17.) The following day, Raniere wrote to Mack,  ""Any news on [Additional Jane Doe 7]?"" and Mack responded that Additional Jane Doe 7 had ""changed her flight""  would ""reach out"" to Raniere regarding ""meeting again to complete the assignment."" (Id. at 5097:23-5098:13.)  According to the PSR, ""Mack was notified by Raniere that [Additional Jane Doe 7] completed the assignment. At a  later point, [Additional Jane Doe 7] had sexual contact with Raniere. She told Mack that Raniere performed oral sex  on her."" (PSR ¶ 119.) Additional Jane Doe 7 gave a victim impact statement at Raniere's sentencing in which she described her  participation in DOS, including being branded, and stated that she was ""instructed to seduce Keith as a test of [her]  loyalty"" and engaged in ""dozens of sexual encounters"" with him that she ""would never have consented to"" if not for  the fear of her DOS collateral being released. (Stc'g Tr. at 81:16-22, 82:2-10.) In light of [*16]  testimonial and documentary trial evidence suggesting that Raniere and Mack planned to assign  Additional Jane Doe 7 to have sexual interactions with Raniere, the Probation Department's finding that Additional  Jane Doe 7 had sexual contact with Raniere, and Additional Jane Doe 7's own description of ""dozens"" of sexual  encounters that would not have occurred absent to her participation in DOS, the court finds by a preponderance of  the evidence that Additional Jane Doe 7 engaged in sexual activity at the instruction of her DOS master and in  connection with her role in DOS. Accordingly, the court determines that Additional Jane Doe 7 is a victim of a  qualifying offense under the TVPA. Sarah Edmondson (""Additional Jane Doe 13,"" ""Sarah,"" ""Jane Doe 11""): At trial, Lauren Salzman testified that  she recruited Additional Jane Doe 13 into DOS to serve as her slave, and that Additional Jane Doe 13 submitted  collateral in connection with her DOS membership. (Trial Tr. at 1717:24-1721:22.) Additional Jane Doe 13 was  branded on her pelvic area in connection with her membership in DOS. (Id. at 1748:22-1749:17.) The court  therefore finds by a preponderance of the evidence that Additional Jane Doe 13 [*17]  was a lower-ranking member  of DOS during the relevant period. At trial, Salzman testified that the concepts of ""time and labor"" were central to DOS in that slaves were expected to  make a ""full-time commitment to be always making [their] master more potent."" (Id. at 1671:10-23.) She explained  that she conveyed to her slaves that they ""should be seeking to provide the most value in the time and labor they're  providing,"" and that ""labor dedicated to furthering the master"" was a core component of their involvement in DOS.  (Id. at 1673:1-1674:13, 1671:22-23.) The court therefore finds by a preponderance of the evidence, on the basis of  Salzman's testimony, that DOS slaves who reported directly to Salzman were required to engage in  uncompensated labor. Thus, even though Salzman did not describe specific assignments that she gave to  Additional Jane Doe 13, the court finds that Additional Jane Doe 13 is a victim of a qualifying offense under the  TVPA. [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] (""Amanda""): Lauren Salzman testified at trial that she recruited Amanda into  DOS. (Id. at 1732:8-9.) She testified that Amanda submitted collateral including sexually explicit photographs and  material that, if released, [*18]  could have negatively affected her own professional status and her romantic  Page 7 of 15   partner's employment. (Id. at 1732:13-22.) She was branded on her pelvic area, on the same day as Lauren  Salzman's other DOS slaves. (Id. at 2197:8-15.) The court therefore finds by a preponderance of the evidence that  Amanda was a lower-ranking member of DOS during the relevant period. In addition to Salzman's testimony about the centrality of labor and a ""full-time commitment"" to her slaves'  involvement in DOS, she specifically testified that she directed her slaves to ""review[] legal contracts and d[o] legal  research."" (Id. at 1671:10-23, 1674:5-13.) Salzman also testified that Amanda was an attorney, and Amanda's  restitution claim lists ""[l]egal for Lauren"" as a DOS assignment to which she devoted 30 hours. (See id. at 1732:10- 12; [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] Restitution Worksheet.) The court therefore finds by a preponderance of  the evidence that Amanda engaged in uncompensated labor in connection with her role in DOS, and it determines  that she is a victim of a qualifying offense under the TVPA. b. Putative TVPA Victims Not Entitled to Restitution on the Basis of Existing Record At this time, the court cannot [*19]  find by a preponderance of the available record evidence that the following  individuals were victims of forced labor and/or sex trafficking offenses. The court will consider sworn testimony  submitted by the parties in connection with their subsequent letter briefs that relates to these individuals' eligibility  for restitution under the TVPA, including testimony that corroborates or disputes facts set forth in the PSR or Victim  Impact Statements. Camila [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] (""Jane Doe 2,"" ""Camila""): Trial testimony established that Jane  Doe 2 was a member of DOS, but as a ""firstline master"" rather than a lower-ranking slave. (Id. at 1509:15-23,  1738:3-1739:7.) While she participated in at least one DOSrelated sexual encounter with Raniere and Jane Doe 5,  the testimony at trial did not establish whether her participation in that encounter was specifically compelled by her  involvement with DOS. (See PSR ¶ 107.) Nor does the trial testimony establish by a preponderance of the evidence  that she engaged in uncompensated labor compelled by her membership in DOS. Accordingly, the court lacks  sufficient evidence to conclude, at this time, that Jane Doe 2 is a statutory victim of Raniere's [*20]  forced labor or  sex trafficking offenses under the TVPA. If presented with unrebutted sworn testimony describing Jane Doe 2's  performance of uncompensated work or participation in a sexual act in connection with her role in DOS and at the  direction of a higher-ranking DOS member to whom she owed obedience, the court would be better positioned to  determine that Jane Doe 2 is a qualifying victim under the TVPA. The court also notes that Jane Doe 2 may be entitled to mandatory restitution under 18 U.S.C. § 2259, which  provides for full restitution for victims of child pornography offenses. Covered offenses under that statute include 18  U.S.C. § 2252, which the jury found that Raniere had violated as a predicate act for his racketeering conviction.  (See PSR ¶¶ 2, 8.) The court encourages the parties to address the question of Jane Doe 2's eligibility for  restitution under § 2259 in their supplemental letter briefs. [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] (""Additional Jane Doe 34,"" ""[TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT],""  ""Additional DOS Victim 3""): Multiple trial witnesses referred in their testimony to Additional Jane Doe 34 as a  DOS slave who reported to Additional DOS Victim 2, a DOS slave who served under Mack. (See id. at 1865:15-25,  4408:19-4409:7, [*21]  5104:11-13.) The Government introduced into evidence at trial an email from Additional  DOS Victim 2 to Mack describing collateral that Additional Jane Doe 34 had submitted and the expectation of  additional forthcoming collateral. (Id. at 5103:18-5104:24.) The court therefore finds by a preponderance of the  evidence that Additional Jane Doe 34 was a lower-ranking member of DOS during the relevant period. The PSR states that Mack and Additional DOS Victim 2 directed Additional Jane Doe 34 ""to read and edit 100  articles for Raniere during a one-month period"" and ""encouraged [her] to have a sexual relationship with Raniere.""  (PSR ¶ 121.) Raniere objected to this portion of the PSR on the grounds that it was based on the accounts of  putative victims who had not testified. (Raniere Obj. to PSR at 22.) Additional Jane Doe 34 submitted a Victim  Impact Statement that describes ""being groomed to be a sexual partner for [Raniere]"" and engaging in repeated  sexual activity with him. ([TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] Victim Impact Stmt. at 6-7.) However, because the  only accounts of Additional Jane Doe 34 engaging in uncompensated labor or sexual activity are from unsworn  Page 8 of 15   sources, the court cannot find [*22]  by a preponderance of the evidence at this time that Additional Jane Doe 34  was a victim of forced labor or sex trafficking in connection with her role in DOS. [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] (""Additional Jane Doe 36,"" ""[TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]""): Jane  Doe 8 testified that she recruited Additional Jane Doe 36 into DOS to be her slave, at Mack's urging and with  Mack's assistance, and that she collected collateral from Additional Jane Doe 36. (Id. at 4387:3-4388:19, 4390:9- 4391:6.) The court therefore finds by a preponderance of the evidence that she was a lower-ranking member of  DOS. At trial, the Government published into evidence an email exchange between Additional Jane Doe 36 and Raniere,  in which they made plans to meet outside at approximately 4:15 a.m. for a ""walk,"" after Raniere asked if she was  ""available at all hours of the night."" (Id. at 5107:9-5109:13.) In a Victim Impact Statement submitted to the court,  Additional Jane Doe 36 describes how Mack groomed her for a sexual relationship with Raniere but implies that no  such relationship was consummated. ([TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]  Victim Impact Stmt. at 1.) Additional Jane Doe 36 does describe, [*23]  in her statement, performing  uncompensated work including data entry as an aspect of her participation in DOS. (Id.) However, because the  court does not have sworn testimony regarding Additional Jane Doe 36's unpaid labor, it cannot at this time find by  a preponderance of the evidence that she performed such labor. Additional Putative Victims: The court also finds that it has insufficient record evidence, apart from unsworn  Victim Impact Statements, to corroborate eight additional putative TVPA victims' involvement in DOS or  performance of unpaid labor and/or sexual acts pursuant to such involvement. Some of these individuals were not  discussed in the trial testimony at all; others were mentioned briefly, but the testimony did not establish any details  of their recruitment into DOS, position in DOS, participation in obligatory DOS rituals, or performance of unpaid  labor or sexual acts in connection with their DOS membership. The individuals in question are: (1) [TEXT  REDACTED BY THE COURT] (""Additional Jane Doe 8""); (2) [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] (""Additional  Jane Doe 14""); (3) [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] (""Additional Jane  Doe 15""); (4) [TEXT REDACTED [*24]  BY THE COURT] (""Additional Jane Doe 25""); (5) [TEXT REDACTED BY  THE COURT] (""Additional Jane Doe 30""); (6) [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] (""Additional Jane Doe 35""); (7)  [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]; and (8) [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]. 2. Identification of Compensable Losses Eligible victims under the TVPA are entitled to mandatory restitution totaling the ""full amount of [their] losses,""  including ""any costs incurred, or that are reasonably projected to be incurred in the future, by the victim, as a  proximate result of the offenses involving the victim."" 18 U.S.C. §§ 1593(b)(3), 2259(c)(2). Recoverable losses  include ""medical services relating to physical, psychiatric, or psychological care;"" ""physical and occupational  therapy or rehabilitation;"" ""necessary transportation, temporary housing, and child care expenses;"" ""lost income;""  ""reasonable attorneys' fees, as well as other costs incurred;"" and ""any other relevant losses incurred by the victim.""  Id. § 2259(c)(2). Additionally, victims under the TVPA recover ""the greater of the gross income or value to the  defendant of the victim's services or labor or the value of the victim's labor as guaranteed under the minimum  wage and overtime guarantees of the Fair Labor Standards Act."" Id. § 1593(b)(3). a. Medical Services [*25]  With regards to medical care costs, the court agrees with the Government's recommendation that losses are  compensable only if supported by a letter from a licensed or credentialed medical provider, counselor, or social       Page 9 of 15   worker. (See Gov't Restitution Ltr. at 6.) As a general matter, the court finds that the defendants imposed on DOS  slaves numerous physical and psychological burdens in order to perpetuate sex trafficking and forced labor  offenses, including sleep deprivation, extreme food deprivation and compulsory weight loss, stress and  psychological abuse, branding, and unwelcome sexual activity. These burdens, which were integral to defendants'  commission of the relevant offenses, were the proximate cause of a wide range of medical care needs, including  but not limited to cosmetic surgery for brand removal and potentially extensive mental health care. With respect to mental health care, the court is prepared to find by a preponderance of the evidence that  Defendants' criminal conduct proximately caused the full extent of DOS victims' psychological and psychiatric care  needs, absent compelling evidence of a separate and unrelated mental health issue that was not exacerbated by  Defendants' [*26]  conduct. Defense counsel argues that the court should reduce restitution awards to account for  victims' psychological harms that predated their involvement with DOS and Raniere. (See Raniere Restitution Ltr. at  28.) In support, it cites to the Northern District of New York's decision in United States v. Pearson, in which the  court reduced victims' restitution awards ""because [they] presented with some mental health issues prior to [their]  involvement with Defendant, [and] the Court cannot conclude that the full extent of the mental health interventions  [they] now require[] are causally related to Defendant's crimes."" No. 04-cr-340 (TJM), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66044,  2009 WL 2383025, at *4-5 (N.D.N.Y. July 30, 2009). One of the cruelest aspects of Raniere and his co-defendants' conduct is the way that they preyed upon victims'  preexisting vulnerabilities and past traumas in order to debase and control them, often under the guise of healing or  self-improvement. In doing so, the defendants compounded and intensified victims' preexisting psychological  issues. Thus, even where a victim might have benefitted from mental health care absent her participation in DOS,  the extent and magnitude of her need for such care following her involvement with DOS may be the proximate  result of the defendants' [*27]  actions. The court is not well positioned to disentangle the psychological harms that  a victim may address through the receipt of mental health care, let alone to apportion the costs of such care among  underlying harms, and it will not do so absent clear evidence that the forced labor and/or sex trafficking of a  specific victim did not give rise to the full extent of her psychological care needs. The court adopts the Government's recommendation that, where a medical provider has given an estimated range  for a victim's future psychological or psychiatric care costs, the court should award restitution based on the midpoint  of that range. (See Gov't Restitution Ltr. at 6.) The court also adopts the Government's recommendation that the  cost of cosmetic surgery for brand removal be estimated as $2,500, based on the cost quoted to Jane Doe 6 by a  medical provider specializing in laser skin treatment. (See id.) Subject to these parameters, and to the other  parameters discussed above, the court finds that TVPA victims' relevant medical care costs, including mental health  care costs, are the proximate result of Defendants' commission of forced labor and sex trafficking offenses and  are therefore [*28]  fully compensable. b. Nxivm-Related Costs Several TVPA victims seek restitution for expenses incurred as a result of their participation in Nxivm and its  programming, including tuition for ESP seminars and other Nxivm courses, membership fees for Nxivm groups,  costs of ""EM"" sessions, and travel and housing costs incurred in order to attend Nxivm programming. As a general  matter, the court finds that the defendants' forced labor and sex trafficking offenses, which pertain specifically to  DOS, are not the proximate cause of DOS members' costs related to Nxivm programming. Many of the victims were  recruited into DOS after they had already become involved with Nxivm and its programming, and insofar as they  participated in Nxivm programming during the period in which they belonged to DOS, such participation can likely  be attributed to their involvement with the larger Nxivm community. At this time, the court is not aware of any evidence providing a direct causal link between the covered offenses and  Nxivm-related costs. Absent further evidence that the defendants caused specific victims to incur specific Nxivm  programming, housing, or travel costs in connection with the forced labor and/or [*29]  sex trafficking of those  victims, the court cannot direct the reimbursement of TVPA victims for these costs. Page 10 of 15   c. Uncompensated Work TVPA victims are entitled to recover the value of their unpaid labor and services, calculated as ""the greater of the  gross income or value to the defendant of the victim's services or labor or the value of the victim's labor as  guaranteed under the minimum wage and overtime guarantees of the Fair Labor Standards Act."" 18 U.S.C. §  1593(b)(3). The victims performed labor and services not for a single employer, but rather for the benefit of DOS  masters to whom they were indentured. Because the Fair Labor Standards Act (""FLSA"") applies only to employers  who earn at least $500,000 in annual revenue, see 29 U.S.C. § 203(s)(1)(A)(ii), DOS masters are not covered  employers and their slaves do not have the protection of minimum wage and overtime guarantees under the FLSA.  Accordingly, the value of the victims' labor must be calculated based on the ""gross income or value to the  defendant."" 18 U.S.C. § 1593(b)(3). The Government's proposed methodology for calculating the value of DOS victims' unpaid labor looks to the nature  of the work performed, identifies a relevant job classification used by New York State's Bureau of Labor Statistics,  and uses the mean hourly [*30]  wage for that job classification from the year in which the work was performed to  determine the value of the defendant's work on a per-hour basis. (See Gov't Restitution Ltr. at 8-9.) Thus, for  example, the Government uses the mean hourly wage for the job classification ""typist"" for a DOS victim who  transcribed recordings, and it uses the mean hourly wage for the job classification ""executive administrative  assistant"" for a DOS victim who performed administrative work. (See [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]  Restitution Worksheet; [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] Restitution Worksheet.) The Government uses the  mean hourly wage for the job classification ""personal care and service worker"" in order to calculate the value of  DOS victims' labor for the hours spent ""on call"" in order to satisfy DOS masters' expectation of slaves' 24-hour  ""readiness."" (See Gov't Restitution Ltr. at 8-9.) The court finds that this is a sound methodology for approximating the value of DOS victims' unpaid labor. The  nature of the victims' labor and services, and the circumstances under which they were obtained, are so unusual  that ascribing an appropriate job classification and hourly wage is a difficult task. The Government's [*31]   recommended method assumes that the victims, if fairly compensated, would have been paid the mean salary for  the recognized category of labor that most closely approximates the work they performed. The court agrees that  applying this assumption allows for a reasonable approximation of the value of the victims' labor. If the defense  believes that certain job classifications recommended by the Government overstate the value of the work performed  by victims, it may seek to persuade the court to use alternative job classifications in applying this methodology. Several TVPA victims seek restitution not only for the specific work assignments they performed at the behest of  their DOS masters, but also for their obligation to be ""on call"" for their DOS masters at every hour of the day and  night. In connection with that responsibility, they seek to recover the mean salary of a ""personal care and service  worker"" for every hour of their membership in DOS during which they were not performing other labor. (See, e.g.,  [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] Worksheet; [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] [TEXT REDACTED BY  THE COURT] Worksheet; [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] Worksheet.) DOS slaves were subjected to  ""readiness"" [*32]  drills that required them to respond to a master's message within sixty seconds, at any hour, or  be ""punished."" (Trial Tr. at 4378:25-4379:10.) The purpose of these drills, they were told, was to ensure that they  were ""constantly thinking about [their] commitment to [DOS]"" and that their masters ""knew where [they] were at all  times."" (Id. at 4173:17-21.) A slave's punishment for failing to meet a master's ""readiness"" demands included, in  some instances, being paddled with a leather strap on her bare bottom. (Id. at 1635:3-6, 1636:16-1637:1.) DOS  masters intended for their slaves to understand that their ""master was supposed to [be their] highest priority and  that [their] main job as a slave was to always be thinking about them . . . and that should be the highest priority  always above all other things."" (Id. at 1642:1-5.) Raniere questions the appropriateness of compensating victims for 24 hours of daily labor. (Raniere Restitution Ltr.  at 22.) The court recognizes the unusualness of this form of ""labor,"" which defies easy comparison to any kind of  work that exists in the regular economy. But the idiosyncratic nature of DOS slaves' ""readiness"" obligations does  not negate the fact that [*33]  they demanded lower-ranking DOS members be perpetually available, at the  Page 11 of 15   exclusion of other activities or opportunities to earn income. Trial testimony revealed at least one instance in which  a DOS slave was required to forgo a paid work opportunity because it conflicted with her commitment to DOS. (See  id. at 4391:12-4392:4.) The Second Circuit has recognized that a court may award restitution to victims of forced  labor on the basis of 24-hour workdays for which they worked in an ""on call"" capacity. See United States v.  Sabhnani, 599 F.3d 215, 255-57 (2d Cir. 2010). The court therefore agrees with the Government that DOS victims'  restitution awards must compensate them for the exclusive, around-the-clock nature of their commitment.  Moreover, because DOS slaves were required to respond to the whims of their masters (and, in some cases, to  those of Raniere) at any hour, without notice, the court finds that their on-call obligations were sufficiently analogous  to the work of a ""personal care and service worker"" to render that an appropriate job classification. d. Attorneys' Fees and Legal Costs Several TVPA victims have submitted claims for recovery of attorneys' fees incurred in connection with these  proceedings. Insofar as TVPA victims retained [*34]  legal counsel in connection with their involvement with the  Government's investigation, their trial testimony, their victim impact statements, their restitution claims, or any other  matters related to these criminal proceedings, such costs are fully compensable. Claims for attorneys' fees and  legal costs must be supported by statements from victims' counsel attesting to the work performed, and by  worksheets describing the work performed and the hours and rates billed. The court will not award restitution for  attorneys' fees and legal costs incurred in connection with any separate legal proceedings, including any civil  litigation. B. Restitution Pursuant to Mandatory Victim Restitution Act of 1996 1. Identification of Relevant Victims As noted above, the MVRA provides for mandatory restitution for persons who are ""directly and proximately harmed  as a result of the commission"" of a qualifying criminal offense, including persons harmed by criminal conduct  committed in the course of a scheme or conspiracy. 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(a)(2). Qualifying offenses include crimes of  violence and crimes against property, including those ""committed by fraud or deceit,"" insofar as they result in either  bodily injury or property loss or damage. Id. § 3663A(c)(1), (b). Identifying individuals [*35]  who meet the MVRA's  definition of ""victim"" therefore requires that the court examine the covered offenses and, where applicable, the  criminal conduct committed in the course of a criminal conspiracy or scheme to determine which putative victims  were directly and proximately harmed. DOS Members: Count Seven, which charged Raniere and certain co-defendants with wire fraud conspiracy, is  based on the defendants' scheme to obtain lower-ranking DOS members' money and property, including rights to  assets, credit card authorizations, and sexually explicit photographs and videos, as ""collateral"" for their involvement  in DOS. (PSR ¶ 21.) Where the Government establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that an individual was  a lower-ranking DOS member who provided money or property as ""collateral,"" that individual is a victim of this  offense - even if there is insufficient evidence to establish that she was also a victim of forced labor or sex  trafficking. The court finds that DOS slaves were victims of wire fraud conspiracy if they furnished collateral that included  monetary assets, rights or access to monetary assets, or sexually explicit photographs or videos of themselves.  However, the [*36]  court does not find by a preponderance of the evidence that every piece of collateral furnished  by a DOS slave was sufficient to render its provider a victim of wire fraud conspiracy. In particular, trial testimony  established that DOS members often recorded accusations, confessions, or secrets with the potential to harm or  embarrass their subjects (usually either the DOS member herself or a close family member) as collateral. The court  does not find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a DOS member was a victim of wire fraud conspiracy  where the only collateral she provided was a statement of this nature. Page 12 of 15   Based on these parameters, court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the following individuals are  victims of the defendants' wire fraud conspiracy, on the basis of trial testimony establishing that they secured their  membership in DOS by providing as ""collateral"" rights to assets, sexually explicit photographs or videos of  themselves, or other money or property: Jane Doe 5 (""Nicole"") (Trial Tr. at 3852:23-3853:4); Jane Doe 6 (""[TEXT  REDACTED BY THE COURT]"") (id. at 1723:21-24, 1724:19-21.); Jane Doe 8 (""Jay"") (id. at 4329:23-4330:4); Sylvie  (id. at 213:19-214:15.); [*37]  Additional Jane Doe 13 (""Sarah"") (id. at 1719:16-20); Additional Jane Doe 34 (""[TEXT  REDACTED BY THE COURT]"") (id. at 5104:11-17); and Amanda (id. at 1732:17-22). Notably, the Government has  not yet been able to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that one of these individuals - Additional Jane  Doe 34 - meets the definition of ""victim"" under the TVPA. Additional former members of DOS may be entitled to  restitution under the MVRA, if the Government provides additional evidence that establishes, by a preponderance,  that they furnished money or property as collateral. Non-DOS Victims Entitled to Restitution: In addition to crimes related to his leadership role in DOS, Raniere was  convicted of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy on the basis of numerous criminal predicate acts. To  determine the victims of Raniere's racketeering offenses, the court must look to the predicate racketeering acts  which the jury found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Raniere had committed. The jury found that Raniere had committed a number of identity theft offenses with specific victims: Jane Doe 1,  James Loperfido, Edgar Bronfman, Sr., Jane Doe 3, and Jane Doe 7. (See PSR ¶¶ 4-5, 10-11, 13, 19.) [*38]   Accordingly, all of these individuals are victims of crimes committed in furtherance of the racketeering scheme for  which Raniere was convicted. Of these victims, only James Loperfido has submitted a claim for restitution. Additionally, the jury found that Raniere and others had conspired to alter records for use in an official proceeding,  in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(k), by directing individuals in the Nxivm community to remove portions of  videotapes that were to be produced in discovery in a copyright lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of  New Jersey. (See PSR ¶ 12.) Nxivm's counterparties requested the production of certain Nxivm videotapes in  support of their claim that Nxivm's curriculum contained false statements and violated consumer protection laws.  (Id. ¶ 81.) Acting on Raniere's instructions, Nxivm members edited out segments of the videos that contained false  claims, and Nxivm then produced the edited tapes while claiming that they were unedited. (Id. ¶ 82.) At trial, an attorney who had represented three of Nxivm's counterparties in the case - Stephanie Franco, her father  Morris Sutton, and her stepmother Rochelle Sutton (collectively, ""the Sutton family"") - testified that [*39]  the  litigation lasted nearly fifteen years, and the Sutton family has submitted a restitution claim seeking over $2.8 million  in compensation for litigation costs. (See Trial Tr. at 4525:15-20, 4533:12-17; Gov't Recommendations at 2.) The  Sutton family's attorney testified that counsel reviewed the edited videotapes in preparation for trial, and that  counsel suspected the tapes had been altered and considered retaining an expert to opine on that matter. (Trial Tr.  at 4501:1-17, 4525:25-4527:7.) The court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that Nxivm's production of fraudulent evidence in federal district  court litigation caused pecuniary losses to the Sutton family by requiring their lawyers to spend time reviewing the  altered tapes and determining how to proceed in response. However, the court does not find that all litigation costs  incurred by the Sutton family in its civil litigation against Nxivm are the proximate result of the alteration of evidence  produced in discovery: many of those expenses would have been incurred even if Nxivm had produced the  unaltered videotapes. Individuals Not Entitled to Restitution: Absent further evidence, the court finds that individuals other [*40]  than  those identified above, more than 80 of whom have submitted restitution claims, are not victims of Raniere's crimes  within the meaning of the MVRA. This group includes five claimants to whom the Government recommend that the  court award restitution: Adrian [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] (""Adrian""), the brother of Jane Does 2, 3, and  4, who seeks to recover for uncompensated labor and psychological care, and Toni Natalie, Barbara Bouchey,  Susan Dones, and [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT], each of whom seeks to recover primarily for litigation  costs she incurred in defending against vexatious litigation initiated by Raniere and his co-conspirators. Page 13 of 15   The MVRA provides for restitution only to the victims of a defendant's crimes, not to every person victimized by his  harmful or improper actions. While the jury found that Raniere committed forced labor offenses, the charges  relating to those offenses were specific to uncompensated work performed by members of DOS. Accordingly, the  uncompensated labor and services performed by Adrian and other members of the Nxivm community, separate  from DOS, are outside the scope of the specific crimes of conviction, and therefore such harms are not  compensable [*41]  under the MVRA. Similarly, while the court has seen ample evidence that Raniere habitually  bullied and terrorized his detractors and perceived enemies through aggressive litigation, funded by co-defendant  Clare Bronfman and designed to push his critics past the brink of financial ruin, that conduct is not a part of any of  the crimes of which he was convicted. Many other individuals who immersed themselves in the Nxivm community, paying for its programming and  subscribing to its teachings, now seek to recover for the costs of their tuition, books, housing, and travel, and for the  mental health care that they require as they seek to heal the psychological damage wrought by the defendants'  conduct. The court recognizes that Raniere generated participation in Nxivm's programs through coercive and  manipulative tactics, which may cause many former participants to reasonably believe that they were cheated,  misled, or pressured into paying the price of participation. The court is sympathetic to the financial toll that  involvement in the Nxivm community took on so many individuals. Even so, the court cannot find by a  preponderance of the evidence, on the existing record, that any such costs [*42]  were the proximate result of  Raniere and his co-defendants' covered offenses. Rather, as the Government acknowledges, ""the causal link  between the defendants' criminal conduct and any losses incurred as a result of the purchase of Nxivm classes and  travel is too attenuated to satisfy the [MVRA's] proximate cause requirement."" (Gov't Restitution Ltr. at 5.) Many, if not all, of these claimants have suffered legitimate losses as a result of Raniere and his co-defendants'  abusive, manipulative, and vexatious conduct. In finding these claimants' alleged losses to be uncompensable  under the MVRA, the court makes no findings with respect to the validity or severity of their claimed losses, and it  does not suggest that those losses are unworthy or less worthy of restitution in any moral sense. Notwithstanding  that the harms they have suffered are beyond the scope of those losses that the court can order the defendant to  redress, the court extends to these claimants both its sympathy and its admiration for their resilience. 2. Identification of Compensable Losses Eligible victims under the MVRA are entitled to mandatory restitution tailored to the nature of the offense. Victims of  offenses ""resulting [*43]  in damage to or loss or destruction of property"" receive the return of the property or, ""if  return is . . . impossible, impracticable, or inadequate,"" payment equivalent to the property's value. 18 U.S.C. §  3663A(b)(1). Victims of offenses ""resulting in bodily injury"" are entitled to recover the costs of medical care and  ""related professional services"" relating to mental health care, the costs of ""necessary physical and occupational  therapy and rehabilitation,"" and lost income that resulted from the offense. Id. § 3663A(b)(2). All victims under the  MVRA are entitled to reimbursement for lost income and expenses, including child care and transportation,  ""incurred during participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings related  to the offense."" Id. § 3663A(b)(4). Raniere's covered offenses under the MVRA - wire fraud conspiracy, and identity theft crimes and conspiracy to  alter records for use in an official proceeding in furtherance of a racketeering enterprise - are crimes resulting in  damage to, loss of, or destruction of property. While all of these crimes deprived victims of property, they did so in a  manner that defies easy valuation. The court finds that the Government has not yet established [*44]  that any  victims under the MVRA are entitled to restitution beyond the costs incurred (including lost income) in participating  in the Government's investigation, prosecution, and related proceedings. The collection of DOS members' collateral through the wire fraud conspiracy deprived them of certain tangible  assets but also, more fundamentally, of control over information and images to which they ascribed high personal  value. That deprivation of control caused them to endure an array of injuries and losses, the magnitude of which far  exceeds any objective monetary value of the property that the defendants obtained. The court believes it is within  its authority to order the defendants to return qualifying MVRA victims' collateral to them, and it has reason to think  that such an order would be a relief to victims who continue to worry about the exposure of their collateral by  Page 14 of 15   Raniere's remaining adherents. But the mere return of collateral at this late stage, long after its rightful owners  submitted to the injustices and indignities of DOS membership, would be inadequate compensation for the damage  wrought. To the extent the Government can provide a reasonable approximation of the value [*45]  of victims'  collateral in this context, the court will order restitution in accordance with that estimate. Similarly, identity theft victims were deprived of the exclusive use of and control over the use of their identity. That  ""property"" cannot feasibly be returned to them, and the mere cessation of the theft is inadequate to compensate for  the injuries that it caused. Accordingly, if the Government can reasonably approximate the value of the damage  incurred by Loperfido, he is entitled to recover an amount commensurate with that value, in addition to  reimbursement for lost income and costs incurred through his participation in the investigation and trial. Finally, while the court finds that Nxivm's production of altered videotapes in response to a civil litigation discovery  request caused the Sutton family's lawyers to expend additional time on the case, and, therefore, caused the Sutton  family to incur additional legal costs, the Government has not yet provided a reasonable approximation of those  costs. The court cannot discern from the current record, including the Sutton family's restitution claim and  supporting documentation, what portion of the Sutton family's legal costs is directly [*46]  attributable to the unlawful  alteration of evidence. Thus, in order for the court to award restitution to the Sutton family on this basis, the  Government must reasonably approximate the amount of losses incurred by the Sutton family as a proximate result  of this predicate racketeering act.",1
"United States v. Paul, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72619","MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER I. INTRODUCTION This matter is before the undersigned United States District Judge for a ruling on Defendant Lee Andrew Paul's  (""Paul"") Motion Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence [Docket No. 203] (the ""§ 2255  Page 2 of 7 Motion""). Paul has also filed a letter [Docket No. 220] requesting a sentence reduction. For the reasons set forth  below, Paul's § 2255 Motion and request for a reduced sentence are denied. II. BACKGROUND On December 11, 2015, a jury returned a verdict finding Paul guilty of three counts of commercial sex trafficking in  violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Jury Verdict [Docket No. 98]. Paul's convictions arose from the sex trafficking of  two girls, ages 12 and 16, and a 19 year old woman. In Counts I and II, the jury found Paul trafficked the minor girls.  Id. In all three Counts, the jury found Paul used force, fraud or coercion in furtherance of his crimes. Id. Paul was  sentenced to a prison term of 396 months on each of Counts I, II, and III, to be served concurrently. [*2]   Sentencing J. [Docket No. 147] at 2; Sentencing Tr. [Docket No. 169] at 46. Paul appealed his conviction, arguing: 1) the evidence was insufficient to support each count of conviction; 2) each  count in the superseding indictment contained multiple crimes and was therefore duplicitous; and 3) the district  court's jury instructions defining ""coercion"" and ""fraud"" rendered § 1591(a) void for vagueness as applied. United  States v. Paul, 885 F.3d 1099 (8th Cir. 2018). On March 22, 2018, the Eighth Circuit affirmed Paul's conviction. Id.  at 1101. The Supreme Court denied Paul's writ of certiorari on October 1, 2018. See Paul v. United States, 139 S.  Ct. 290, 202 L. Ed. 2d 190 (2018). Paul then filed this § 2255 Motion. He asserts ineffective assistance of counsel claims against his trial counsel,  Michael Colich, and his appellate counsel, Virginia Villa. Paul also argues that the Government failed to establish  the requisite knowledge for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1591. In addition to the § 2255 Motion, Paul requests  that his sentence be reduced because he has rehabilitated himself while in prison and desires to assist his family  during the COVID-19 pandemic. III. DISCUSSION A. Legal Standard Persons in federal custody are provided a limited opportunity to collaterally attack the constitutionality, jurisdictional  basis, or legality of their sentence [*3]  under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. See United States v. Addonizio, 442 U.S. 178, 185,  99 S. Ct. 2235, 60 L. Ed. 2d 805 (1979). ""Relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is reserved for transgressions of  constitutional rights and for a narrow range of injuries that could not have been raised on direct appeal, and if  uncorrected, would result in a complete miscarriage of justice."" Walking Eagle v. United States, 742 F.3d 1079,  1081-82 (8th Cir. 2014) (quoting United States v. Apfel, 97 F.3d 1074, 1076 (8th Cir. 1996)). Section 2255 generally may not ""be used to relitigate matters decided on direct appeal."" Sun Bear v. United States,  644 F.3d 700, 702 (8th Cir. 2011) (citing Davis v. United States, 417 U.S. 333, 346-47, 94 S. Ct. 2298, 41 L. Ed. 2d  109 (1974)); see also United States v. Shabazz, 657 F.2d 189, 190 (8th Cir. 1981) (per curiam) (""Claims which  were raised and decided on direct appeal cannot be relitigated on a motion to vacate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §  2255.""). B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel     2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72619, *1 Page 3 of 7 ""To establish ineffective assistance of counsel within the context of section 2255 . . . a movant faces a heavy  burden."" Apfel, 97 F.3d at 1076. A defendant must show that ""(1) his attorney's performance failed to conform to the  degree of skill, care, and diligence of a reasonably competent attorney; and (2) he was prejudiced by the attorney's  poor performance."" Pierce v. United States, 686 F.3d 529, 531 (8th Cir. 2012) (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466  U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984)). The defendant must overcome the ""strong presumption"" that  his counsel provided reasonable assistance. Id. Overcoming that presumption requires a showing that, ""in light of  all the circumstances, the lawyer's performance was outside the range of professionally competent assistance.""  Cox v. Norris, 133 F.3d 565, 573 (8th Cir. 1997). If the defendant can show his counsel's performance was  inadequate, [*4]  he then must show that, but for the deficient performance, the outcome of his case would have  been different. Id. Paul argues that his trial and appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by: (1) failing to challenge  the Third Superseding Indictment [Docket No. 89]; (2) failing to assert prosecutorial misconduct; (3) failing to file a  pretrial severance motion; (4) failing to object to the Jury Instructions and Verdict Form; (5) failing to challenge §  1591(a) as unconstitutionally vague; and (6) advising Paul to stipulate to the interstate commerce element of  Counts I-III. 1. Challenging the Third Superseding Indictment Count I of the Third Superseding Indictment charged Paul with using ""force, fraud, and coercion"" to traffic Z.S.,  ""who had not yet attained the age of 14 years . . . all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591(a),  1591(b)(1), 1591(c), 1594(a), 1594(c), and 2."" Count II charged Paul with using ""force, fraud, and coercion"" to traffic  K.J., ""who had not yet attained the age of 18 years . . . all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections  1591(a), 1591(b)(1), 1591(c), 1594(a), 1594(c), and 2."" Count III charged Paul with using ""force, fraud, and  coercion"" to traffic A.S., all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591(a), 1591(b)(1), 1591(c),  1594(a), 1594(c), and 2."" Paul argues his ""trial Counsel failed to conduct a proper inquisition [*5]  into who were the participants of the  alleged 'conspiracy' [under 18 U.S.C. § 1594(c)] and 'venture' [under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2)] in Counts 1 and 2, by  not disputing it's [sic] lack of correlation to Paul's case."" Mem. Supp. [Docket No. 204] at 9; Reply [Docket No. 219]  at 2. Paul contends he was the only person indicted and charged with conspiracy to commit trafficking, and ""A.S.  was not mentioned in the charging instrument as being a co-conspirator."" Mem. Supp. at 7, 9. Paul argues that ""in  permitting the government to try the case on Conspiracy to commit Sex Trafficking of a Minor, the District Court  allowed the introduction of an enormous amount of evidence of the Substantive offense [of] 1591(a)(2)."" Mem.  Supp. at 7. This argument fails to recognize that because Paul was charged with the substantive offense of §  1591(a), evidence relevant to the substantive offense would have been admitted regardless of whether Paul had  also been charged with conspiracy to commit sex trafficking under § 1594(c). Paul has not demonstrated how  counsel's failure to challenge the Third Superseding Indictment as defective based on the conspiracy charge was  deficient, much less prejudicial, under the Strickland standard. Paul also contends his trial counsel [*6]  was ineffective for failing to raise duplicity and multiplicity challenges to the  Third Superseding Indictment. Paul's duplicity arguments are based on his contention that § 1591(a) includes two  separate crimes—sex trafficking minors and sex trafficking through force, fraud or coercion—and there was no  unanimous finding by the jury as to either crime. This argument was considered and rejected by the Eighth Circuit  on direct appeal. Paul, 885 F.3d at 1104-05. The Eighth Circuit held that ""the district court eliminated this risk of  non-unanimity by instructing the jury, and reflecting on the verdict form for Count I (Z.S.) and for Count II (K.J.), that  it must make separate findings whether Paul committed (i) 'the crime of sex trafficking of a minor,' and (ii) 'the crime  of sex trafficking by use of force, fraud, or coercion.' In convicting Paul of Counts I and II, the jury unanimously  found Paul guilty of both offenses against both victims. Thus, there was no duplicity."" Paul, 885 F.3d at 1105. Paul's multiplicity argument is that he should not have been charged for three counts of trafficking, because the  three individuals he trafficked ""were alleged to be transported at the same time on the same trip."" Reply at 10. This  argument fails because [*7]  each of the individual victims warrant a separate count of sex trafficking. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72619, *3 Page 4 of 7 Paul also argues that the Third Superseding Indictment was constructively amended, and that trial and appellate  counsel were ineffective for failing to challenge the constructive amendment. ""In cases in which courts have found a  constructive amendment of an indictment by virtue of the trial court's instructions to the jury, the instructions in  effect allowed the jury to convict the defendant of an offense different from or in addition to the offenses alleged in  the indictment."" United States v. Begnaud, 783 F.2d 144, 147 (8th Cir. 1986). Paul contends the Jury Instructions  and Verdict Form constructively amended the Third Superseding Indictment by stating that Paul was charged in  Counts I and II with using force, fraud, and coercion. Mem. Supp. at 15-16; Reply at 4-5. This argument is meritless  because the Jury Instructions and Verdict Form were correct. Counts I and II expressly charged Paul with sex  trafficking Z.S. and K.J. ""knowing that force, fraud or coercion would be used."" The Jury Instructions and Verdict  Form did not allow the jury to convict Paul of a different or additional offense beyond the offenses alleged in the  Third Superseding Indictment. Paul similarly [*8]  argues that the Government ""misled the Court that Paul was charged with Force, Fraud, and  Coercion in Counts I and II,"" and that as a result the Government was improperly permitted to introduce evidence of  Paul's sexual assaults on victims Z.S. and K.J. Reply at 5. Paul argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to  object to the admission of this evidence. Again, Counts I and II explicitly charge Paul with sex trafficking Z.S. and  K.J. through the use of force, fraud, and coercion. The evidence of Paul's assaults on Z.S. and K.J. was properly  admitted as direct evidence of the crimes charged. 2. No Prosecutorial Misconduct Paul claims that his trial and appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to assert prosecutorial  misconduct. Paul contends the prosecutor misled the grand jury into returning the First Superseding Indictment  [Docket No. 21], which added a sex trafficking charge for trafficking A.S. (Count III). Paul argues the initial  Indictment [Docket No. 15], which charged Paul with engaging in and conspiring to sex traffick Z.S. and K.J., was  based on a criminal complaint and affidavit that included A.S.'s name. Paul contends the prosecutor  subsequently [*9]  redacted A.S.'s name from the complaint and affidavit, and used the redacted materials to obtain  the First Superseding Indictment that added A.S. as a victim. Paul argues his counsel should have objected to the  Government alleging A.S. was both a co-conspirator and a victim. ""As a general rule, prosecutorial misconduct does not warrant federal habeas relief unless the misconduct infected  the trial with enough unfairness to render petitioner's conviction a denial of due process."" Louisell v. Dir. of Iowa  Dep't of Corr., 178 F.3d 1019, 1023 (8th Cir. 1999) (internal quotations and alterations omitted). Paul does not  explain how redacting a sex trafficking victim's name in grand jury materials is improper. Nor has Paul alleged that  the grand jury was somehow unaware of or confused as to the true identity of A.S. Paul also argues the Third Superseding Indictment constituted prosecutorial misconduct because it charged Paul  with sex trafficking by use of force fraud and coercion. Paul contends he ""was prejudiced because the government  repeatedly stated [during trial] that the defendant used force, fraud and coercion to cause all three of his victims to  engage in commercial sex actions."" Mem. Supp. at 30. This argument lacks any basis. Paul has not shown any prosecutorial [*10]  misconduct, much less misconduct that caused enough unfairness to  render Paul's convictions a denial of due process. Paul's counsel was not deficient for failing to assert prosecutorial  misconduct. 3. Pretrial Motion for Severance Paul also claims his trial attorney was ineffective for not filing a pretrial motion to sever Counts I and II (sex  trafficking minors Z.S. and K.J. using force, fraud, and coercion) from Count III (sex trafficking A.J. using force,  fraud, and coercion). Paul argues that the evidence in Count III had a ""spill over"" effect that prejudiced the jury's  judgment on Counts I and II. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72619, *7 Page 5 of 7 Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a) states that ""[t]he indictment or information may charge a defendant in  separate counts with 2 or more offenses if the offenses charged . . . are of the same or similar character, or are  based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan."" The  offenses in Counts I and II were ""of the same or similar character"" and were ""based on the same act or transaction""  as Count III, because Paul sex trafficked all three victims at the same time and in each other's presence. All three  Counts were also parts of a ""common scheme or plan"" by Paul [*11]  to victimize young, vulnerable women. Trial  counsel's decision not to seek to sever Count III was neither deficient nor prejudicial as the severance motion would  have been without merit. 4. Jury Instructions and Verdict Form Paul also argues his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the Jury Instructions and Verdict Form. ""Jury  instructions are acceptable if, taken as a whole, they adequately apprise the jury of the essential elements of the  offenses charged and the burden of proof required of the government."" United States v. Brown, 478 F.3d 926, 928  (8th Cir. 2007). Paul argues the Court's Jury Instructions for Counts I and II were erroneous because they stated the wrong mens  rea requirement for proving Paul's knowledge of Z.S. and K.J.'s ages. The Court disagrees. The Jury Instructions  for Counts I and II track nearly verbatim the offense of sex trafficking a minor under § 1591, including the requisite  mens rea. Compare 18 U.S.C.A. § 1591(a)(1), (c) with Jury Instructions 10, 11, 14. Taken as a whole, the Jury  Instructions addressing Counts 1 and 2 ""adequately apprise the jury of the essential elements of the offenses  charged and the burden of proof required of the government."" Brown, 478 F.3d at 928. Counsel's lack of objection  to the Jury Instructions was not ineffective assistance [*12]  under the Strickland standard. Paul also argues that counsel was ineffective for not requesting a specific unanimity instruction or special verdict  form. This argument fails because the Eighth Circuit has held in this case that ""the district court eliminated th[e] risk  of non-unanimity by instructing the jury, and reflecting on the verdict form for Count I (Z.S.) And for Count II (K.J.),  that it must make separate findings whether Paul committed (i) 'the crime of sex trafficking of a minor,' and (ii) 'the  crime of sex trafficking by the use of force, fraud, or coercion.'"" Paul, 885 F.3d at 1105. 5. Constitutionality of § 1591(a) Paul argues his counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the constitutionality of § 1591(a) as unconstitutionally  vague. Paul claims § 1591 is vague because it lacks clarity as to whether the statute includes a single offense or  multiple offenses. The challenged statute provides: (a) Whoever knowingly— (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce ... recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains,  or maintains by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture which has engaged  in an act described in violation of paragraph (1), knowing, [*13]  or in reckless disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion  described in subsection (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be used to cause the person to engage  in a commercial sex act, or that the person has not attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage  in a commercial sex act, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) (2012).   2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72619, *10 Page 6 of 7 ""A statute is void for vagueness if it: (1) fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is  prohibited, or (2) it is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement."" Paul,  885 F.3d at 1105. Paul does not explain how a person of ordinary intelligence would lack notice of what is  prohibited by § 1591, or how the statute encourages discriminatory enforcement. Moreover, the Eighth Circuit  concluded in Paul's appeal that although there may be some ambiguity as to whether § 1591 includes two separate  crimes—the crime of sex trafficking of a minor and the crime of sex trafficking by use of force, fraud, or coercion— the concern is not relevant here because ""the jury unanimously found Paul guilty of both offenses against both [Z.S.  and K.J.]."" Paul, 885 F.3d at 1105. Counsel's failure to challenge § 1591 as void for vagueness on [*14]  this  ground was not deficient or prejudicial. 6. Stipulation to Interstate Commerce Element Paul argues his trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance by advising him to stipulate to the interstate commerce  element of Counts I-III. At trial, the parties stipulated that various websites, hotels, and cell phone carriers were  entities ""affecting interstate commerce."" Trial Tr. Vol. III [Docket No. 166] at 652-654. The Government introduced  substantial evidence of Paul's use of these entities in the commission of his crimes. Paul argues ""no reasonable  counsel would have advised his client to lift the Government's burden of proof and stipulate to an essential element  of the offense."" Mem. Supp. at 52. A trial counsel's decision to stipulate to facts is a tactical decision. Edgemon v. Lockhart, 768 F.2d 252, 255 (8th  Cir. 1985). Matters of trial tactics do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel unless the chosen tactic is  ""wholly without reason."" Williams-Bey v. Trickey, 894 F.2d 314, 316 (8th Cir. 1990). Based on the evidence  presented by the Government that Paul used hotels, cell phone carriers, and websites in committing his crimes,  Paul's trial counsel was not deficient in advising Paul to stipulate to the interstate commerce element of the sex  trafficking offenses charged in Counts [*15]  I-III. If contested, the element would be readily susceptible to easy  proof by the prosecution. C. Rehaif Paul argues his convictions on all counts must be vacated under Rehaif v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2191, 204 L.  Ed. 2d 594 (2019). He contends that under Rehaif, the Government was required to prove that Paul knew his  conduct was unlawful. Rehaif involved a charge for unlawful possession of a firearm. The holding in Rehaif requires the Government prove  that a person whose prohibited status bars them from possessing a firearm know of both this status and his  possession of a firearm to ""knowingly violate"" the ban in 18 U.S.C. § 922(g). Id. at 2196-97, 2200. The rationale  behind the holding is that ""the possession of a gun can be entirely innocent,"" and ""[i]t is therefore the defendant's  status [as a felon or alien], and not his conduct alone, that makes the difference. Without knowledge of that status,  the defendant may well lack the intent needed to make his behavior wrongful. His behavior may instead be an  innocent mistake to which criminal sanctions normally do not attach."" Id. at 2197. Paul argues that under Rehaif, the Government was required to prove that Paul knew he had violated the material  elements of § 1591(a). He contends the Jury Instructions wrongly stated that ""the government is not required [*16]   to prove that the defendant knew his acts or omissions were unlawful."" Jury Instructions No. 14. This argument lacks merit. Unlike the statute at issue in Rehaif, the sex trafficking statute does not criminalize  otherwise innocent conduct. Paul's behavior in sex trafficking two minors and a 19-year old woman using force,     2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72619, *13 Page 7 of 7 fraud and coercion was not ""an innocent mistake to which criminal sanctions normally do not attach."" Rehaif, 139 S.  Ct. at 2197. The jury was properly instructed that the Government need not prove that Paul knew his acts or  omissions were unlawful. Additionally, the Jury Instructions correctly declined to apply a mens rea requirement to  the interstate commerce element of § 1591. See United States v. Collier, 932 F.3d 1067, 1075 (8th Cir. 2019)  (holding that ""knowingly"" does not apply to the ""interstate or foreign commerce"" element of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1)). D. Request for Reduced Sentence Paul has filed a letter requesting that the Court reduce his sentence. He states that he has completed several  educational courses offered by the Bureau of Prisons and has rehabilitated himself while in custody. Paul also  states that the mother of his children is a health care worker, and that he desires to assist his family while they are  enduring the COVID 19 pandemic. The Court is hopeful that [*17]  the many educational and vocational opportunities Paul has afforded himself while  in custody will improve his remaining time in custody and allow him to find steady employment and lead a  productive life upon his release. The Court also recognizes that the current pandemic presents added difficulty and  stress to prisoners and their families. However, Paul has not identified an exception to the general rule that ""[t]he  court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed. 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c). The request for a  reduced sentence is denied. IV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY The Court may grant a certificate of appealability only where a defendant has made a substantial showing of the  denial of a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2); Tiedeman v. Benson, 122 F.3d 518, 523 (8th Cir. 1997). To  make such a showing, ""[t]he petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court's  assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong."" Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S. Ct.  1595, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542 (2000). The Court finds it unlikely that another court would decide the issues raised in this  § 2255 Motion differently, or that any of the issues raised in Paul's Motion would be debatable among reasonable  jurists. Therefore, the Court declines to grant a certificate of appealability.",1
"United States v. Williams, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956","MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER THIS MATTER comes before the Court on: (i) Defendant Leotha Williams' First Set of Objections to the  Presentence Report, filed March 16, 2020 (Doc. 198)(""First Objections""); and (ii) Defendant Leotha Williams'  Second Set of Objections to the Presentence Report, filed March 16, 2020 (Doc. 199)(""Second Objections""). The  primary issues are: (i) whether the Court should amend the Presentence Investigation Report ¶ 11, at 8, filed  January 6, 2020 (Doc. 184)(""PSR""), to omit its characterization of Defendant Leotha Williams' co-Defendant, Adonis  Baker, as the most active sex trafficker in Albuquerque, New Mexico; (ii) whether the Court should amend the  PSR's ¶ 14, at 9, to omit its statement that Baker placed advertisements for trafficked women in Texas, Arizona,  Nevada, Illinois, Tennessee, Alabama, Missouri, Kansas, and Virginia; (iii) whether the Court [*2]  should amend  the PSR's ¶ 14, at 9, to omit its reference to Baker's use of a firearm in forcing Jane Doe 2, Williams' victim, to get  into a car with Baker and Williams; (iv) whether the Court should amend the PSR's ¶ 17, at 9, to omit its description  of Baker's abuse of Jane Doe; (v) whether the Court should amend the PSR's ¶ 18, at 9, to omit its characterization  that girls and women in Williams and his co-Defendants' employment were not free to leave such that Jane Doe 2  had to escape from Williams and his co-Defendants; (vi) whether the Court should amend the PSR ¶ 23, at 10, to  omit its characterization that Williams conspired and engaged in an extensive human trafficking organization; (vii)  whether the Court can rely on Baker's sale of Jane Doe 7, a sex worker, to Cornelius Galloway in March, 2016, as  Page 2 of 33   conduct relevant to Williams' sentence; (viii) whether the Court should amend the PSR's ¶ 46, at 13, to omit  instances of Baker's sexual abuse of his victims, because there is no evidence that Williams was aware of this  abuse; (ix) whether the Court should amend the PSR's ¶ 47, at 13, because there is insufficient evidence that Baker  held one of victim's children hostage to intimidate [*3]  the victim to continue working for Baker; (x) whether the  Court should amend the PSR's ¶ 50, at 14, because there is insufficient evidence that Baker and Williams took  several victims to Colorado Springs, Colorado, to engage in sex work; (xi) whether the Court should apply the  United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual (""U.S.S.G."" or ""Guidelines"") § 2G1.1, rather than  U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1, to Williams' offense, because Williams did not coerce or intimidate the sex workers that Baker  employed, but rather persuaded them to continue working; (xii) if U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1 applies, whether Williams  abducted Jane Doe 2 such that a 4-level enhancement for abduction under U.S.S.G. §2A3.1(b)(5) applies; (xiii)  whether Williams' offense involved physical restraint of Jane Doe 2 such that U.S.S.G. § 3A1.3's 2-level  enhancement applies; and (xiv) whether Williams' role was sufficiently minimal that he should receive a 4-level  adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2(a). Williams' primary argument for several of these objections is that he  was unaware of and not present for much of Baker's abuse. See First Objections at 2-5. The Court concludes that  many -- but not all -- of Baker's acts to whose inclusion in the PSR Williams objects are foreseeably within the  scope and in furtherance of Williams' jointly undertaken [*4]  criminal activity. See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3. Accordingly,  the Court concludes that: (i) Plaintiff United States of America has not proven by a preponderance of the evidence  that Baker was Albuquerque's most active sex trafficker, so the Court will amend the PSR's ¶ 11, at 8, to omit that  characterization, unless the United States presents evidence at the sentencing hearing that supports the PSR's  characterization of Baker; (ii) although Baker placed sex-worker advertisements in other states, advertisements  beyond New Mexico and Colorado were not within the scope of jointly undertaken conduct in which Williams agreed  to assist, and so the Court will amend the PSR's ¶ 14, at 9; (iii) Baker's use of a firearm in directing Jane Doe 2 to  get into a vehicle with Baker and Williams was foreseeably in furtherance and in the scope of jointly undertaken  criminal activity, so the Court will not amend the PSR's ¶ 14, at 9; (iv) the relevance of Baker's abuse does not  depend on Williams' knowledge, because that abuse was central to Williams and his co-Defendants' criminal  enterprise, so the Court will not amend the PSR's ¶ 17, at 9; (v) the United States has proven by a preponderance  of the evidence that sex workers [*5]  in Williams' employ were not free to quit or leave, so the Court will not amend  the PSR's ¶ 18, at 10; (vi) the United States has not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that Williams  conspired and engaged in an extensive trafficking organization, so the Court will not amend the PSR's ¶ 23, at 10;  (vii) that Baker sold Jane Doe 7 to another trafficker is illustrative of Williams' offense and so is relevant under 18  U.S.C. § 3661; (viii) Baker's sexual abuse of sex workers in the Defendants' employ is relevant to Williams' offense  under 18 U.S.C. § 3661, so the Court will not amend the PSR's ¶ 46, at 12; (ix) there is sufficient evidence that  Baker held one of his victim's children hostage to coerce the victim's subservience, and this incident is relevant  under 18 U.S.C. § 3661, so the Court will not amend the PSR's ¶ 50, at 14; (x) there is sufficient evidence that  Baker took several victims to Colorado Springs to engage in sex work, and this conduct is relevant to Williams'  offense under 18 U.S.C. § 3661, so the Court will not amend the PSR's ¶ 50, at 14; (xi) U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1 properly  applies to Williams' offense, because, although he pled guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. § 2422(a), his offense conduct  involved coercive behavior that § 2A3.1 cross references; (xii) § 2A3.1(b)(5)'s 4-level enhancement [*6]  applies,  because Williams aided and abetted Baker when he forcibly abducted Jane Doe 2, transported her to another state,  and forced Jane Doe 2 to engage in sex work; (xiii) Baker forcibly restrained Jane Doe 2, and Williams aided and  abetted that restraint, such that § 3A1.3's 2-level enhancement applies; and (xiv) Williams' role in the sex- trafficking enterprise was not supervisory or managerial, but also was not minimal, so a 2-level reduction in  Williams' offense level is appropriate. The Court also concludes that the PSR's application of a 4-level  enhancement under §2A3.1(b)(1) is proper and does not constitute double counting, but that the PSR improperly  applies a 2-level enhancement under § 2A3.1(b)(4), because Williams' victim did not sustain serious bodily injury.  Accordingly, the Court sustains in part and overrules in part the First Objections, and sustains in part and overrules  in part the Second Objections. FACTUAL BACKGROUND The Court takes its facts from the PSR and the Plea Agreement, filed October 15, 2019 (Doc. 173). Between 2014  and 2017, Baker led a sex trafficking organization in which co-defendant Inkosi Grandberry and Williams assisted.  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *2 Page 3 of 33   See PSR ¶ 23, at 10. Grandberry and Williams served as Baker's [*7]  lieutenants, assisting Baker in capturing  women and ensuring their continued subservience. See PSR ¶ 23, at 10. Baker typically targeted homeless or  drug-addicted girls and women whom he lured into his control by offering drugs and shelter, and whom he then  forced into sex work. See PSR ¶ 23, at 10. Baker typically carried a firearm that he made visible to his victims. See  PSR ¶ 23, at 10. In at least two instances, Baker picked up women he had previously not met and immediately  drove them to other cities and states to engage in sex work. See PSR ¶ 23, at 10. One victim reported being  drugged into unconsciousness and waking up in another state. See PSR ¶ 23, at 10. On January 26, 2018, law enforcement interviewed Jane Doe 7, another woman who had worked for Baker. See  PSR ¶ 44, at 13. Tobi Stanfill, another sex worker, introduced Jane Doe 7 to Baker, and Baker later sold Stanfill to  Cornelius Galloway, another trafficker. See PSR ¶ 14, at 13. Jane Doe 7 reported that Baker physically attacked  other sex workers, including striking Stanfill's head with a wooden chair leg and breaking another worker's leg. See  PSR ¶¶ 48-49, at 13. After Baker sold Stanfill, she was murdered. See PSR ¶ [*8]  44, at 13. Jane Doe 7 also  reported that Baker took photographs of Jane Doe 7, which he posted on Backpage.com as advertisements. See  PSR ¶ 45, at 13. Baker forced Jane Doe 7 to work every day and required her to earn $1,500.00 a day. See PSR §  45, at 13. Jane Doe 7 earned $80.00 to $200.00 per ""date,"" but Baker collected all the money that she earned. PSR  ¶ 45, at 13. The PSR states that Baker gave Jane Doe 7 drugs and ""prevent[ed] her from seeing her infant child""  when she refused to work. PSR ¶ 45, at 13. In July or August, 2016, Baker and Williams approached Jane Doe 2 on Central Avenue in Albuquerque. See PSR  ¶ 14, at 9. Baker showed Jane Doe 2 a handgun, and told her to get into Baker's car with him and Williams. See  PSR ¶ 14, at 9. Baker told Jane Doe 2 that she had ""no choice"" but to get inside the car. PSR ¶ 14, at 9. Baker and  Williams then drove Jane Doe 2 to a hotel in Colorado Springs, where Baker kept other women who were working  for him. See PSR ¶ 14, at 9. During the drive to Colorado Springs, Baker bought Jane Doe 2 lingerie at a Walmart,  where Baker took photographs of Jane Doe 2 that he posted to Backpage.com. See PSR ¶ 16, at 9. In Colorado  Springs, Baker forced Jane [*9]  Doe 2 to engage in fifteen to twenty ""dates."" PSR ¶ 17, at 9. Jane Doe 2 had to  give Baker all the money that she earned. See PSR ¶ 17, at 9. On the two or three instances in which Jane Doe 2  did not give Baker money, he assaulted her and, in one instance, raped her. See PSR ¶ 17, at 9. During Jane Doe  2's time in Colorado Springs, Williams acted as ""guard and security for the victims when Baker was not around.""  PSR ¶17, at 9. In September, 2016, Jane Doe 2 fled with the help of another sex worker. See PSR ¶ 18, at 9. In January, 2017, Baker called the Albuquerque Police Department (""APD"") and reported that Jane Doe 7 had  abandoned her infant child after she refused to work. PSR ¶ 47, at 13. Baker told Jane Doe 7 that, if she did not  work for him, he could ""make money off her baby."" PSR ¶ 47, at 13. APD officers visited Baker's apartment, but  Baker had already left with Jane Doe 7's child. See PSR ¶ 47, at 13. Jane Doe 7 told APD officers that ""Baker  forcibly took her baby and told her she needs to make a certain amount of money to get the baby back."" PSR ¶ 47,  at 13. Williams was present at Baker's apartment during this interview. See PSR ¶ 47, at 13. Jane Doe 7 described Williams as [*10]  Baker's ""pimp partner."" PSR ¶ 45, at 13. Jane Doe 7 said that Williams  guarded the sex workers' movements when Baker was not around. See PSR ¶ 46, at 13. In June, 2017, Baker and  Williams took Jane Doe 7 and two other sex workers to Colorado Springs to engage in sex work. See PSR ¶ 50, at  14. Jane Doe 7 reported that, in another instance, Baker brought another woman back with him to Colorado Springs  to engage in sex work. See PSR ¶ 50, at 14. The woman reported that Baker drugged her in Albuquerque and she  awoke in Colorado Springs. See PSR ¶ 50, at 14. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND On September 11, 2019, a federal Grand Jury issued a twenty-count Superseding Indictment that charged Baker,  Williams, and Inkosi Grandberry with violating 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a)(1) and (d), 2422(a), and 2423(a) and (e). See  Superseding Indictment ¶¶1-20, at 1-8, filed September 11, 2019 (Doc. 153)(""Indictment""). The Indictment charges  Williams with: (i) two counts of violating § 1591(a)(1), see Indictment ¶¶ 5, 13, at 3, 6; (ii) two counts of violating §  2422(a), see Indictment ¶¶ 6, 14, at 3-4, 6; and (iii) one count of violating § 2421(a), see Indictment ¶ 15, at 6. On  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *6 Page 4 of 33   October 15, 2019, Williams pled guilty to Count 6, and admitted to violating 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 2422(a). See Plea  Agreement ¶ 8, at 3. Williams [*11]  states: At some point between June 2016 and September 2016, I, Leotha Williams, went with my co-defendant,  Adonis Baker to approach Jane Doe 2 near a bus stop and Central Ave. in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The two  of us made it clear to her that she was to get in our vehicle. I knew at the time that she would be immediately  driven from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Colorado Springs, Colorado for the purpose of working as a  prostitute. I knowingly aided and abetted my co-defendant to persuade Jane Doe 2 to travel in interstate  commerce to engage in prostitution. When we arrived in Colorado Springs, I helped make sure Jane Doe 2  was accounted for and engaged in prostitution. Plea Agreement ¶ 9, at 4. The Plea Agreement reflects the United States and Williams' agreement that a sentence  of thirty-six to sixty months is appropriate. See Plea Agreement ¶ 11, at 5. Although Williams pled guilty to § 2422(a), the USPO uses U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1 to determine his base offense level,  because § 2G1.1(c)(1) cross references § 2A3.1. See PSR ¶ 29, at 11. The USPO thus calculates a base offense  level of 30, whereas, under § 2G1.1(c)(1), Williams' base offense level would be 14. See PSR ¶ 29, at 11; U.S.S.G.  §§ 2A3.1, 2G1.1. The USPO then adds a series of enhancements, beginning with a 4-level [*12]  enhancement  under U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1(b)(1), because Williams' offense involves conduct that 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) or (b)  describes. See PSR ¶ 30, at 11. The USPO then adds a 2-level increase under § 2A3.1(b)(4), which applies if the  victim sustained serious bodily injury. See PSR ¶ 31, at 11. The USPO further adds a 4-level enhancement under §  2A3.1(b)(5), which applies if the offense conduct involved abduction, and a 2-level enhancement under § 3A1.3,  which applies if the victim was physically restrained. See PSR ¶ 32, at 11. The USPO then applies a 3-level  decrease for Williams' acceptance of responsibility and assistance to authorities. See PSR ¶¶ 38-39, at 12. The  USPO thus calculates a total offense level of 39. See PSR ¶ 40, at 12. Although Williams has a series of  convictions, including for felony robbery, these convictions do not factor into Williams' criminal history score, which  is zero, because Williams committed the offenses more than fifteen years before this federal offense. See PSR ¶  62, at 17; U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(c), (e)(3). According to the PSR, Williams' total offense level and criminal history  category results in a Guidelines imprisonment range of 262 to 327 months. See PSR ¶ 114, at 28. The maximum  imprisonment term for § 2422(a), however, is twenty years. See 18 U.S.C. § 2422(a). Williams objects [*13]  to the PSR's inclusion of several of Baker's acts, of which Williams asserts he was unaware.  See First Objections at 2-4. Williams' primary objection, however, is to the USPO's application of § 2A3.1 rather  than § 2G1.1. See Second Objections at 3-4. Williams also argues that, if the Court determines that § 2A3.1  applies, the Court should not apply § 2A3.1(b)(5)'s 4-level enhancement, which applies to § 2A3.1 offenses  involving abduction. See Second Objections at 4. Williams further argues that § 3A1.3's 2-level enhancement for  offenses involving physical restraint does not apply. See Second Objections at 5. Last, Williams asserts that he  played a minimal role in Baker's enterprise such that the Court should apply a mitigating-role adjustment to his  offense level. See Objections at 5-6. Both the United States and the USPO disagree with each of Williams'  objections. See United States' Response to Defendant Williams' Second Set of Objections to the Presentence  Report (Doc. 199) at 4-8, filed March 27, 2020 (Doc. 207)(""Response""); Addendum to the Presentence Report at 1- 9, filed March 26 2020 (Doc. 202)(""Addendum""). The United States agrees, however, that Williams did not hold a  managerial or supervisory role in Baker's enterprise, so the United States stipulates to the application of a  mitigating-role adjustment. See Response at 8. RELEVANT [*14]  LAW REGARDING THE GUIDELINES In United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court of the  United States of America severed the mandatory provisions from the Sentencing Reform Act, Pub. L. No. 98-473,  98 Stat. 1976, thus making Guidelines sentencing ranges effectively advisory. In excising the two sections, the  Supreme Court left the remainder of the Sentencing Reform Act intact, including 18 U.S.C. § 3553: ""Section  3553(a) remains in effect, and sets forth numerous factors that guide sentencing. Those factors in turn will guide  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *10 Page 5 of 33   appellate courts, as they have in the past, in determining whether a sentence is unreasonable."" United States v.  Booker, 543 U.S. at 261. Congress has directed sentencing courts to impose a sentence ""sufficient, but not greater than necessary"" to  comply with four statutorily defined purposes enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2): (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for  the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional  treatment in the most effective manner . . . . 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A)-(D). [A] defendant who has been found guilty of an offense described in any Federal statute . [*15]  . . shall be  sentenced in accordance with the provisions of this chapter so as to achieve the purposes set forth in  subparagraphs (A) through (D) of section 3553(a)(2) to the extent that they are applicable in light of all the  circumstances of the case. 18 U.S.C. § 3551. To achieve these purposes, § 3553(a) directs sentencing courts to consider: (i) the Guidelines;  (ii) the nature of the offense and of the defendant's character; (iii) the available sentences; (iv) the policy favoring  uniformity in sentences for defendants who commit similar crimes; (v) the need to provide restitution to victims; and  (vi) any pertinent United States Sentencing Commission policy statements in effect on the date of sentencing. See  18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). Although the Guidelines are no longer mandatory, both the Supreme Court and the United States Court of Appeals  for the Tenth Circuit have clarified that, while the Guidelines are one of several factors which § 3553(a) enumerates,  they require careful consideration. See Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 349, 127 S. Ct. 2456, 168 L. Ed. 2d 203  (2007)(""The Guidelines as written reflect the fact that the Sentencing Commission examined tens of thousands of  sentences and worked with the help of many others in the law enforcement community over a long period of time in  an effort to fulfill [its] statutory mandate.""); [*16]  United States v. Cage, 451 F.3d 585, 593 (10th Cir.  2006)(describing the Guidelines as more than ""just one factor among many""). They are significant, because ""the  Guidelines are an expression of popular political will about sentencing that is entitled to due consideration . . . [and]  represent at this point eighteen years' worth of careful consideration of the proper sentence for federal offenses.""  United States v. Cage, 451 F.3d at 593 (internal quotation marks omitted)(quoting United States v. Terrell, 445 F.3d  1261, 1265 (10th Cir. 2006)). A reasonable sentence is one that also ""avoid[s] unwarranted sentence disparities  among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct."" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). See  United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. at 261-62. The Tenth Circuit has ""joined a number of other circuits in holding that a sentence within the applicable Guidelines  range is presumptively reasonable."" United States v. Terrell, 445 F.3d 1261, 1264 (10th Cir. 2006), overruled on  other grounds by Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. at 349, as recognized in United States v. Zamora-Solorzano, 528  F.3d 1247, 1251 n.3 (10th Cir. 2008). This presumption, however, is an appellate presumption, and not one that the  trial court can or should apply. See Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 46-47, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445  (2007); Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U.S. 85, 90-91, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481 (2007); Rita v. United  States, 551 U.S. at 351. Instead, the trial court must undertake the § 3553(a) balancing of factors without any  presumption in favor of the advisory Guidelines sentence. See Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. at 351; Gall v.  United States, 552 U.S. at 46-47; Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U.S. at 90-91.    2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *14 Page 6 of 33   While the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Booker has given the sentencing court discretion that it  did not have earlier, the sentencing court's first [*17]  task remains to accurately and correctly determine the  advisory-guideline sentence. Thus, before the sentencing court takes up a defendant's Booker arguments, the  sentencing court must first determine whether the defendant is entitled to downward departures. The  sentencing court may, however, also use these same departure factors in the Booker calculus, even if the court  does not grant a downward departure. United States v. Apodaca-Leyva, No. CR 07-1479 JB, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42317, 2008 WL 2229550, at *6  (D.N.M. Feb. 13, 2008)(Browning, J.). The Supreme Court has recognized, however, that sentencing judges are ""in  a superior position to find facts and judge their import under § 3553(a) in each particular case."" Kimbrough v. United  States, 552 U.S. at 89. Applying § 3553(a)'s factors, the Court has concluded that the case of an immigrant who  illegally re-entered the United States to provide for his two children and two siblings was not materially different  from other re-entry cases, and, thus, no variance from the Guidelines sentence was warranted. See United States  v. Almendares-Soto, No. CR 10-1922 JB, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137157, 2010 WL 5476767, at *12 (D.N.M. Dec.  14, 2010)(Browning, J.). On the other hand, in United States v. Jager, No. CR 10-1531 JB, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  21203, 2011 WL 831279 (D.N.M. Feb. 17, 2011)(Browning, J.), although the defendant's military [*18]  service was  not present to an unusual degree and, thus, did not warrant a departure, the Court concluded that a variance was  appropriate, because the defendant's military service was ""superior and uniformly outstanding,"" as the defendant                                   2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *16 Page 7 of 33   appeared to have been ""trustworthy[] and dedicated, and he served with distinction."" 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21203,  2011 WL 831279, at *14. LAW REGARDING THE BURDEN OF PROOF REQUIRED FOR ENHANCEMENTS UNDER THE GUIDELINES In Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000)(""Apprendi""), the Supreme  Court reaffirmed the principle that it is permissible for sentencing judges ""to exercise discretion -- taking into  consideration various factors relating both to offense and offender -- in imposing judgment within the range  prescribed by statute."" 530 U.S. at 481. The Supreme Court cautioned, however, that the Constitution of the United  States of America limits this discretion, and the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution requires that, ""[o]ther than the  fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum  must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt."" Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490. In Blakely v.  Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S. Ct. 2531, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403 (2004), the Supreme Court elaborated on its holding  in Apprendi, stating that the ""'statutory maximum' for Apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may  impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant."" Blakely v.  Washington, 542 U.S. at 303 (emphasis and citations omitted). In United States v. Booker, however, the Supreme  Court held that, because the sentencing guidelines [*21]  are no longer mandatory, ""Apprendi does not apply to the  present advisory-Guidelines regime."" United States v. Ray, 704 F.3d 1307, 1314 (10th Cir. 2013). See United  States v. Booker, 543 U.S. at 259 (""[W]ithout this provision [of the Guidelines statute] -- namely, the provision that  makes the relevant sentencing rules mandatory and imposes binding requirements on all sentencing judges -- the  statute falls outside the scope of Apprendi's requirement."" (alterations and internal quotations marks omitted)). More  recently, the Supreme Court held that the requirements in Apprendi apply to facts that increase a defendant's  mandatory minimum sentence. See Alleyne v. United States, 570 U.S. 99, 103, 133 S. Ct. 2151, 186 L. Ed. 2d 314  (2013)(""Alleyne""). In United States v. Magallanez, 408 F.3d 672 (10th Cir. 2005), the Tenth Circuit held that Blakely v. Washington  and United States v. Booker did not change the district court's enhancement findings analysis. See United States v.  Magallanez, 408 F.3d at 684-85. United States v. Magallanez involved plain-error review of a drug sentence in  which a jury found the defendant guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and of distributing  methamphetamine. See 408 F.3d at 676. As part of its verdict, the jury, through a special interrogatory, attributed to  the defendant between 50 and 500 grams of methamphetamine. See 408 F.3d at 682. At sentencing, however, the  judge -- based on testimony of the various amounts that government witnesses indicated they [*22]  had sold to the  defendant -- attributed 1200 grams of methamphetamine to the defendant and used that amount to increase his  sentence under the Guidelines. See 408 F.3d at 682. The district court's findings increased the defendant's  Guidelines sentencing range from 63 to 78 months to 121 to 151 months. See 408 F.3d at 682-83. On appeal, the  Tenth Circuit stated that, both before and after Congress' passage of the Sentencing Reform Act, ""sentencing  courts maintained the power to consider the broad context of a defendant's conduct, even when a court's view of  the conduct conflicted with the jury's verdict."" 408 F.3d at 684. Although United States v. Booker made the  Guidelines ranges ""effectively advisory,"" the Tenth Circuit reaffirmed that ""district courts are still required to consider  Guideline ranges, which are determined through application of the preponderance standard, just as they were  before."" United States v. Magallanez, 408 F.3d at 685 (citation omitted). The Tenth Circuit, while ""recognizing 'strong arguments that relevant conduct causing a dramatic increase in  sentence ought to be subject to a higher standard of proof,'"" has ""long held that sentencing facts in the 'ordinary  case' need only be proven by a preponderance.""

United States v. Price, 400 F.3d 844, 847 (10th Cir. 2005). Accord United States v. Ray, 704 F.3d at  1314. A defendant may assert an error under Apprendi only where the fact at issue increased his sentence beyond  the statutory maximum. See United States v. O'Flanagan, 339 F.3d 1229, 1232 (10th Cir. 2003)(holding that a  defendant could not assert an error under Apprendi, because ""his sentence does not exceed the statutory  maximum""); United States v.

The Court has noted: [A]lthough the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Alleyne v. United States, ...expands the  rule from Apprendi v. New Jersey...(holding that facts that increase the maximum sentence a defendant faces  must be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt), to cover facts that increase [*24]  the mandatory  minimum sentence, as well as the maximum sentence, it does not prohibit district judges from continuing to find  advisory sentencing factors by a preponderance of the evidence. See [United States v. ]Sangiovanni, 2014  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122201, 2014 WL 4347131, at *22-26 [(D.N.M. 2014)(Browning, J.)]. United States v. Cervantes-Chavez, 59 F. Supp. 3d 1295, 2014 WL 6065657, at *14 (D.N.M. 2014)(Browning, J.). LAW REGARDING RELEVANT CONDUCT FOR SENTENCING In calculating an appropriate sentence, the Guidelines consider a defendant's ""offense of conviction and all relevant  conduct under § 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) unless a different meaning is specified or is otherwise clear from the  context."" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1, n.1(H). In United States v. Booker, the Supreme Court notes:                         2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *22 Page 9 of 33   Congress' basic statutory goal -- a system that diminishes sentencing disparity [*25]  --depends for its success  upon judicial efforts to determine, and to base punishment upon, the real conduct that underlies the crime of  conviction. That determination is particularly important in the federal system where crimes defined as, for  example, ""obstruct[ing], delay[ing], or affect[ing] commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in  commerce, by . . . extortion,"" . . . can encompass a vast range of very different kinds of underlying conduct. 543 U.S. at 250-51 (emphasis in original)(quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a)). The Supreme Court's reasoning in United  States v. Booker suggests that the consideration of real conduct is necessary to effectuate Congress' purpose in  enacting the Guidelines. Section 1B1.3(a) provides that the base offense level under the Guidelines ""shall be determined"" based on the  following: (1) (A) all acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or  willfully caused by the defendant; and (B) in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity (a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or enterprise  undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy), all  reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly [*26]  undertaken criminal  activity, that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or  in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense; (2) solely with respect to offenses of a character for which § 3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple  counts, all acts and omissions described in subdivisions (1)(A) and (1)(B) above that were part of the same  course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction; (3) all harm that resulted from the acts and omissions specified in subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) above, and all  harm that was the object of such acts and omissions; and (4) any other information specified in the applicable guideline. U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)-(4). The court may consider, as relevant conduct, actions that have not resulted in a  conviction. Pursuant to § 6A1.3's commentary, evidentiary standards lower than beyond a reasonable doubt are  permitted to show relevant conduct. The court may rely upon reliable hearsay, so long as the evidence meets the  preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. See United States v. Vigil, 476 F. Supp. 2d 1231, 1245 (D.N.M.  2007)(Browning, J.), aff'd, 523 F.3d 1258 (10th Cir. 2008). Accord United States v. Schmidt, 353 F. App'x 132, 135  (10th Cir. 2009)(unpublished)(""The district court's determination of 'relevant conduct' is a factual finding subject to a  preponderance of the evidence standard, and clear [*27]  error review.""). The evidence and information upon which  the court relies, however, must have sufficient indicia of reliability. See U.S.S.G. § 6A1.3 (""In resolving any dispute  concerning a factor important to the sentencing determination, the court may consider relevant information without  regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient  indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.""). Supreme Court precedent on relevant conduct consists primarily of two cases: Witte v. United States, 515 U.S. 389,  115 S. Ct. 2199, 132 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1995), and United States v. Watts, 519 U.S. 148, 117 S. Ct. 633, 136 L. Ed. 2d  554 (1997). In Witte v. United States, the Supreme Court upheld the use of uncharged conduct at sentencing  against a double-jeopardy challenge. See 515 U.S. at 404-06. The defendant in Witte v. United States had been  involved in an unsuccessful attempt to import marijuana and cocaine into the United States in 1990, and in an  attempt to import marijuana in 1991. See 515 U.S. at 392-93. In March, 1991, a federal grand jury indicted the  defendant for attempting to possess marijuana with intent to distribute in association with the defendant's latter  attempt to import narcotics. See 515 U.S. at 392-93. At sentencing, the district court concluded that, because the  1990 attempt was part of the continuing conspiracy, it was [*28]  relevant conduct under § 1B1.3, and thus  calculated the defendant's base offense level based on the aggregate amount of drugs involved in both the 1990  and 1991 episodes. See 515 U.S. at 394. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *24 Page 10 of 33   In September, 1992, a second federal grand jury indicted the defendant for conspiring and attempting to import  cocaine in association with his activities in 1990. See 515 U.S. at 392-93. The defendant moved to dismiss the  indictment, contending that he had already been punished for the cocaine offenses, because the court had  considered those offenses relevant conduct at the sentencing for the 1991 marijuana offense. See 515 U.S. at 395.  The district court agreed and dismissed the indictment, holding that punishment for the cocaine offenses would  violate the prohibition against multiple punishments in the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the  Constitution. See 515 U.S. at 395. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed and held that  ""the use of relevant conduct to increase the punishment of a charged offense does not punish the offender for the  relevant conduct."" United States v. Witte, 25 F.3d 250, 258 (5th Cir. 1994). In reaching this holding, the Fifth Circuit  acknowledged that its conclusion was contrary to other United States Courts of Appeals opinions, including a Tenth  Circuit opinion, that had previously considered this question. See 25 F.3d at 255 n.19 (citing [*29]  United States v.  Koonce, 945 F.2d 1145 (10th Cir. 1991)). The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve the conflict between the Courts of Appeals and affirmed the Fifth  Circuit decision. See Witte v. United States, 515 U.S. at 395. In holding that a district court's consideration of the  defendant's relevant conduct did not punish the defendant for that conduct, the Supreme Court concluded that  ""consideration of information about the defendant's character and conduct at sentencing does not result in  'punishment' for any offense other than the one of which the defendant was convicted."" 515 U.S. at 401. The  Supreme Court reasoned that sentencing courts had always considered relevant conduct and ""the fact that the  sentencing process has become more transparent under the Guidelines . . . does not mean that the defendant is  now being punished for uncharged relevant conduct as though it were a distinct criminal offense."" 515 U.S. at 402.  Sentencing enhancements do not punish a defendant for uncharged offenses; rather, they reflect Congress' policy  judgment ""that a particular offense should receive a more serious sentence within the authorized range if it was  either accompanied by or preceded by additional criminal activity."" 515 U.S. at 403. In United States v. Watts, the Supreme Court, in a per curiam opinion, relied upon  [*30] Witte v. United States and  upheld, against a double-jeopardy challenge, a sentencing judge's use of conduct for which the defendant had been  acquitted. See United States v. Watts, 519 U.S. at 149. The Supreme Court noted that its conclusion was in accord  with every United States Court of Appeals -- other than the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit -- and that each  had previously held that a sentencing court may consider conduct for which the defendant had been acquitted, if the  government establishes that conduct by a preponderance of the evidence. See 519 U.S. at 149 (citing, e.g., United  States v. Coleman, 947 F.2d 1424, 1428-29 (10th Cir. 1991)). The Supreme Court began its analysis with 18 U.S.C.  § 3661: ""No limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a  person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of  imposing an appropriate sentence."" United States v. Watts, 519 U.S. at 151 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3661). According  to the Supreme Court, 18 U.S.C. § 3661 codifies ""the longstanding principle that sentencing courts have broad  discretion to consider various kinds of information"" and that ""the Guidelines did not alter this aspect of the  sentencing court's discretion."" United States v. Watts, 519 U.S. at 151-52. Tenth Circuit caselaw now adheres closely to the Supreme Court's results in Witte v. United States and   [*31] United States v. Watts. See United States v. Andrews, 447 F.3d 806, 810 (10th Cir. 2006)(applying Witte v.  United States' holding to affirm that a career-offender enhancement does not violate the Fifth Amendment's Double  Jeopardy Clause). In United States v. Banda, 168 F. App'x 284 (10th Cir. 2006)(unpublished), the Tenth Circuit  rejected a defendant's argument that it was ""structural error"" for a district court to find sentencing factors ""by a  preponderance of the evidence rather than the jury applying a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard."" 168 F. App'x  at 290. The Tenth Circuit explained that ""'[i]t is now universally accepted that judge-found facts by themselves do  not violate the Sixth Amendment. Instead, the constitutional error was the court's reliance on judge-found facts to  enhance the defendant's sentence mandatorily.'"" 168 F. App'x at 290 (quoting United States v. Lauder, 409 F.3d  1254, 1269 (10th Cir. 2005)). In United States v. Coleman, the defendant appealed the district court's sentence enhancement for firearms  possession after he was convicted of conspiracy to possess and possession of a controlled substance with intent to  distribute but was acquitted of using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. See 947  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *28 Page 11 of 33   F.2d at 1428. The Tenth Circuit acknowledged that courts had taken various positions on whether a sentence may  be enhanced for firearms possession despite a defendant's acquittal on firearms charges. See 947 F.2d at 1428-29  (citing United States v. Duncan, 918 F.2d 647, 652 (6th Cir. 1990) [*32] (""[A]n acquittal on a firearms carrying  charge leaves ample room for a district court to find by the preponderance of the evidence that the weapon was  possessed during the drug offense.""); United States v. Rodriguez, 741 F. Supp. 12, 13-14 (D.D.C. 1990)(Green,  J.)(refusing to apply 2-level enhancement for firearms possession, because ""[t]o add at least 27 months to the  sentence for a charge of which the defendant was found not guilty violates the constitutional principle of due  process and the ban against double jeopardy"")). Without discussion related to the standard of proof a sentencing court should use to make factual findings, the  Tenth Circuit held that the district court did not err in enhancing the defendant's sentence for possession of a  firearm. See United States v. Coleman, 947 F.2d at 1429. The Tenth Circuit based its conclusion on evidence that:  (i) individuals at the arrest scene handled the weapons at will; (ii) the weapons were handled at will by individuals  who lived at the house; and (iii) the weapons were kept for the protection of conspiracy participants and the  narcotics involved. See 947 F.2d at 1429. The Tenth Circuit summarized that, in reviewing relevant federal case  law, it found ""persuasive the decisions that have allowed a sentencing court to consider trial evidence that was  applicable [*33]  to a charge upon which the defendant was acquitted."" 947 F.2d at 1429. In United States v. Washington, the defendant argued that the United States needed to prove drug quantities used  as relevant conduct to establish a defendant's offense level by clear-and-convincing evidence, rather than by a  preponderance of the evidence. See 11 F.3d at 1512. The defendant objected to his sentencing, because the drug  quantity that the district court considered as relevant conduct, and which the court found by a preponderance of the  evidence, increased his Guidelines sentencing range from 210-262 months to life in prison. See 11 F.3d at 1515.  The defendant argued ""that because the additional drug quantities effectively resulted in a life sentence a higher  standard of proof should be required."" 11 F.3d at 1515. Although the Tenth Circuit in United States v. Washington  ""recognize[d] the strong arguments that relevant conduct causing a dramatic increase in sentence ought to be  subject to a higher standard of proof,"" it held that ""the Due Process Clause does not require sentencing facts in the  ordinary case to be proved by more than a preponderance standard."" 11 F.3d at 1516 (citing McMillan v.  Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 84, 106 S. Ct. 2411, 91 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1986)). See United States v. Sangiovanni, 2014  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122201, 2014 WL 4347131, at *22-26 (concluding that a sentencing court can cross reference  from the Guidelines that correspond to the defendant's [*34]  crime of conviction to the Guidelines for another, more  harshly punished crime, if it can be established by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant committed  the more serious crime); United States v. Cervantes-Chavez, 59 F. Supp. 3d 1295, 1314-15 (D.N.M.  2014)(Browning, J.)(cross-referencing from the guideline for being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm to the  drug-possession guideline after finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant committed a drug- possession crime). The Court previously has held that it may consider a defendant's refusal to answer questions for the PSR, while not  drawing an adverse inference from the refusal. See United States v. Goree, No. CR 11-0285 JB, 2012 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 22557, 2012 WL 592869, at *11 (D.N.M. 2012)(Browning, J.). The Court also has held that, although it can  consider a defendant's silence about information regarding herself or others engaging in criminal conduct, it will not  rely on that silence to increase the defendant's sentence. See United States v. Chapman, No. CR 11-0904 JB,  2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91611, 2012 WL 2574814, at *13 n.5 (D.N.M. 2012)(Browning, J.). Finally, the Court has  held that a defendant's ""aggression towards other individuals, and the murder he may have attempted to  orchestrate while incarcerated,"" is relevant information [*35]  which the Court can consider in fashioning a proper  sentence. United States v. Romero, No. CR 09-1253 JB, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 179914, 2012 WL 6632493, at *23  (D.N.M. Dec. 6, 2012)(Browning, J.). See United States v. Tapia, No. CR 12-3012 JB, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  205705, 2017 WL 6417610, at *10-15 (D.N.M. Dec. 14, 2017)(Browning, J.). ANALYSIS 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *31 Page 12 of 33   Many of Williams' Objections are based on his argument that the Court cannot rely on the PSR's factual summary,  because there is insufficient evidence that Williams was aware of Baker's actions. See, e.g., First Objections at 4  (""There is no[] evidence in discovery that Mr. Williams was aware of any sexual activity between Jane Doe 7 and  Mr. Baker.""). Conduct's relevance to Williams' sentence does not necessarily depend, however, on Williams'  awareness at the time the conduct occurred. Accordingly, the Court generally overrules the First Objections. The  Court similarly concludes that the PSR properly cross references U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1, because Williams' offense  involved conduct that 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) describes -- threatening or placing the victim in fear that any person will  be subject to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping. Next, the Court concludes that § 2A3.1(b)(5)'s 4-level  enhancement is proper, because Baker, brandishing a firearm, forced Jane Doe 2 to get [*36]  into a car with him  and Williams in Albuquerque and drove her to Colorado Springs, which amounts to abduction. The Court further  concludes that § 3A1.3's 2-level enhancement applies to Williams' offense level, because Williams aided Baker in  forcibly preventing sex workers from leaving Baker, including by standing guard outside the victims' hotel rooms.  Next, the Court concludes that Williams is substantially less culpable then the average participant in Baker's  criminal enterprise such that § 3B1.2's 4-level adjustment is proper. Last, the Court concludes that a § 2A3.1(b)(4)'s  2-level enhancement does not apply, because Williams' victim did not sustain serious bodily injury. Accordingly, the  Court sustains in part and overrules in part the First Objections and the Second Objections. I. THE PSR'S FACTUAL SUMMARY IS MOSTLY ACCURATE, AND WILLIAMS NEED NOT BE AWARE OF ALL  OF BAKER'S ACTIONS FOR THOSE ACTIONS TO FACTOR INTO WILLIAMS' OFFENSE CONDUCT. The primary argument that Williams advances in the First Objections is that he was unaware of several of Baker's  criminal actions, and so those actions should not be included in the PSR's summary of Williams' offense. The Court  concludes that, while Williams' knowledge [*37]  or lack thereof is relevant to his sentence, most of Baker's actions  against which Williams lodges his Objections are foreseeably within the scope and in furtherance of Baker,  Grandberry, and Williams' jointly undertaken criminal activity. Accordingly, the Court generally overrules the First  Objections. A. THE UNITED STATES MUST DEMONSTRATE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY  CONSIDERED BAKER THE MOST ACTIVE TRAFFICKER IN ALBUQUERQUE. Williams objects to the PSR's ¶ 11, at 8, to the extent that it characterizes Baker as ""the most active trafficker in  Albuquerque."" PSR ¶ 11, at 8. See First Objections at 1-2. Williams says that discovery ""suggest[s] a limited  number of potential victims"" and so contradicts the PSR's characterization. First Objections at 1. Williams also  complains that he has not received ""any statistical analysis that would support this statement,"" which would ""require  expert knowledge and testimony."" First Objections at 2. Williams further objects to the PSR's statement that, ""[l]ike  most victims of human trafficking, [Baker's] victims were afraid of him and were hesitant to cooperate with law  enforcement due to fear of retaliation."" PSR ¶ 11, at 8. See First Objections at 2. Williams avers that this statement  ""would require extensive expert testimony [*38]  concerning psychological issues,"" and Williams contends that law  enforcement spoke with ""several . . . purported witness"" who ""often readily spoke with law enforcement."" Second  Objections at 2. The PSR states that the United States Department of Homeland Security (""DHS"") ""considered Baker to be the most  active trafficker in Albuquerque."" PSR ¶ 11, at 8. The PSR thus does not assert that Baker was the most active  trafficker in Albuquerque, but rather that DHS considered him so. The question is thus whether there is sufficient  evidence that DHS held this opinion of Baker. The United States says that a DHS special agent, whom the United  States describes as ""a sex trafficking expert,"" ""will testify that this was his perception at the time he was  investigating this case."" First Response at 1. The Tenth Circuit has long held that ""sentencing facts in the 'ordinary  case' need only be proven by a preponderance."" United States v. Olsen, 519 F.3d 1096, 1105 (10th Cir.  2008)(quoting United States v. Washington, 11 F.3d 1510, 1516 (10th Cir. 1993)). Here, the Court will require the  United States to present the DHS witness, because the United States' characterization of what the DHS witness will  say is not reliable evidence that Baker was the most active sex trafficker in Albuquerque. See Fed. R. Crim. P.  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *35 Page 13 of 33   32(i)(3)(B); United States v. Vigil, 476 F. Supp. 2d 1231, 1245 (D.N.M. 2007)(Browning, J.), aff'd, 523 F.3d 1258  (10th Cir. 2008)(noting that courts may rely [*39]  upon reliable hearsay, so long as the evidence meets the  preponderance-of-the-evidence standard). The United States offers no evidence, other than a promise to have the  DHS agent testify, to support the PSR's description. Accordingly, the Court sustains the Objection and, unless the  United States presents the DHS witness, the PSR will be amended to omit the USPO's characterization of DHS'  views of Baker. B. BAKER'S ADVERTISEMENTS IN OTHER STATES IS NOT RELEVANT TO WILLIAMS' OFFENSE  CONDUCT, BECAUSE THAT ACTIVITY IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF WILLIAMS' AGREEMENT. Williams next objects to the PSR's ¶ 12, at 8, which provides: ""Baker was known to utilize Backpage.com to post  advertisements in New Mexico and throughout the United States for commercial sex services, including in Texas,  Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, Illinois, Tennessee, Alabama, Missouri, Kansas, and Virginia."" PSR ¶ 12, at 8. Williams  does not assert that this information is inaccurate, but rather that ""[t]hese appear to be references to separate  offenses and/or conspiracies in which Mr. Williams was not involved. Mr. Williams' conduct should be limited to the  admitted conduct in New Mexico and Colorado."" First Objections at 2. The United States does not [*40]  respond  directly to Williams' Objection, asserting instead that the ""statement is accurate, and should remain."" First  Response at 2. The USPO more directly responds and states: ""The information is necessary to show the full scope  of the defendant's conduct, and the conduct of other defendants, as it pertains to their ongoing and jointly  undertaken sex trafficking activity."" Addendum at 2. The information is relevant to Williams' offense. Under U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1), relevant conduct in a jointly  undertaken criminal activity is ""all acts and omissions of others"" that were: (i) within the scope of the jointly  undertaken activity, (ii) in furtherance of that criminal activity, and (iii) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that  criminal activity. U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B). In the Guidelines application notes, the United States Sentencing  Commission emphasizes that these requirements are conjunctive and so ""the scope of the criminal activity jointly  undertaken by the defendant . . . is not necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy."" U.S.S.G. §  1B1.3 note 2. The United States Sentencing Commission clarifies that a sentencing court must ""first determine the  scope of the criminal activity the particular defendant agreed to jointly undertake,"" adding [*41]  that ""the conduct of  others that was not in furtherance of the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant, or was not reasonably  foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity, is not relevant conduct under this provision."" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3  note 2. The application note provides a hypothetical scenario of two defendants agreeing to commit a robbery and,  during the course of that robbery, the first defendant assaults a victim. See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3 note 3. The  Guidelines provide that the second defendant is accountable for the assault, ""even if the second defendant had not  agreed to the assault and had cautioned the first defendant to be careful not to hurt anyone,"" because the assault is  foreseeably within the scope, and in furtherance, of the jointly undertaken activity. U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3 note 3.  Similarly, if a defendant is one of ten persons that a principal defendant hired to off-load a ship containing drugs, the  defendant is accountable for the entire ship's contraband. See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3 note 4(A)(i). The United States  Sentencing Commission provides that the defendant is accountable for the contraband regardless of his or her  knowledge of the extent of the criminal activity. See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3 note 4(A)(i). Here, Williams pled guilty to one count of aiding and abetting the coercion [*42]  of another to travel in interstate  commerce to engage in prostitution. See Plea Agreement ¶ 8, at 3-4. As the United States Court of Appeals for  the Eleventh Circuit has explained in United States v. Blanc, 146 F.3d 847 (11th Cir. 1998), § 1B1.3(a)(2)'s purpose  is ""to take account of a 'pattern of misconduct that cannot readily be broken into discrete identifiable units that are  meaningful for purposes of sentencing,'"" and where ""the conduct is subject to meaningful subdivision into wholly  discrete and identifiable units,"" it is not relevant for Guidelines purposes. 146 F.3d at 852-53 (quoting United States  v. Maxwell, 34 F.3d 1006, 1010 (11th Cir. 1994)). Here, the offense to which Williams admits involved operations in  two states. See Plea Agreement ¶ 9, at 4. Williams agreed to help Baker maintain a trafficking enterprise in New  Mexico and Colorado that involved posting advertisements. See Plea Agreement ¶ 9, at 4. Although it may have  been foreseeable that Baker would post advertisements in more than one state, there is no evidence that Williams  agreed to such a broad geographical operation. Baker's additional actions posting advertisements in other states  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *38 Page 14 of 33   not within the scope of Williams' jointly undertaken criminal activity. Further, there is no other evidence of Baker's  activities in states other than New Mexico and Colorado, [*43]  so activity in other states may be separated without  eroding the PSR's narrative of the conduct in New Mexico and Colorado. Accordingly, the Court sustains the  Objection. C. BAKER'S USE OF A HANDGUN IN COERCING JANE DOE 2 IS RELEVANT TO WILLIAMS' OFFENSE,  REGARDLESS OF WILLIAMS' SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE. Williams next objects to the PSR's ¶ 14, at 9, to the extent that the PSR says that Baker showed Jane Doe that he  carried a handgun when he picked up Jane Doe 2 on Central Avenue in Albuquerque. See First Objections at 3.  Williams says that he admits to aiding in ""persuading [Jane Doe 2] to get in the vehicle,"" but that he was ""unaware  any weapons were displayed."" First Objections at 3 (emphasis in First Objections). Williams notes that the United  States has not recovered or seized the firearm in question, and further asserts that ""his aversion to firearms is real  and visceral,"" because his significant other died from a gunshot wound in the 1990s. First Objections at 3. Williams  says that he would ""not have willingly involved himself in any activity with a firearm."" First Objections at 3. Williams  thus avers that the evidence on which the PSR relies -- Jane Doe 2's statements -- is not reliable. See First  Objections at 3. The United States responds that ""victim after victim in this case recounts [*44]  co-Defendant Baker  possessing a firearm."" First Response at 2. The United States further notes that Williams committed armed robbery  with a handgun in 1993 and that the PSR documents that Williams ""has 38 contacts with law enforcement,"" several  of which ""involved the use of a weapon."" First Response at 2-3. The United States thus avers that ""it is a very hard  sell to present Williams as ignorant to the fact that a gun was used regularly in this crime."" First Response at 3. The Court agrees with the United States that Baker's use of a firearm is relevant to Williams' sentence -- it is  probative of whether and the extent to which Williams' offense involved coercion. As a preliminary matter,  however, both parties err in using propensity evidence to advance their positions. An ""offense,"" as the Guidelines  defines, includes the ""offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under § 1B1.3"" United States v. Tagore, 158  F.3d 1124, 1128 (10th Cir. 1998). Section 1B1.1 of the Guidelines provides that sentencing courts shall calculate a  defendant's Guidelines sentence ""on the basis of"" ""all acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled,  commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant."" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a) and (a)(1)(A). Section  1B1.3 embodies the principle that the sentence should reflect the offense's [*45]  seriousness, and so courts should  consider all conduct relevant to determining that seriousness. See United States v. Allen, 488 F.3d 1244, 1255  (10th Cir. 2007). The Guidelines thus ""allow courts to consider conduct which is not formally charged or is not an  element of the offense of conviction."" United States v. Tagore, 158 F.3d at 1128. The conduct that a sentencing  court may consider, therefore, ""comprises more, often much more, than the offense of conviction itself, and may  include uncharged and even acquitted conduct."" United States v. Allen, 488 F.3d at 1254-55. The Court may  consider only relevant conduct, however, and this ""relatedness principle is fundamental because of our commitment  to sentencing based on the seriousness of the actual offense proven or admitted."" United States v. Allen, 488 F.3d  at 1255. This limiting principle is based on the Sixth Amendment: ""If the considered conduct has nothing to do with  the offense of conviction, the court is effectively sentencing a defendant for a crime that was never proved to the  jury . . . ."" United States v. Allen, 488 F.3d at 1255. The parties make propensity arguments. Rule 404 of the Federal Rule of Evidence's distinction between propensity  and ""another purpose,"" Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(2), is analogous to the Guidelines' distinction between an offense's  characteristics and an offender's characteristics. See United States v. Allen, 488 F.3d at 1254; Douglas A. Berman,  Conceptualizing Blakely, 17 Fed. Sent'g Rep. 89, 89-90 (2004)(distinguishing between offense characteristics and  offender characteristics). [*46]  Relevant conduct determines the overall offense level, while the defendant's  characteristics relating to the risk of recidivism -- typically past criminal conduct -- relate to the defendant's criminal  history category. See U.S.S.G. §§ 1B1.3 (relevant conduct), 4A1.1, 4A1.3(a)(2)(E) (criminal history). Conduct related to the offense of conviction is treated as an offense characteristic, whereas past criminal  convictions are generally treated as an offender characteristic, and taken into account by assigning a criminal  history score. . . . Future dangerousness also is an offender characteristic. Because evaluation of future  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *42 Page 15 of 33   dangerousness could otherwise veer into speculation, it generally is evaluated on the basis of the defendant's  recidivism, which takes into account prior convictions and prior similar adult misconduct. United States  Sentencing Guidelines Manual §§ 4A1.1, 4A1.3(a)(2)(E). United States v. Allen, 488 F.3d at 1254. The United States thus errs in relying on Williams past crimes -- which happened almost thirty years ago -- in  contending that Williams must have been aware that Baker carried and used a firearm in intimidating or coercing his  victims. The United States makes what amounts to a rule 404(b) argument that, because Williams used a firearm in  his previous crimes, it is probable that [*47]  he was fine with Baker using a firearm here. See First Response at 3.  Under rule 404(b), ""[e]vidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person's character in  order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character."" Fed. R. Evid.  404(b)(1). Similarly, Williams argues that, because his significant other was murdered with a firearm, Williams  would not knowingly associate with anyone who uses a firearm. See First Objections at 3. Both parties' arguments run counter to rule 404(b) and are not based on information that is sufficiently reliable to be  probative. See U.S.S.G. § 6A1.3 (""In resolving any dispute concerning a factor important to the sentencing  determination, the court may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of  evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable  accuracy.""). Moreover, a preponderance of the evidence -- without relying on propensity arguments -- demonstrates  that Baker and Grandberry routinely carried and used firearms in maintaining their control over the victims. Jane  Doe 2 reported that Baker displayed a firearm when he told her to get into his car. See PSR ¶ 14, [*48]  at 9;  Addendum at 3; First Response at 3. There are also several other reports of Baker and Grandberry displaying  firearms to intimidate their victims. See PSR ¶ 23, at 10 (""Most victims reported Baker and codefendants usually  possessed a firearm. The defendants used physical force and violence, threats of violence, and sexual violence."").  Baker thus frequently used a firearm in service of a criminal enterprise which Williams agreed to further. In this way, Williams' specific knowledge that Baker held and brandished a firearm when he picked up Jane Doe 2  is not necessary for those actions to factor into Williams' offense conduct. See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3 note  4(A)(i)(providing that a defendant who agrees to further a principal's scheme is accountable for the principal's  foreseeable actions ""regardless of his knowledge or lack of knowledge""). The standard under § 1B1.3 is whether  the codefendant's actions are ""within the scope of the agreement and reasonably foreseeable to [the defendant].""  United States v. Arias-Santos, 39 F.3d 1070, 1078 (10th Cir. 1994). Conversely, a defendant's mere knowledge of a  codefendant's criminal conduct is not sufficient. ""The scope requirement is key: it means that just knowing of  coconspirators' illicit activities, without more, will not suffice to attribute such activities [*49]  to a defendant unless  the activities are also within the agreement's scope."" United States v. Biglow, 635 F. App'x 398, 401 (10th Cir.  2015)(unpublished). Accordingly, defendants are responsible for a codefendant's criminal conduct that was ""in  furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity"" and ""reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal  activity."" United States v. Figueroa-Labrada, 720 F.3d 1258, 1265 (10th Cir. 2013). Baker's use of a firearm in picking up Jane Doe 2 was reasonably foreseeable and in furtherance of jointly  undertaken activity in which Williams agreed to participate. Williams admits, in the Plea Agreement, that he and  Baker ""made clear to [Jane Doe 2] that she was to get in our vehicle."" Plea Agreement ¶ 9, at 4. Further, Williams  admits that, before he and Baker picked up Jane Doe 2, Williams knew that they planned to take her to Colorado  Springs to engage in sex work. See Plea Agreement ¶ 9, at 4. Williams thus agreed to assist in conduct that  required overcoming Jane Doe 2's resistance. That Baker would use a firearm in overcoming Jane Doe 2's  resistance is thus foreseeable and in furtherance of the scheme. See United States v. Figueroa-Labrada, 720 F.3d  at 1265 (noting importance of determining ""the scope of the specific agreement the individual defendant joined in  relation to the conspiracy as a whole,"" regardless of the [*50]  defendant's specific knowledge of the coconspirator's  planned actions); U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3 note 2 (providing several hypothetical applications of this rule). The Court thus  overrules Williams' Objection. Nonetheless, the Court notes that the United States has not offered reliable evidence  that Williams was specifically aware of Baker's use of the firearm. Accordingly, the PSR's summary of Williams'  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *46 Page 16 of 33   version of the offense should be amended to include Williams' assertion there is no evidence that he was aware of  the firearm. D. BAKER'S SEXUAL ABUSE FALLS WITHIN WILLIAMS' OFFENSE CONDUCT. Williams next objects to the PSR's ¶ 17, at 9, which discusses Baker's repeated sexual assault of Jane Doe 2 in  Colorado Springs as well as Baker supplying Jane Doe 2 with methamphetamine. See First Objections at 3.  Williams says that it is ""inappropriate"" to rely on these assaults in determining his sentence, because the assaults  are not a "" known part of any joint activity in which Mr. Williams was involved."" First Objections at 3. The United  States responds that the PSR's narrative is proper, because it was Williams ""job to guard [Jane Doe 2] while Baker  was away,"" typically when Baker ""would make trips from Colorado back to Albuquerque to pick up narcotics.""  First [*51]  Response at 3. The USPO adds that it will include Williams' assertion in the PSR's section summarizing  Williams' version of the events. See Addendum at 2-3. The USPO avers, however, that Baker's assault and  drugging of Jane Doe 2 is sufficiently related to criminal activity that Williams specifically agreed to further. See  Addendum at 3. Baker's criminal conduct undoubtedly involved despicable acts meant to exert and maintain control over his victims.  See, e.g., PSR ¶¶ 45-48, at 12-13. Baker targeted vulnerable women -- such as women addicted to drugs or  without homes -- and lured them into his control with promises of drugs and shelter. See PSR ¶ 23, at 10. Baker  then used intimidation and force -- including sexual violence -- to keep his victims in line, and drugs to maintain  their dependence on him. See, e.g., PSR ¶ 46, at 13. Williams acted as the scheme's low-level enforcer. See PSR  ¶ 24, at 11. When Baker was not around, Williams stood guard outside the women's hotel rooms -- not only to  protect them from immediate harm, but also to prevent their fleeing. See PSR ¶ 46, at 13. One victim reports that  Williams ""guarded the victims' movements."" PSR ¶ 46, at 13. As with Baker's use of a firearm, Baker sexually [*52]   assaulting victims was a means to control those victims, and Williams knowingly assisted Baker in maintaining that  control by guarding their movements when Baker was not around. In an enterprise that involved controlling and  using women's bodies, it was reasonably foreseeable that Baker would assault women he was forcing to do sex  work to ensure their subservience. Those assaults took place within criminal conduct in which Williams was a  knowing participant. See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3. The Court will, however, direct that the PSR's summary of Williams'  version of events reflects Williams' statement that he was unaware of these assaults, because, per the PSR,  Williams' presence with the victims typically corresponded with Baker's absence. See PSR ¶ 46, at 13. Accordingly,  although the Court directs that the PSR's summary of Williams' version of events be amended, Baker's assaults are  properly included within Williams' offense conduct, and the Court overrules the Objection. E. THE PSR PROPERLY CHARACTERIZES JANE DOE 2's FLEEING AS AN ESCAPE. Williams next objects to the PSR's characterization of Jane Doe 2's leaving Baker as an escape. See First  Objections at 3-4. Williams contends that he interviewed ""workers at other hotels in [*53]  the Albuquerque area  familiar with this case, and those individuals have verified that women were free to come and go from the property.""  First Objections at 3. Williams further contends that women who worked for Baker engaged in sex work before and  after working for Baker, which Williams contends demonstrates that Jane Doe 2 did not need to escape from  working for Baker. See First Objections at 4. The United States responds that Williams' ""vague[]"" statement about  employees at Albuquerque hotels ""means nothing."" First Response at 3-4. ""To the contrary,"" the United States  avers, ""a hotel worker will say they never observed such a thing, especially when asked by a lawyer or a lawyer's  investigator,"" because [s]uch admissions would be very bad for business."" First Response at 4. The United States  further contends that, in ""trafficking culture, not a lot of victims are going to make a scene in public to expose their  abuse,"" and the United States says that the DHS agent ""will testify that there would likely be very dire  consequences for such behavior."" First Response at 4. As for Williams' contention that other workers said that they  ""could have left,"" First Objections at 4, the United States avers that these women likely meant that, while they  ""literally"" [*54]  could have left, they then would have been ""homeless, without food or drugs, and likely face a brutal  beating on their way out."" First Response at 4. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *50 Page 17 of 33   The Tenth Circuit has ""long held that sentencing facts in the 'ordinary case' need only be proven by a  preponderance."" United States v. Olsen, 519 F.3d at 1105 (quoting United States v. Washington, 11 F.3d at 1516).  Here, Williams objects not to the fact that Jane Doe 2 left Baker with another sex worker's help, but rather the  PSR's characterization of Jane Doe 2's leaving as an escape. See First Objections at 3-4. The fact at issue, then, is  whether Jane Doe 2 was free to leave Baker's employment at any time. ""Escape"" means ""to get free from a  dangerous  or  confining  situation.""  Merriam-Webster  Dictionary,  ""Escape,""  https://www.merriam- webster.com/thesaurus/escape (last accessed June 20, 2020). Here, there is sufficient evidence that, when Jane  Doe 2 left Baker's employment, she was getting free from a dangerous or confining situation. Williams pled guilty to  assisting Baker in forcing Jane Doe 2 -- a complete stranger, someone whom they had just seen waiting at a bus  stop -- to get into their car and taking Jane Doe 2 from Albuquerque to Colorado Springs to do sex work for Baker.  See Plea Agreement ¶ 9, at 4. Jane Doe 2 reports that Baker [*55]  ""forced"" her to engage in fifteen to twenty dates  in Colorado Springs. See PSR ¶ 17, at 9. Moreover, Baker required Jane Doe 2 to give him all her work's earnings.  See PSR ¶ 17, at 9. When Jane Doe 2 did not give Baker her earnings, he abused her, including, on at least one  occasion, raping her. See PSR ¶ 17, at 9. Jane Doe 2 was thus in an unfamiliar city, forced to work but unable to  earn money for herself. See PSR ¶¶ 16-17, at 9. These circumstances are sufficient to characterize Jane Doe 2's  leaving as an escape. This escape is also properly included within Williams' offense narrative, because he assisted  Baker in maintaining control over Jane Doe 2 by guarding her movements when Baker was not around. See PSR ¶  17, at 9. The Court thus overrules the Objection. F. THAT BAKER'S ORGANIZATION WAS EXTENSIVE IS NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO WILLIAMS. Williams next objects to the PSR's characterization of Baker's trafficking operation as ""extensive."" First Objections  at 4. Williams says that he ""had no knowledge of an 'extensive organization' and has been given no basis for a  claim of who may or may not be 'the most significant sex trafficker in Albuquerque.'"" First Objections at 4 (quoting  PSR ¶ 23, at 10). The United States disagrees and [*56]  asserts that Baker's ""victims were numerous."" First  Response at 4. The United States further says that ""Grandberry and Williams aided and abetted Baker in his  extensive organization that included the three of them, and the numerous women they trafficked."" First Response at  4. The United States says that the DHS agent will testify that Baker's organization is properly considered extensive.  See First Response at 4. The Court sustains the Objection. This instance is one in which Williams' knowledge is relevant. A defendant's  accountability for others' acts depends on the scope of the defendant's agreement: ""Acts of others that were not  within the scope of the defendant's agreement, even if those acts were known or reasonably foreseeable to the  defendant, are not relevant conduct under subsection (a)(1)(B)."" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3 n.3(B). Williams agreed to assist  Baker in recruiting and maintaining control over sex workers in New Mexico and Colorado. As the Court concludes  below, Williams acted as a low-level enforcer in Baker's enterprise. While Baker's organization may have been  extensive -- the PSR's characterization suggests that it was -- there is insufficient evidence that Williams specifically  agreed to assist in an extensive [*57]  organization, rather than assisting Baker in more limited instances of the  organization's operations. See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3 n.3(B). Accordingly, the Court sustains the Objection. G. THE PSR'S INFORMATION ABOUT TOBI STANFILL AND CORNELIUS GALLOWAY IS RELEVANT TO  WILLIAMS' BACKGROUND, CHARACTER, AND CONDUCT. Williams next objects to a portion of the PSR's ¶ 44, at 13, which states that one of Baker's victims, who ""has since  been murdered and is suspected to have been sold by Adonis Baker to Cornelius Galloway (another federal  defendant convicted of sex trafficking during this time, case number 17CR1235WJ),"" introduced Jane Doe 7 to  Baker. PSR ¶ 44, at 13. See First Objections at 4. Williams says that he ""has not been provided with discovery in  relation to"" the other cited case ""to verify, or challenge, the information suggested."" First Objections at 4. Williams  says that, ""[i]f this information is material to sentencing, that discovery would qualify as Brady[ v. Maryland, 373  U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963)(""Brady""),] material and should have been disclosed in full to the  defense."" First Objections at 4. Williams also avers that ""there is no allegation that [he] was connected to"" Cornelius  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *54 Page 18 of 33   Galloway's activities, the individual to whom Baker ""sold"" Stanfill. PSR ¶ 44, at 13. See First Objections at 4. Last,  Williams argues that including [*58]  this allegation ""may unfairly prejudice him with the United States Bureau of  Prisons classification system."" First Objections at 4. The United States says that the PSR does not allege that  Williams is ""connected to the Galloway organization, or that he participated in any way with"" Stanfill's murder. First  Response at 5. The United States argues, however, that the PSR's ¶ 44, at 13, is ""necessary to explain how Jane  Doe 7 became introduced to Baker and ultimately Williams, who[m] she described as Baker's 'pimp partner.'"" First  Response at 5 (quoting Jane Doe 7). Although not necessary to resolve the Objection, the Court notes that there is no reason to suspect that the Stanfill- Galloway information is ""Brady material [that] should have been disclosed in full to the defense."" First Objections at  4. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution requires that the United States disclose to  the defendant any evidence that ""is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad  faith of the prosecution."" Brady, 373 U.S. at 87. The Supreme Court has extended the prosecution's disclosure  obligation to include evidence that is useful to the defense in impeaching government witnesses, even if the  evidence is not intrinsically exculpatory. See Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S. Ct. 763, 31 L. Ed. 2d 104  (1972); Douglas v. Workman, 560 F.3d 1156, 1172-73 (10th Cir. 2009)(""[N]o distinction is [*59]  recognized  between evidence that exculpates a defendant and 'evidence that the defense might have used to impeach the  [United States'] witnesses by showing bias and interest.'"" (quoting United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676, 105  S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985)); United States v. Abello-Silva, 948 F.2d 1168, 1179 (10th Cir.  1991)(""Impeachment evidence merits the same constitutional treatment as exculpatory evidence.""). The  prosecution's Brady obligations extend to the sentencing phase. See Brady, 373 U.S. at 87. The Fifth Amendment does not, however, ""require the prosecution to divulge every possible shred of evidence that  could conceivably benefit the defendant."" Smith v. Sec'y of N.M. Dep't of Corr., 50 F.3d 801, 823 (10th Cir. 1995).  Brady requires disclosure only of evidence that is both favorable to the accused, and ""material either to guilt or to  punishment."" Brady, 373 U.S. at 87. ""Evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the  evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different."" United States v.  Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682. See United States v. Allen, 603 F.3d 1202, 1215 (10th Cir. 2010). A ""reasonable  probability,"" in turn, is a ""probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome."" United States v. Bagley,  473 U.S. at 682 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Tenth Circuit has noted that ""[t]he mere possibility that  evidence is exculpatory does not satisfy the constitutional materiality standard."" United States v. Fleming, 19 F.3d  1325, 1331 (10th Cir. 1994). Here, Williams asserts that information about Galloway and Stanfill is ""material to sentencing"" and [*60]  so the  United States should have disclosed this information to Williams. First Objections at 4. Williams does not, however,  explain why this information is material to Williams' sentence. Williams does not contend that the Galloway-Stanfill  information is exculpatory. To the contrary, the United States contends that this information is necessary to paint a  full picture of the extent of Williams' culpability. See First Response at 5 (asserting that the PSR's ¶ 44, at 13, is  ""necessary to explain how Jane Doe 7 became introduced to Baker and ultimately Williams, who she described as  Baker's 'pimp partner.' T.S. and Jane Doe 7 were victimized by Baker and Williams at the same time. Therefore,  T.S. is relevant to this case and to Williams' participation."" (quoting Jane Doe 7)). The United States, therefore, had  no duty to disclose the Galloway/Stanfill information. Because there is no information suggesting that this  information is exculpatory, the United States had no duty to disclose it. See, e.g., United States v. Cooper, 654 F.3d  1104, 1120 (10th Cir. 2011); United States v. Page, 808 F.2d 723, 730 (10th Cir. 1987). The Court notes that ethical  rules require prosecutors to ""'disclose to the defense and to the tribunal all unprivileged mitigating information  known to the prosecutor, except when the prosecutor is relieved of this [*61]  responsibility by a protective order of  the tribunal.'"" Cone v. Bell, 556 U.S. 449, 470 n.15, 129 S. Ct. 1769, 173 L. Ed. 2d 701 (2009)(quoting Am. Bar  Ass'n Model Rules of Professional Conduct 3.8(d) (2008)). The Supreme Court has not, however, held that the Fifth  Amendment requires such disclosure. See Cone v. Bell, 556 U.S. at 470 n.15 (""Although the Due Process Clause  of the Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted by Brady, only mandates the disclosure of material evidence, the  obligation to disclose evidence favorable to the defense may arise more broadly under a prosecutor's ethical or  statutory obligations.""). Finally and most importantly, the United States says that it disclosed this information to  each Defendant before any of them pled guilty. See First Response at 4-5. There is thus no Brady issue here. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *57 Page 19 of 33   The portion of the PSR to which Williams objects is expressly listed as ""Offense Behavior not Part of Relevant  Conduct."" PSR ¶ 41, at 12. The information is thus not part of Relevant Conduct, but is part of Williams' Offense  Behavior. Neither the PSR nor the United States alleges that Williams has any connection to Galloway or Stanfill  apart from their mutual association with Baker. See Addendum at 5; First Response at 5. The Court has previously  overruled a defendant's objections to the information in a presentence report, under the section entitled  ""Offense [*62]  Behavior Not Part of Relevant Conduct,"" where the defendant argued that the information is not  pertinent to sentencing and ""takes into consideration uncharged allegations that other witnesses made."" United  States v. Sandoval, 506 F. Supp. 2d 582, 593 (D.N.M. 2007)(Browning, J.). The Court explained that ""it is proper for  the Court to consider this information to ascertain [the defendant] Sandoval's life and background."" 506 F. Supp. 2d  at 593. The Court noted that the USPO maintained that the information had sufficient ""indicia of reliability,"" and that  the information was necessary to fully gauge Sandoval's conduct within the brief time period during the charged  offenses were committed. 506 F. Supp. 2d at 593. Based upon U.S.S.G. § 1B1.4, 18 U.S.C. § 3661, United States  v. Watts, and Witte v. United States, the Court overruled Sandoval's objection and considered the information. See  United States v. Sandoval, 506 F. Supp. 2d at 593. ""No limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person  convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an  appropriate sentence."" 18 U.S.C. § 3661. The information about Galloway and Stanfill is relevant to determining the  nature of the Defendants' criminal enterprise. It is probative of the danger that the victims faced and the  cavalier, [*63]  cruel manner in which the Defendants treated their victims. See PSR ¶ 44, at 13 (providing that  Baker ""sold"" Stanfill to Galloway); id. ¶ 47, at 14 (providing that Baker ""sold"" another woman to a man in Phoenix,  Arizona, for $7,000.00). The information also demonstrates how Jane Doe 7 came to work for Baker and validates  her characterization of Williams as Baker's ""pimp partner."" PSR ¶ 44, at 13. The PSR's ¶ 44, at 13, is thus  ""information concerning [Williams'] background, character, and conduct."" 18 U.S.C. § 3661. See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.4  (""In determining the sentence to impose within the guideline range, or whether a departure from the guidelines is  warranted, the court may consider, without limitation, any information concerning the background, character and  conduct of the defendant, unless otherwise prohibited by law.""). The Supreme Court intends for district courts to  consider a defendant's real conduct when effectuating Congress' purposes set forth in the Sentencing Guidelines.  See United States v. Reyes-Vencomo, No. CR 11-2563 JB, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91614, 2012 WL 2574810, at *4  (D.N.M. June 26, 2012)(Browning, J.)(citing United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. at 250-51). The Supreme Court has  recognized that 18 U.S.C. § 3661 is an embodiment of the ""the longstanding principle that sentencing courts [*64]   have broad discretion to consider various kinds of information"" and that ""the Guidelines did not alter this aspect of  the sentencing court's discretion."" United States v. Watts, 519 U.S. at 151-52. Because the information is relevant  to Williams' background, character, and conduct, the Court overrules the Objection. H. IT IS RELEVANT THAT BAKER RAPED JANE DOE 7 AND THAT WILLIAMS GUARDED JANE DOE 7'S  MOVEMENTS WHEN BAKER WAS NOT AROUND. Williams objects to the PSR's narrative, also included in the ""Offense Behavior not Part of Relevant Conduct""  section, that says that: (i) Baker raped Jane Doe 7 ""approximately five times; (ii) Baker owned a handgun that he  kept in his apartment and the hotel rooms that he used; (iii) Jane Doe 7 had been to Baker's apartment in  Albuquerque, and Baker gave Jane Doe 7 a ""track phone""; (iv) Jane Doe 7 said that Williams ""often guarded the  victims' movements when baker was not there""; and (v) Jane Doe 7 described Grandberry as ""another one of  Baker's coconspirators, and [other coconspirators and victims] assisted in posting Backpage.com advertisements.""  PSR ¶ 46, at 13. See First Objections at 4. Williams says that Jane Doe 7's statement that Williams guarded her  when Baker was not around suggests that he ""would not be [*65]  aware"" of the activity that the PSR's ¶ 46, at 13,  describes. First Objections at 4. The United States says that it does not allege that Williams knew that Baker raped    2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *61 Page 20 of 33   Jane Doe 7, but the United States avers that, ""[c]learly, Williams was aware of something nefarious if it was his job  to guard Jane Doe 7 when Baker was not there."" First Response at 5. The PSR's portion to which Williams objects falls under the PSR's section entitled ""Offense Behavior Not Part of  Relevant Conduct."" PSR ¶ 41, at 11. The information is thus not part of Relevant Conduct, but is part of his Offense  Behavior. As with the previous Objection, the information about how Baker treated his victims, and the role that  Williams played in enforcing Baker's control over the victims, are relevant to Williams' ""background, character, and  conduct."" 18 U.S.C. § 3661. Moreover, Williams does not object to the information's veracity such that the Court  must ""rule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect  sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing."" Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(3)(B). Williams,  instead, asserts that he was unaware of Baker's rapes. These remarks do not satisfy Williams' ""affirmative  duty [*66]  to make a showing that the information in the PSR was unreliable and articulate the reasons why the  facts contained therein [are] untrue or inaccurate."" United States v. Rodriguez-Delma, 456 F.3d 1246, 1253 (10th  Cir. 2006). Williams has pointed to no facts which call into question the accuracy of the PSR's ¶ 46, at 13. The  Court thus overrules the Objection. I. SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE SUPPORTS CONCLUDING THAT BAKER THREATENED JANE DOE 7 BY  CALLING TO POLICE TO REPORT THAT SHE HAD ABANDONED HER BABY. Williams next objects to the PSR's ¶ 47, at 13. See First Objections at 5. That paragraph states: In January 2017, Baker called the Albuquerque Police Department (APD) and reported Jane Doe 7 as  abandoning her child when she refused to work on East Central. Her son was at Baker's apartment at the time.  Baker told her that if she did not make money for him, he could ""make money off her baby."" APD and [a social  worker from the New Mexico Children, Youth, and Families Department (""CYFD"")] responded to Baker's  apartment. By the time APD arrived, Baker had already taken the child to another location. CYFD ultimately  removed [Jane Doe 7's] child from her care. This account is corroborated by an APD report and lapel videos  where [Jane Doe 7] is telling her friend and her mom that Baker forcibly [*67]  took her baby and told her she  needs to make a certain amount of money to get the baby back. Leotha Williams was present during this  incident as well. PSR ¶ 47, at 13. Williams says that the paragraph ""misstate[s]"" APD's investigation. First Objections at 5. Williams  argues that the PSR's assertion that Baker took [Jane Doe 7's] child is ""based on a report to police that came  through multiple layers of hearsay, not from Jane Doe 7 herself,"" and that Jane Doe 7 has ""refused to speak with or  meet with law enforcement."" First Objections at 5. Williams further contends that Jane Doe 7 ""was a long-time drug  abuser and sex worker with significant credibility concerns, including continuously abandoning her children in favor  of drugs and sex work,"" and that ""she eventually lost her children through CYFD proceedings unconnected to Mr.  Williams."" First Objections at 5. Williams then asserts that Baker calling APD to report the child's abandonment  ""undercut[s]"" Jane Doe 7's story about abduction. First Objections at 5. The United States elaborates on the PSR's ¶ 47, at 13. See First Response at 5. The United States says that, in  January, 2017, Jane Doe 7 told her friend that Baker ""was holding her baby as leverage to cause her to walk the  track as a prostitute."" First Response [*68]  at 5. The United States says that this friend told APD officers that she  went to Baker's apartment to check on the baby and that the baby was unattended. See First Response at 5-6. The  United States says that Baker then told the friend that she ""'need[ed] to bring [Jane Doe 7] here'"" and that the friend  told APD officers her belief that, if Jane Doe 7 went to Baker's apartment, he would assault Jane Doe 7. First  Response at 6 (quoting Baker). The United States also says that the friend told APD officers her belief that Baker  held the baby, because Jane Doe 7 refused to work on Central Avenue in Albuquerque the previous night. See First  Response at 6. The United States says that the friend also ""described . . . another male individual who was there,  and stated she believed they were working together."" First Response at 6. The United States then relates that an  APD officer called Jane Doe 7 but that Jane Doe 7's statements are inaudible in the officer's lapel camera footage.  See First Response at 6. The United States asserts, however, that ""one can infer what she reported from the  officer's responses,"" which reveal that Jane Doe 7 said that she was working for Baker, and that Baker kicked [*69]   2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *65 Page 21 of 33   Jane Doe 7 out a car and took her baby against her will. First Response at 6. The United States says that, when the  APD officer returned to Baker's apartment, they met Baker and Williams, who wore ""a baby-blue three-piece suit,  with a tie and white shoes."" First Response at 6. The United States reports that Baker referred to Jane Doe 7 as a  girlfriend and that he had left Jane Doe 7's baby with her sister. See First Response at 7. According to the United  States, Jane Doe 7 spoke with DHS agents a year later and said that Baker threatened her by warning that, ""if she  did not make money for him, he could make money off her baby,"" and that this threat compelled her to continue  working for Baker. First Response at 7. The United States acknowledges that Jane Doe 7 struggles with drug addiction and with caring for her children, but  asserts that Baker used these struggles to ""exploit her."" First Response at 7. According to the United States, Baker  did not call APD out of concern that Jane Doe 7 had abandoned her baby, but rather as ""retaliation for her not doing  what he wanted her to do,"" and so his calling the police ""does not 'undercut' anything."" First Response at 7 (quoting  First Objections at 5). The United [*70]  States, instead, asserts that Baker's APD call ""is substantive evidence of  him using threats and coercion to cause [Jane Doe 7] to engage in prostitution,"" and that ""all that time, Leotha  Williams was there too."" First Response at 7. That Williams makes a factual contention does not necessarily require the Court to ""rule on the dispute or  determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will  not consider the matter in sentencing."" Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(3)(B). To invoke a district court's rule 32 fact-finding  obligation, a defendant is required to make ""specific allegations"" of factual inaccuracy. United States v. Rodriguez- Delma, 456 F.3d at 1253. Accord United States v. Jim, 877 F. Supp. 2d 1018, 2012 WL 2574807, at *23 (D.N.M.  2012)(Browning, J.). Williams' bases for questioning the PSR's narrative are that it relies on hearsay and that Jane  Doe 7 is a drug addict and a sex worker and so is not credible. See First Objections at 5. These remarks do not  satisfy Williams' ""affirmative duty to make a showing that the information in the PSR was unreliable and articulate  the reasons why the facts contained therein [were] untrue or inaccurate."" United States v. Rodriguez-Delma, 456  F.3d at 1253. ""The fact that a defendant has objected to the ultimate conclusions drawn by the PSR . . . does not  necessarily imply that a [*71]  'controverted matter' exists."" United States v. Rodriguez-Delma, 456 F.3d at 1253  (citing United States v. Murray, 82 F.3d 361, 363 (10th Cir. 1996)). To the extent that Williams' objects to the  narrative, the court may rely upon reliable hearsay information, so long as the evidence meets the preponderance- of-the-evidence standard. See United States v. Vigil, 476 F. Supp. 2d 1231,1245 (D.N.M. 2007)(Browning J.);  U.S.S.G. § 6A1.3 (stating that a court may rely on relevant information when resolving a dispute concerning a factor  important to sentencing, even if the information is not admissible at trial, ""provided that the information has sufficient  indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy""). Here, the United States cites APD investigative reports and  lapel camera footage that support the PSR's narrative. See First Response at 6. That footage shows that Williams  was present at Baker's apartment during the incident. See First Response at 6-7. Accordingly, contrary to Williams'  contention, the United States does not rely solely on Jane Doe 7's statements. Moreover, to the extent that the  United States relies on Jane Doe 7's statements, the fact that she struggles with drug addiction and is a sex worker  does not necessarily impugn her credibility, especially as compared to Williams' contention that uncharacteristic  concern for Baker's victims motivated his [*72]  call to APD. The evidence thus supports that Baker called APD and  CYFD to report that Williams had abandoned her child. Williams has not demonstrated ""that a controverted matter  exists."" United States v. Rodriguez-Delma, 456 F.3d at 1253. Williams thus has not met his ""affirmative duty to  make a showing that the information in the PSR was unreliable and articulate the reasons why the facts contained  therein [were] untrue or inaccurate."" United States v. Rodriguez-Delma, 456 F.3d at 1253. The information is also  relevant. The PSR describes an instance of Baker punishing his victims for not following his orders, and Williams  was present for at least part of the incident. Accordingly, the Court overrules the Objection. J. WILLIAMS' ASSERTION THAT HE WAS UNAWARE THAT BAKER ABUSED STANFILL IS NOT ENOUGH  TO STRIKE THAT ABUSE'S DESCRIPTION FROM THE PSR. Williams objects to the PSR's ¶¶ 48-48, at 13. See First Objections at 5. Those paragraphs state: 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *69 Page 22 of 33   [Jane Doe 7] stated Baker was often angry with Tob[i] Stanfill because she did not make enough money. [Jane  Doe 7] once witnessed Baker strike Stanfill in the head with a wooden chair leg. Baker would provide  methamphetamine to Stanfill, and all her earnings went to Baker. [Jane Doe 7] witnessed Baker physically attack [Jane Doe 4] in Denver during a commercial sex [*73]  work  trip. Baker was angry with Jane Doe 4 because she refused to work when she was getting her period. Baker  struck [Jane Doe 4] seven to eight times in the legs with a wooden luggage rack and broke her leg. This  happened in early June 2016, and [Jane Doe 4] had to be treated at a hospital. This information corroborates  prior law enforcement observation of [Jane Doe 4] with a cast on her leg during that same time. [Jane Doe 4]  was told by Chey[, another conspirator,] that Baker sold [Jane Doe 4] to [a] pimp in Phoenix for $7,000. This  corroborates [Jane Doe 4's] disappearance from the Albuquerque area in the late summer of 2017. PSR ¶¶ 48-49, at 13. Williams asserts that the paragraphs should be deleted, because he ""was not present and did  not witness any physical abuse or sexual activity between Mr. Baker and anyone else."" First Objections at 5.  Williams also contends that Jane Doe 7 said that Williams was only present when Baker was not present, and so he  could not have been aware of any abuse. See First Objections at 5. The United States says that it is ""unrealistic""  that Williams was ignorant of the abuse that Jane Doe 7 suffered. First Response at 7. The United States asserts  that Jane Doe 7 did not say that Williams [*74]  was present only when Baker was absent. See First Response at 7. As discussed supra, Baker's abuse and the abuse's nature are relevant to Williams' ""background, character, and  conduct."" 18 U.S.C. § 3661. The Court sees no material difference between the abuse that the PSR's ¶¶ 48-49, at  13, discusses and the abuse that the Court has already determined is relevant. Like the previously discussed  abuse, the abuse that the PSR's ¶¶ 48-49, at 13, discusses was not some unforeseeable, isolated incident. Instead,  Baker maintained control over his victims by threats, intimidation, and violence. Williams guarded the victims'  movements when Baker was not present and so helped Baker maintain his control. See PSR ¶24, at 11. The  objected-to paragraphs are also probative in that they document the abuse's extent and extremity. Moreover, the  incident discussed in the previous subsection -- in which Baker and Williams were together at Baker's apartment  when APD officers and CYFD social workers investigated Baker's assertions regarding Jane Doe 7 -- demonstrates  that Baker's and Williams' presence around the victims was not mutually exclusive and so Williams was not totally  ignorant of Baker's abuse. See First Response [*75]  at 7. Accordingly, Williams' assertion that he was unaware of  the abuse that the PSR's ¶¶ 48-49 describes is not enough to strike those paragraphs from the PSR, and the Court  overrules the Objection. K. BAKER DRUGGING ANOTHER VICTIM AND TAKING HER FROM ALBUQUERQUE TO COLROADO  SPRINGS IS RELEVANT, AND WILLIAMS DOES NOT ASSERT A SUFFICIENT FACTUAL OBJECTION FOR  THE INCIDENT TO BE OMITTED FROM THE PSR. Williams last objects to the PSR's ¶ 50, at 14, which states: In June of 2017, Baker and Williams took [Jane Doe 7], A.G., and [Jane Doe 4] to Colorado Springs, Colorado  from Albuquerque for the purposes of engaging in commercial sex acts. While staying in Colorado Springs,  Baker would make trips to Albuquerque to buy narcotics, and on one occasion, he brought an African American  female back with him to engage in sex work. The female said she smoked a ""blunt"" with Baker in Albuquerque  and then woke up in Colorado Springs (consistent with the narrative provided by Jane Doe 2). PSR ¶ 50, at 14. Williams says that the only evidence supporting the paragraph's assertion that Williams was in  Colorado Springs in June, 2017, is ""the unreliable statement of a single witness, with evidentiary credibility [*76]   issues."" First Objections at 5. Williams thus contends that ""the statement does not have sufficient reliability to be  included in the PSR [and] should be omitted."" First Objections at 5. Last, Williams asserts that ""the remaining  statements in Paragraph 50 do not involve Williams."" First Objections at 5. The United States responds that ¶ 50  describes conduct similar to that of which Williams was convicted. See First Response at 8. The United States  avers that the victims that the PSR's ¶ 50, at 14, describes did not know Jane Doe 2, and so ¶ 50 corroborates  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *72 Page 23 of 33   Jane Doe 2's account of Baker and Williams' actions in coercing Jane Doe 2 to go with them to Colorado Springs.  See First Response at 8. As with some of Williams' previous objections, asserting general ""evidentiary credibility issues"" is not enough to  require the Court to ""rule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not  affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing."" Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(3)(B). See  United States v. Romero, No. CR 09-1253 JB, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 179914, 2012 WL 6632493, at *24 (D.N.M.  Dec. 6, 2012)(Browning, J.)(holding that general allegations that evidence is unreliable ""do not satisfy [the  defendant's] 'affirmative duty to make a showing that [*77]  the information in the PSR was unreliable and articulate  the reasons why the facts contained therein [were] untrue or inaccurate'"" (quoting United States v. Rodriguez— Delma, 456 F.3d at 1253)). Moreover, the evidence is relevant to Williams' ""background, character, and conduct.""  18 U.S.C. § 3661. The paragraph closely parallels Williams' plea admission -- both document Baker forcing women  to leave Albuquerque to do sex work for him in Colorado Springs. See PSR ¶ 50, at 14; Plea Agreement ¶ 9, at 4.  The Court will consider the information. Based on U.S.S.G. § 1B1.4, 18 U.S.C. § 3661, United States v. Watts, and  Witte v. United States, the Court will overrule the objection. Having resolved Williams' Objections to the information  on which the Court may rely, the Court proceeds to ruling on Williams' Objections to the PSR's conclusions  regarding sentencing enhancements and adjustments. II. THE COURT GENERALLY OVERRULES WILLIAMS' OBJECTIONS TO THE SENTENCING  ENHANCEMENTS, BUT WILLIAMS IS ENTITLED TO A MITIGATING-ROLE ADJUSTMENT. The Court overrules each of Williams' objections with the exception of his mitigating-role argument. Specifically, the  Court concludes that the PSR properly cross references § 2A3.1, because Williams' offense involved [*78]   coercion. The Court also concludes that a 4-level enhancement under § 2A3.1(b)(5) applies, because Williams'  offense involved abducting Jane Doe 2. Further, § 2A3.1(b)(5)' application does not preclude § 3A1.3's  enhancement for physical restraint, and Williams aided Baker in restraining Jane Doe 2. Last, Williams held a  minor, nonsupervisory role in Williams' enterprise, so § 3B1.2's adjustment applies. Accordingly, the Court overrules  in part and sustains in part the Second Objections. A. THE USPO PROPERLY CROSS-REFERENCES U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1. The USPO contends that U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1, rather than § 2G1.1, determines Williams' base offense level. See PSR  ¶ 29, at 11. Although § 2G1.1 typically applies to 18 U.S.C. § 2422 convictions, the USPO contends that a cross  reference to § 2A3.1 is appropriate, because Williams' offense involved conduct that 18 U.S.C. §§ 2241(a), (b), or  2242 describe. See Addendum at 7; U.S.S.G. § 2G1.1(c)(1). In the Second Objections, Williams asserts that the  USPO errs in applying § 2A3.1, and that this error causes ""an inappropriate and astronomical increase to the  recommended Guideline sentencing range."" Second Objections at 3. Williams contends that § 2G1.1, rather than §  2A3.1, applies to his offense. See Second Objections at 2-3. Williams first asserts that Jane Doe 2 is predisposed  to engage in sex work, and so any coercion on Baker and Williams' part did not cause her to engage in sex  work. [*79]  See Second Objections at 3. Williams then contends that his offense conduct did not involve coercion,  and so § 2G1.1 applies. The Court first concludes that Jane Doe 2's predisposition, even if it exists, does not  foreclose § 2A3.1's application. The Court then concludes that Williams' offense involved coercion and threats  such that § 2A3.1 properly applies. 1. Williams' Argument that Sex Workers Cannot be Coerced into Doing Sex Work Does Not Comport with 18  U.S.C. § 2241(a)'s Text. Williams' primary argument is that he ""persuaded,"" but did not ""threaten"" or ""coerce,"" Jane Doe 2 to get in the car  with Baker and himself. Second Objections at 3. Williams contends that, ""[i]f persuasive coercion equated 'force or  threat,' the cross reference would always apply, and §2G1.1(b)(1) would be superfluous."" Second Objections at 3  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *76 Page 24 of 33   (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 2241). Instead, Williams argues that ""the force or threat applied should be the cause of  engagement in prostitution before the cross reference applies, particularly given the extreme increase it  mandates."" Second Objections at 3 (citing United States v. Zitlalpopoca-Hernandez, 632 F. App'x 335, 337 (9th Cir.  2015)(unpublished)). Williams asserts that, even if his offense involved threats or coercion, those threats cannot be  the but-for cause of Jane Doe 2's sex work, because ""Jane Doe 2 was a sex worker and would have been a sex  worker with or without any alleged force or threat."" [*80]  Second Objections at 4. Williams says that he ""intends to  present evidence that Jane Doe 2 had a long history of drug abuse, dishonesty, and criminal conduct indicative of  sex work unconnected to the events of this case."" Second Objections at 4. Williams alleges, as an example, that  Jane Doe 2 has pled guilty to child abuse and has ""had numerous violations of her probation for matters associated  with drug use, disappearance, repeated child abuse, intimidating witnesses to her child abuse, and sexual assault  towards others in her recovery program."" Second Objections at 4. According to Williams, ""[t]his highlights that Jane  Doe 2 was not a stranger to the streets."" Second Objections at 4. Accordingly, Williams contends that § 2A1.3 does  not apply, because Jane Doe 2 would have been a sex worker independent of his offense. See Second Objections  at 4. The United States disagrees. See United States' Response to Defendant Williams' Second Set of Objections to the  Presentence Report at 2, filed March 23, 2020 (Doc. 201)(""Second Response""). The United States says that courts  ""across the country have applied this cross reference in similar cases."" Second Response at 3 (citing United States  v. Scott, 434 F. App'x 103, 106 (3d Cir. 2011)(unpublished); United States v. Kizer, 517 F. App'x 415, 417 (6th Cir.  2013)(unpublished)). The United States describes Williams' arguments as ""essentially asking this court to believe  that although [*81]  he helped Baker victimize Jane Doe 2, it is still all her fault because she has a criminal history  and was therefore a prostitute."" Second Response at 4. The United States asks that the Court reject Williams'  ""absurd and disgusting proposition"" that sex workers cannot be victimized. Second Response at 5. The United  States further asserts that ""Williams has not, because he cannot, point to any history of prostitution by Jane Doe 2  prior to her abduction from a bus stop by Williams and Baker."" Second Response at 4. The United States asserts  that Williams assisted Baker in forcing Jane Doe 2 to engage in a sex act, the cross reference is proper. See  Second Response at 5. Williams pled guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. § 2422(a). See Plea Agreement ¶ 8, at 3. Section 2G1.1 pertains to  ""promoting prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct,"" and applies to § 2422(a). Section 2A3.1 pertains to ""criminal  sexual abuse,"" and applies to violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2241 and 2242. See U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1. The cross  reference at § 2G1.1(c)(1) directs courts to apply § 2A3.1, ""[i]f the offense involved conduct described in 18 U.S.C.  § 2241(a) or (b) or 18 U.S.C. § 2242."" U.S.S.G. § 2G1.1(c)(1). The application note to § 2G1.1 summarizes such  offenses: (A) Conduct Described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) or (b). -- For purposes of subsection (c)(1), conduct described in  18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) or (b) is: (i) using force against the victim; (ii) threatening [*82]  or placing the victim in  fear that any person will be subject to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping; (iii) rendering the victim  unconscious; or (iv) administering by force or threat of force, or without the knowledge or permission of the  victim, a drug, intoxicant, or other similar substance and thereby substantially impairing the ability of the victim  to appraise or control conduct. This provision would apply, for example, if any dangerous weapon was used or  brandished, or in a case in which the ability of the victim to appraise or control conduct was substantially  impaired by drugs or alcohol. (B) Conduct Described in 18 U.S.C. § 2242. -- For purposes of subsection (c)(1), conduct described in 18  U.S.C. § 2242 is: (i) engaging in, or causing another person to engage in, a sexual act with another person by  threatening or placing the victim in fear (other than by threatening or placing the victim in fear that any person  will be subject to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping); or (ii) engaging in, or causing another person to  engage in a sexual act with a victim who is incapable of appraising the nature of the conduct or who is  physically incapable of declining participation in, or communicating unwillingness to engage [*83]  in, the  sexual act. U.S.S.G. § 2G1.1 n.4. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *79 Page 25 of 33   The Court does not agree with Williams' argument that he could not have coerced Jane Doe 2 into sex work,  because she would have done sex work in any event. First, Williams points to no evidence that Jane Doe 2 did sex  work before meeting Baker, and the United States asserts that she had not engaged in such work. See Second  Response at 4. Williams' argument is thus that she had a propensity to do sex work. See Second Objections at 3  (asserting that Jane Doe 2's criminal history is ""indicative of sex work""). To support this argument, Williams asserts  that, before meeting Baker, Jane Doe 2 had pled guilty to child abuse and ""had numerous violations of her  probation for matters associated with drug use, disappearance, repeated child abuse, intimidating witnesses to her  child abuse, and sexual assault towards others in her recovery program."" Second Objections at 3. None of these  alleged violations is ""indicative of sex work,"" Second Objections at 3, or even correlated with sex work. Accordingly,  Williams has presented no evidence that Jane Doe 2 would have engaged in sex work regardless of Baker and  Williams' actions in this case. Second, even aside from these factual shortcomings, the logical premise is flawed. By Williams' logic, [*84]  his  conviction could not stand: if one cannot threaten Jane Doe 7 to do what she would have inevitably done, there is  no reason he could persuade such inevitable action. Under Williams' logic, no sex worker could ever fall victim to  the litany of sex offenses that the United States Code provides, including rape, where the sex worker may have  engaged in some other sex act of his or her own free will. Williams affords no justification for the sweeping  argument that Congress excluded all sex workers from its statutes' protection. See, e.g., Bostock v. Clayton Cty.,  Georgia, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 207 L. Ed. 2d 218, 2020 WL 3146686, at *11 (U.S. 2020)(Gorsuch, J.)(""Nor is there any  such thing as a 'canon of donut holes,' in which Congress's failure to speak directly to a specific case that falls  within a more general statutory rule creates a tacit exception."") There is nothing in §§ 2422, 2241, and 2242's text that suggests that sex workers cannot be victims of acts that  otherwise violate those statutes. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, interpreting  § 2422(b)'s similar language in United States v. Hite, 769 F.3d 1154, 413 U.S. App. D.C. 66 (D.C. Cir. 2014),  discussed the statutes operative terms: The ordinary meanings of the verbs persuade, induce, entice, and coerce demonstrate that § 2422(b) is  intended to prohibit acts that seek to transform or overcome the will [*85]  of a minor. For instance, ""persuade""  is commonly defined as ""[t]o induce or win over (a person) to an act or course of action; to draw the will of  (another) to something, by inclining his judgement [sic ] or desire to it; to prevail upon, to urge successfully, to  do something,"" Oxford English Dictionary (2d ed.1989), or ""to win over by an appeal to one's reason and  feelings, as into doing or believing something,"" Black's Law Dictionary (6th ed.1990). See also Webster's Third  New International Dictionary, Unabridged (1981) (defining ""persuade"" as ""to induce by argument, entreaty, or  expostulation into some mental position . . . win over by an appeal to one's reason and feelings (as into doing  or believing something)""). Likewise, ""induce"" is ordinarily defined as ""[t]o lead (a person), by persuasion or  some influence or motive that acts upon the will,"" ""to lead on, move, influence, prevail upon (any one) to do  something."" Oxford English Dictionary (2d ed.1989) (emphasis in original). See also Black's Law Dictionary  (6th ed.1990) (""induce"" defined as ""[t]o bring on or about, to affect, cause to influence to an act or course of  conduct, lead by persuasion or reasoning, incite by motives, [*86]  prevail on""); Webster's Third New  International Dictionary, Unabridged (1981) (""induce"" defined as ""to move and lead (as by persuasion or  influence),"" ""prevail upon,"" and ""to bring on or bring about""). ""Entice"" and ""coerce"" similarly connote efforts to  affect the mind or will of another. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary (6th ed.1990) ( ""entice"" means ""to lure,  induce, tempt, incite, or persuade a person to do a thing""; ""coerce"" means ""[c]ompelled to compliance;  constrained to obedience, or submission in a vigorous or forcible manner""). Congress is presumed to use  words in the common, ordinary meaning absent contrary indication, and we find none here. See, e.g., FDIC v.  Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 476, 114 S. Ct. 996, 127 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1994); Engine Mfrs. Ass'n v. S. Coast Air Quality  Mgmt. Dist., 541 U.S. 246, 252, 124 S. Ct. 1756, 158 L. Ed. 2d 529 (2004). United States v. Hite, 769 F.3d at 1161. Each of these terms refers to specific instances of pressure, and which  which general propensity does not necessarily negate. The terms instead require overcoming or transforming the  victim's will as to a specific course of action. See United States v. Tee, 881 F.3d 1258, 1264 (10th Cir.  2018)(affirming § 2422(a) conviction even though the victim first proposed the idea of prostitution); United States  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *83 Page 26 of 33   v. Hite, 769 F.3d at 1161. Williams' argument substitutes the general for the specific to assert that, if Jane Doe 2  had a general propensity to engage in sex work, she could not be criminally persuaded or coerced into doing [*87]   any specific sex acts. But this argument makes no more sense than saying that prison guards cannot force-feed  inmates, because those inmates would have eaten at some other point in their lives, or that Person A's intent to  have sex with Person B on Friday means that Person B is not liable if he rapes Person A on Saturday. Cf. United  States v. Tee, 881 F.3d 1258, 1264 (10th Cir. 2018)(affirming a § 2422(a) conviction even though the victim first  presented the idea of traveling in interstate commerce to commit a commercial sex act). For similar reasons, prior sex work is typically not admissible to disprove later coercion. See, e.g., Fed. R. Evid.  412; United States v. Pablo, 696 F.3d 1280, 1299 (10th Cir. 2012)(affirming the district court's exclusion of  evidence, in a rape prosecution, that the victim had consensual sex with two other men on the night of the rape);  Jones v. Goodwin, 982 F.2d 464, 471 (11th Cir. 1993)(""[A] woman's consensual sexual activities with certain  individuals in no way imply consent to similar activities with others.""); United States v. Saunders, 943 F.2d 388, 392  (4th Cir. 1991)(""[I]t is intolerable to suggest that because the victim is a prostitute, she automatically is assumed to  have consented with anyone at any time.""). Accordingly, that Jane Doe 2 may later have engaged in sex work  independent of Baker does not foreclose § 2A3.1's application. 2. The PSR Properly Cross References § 2A3.1 in Determining Williams' base offense [*88]  level. Williams argues that he only persuaded Jane Doe 2 and that, moreover, if any coercion occurred, it resulted from  Baker's conduct and not his. See Second Objections at 4. The United States contends that § 2A3.1 applies,  because Williams' offense conduct involved ""forcing, threatening, and coercing"" Jane Doe to do sex work. Second  Response at 5. The Court concludes that the cross reference is proper under either §§ 2241 or 2242. First, the cross reference applies under § 2241, because Williams' offense conduct involved: ""(i) using force against  the victim; and (ii) threatening or placing the victim in fear that any person will be subject to death, serious bodily  injury, or kidnapping."" U.S.S.G. § 2G1.1 n.4. Williams' offense involved Baker brandishing a firearm to intimidate  Jane Doe 2 into getting into a car with Baker and Williams. See PSR ¶ 14, at 9 (""Baker told [Jane Doe 2] to get in  the vehicle and flashed a handgun he had in his waistband.""). Baker told Jane Doe 2 that ""she had 'no choice' but  to get in the vehicle."" PSR ¶ 14, at 9. In the Plea Agreement, Williams admits that he and Baker ""made clear that  she was to get into the vehicle."" Plea Agreement ¶ 9, at 4. The Guidelines application note to § 2G1.1(c)(1)  provides that the cross reference ""would [*89]  apply, for example, if any dangerous weapon was used or  brandished[.]"" U.S.S.G. § 2G1.1 note 4. The cross reference is thus appropriate, because Williams offense involved  conduct that § 2241(a) describes. See 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) (""Whoever . . . knowingly causes another person to  engage in a sexual act -- [] by using force against that other person; or [] by threatening or placing that other person  in fear that any person will be subjected to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping[.]""). The cross reference is also appropriate under § 2242. A cross reference is permissible under that section if the  offense involved ""engaging in, or causing another person to engage in, a sexual act with another person by  threatening or placing the victim in fear (other than by threatening or placing the victim in fear that any person will  be subject to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping)."" U.S.S.G. § 2G1.1 n.4. The threats continued once Jane  Doe 2 was held in Colorado Springs, where Baker assaulted and raped Jane Doe 2 when she refused to work or to  forfeit her earnings to Baker. See PSR ¶ 17, at 9. Williams assisted these threats by guarding Jane Doe 2 when  Baker was not around, thus preventing her escape and maintaining Jane Doe 2's fear of Baker. ""The  definition [*90]  of 'fear,' as used in 18 U.S.C. § 2242(1), is very broad."" United States v. Castillo, 140 F.3d 874, 885  (10th Cir. 1998)(citing United States v. Gavin, 959 F.2d 788, 791 (9th Cir. 1992)). ""The element is satisfied when  the defendant's actions implicitly place the victim in fear of some bodily harm."" United States v. Castillo, 140 F.3d at  885 (citing United States v. Cherry, 938 F.2d 748, 755 (7th Cir. 1991)). In United States v. Monsalve, 342 F. App'x  451 (11th Cir. 2001)(unpublished), the United States Court of Appeals, citing United States v. Castillo, upheld a  cross reference where the defendant smuggled two women into the United States with the promise that they would  be waitresses. See United States v. Monsalve, 342 F. App'x at 454. After arriving in the United States illegally, ""they  were told they owed [the defendant] a $16,000 smuggling fee and that they must repay him by working as  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *86 Page 27 of 33   prostitutes. They had their identification documents taken from them, spoke no English, and depended on Monsalve  and his associates for food, water, shelter, and clothing."" 342 F. App'x at 454. One of the defendant's ""managers""  told the victims that he would have them deported if they tried to escape. 342 F. App'x at 454. Here, Baker and  Williams took Jane Doe 2, against her will, to an unfamiliar city. See PSR ¶ 14, at 9. They refused to stop on the  drive to Colorado Springs when she asked to use a restroom or get some food. See PSR ¶ 14, at 9. They took all  her money such that she was completely dependent upon Baker for food, water, and shelter. See PSR ¶ 17, at 9.  In [*91]  three instances, Baker gave Jane Doe 2 methamphetamine, ""which she used to stay awake because she  was afraid of being raped by Baker."" PSR ¶ 17, at 9. As discussed supra, Williams assisted in this conduct such  that it is properly applied to his offense. Williams' offense conduct thus involved placing Jane Doe 2 in fear, and this  fear caused Jane Doe 2 to engage in sex work. Accordingly, Williams' offense involved conduct that §§ 2242(1)  and 2242 describe, and the cross reference is appropriate. The Court thus overrules the Objection and concludes  that § 2A3.1 determines Williams' base offense level. B. A 4-LEVEL ENHANCEMENT FOR ABDUCTION APPLIES. Williams next asserts that §2A3.1(b)(5), which provides a 4-level enhancement for offenses involving abduction,  does not apply to his Guidelines offense level. See Second Objections at 4. Williams asserts that Jane Doe 2 ""was  persuaded, not forced, to accompany defendants,"" and that she ""participated in an activity which was not unusual  for her."" Second Objections at 5. Last, Williams maintains that ""there was no[] force involved and an abduction did  not occur."" Second Objections at 5. The United States disagrees and asserts that the enhancement applies,  because Baker showed Jane Doe 2 a gun and made it clear that she had no choice but to [*92]  accompany them  to a different location. See Second Response at 6. Section 2A3.1(b)(5) provides a 4-level enhancement ""[i]f the victim was abducted."" U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1(b)(5).  ""Abducted"" means that a victim was forced to accompany an offender to a different location. U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1,  n.1(A) (""'Abducted' means that a victim was forced to accompany an offender to a different location. For example, a  bank robber's forcing a bank teller from the bank into a getaway car would constitute an abduction.""). See United  States v. Kavo, 128 F. App'x 447, 451-52 (6th Cir. 2005)(holding that abduction occurred within the meaning of §  2A3.1(b)(5) when the defendant physically carried the victim against her wishes from the main floor of his home to  his basement bedroom, because it gave the defendant a better chance to complete his crime than ""if he had  remained in the immediate area where his sister was sleeping and could have been summoned to assist the  victim""); United States v. Mix, 77 F. App'x 986, 990 (9th Cir. 2003)(upholding district court's enhancement for  abduction when the defendant ""forced his victim at knifepoint into a back room to continue the assault""). The  defendant need not, however, use violent force: ""'[T]he abduction adjustment requires only that force necessary to  overcome the particular victim's will.'"" United States v. Martinez-Hernandez, 593 F.3d 761, 762 (8th Cir.  2010)(quoting United States v. Saknikent, 30 F.3d 1012, 1014 (8th Cir. 1994))(alteration added in United States v.  Martinez-Hernandez). See [*93]  United States v. Hefferon, 314 F.3d 211, 226-27 (5th Cir. 2002)(concluding that  abduction happened by ""veiled coercion"" where the defendant ""was able to isolate the victim by dominating her  lack of intellectual ability, and also by appealing to the credulous nature of a seven-year-old""). These cases show that the abduction enhancement applies when the offense involves conduct that overcomes the  victim's will to move the victim to a different location. Here, Baker and Williams abducted Jane Doe 2. Baker flashed  a gun, and he and Williams ""made clear that she was to get in [their] vehicle."" Plea Agreement ¶ 9, at 4. See PSR ¶  14, at 9 (providing that Baker told Jane Doe 2 that she ""had no choice"" but to get into the car). Contrary to Williams'  assertion, Jane Doe 2 thus did not get in the car solely of her volition but rather because Baker and Williams  overcame Jane Doe 2's will. See United States v. Martinez-Hernandez, 593 F.3d at 762 (""[T]he abduction  adjustment requires only that force necessary to overcome the particular victim's will."" (internal quotation marks  omitted)). Further, although Williams contends that Jane Doe 2 willingly got into the car, he makes no suggestion  that Jane Doe 2 did so willing to leave Albuquerque for Colorado Springs. To the contrary, during the drive to  Colorado Springs, [*94]  Baker refused to stop for food or let Jane Doe 2 use the restroom, further demonstrating  that she was not a willing participant in the ride. See PSR ¶ 16, at 9. Accordingly, the Court overrules the Objection,  and § 2A3.1(b)(5)'s 4-level enhancement applies. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *90 Page 28 of 33   C. A 2-LEVEL ENHANCEMENT FOR PHSYICAL RESTRAINT IS APPROPRIATE. Williams next objects to the PSR's application of a 2-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. §3A1.3, which applies to  offenses involving physical restraint. See Second Objections at 5. Williams contends that § 3A1.3, ""requires forcible  restraint,"" like ""'being tied, bound, or locked up.'"" Second Objections at 5 (emphasis in Second Objections)(quoting  U.S.S.G §1B1.1 n.1(L)). He says that the restraint that § 3A1.3 requires ""is not the same as being put in a hotel  room, particularly in a situation where other witnesses have verified the women were free to come-and-go as they  pleased."" Second Objections at 5. Finally, Williams contends that, if the Court concludes that § 2A3.1(b)(5)'s  abduction-enhancement applies, applying § 3A1.3 would amount to impermissible double counting. See Second  Objections at 5 (citing U.S.S.G. §3A1.3 n.2). The United States responds that § 3A1.3 applies when the defendant  ""hold[s] the victim back from some action, procedure, or course, prevent[s] the victim from doing something, or  otherwise keep[s] the victim within bounds or under control."" [*95]  Second Response at 6 (citing United States v.  Checora, 175 F.3d 782, 790 (10th Cir. 1999)). The United States contends that Baker's abuse amounts to a  physical restraint and that Williams is responsible for that restraint. See Second Response at 7-8. The United  States thus asks that the Court overrule the Objection. Section 3A1.3 provides a 2-level enhancement if the offense involved physically restraining the victim. See  U.S.S.G. § 3A1.3. Application note 1(L) of the Commentary to Guideline § 1B1.1 states that the term ""physically  restrained"" means ""the forcible restraint of the victim such as being tied, bound, or locked up."" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1  n.1(L). ""By use of the words 'such as,' the Sentencing Commission listed 'being tied, bound, or locked up""' by way  of example rather than limitation."" United States v. Nelson, 740 F. Supp. 1502, 1512 (D. Kan. 1990)(O'Connor,  C.J.)(quoting U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1 cmt. and citing United States v. Stokley, 881 F.2d 114, 116 (4th Cir. 1989). See  United States v. Joe, 696 F.3d 1066, 1071 (10th Cir. 2012)(""Like most other courts, we have held that the examples  listed in the definition are intended only as examples and not as an exhaustive list of how a victim may be physically  restrained.""). Accordingly, there does not have to be ""physical touching of the victim,"" because ""[k]eeping someone  from doing something is inherent within the concept of restraint."" United States v. Fisher, 132 F.3d 1327, 1329-30  (10th Cir. 1997)(applying § 3A1.3 where a ""coconspirator deliberately kept the security guard at bay by pointing a  gun directly at his head""). [*96]  Last, the restraint of the victim need not occur during the offense of conviction, as  long as the restraining occurred as part of the relevant conduct. See United States v. Holbert, 285 F.3d 1257, 1262- 63 (10th Cir. 2002)(""We hold that, for the purpose of applying § 3A1.3, the defendant must have physically  restrained a victim in the course of the offense, and that the course of the offense includes any conduct for which  the defendant is accountable under § 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).""). While some courts have limited their interpretation of physical restraint to instances similar to § 1B1.1 n.1(L)'s  examples, see, e.g., United States v. Anglin, 169 F.3d 154, 164 (2d Cir. 1999), the Tenth Circuit ""has taken a  different approach"" and interprets physical restraint expansively, United States v. Joe, 696 F.3d at 1071. In United  States v. Miera, 539 F.3d 1232 (10th Cir. 2008), the Tenth Circuit concluded that a physical-restraint enhancement  was proper when the defendants, during a bank robbery, ordered the bank's employees and patrons to put their  hands up and not move. See 539 F.3d at 1234. The Tenth Circuit noted that ""physical restraint is not limited to  physical touching of the victim."" 539 F.3d at 1234. Accordingly, that Williams may not have personally used the  means that § 1B1.1 n.1(L) describes does not foreclose § 3A1.3's application. In United States v. Joe, a Tenth  Circuit panel noted, with disapproval, the breadth of the Tenth Circuit's interpretation [*97]  of physical restraint: Thus, although the Guidelines provision we are examining here uses the term ""physically restrained,"" and  ""physically"" would seem to be a modifier of ""restrained,"" our cases have wrenched ""physically"" from its original  place so that it now seems to describe the conduct or the inner thoughts of the victim. Thus, we have said that  keeping victims from ""even considering an escape"" is to physically restrain them. [United States v. ]Miera, 539  F.3d at 1235. Indeed, it may seem as though our construction has gone so far as to render ""physically"" a  nullity: if preventing a victim from thinking about escape, see id., is to ""physically restrain"" that victim, then it is  quite a challenge to conceive of a restraint that would not be deemed ""physical"" under this court's case law. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *94 Page 29 of 33   United States v. Joe, 696 F.3d at 1072. The Tenth Circuit panel concluded, however, that the Tenth Circuit caselaw  expansively interpreting physical restraint bound the panel. See 696 F.3d at 1071. Williams' offense conduct involves physical restraint. Although Williams avers that Jane Doe 2 was ""free to come  and go,"" he points only to ""interview[s with] workers at other hotels in the Albuquerque area,"" and not to any  evidence specific to the hotel in Colorado Springs where [*98]  Baker held Jane Doe 2. First Objections at 3. See  Second Objections at 5. Moreover, Baker abused Jane Doe 2 when she did not comply with his demands that she  engage in sex work or forfeit her earnings. See PSR ¶ 17, at 9. Williams then guarded Jane Doe 2's hotel room in  Colorado Springs, further restraining her. Finally, even if Williams was not preventing Jane Doe 2's escape by  guarding her hotel room, she was in an unfamiliar city without money. Given the Tenth Circuit's broad interpretation  of § 3A1.3, this all amounted to physically restraining Jane Doe 2. See United States v. Miera, 539 F.3d at 1234. Williams asserts that, if the Court applies the abduction enhancement, application of the physical-restraint  enhancement amounts to impermissible double counting. See Second Objections at 5. The United States responds  that, because there was additional conduct beyond the initial abduction that amounts to physical restraint, applying  both enhancements is permissible. See Second Response at 7. The Tenth Circuit has stated that, while generally  ""impermissible 'double counting' occurs 'when the same conduct on the part of the defendant is used to support  separate increases under separate enhancement provisions which necessarily overlap, are indistinct, and serve  identical purposes,'"" sometimes ""the [*99]  Guidelines themselves provide an alternative principle of double  counting."" United States v. Joe, 696 F.3d at 1070 (quoting United States v. Reyes Pena, 216 F.3d 1204, 1209 (10th  Cir. 2000)). Where the ""particular guideline specifically speaks to double counting, such an instruction would be  controlling"" over the general double-counting analysis. United States v. Coldren, 359 F.3d 1253, 1256 (10th Cir.  2004). U.S.S.G. § 3A1.3, the restraint-of-victim enhancement, instructs courts not to ""apply this adjustment where  the offense guideline specifically incorporates this factor, or where the unlawful restraint of a victim is an element of  the offense itself (e.g. this adjustment does not apply to offenses covered by § 2A4.1 (Kidnapping, Abduction,  Unlawful Restraint))."" U.S.S.G. § 3A1.3 n.2. In United States v. Strong, 826 F.3d 1109 (8th Cir. 2016), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit  addressed an objection similar to Williams' objection. See 826 F.3d at 1116. The defendant relied upon § 3A1.3's  Application Note 2, which refers specifically to abduction, to argue that a physical-restraint enhancement and an  abduction enhancement are mutually exclusive. See 826 F.3d at 1117. The Eighth Circuit disagreed with the  defendant and held, first, that the two enhancements are not necessarily mutually exclusive: ""'the [Guidelines]  drafters did not intend that [abduction and physical restraint enhancements] be considered mutually exclusive, but  rather gradations of aggravating [*100]  conduct.'"" 826 F.3d at 1117 (quoting United States v. Gall, 116 F.3d 228,  230 (7th Cir. 1997), and citing United States v. Smith, 320 F.3d 647, 657-58 (6th Cir. 2003)). The Eighth Circuit  further asserted that both enhancements applied, because the defendant was conviction of aggravated sexual  abuse, rather than abduction, and the Eighth Circuit acknowledged that, ""[h]ad the offense been abduction, adding  a physical restraint adjustment would have clearly been improper based on §3A1.3, cmt. n.2."" 826 F.3d at 1117.  The Eighth Circuit then concluded that the enhancements were not based on the same conduct -- the abduction  enhancement applied, because the defendant dragged the victim from her neighbor's house to her house, and the  restraint enhancement applied, because the defendant kept the victim at her house, against her will, for three days.  See 826 F.3d at 1117. Here, application of both enhancements does not amount to double counting, because both enhancements are  based on separate conduct. The abduction enhancement applies, because Williams' offense conduct involved  overcoming Jane Doe 2's resistance or will to transport her to another location. See PSR ¶ 14, at 9. The physical  restraint enhancement applies, because Williams' offense conduct involved keeping her in the Colorado Springs  hotel room against her will. See PSR ¶ 17, at 9. Further, the [*101]  physical restraint that supports the § 3A1.3  enhancement is not an element of Williams' conviction. Williams pled guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. § 2422(a). See  Plea Agreement ¶ 9, at 4. In the Plea Agreement, Williams admits that he ""knowingly persuaded, induced, enticed,  or coerced"" Jane Doe 2 ""to travel in interstate commerce"" ""to engage in prostitution."" Plea Agreement ¶ 8, at 3-4.  The physical restraint that supports the enhancement occurred after the abduction, while Williams aided Baker in  keeping Jane Doe 2 in the Colorado Springs hotel room. Williams' offense, therefore, is not one that § 2A4.1  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *97 Page 30 of 33   covers, and so applying both § 3A1.3 and § 2A3.1(b)(5) does not amount to impermissible double counting.  Accordingly, the Court overrules the Objection. D. WILLIAMS IS ENTITLED TO A MITIGATING ROLE ADJUSTMENT. The USPO concludes that Williams is not entitled to a mitigating-role adjustment, largely because Williams was  ""present"" during several of Baker's offenses. Addendum at 8. Specifically, the USPO asserts that an adjustment  under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2 is improper, because: (i) ""Williams was present during his sex trafficking activities over a  period of time""; (ii) ""Williams is known to be present during the offense of conviction (Count 6) which occurred  between June and [*102]  September 2016""; (iii) Williams was also present during the incident involving [Jane Doe  7] and her missing child in January 2017""; (iv) Jane Doe 7 ""has also alleged that Williams was present with Baker in  June 2017 during a trip to Colorado""; and (v) Jane Doe 7 ""also alleged that Williams often guarded the victims'  movements when Baker was not present, which corroborates [Jane Doe 2's] statement."" Addendum at 5. Williams  avers that he is ""substantially less culpable than anyone else in the group,"" and that, if Baker's criminal activity  ""stretched to many states beyond New Mexico and Colorado, it is clear Mr. Williams did not understand the scope  and structure."" Second Objections at 5. Williams argues that he did not have decision-making authority and ""did not  participate in any planning."" Second Objections at 5. Last, Williams contends that ""he did not benefit,"" and that no  one ""gave him compensation."" Second Objections at 6. Williams characterizes himself as ""along for the ride and a  temporary stand-in,"" so he was the ""quintessential minimal participant."" Second Objections at 6. The United States  agrees with Williams. See Second Response at 8. The United States says that, although Williams aided and  abetted Baker's offenses, the United States has no evidence ""of how Williams benefitted [*103]  financially from  these crimes, if at all,"" and that only Baker made the decisions and ""doled out the abuse on the victims."" Second  Response at 8. The United States thus ""agrees that application of a departure for a mitigating role is likely  appropriate."" Second Response at 8. The Guidelines define a minor participant as one ""who is less culpable than most other participants in the criminal  activity."" U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2 n.5. A defendant ""who performs a limited function in the criminal activity may receive an  adjustment under this guideline."" U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2 n.3(A). In determining whether Williams was a minor participant  in the murders, the Court may consider: (i) ""the degree to which the defendant understood the scope and structure  of the criminal activity""; (ii) ""the degree to which the defendant participated in planning or organizing the criminal  activity""; (iii) ""the degree to which the defendant exercised decision-making authority or influenced the exercise of  decision-making authority""; (iv) ""the nature and extent of the defendant's participation in the commission of the  criminal activity, including the acts the defendant performed and the responsibility and discretion the defendant had  in performing those acts""; and (v) [*104]  ""the degree to which the defendant stood to benefit from the criminal  activity."" U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2 n.3(C). A 2-level adjustment under § 3B1.2(b) is proper. Williams conduct can be accurately described as ""limited"" or as  ""substantially less culpable than [an] average participant"" in Baker's crimes. U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2 n.3(A) (title case  omitted). First, as the United States notes, Williams received little by way of financial gain in a criminal enterprise  that was, primarily, about financial gain. See Second Response at 8. Second, Williams was not a decision-maker in  the enterprise, but rather took orders from Baker. See Second Response at 8. Williams thus did ""not have a  proprietary interest in the criminal activity and [was] simply being paid to perform certain tasks."" U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2  n.3(C). Moreover, these is no evidence that Williams himself engaged in any direct abuse of the victims. See PSR  ¶¶ 14-17, at 9; id. ¶¶ 45-47, at 13. Williams was thus a ""minor participant"" in Baker's crimes. U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2(b). That Williams is entitled to a mitigating-role adjustment is not, however, an easy call. As discussed in Section I,  supra, Williams' relevant conduct includes several of Baker's heinous actions. As the USPO notes, Williams was  present for some of those acts, and, as the Court notes in Section I, supra, a preponderance [*105]  of the evidence  does not establish that he was completely ignorant of Baker's abuse. Further, Jane Doe 7 describes Williams as  Baker's ""pimp partner."" PSR ¶ 45, at 13. Accordingly, Williams cannot accurately be described as a ""minimal  participant"" in Baker's enterprise. U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2(a). Moreover, the Application Notes to § 3B1.2 provide that,  when a defendant receives a lower offense level ""by virtue of being convicted of an offense significantly less serious  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *101 Page 31 of 33   than warranted by his actual criminal conduct,"" a role adjustment ""ordinarily is not warranted because such  defendant is not substantially less culpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the less serious offense.""  U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2 n.3(B). Williams was convicted of violating § 2422(a) despite being responsible for conduct that  constitutes more serious offenses. Nonetheless, that culpability is reflected in the cross reference to § 2A3.1, and  so Williams has not received a lower offense level ""by virtue of being convicted of an offense significantly less  serious than warranted by his actual criminal conduct."" U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2 n.3(B). Williams is thus ""less culpable than  most other participants in the criminal activity,"" but his role cannot ""be described as minimal."" U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2 n.5.  Accordingly, a 2-level adjustment [*106]  is proper, and the Court sustains in part and overrules in part the  Objection. III. THE 4-LEVEL ENHANCEMENT UNDER § 2A3.1(b)(1) APPLIES AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE  IMPERMISSIBLE DOUBLE COUNTING, BUT THE 2-LEVEL ENHANCEMENT UNDER § 2A3.1(b)(4) DOES NOT  APPLY. Last, the Court resolves two issues with the PSR that the parties do not raise. First, the PSR, after concluding that a  cross reference to § 2A3.1 applies, adds a 4-level enhancement under § 2A3.1(b)(1), because Williams' offense  involves conduct that §§ 2241 or § 2242 describes. See PSR ¶ 30, at 11. The Court concludes that, in this case,  applying § 2A3.1(b)(1) does not impermissibly double count conduct that formed the basis for the cross reference  under § 2G1.1(c)(1). Second, the PSR applies a 2-level enhancement for seriously bodily injury. See PSR ¶ 31, at  11. The Court concludes that there is insufficient evidence that Jane Doe 2 suffered serious bodily injury, and so the  2-level enhancement under § 2A3.1(b)(4) does not apply. A. A 2-LEVEL ENHANCEMENT FOR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY DOES NOT APPLY. The PSR calculates a 2-level enhancement under § 2A3.1(b)(4). See PSR ¶ 31, at 11. Although neither party  objects to this enhancement, the Court concludes that the enhancement does not apply to Williams' offense.  Section 2A3.1(b)(4)(B) directs courts to apply a 2-level enhancement [*107]  ""if the victim sustained serious bodily  injury."" U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1(b)(4)(B). The Guidelines provide two definitions of ""serious bodily injury. U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1  note 1(L). First, ""'[s]erious bodily injury' means injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of  a function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or [ii] requiring medical intervention such as surgery,  hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation."" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1 note 1(L). Second, ""'serious bodily injury' is deemed to  have occurred if the offense involved conduct constituting criminal sexual abuse under 18 U.S.C. § 2241 or [§] 2242  or any similar offense under state law."" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1 note 1(L). The second definition cannot apply, however,  ""when the sentencing court is calculating the offense level for an 18 U.S.C. § 2241 offense."" United States v. Jim,  786 F.3d 802, 814 (10th Cir. 2015). This limitation is because § 2A3.1's application note 1 states that, ""for the  purposes of this guideline, 'serious bodily injury' means conduct other than criminal sexual abuse, which is already  taken into account in the base offense level under subsection (a)."" U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1 n.1 (emphasis in original). The  Tenth Circuit has held that ""the two-level serious-bodily-injury enhancement can still apply to a sexual abuse  offender, but it must be based on the fact that the victim's injuries meet"" the first definition -- that is, ""'injury  involving [*108]  extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member, organ, or  mental faculty; or requiring medical intervention such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation.'"" United  States v. Jim, 786 F.3d at 814 (quoting U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1 n.1(L)). Consequently, the Tenth Circuit holds that, when  § 2A3.1 provides the base offense level, a sentencing court can consider injuries the victim suffered resulting directly from the sexual abuse as well as  those suffered during relevant conduct surrounding that offense when determining whether the victim suffered  serious bodily injury, defined as injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a  function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or requiring medical intervention such as surgery,  hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation[.] 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *105 Page 32 of 33   United States v. Jim, 786 F.3d at 815 (citation omitted). See United States v. Volpe, 224 F.3d 72, 78 (2d Cir.  2000)(noting that § 2A3.1(b)(4)'s ""degree-of-injury adjustment punishes the assailant for the injuries to the victim  that result from the assault"")(emphasis in original). Here, § 2A3.1 provides Williams' base offense level, so § 2A3.1(b)(4)'s 2-level enhancement can apply only if his  offense conduct causes ""extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a bodily member, organ, or mental  faculty; or requiring medical intervention [*109]  such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation.""  U.S.S.G. § 1B1.1 n.1(L). There is no such evidence here that Jane Doe 2 sustained such an injury. Accordingly, the  Court directs that the PSR's ¶ 31, at 11, be amended to omit the 2-level enhancement for serious bodily injury. B. A 4-LEVEL ENHANCEMENT UNDER § 2A3.1(b)(1) IS APPROPRIATE AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE  DOUBLE COUNTING. After concluding that a cross reference to § 2A3.1, pursuant to § 2G1.1, is appropriate, the PSR applies a 4-level  enhancement under § 2A3.1(b)(1). That section applies if the defendant's relevant offense conduct involves  conduct that §§ 2241(a) or (b) describe. See U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1(b)(1). Neither party objects to this enhancement. Courts have uniformly held that cross-referencing to § 2A3.1, because the offense involved conduct that § 2241  describes, does not foreclose a 4-level enhancement under § 2A3.1(b)(1). In United States v. Flanders, 752 F.3d  1317 (11th Cir. 2014), the Eleventh Circuit concluded that ""the Sentencing Commission intended for the entirety of  § 2A3.1, including any enhancements, to apply following the application of the cross reference."" United States v.  Flanders, 752 F.3d at 1340 (citing U.S.S.G. § 1B1.5(a)). The Eleventh Circuit further concluded that § 2G1.1(c)(1)'s  cross reference and § 2A3.1(b)(1)'s enhancement involve different conduct. See 752 F.3d at 1340. The Eleventh  Circuit said that the cross reference applies to offenses that involve sexual abuse, while [*110]  the enhancement  applies ""only where the offense involved conduct constituting the more severe subset of aggravated sexual abuse  offenses."" 752 F.3d at 1340 (citing U.S.S.G. §§ 2A3.1(b)(1), 2G1.1(c)(1); 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) and (b)). The  Eleventh Circuit thus held that, even to the extent that the defendant's base offense level and the § 2A3.1(b)(1)  enhancement were ""based on the same conduct, . . . those calculations did not constitute impermissible double  counting."" 752 F.3d at 1340. (citing United States v. Webb, 665 F.3d 1380, 1382-83 (11th Cir. 2012). The United  States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit takes a similar approach applying § 2A3.2(c)(1)'s cross reference,  which the Ninth Circuit noted ""applies if the offense involved a violation of either 18 U.S.C. §§ 2241 or 2242,""  neither of which require the use of force. United States v. Archdale, 229 F.3d 861, 869 (9th Cir. 2000). The Ninth  Circuit thus concluded that, because it is possible to be sentenced under § 2A3.1 for an offense that does not  involve the use of force, such behavior may justify an enhancement, because ""the guideline's base offense level  will not necessarily have been set to capture the full extent of the wrongfulness of such behavior."" United States v.  Archdale, 229 F.3d at 869 (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the Ninth Circuit noted that, because ""'[t]he  Sentencing Commission plainly understands the concept of double counting and expressly forbids it where it is not  intended,'"" it is notable [*111]  that the Sentencing Commission did not preclude the enhancement's application  following a cross reference. United States v. Archdale, 229 F.3d at 869 (quoting United States v. Williams, 954 F.2d  204, 208 (4th Cir. 1992)). The Tenth Circuit has similarly held that, ""in a case involving the sexual abuse of a child,  the guidelines provide the sentencing judge with the flexibility to apply a force enhancement depending on the  facts."" United States v. Reyes Pena, 216 F.3d at 1210-11. Accordingly, it is permissible to apply § 2A3.1(b)(1)'s 4- level enhancement, because Williams' offense conduct involved the use of force that § 2241(a) and (b) describes. In summary, under § 2A3.1, Williams' base offense level is 30. See U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1(a)(2). A 4-level enhancement  under U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1(b)(1) is proper, because Williams' offense involves conduct that § 2241(a) and (b) describe.  See PSR ¶ 30, at 11. A 4-level enhancement for abduction under U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1(b)(5), and a 2-level  enhancement for physical restraint under U.S.S.G. § 3A1.3 are proper, but Williams is also entitled to a 2-level  adjustment under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2. Williams is further entitled to a 3-level adjustment for his acceptance of  responsibility and assistance to authorities. See PSR ¶¶ 38-39, at 13. Williams cumulative offense level is thus 35.  Williams has a criminal history score of zero, and so his resulting criminal history category is 1. See PSR ¶ 62, at  17. Accordingly, Williams' Guidelines imprisonment range [*112]  is 168-210 months imprisonment. See U.S.S.G.  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *108 Page 33 of 33   §5A.1. The Court notes, however, that Williams and the United States agree that a sentence of thirty to sixty  months imprisonment is appropriate. See Plea Agreement ¶ 15, at 6. The Court will determine Williams sentence at  his sentencing hearing. /s/ James O. Browning UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124956, *112",1
"Bonestroo v. United States, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 186355","AMENDED REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION INTRODUCTION Movant, Ronald Bonestroo, a federal inmate at the Petersburg Low Federal Correctional Institution in Petersburg,  Virginia, has filed a pro se motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. This  matter was referred to this magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A) & (B) and the October 16, 2014,  standing order of the Honorable Karen E. Schreier, district judge. FACTS Mr. Bonestroo was found guilty by a jury of attempted commercial sex trafficking of a child on November 8, 2011.  The district court granted Mr. Bonestroo's motion for judgment of acquittal on January 4, 2012. The government  appealed the district court's decision and, on January 7, 2013, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and  remanded the case for reinstatement of the jury verdict and imposition of sentence. Mr. Bonestroo filed a petition for  writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court on June 11, 2013. Mr. Bonestroo [*2]  was sentenced by the  Page 2 of 4   district court on June 17, 2013, to 120 months' imprisonment and a 5-year term of supervised release. On October  18, 2013, the United States Supreme Court denied Mr. Bonestroo's petition for a writ of certiorari. Mr. Bonestroo  filed this § 2255 action over three years later, on November 16, 2016. DISCUSSION This Court conducted a preliminary review of Mr. Bonestroo's petition as required by Rule 4. Believing that Mr.  Bonestroo's petition may be time-barred, the court issued an order to show cause directing both the government  and Mr. Bonestroo to file briefs with the court, setting forth documentation and other appropriate authority as to  whether Mr. Bonestroo's petition should be dismissed on statute of limitations grounds. See Docket No. 5. The  court set forth in its order the relevant law applicable to the statute of limitations for § 2255 motions, including the  law of equitable tolling. Id. The deadline for the parties' briefs was December 20, 2016. Id. Mr. Bonestroo filed a brief with the court pursuant to the order to show cause on December 27, 2016, arguing that  his § 2255 motion should be considered timely. See Docket No. 9. The government filed a brief indicating its  agreement with [*3]  the court's analysis that Mr. Bonestroo's motion was time-barred. See Docket No. 7. There is a one-year statute of limitations relevant to Section 2255 motions: (f) A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section. The limitation period shall run from  the latest of— (1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final; (2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by governmental action in violation of the  Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from making a motion  by such governmental action; (3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has  been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral  review; or (4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered  through the exercise of due diligence. See 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f). Motions under § 2255 are subject to a one-year statute of limitation that runs from the latest of four specified dates.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f). Only one is relevant here—""the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.""  Id. A judgment is deemed final ""where the judgment of conviction [*4]  was rendered, the availability of appeal  exhausted, and the time for petition for certiorari had elapsed [or a petition for certiorari finally denied...]."" United  States v. Johnson, 457 U.S. 537, 543, n. 8, 102 S. Ct. 2579, 73 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1982) (citation omitted); see also  Clay v. United States, 537 U.S. 522, 527, 123 S. Ct. 1072, 155 L. Ed. 2d 88 (2003) (for the purpose of starting §  2255's one-year limitation period, ""[f]inality attaches when [the Supreme] Court affirms a conviction on the merits on  direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.""). The  time for filing a petition for certiorari is 90 days after entry of the court of appeals' judgment. Clay, 537 U.S. at 525. In Mr. Bonestroo's case, the statute of limitations began to run on October 18, 2013 (the date the Supreme Court  denied his petition for certiorari), and he had until October 18, 2014, to file a § 2255 motion. See 28 U.S.C. §    2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 186355, *2 Page 3 of 4   2255(f). Mr. Bonestroo did not file his § 2255 motion until November 16, 2016. His motion is clearly time-barred  unless equitable tolling applies. The doctrine of equitable tolling has been extended to § 2255 motions. United States v. Martin, 408 F.3d 1089,  1092 (8th Cir. 2005). Equitable tolling is an extraordinary remedy used only in rare circumstances and ""affords the  otherwise time-barred petitioner an exceedingly narrow window of relief."" Jihad v. Hvass, 267 F.3d 803, 805 (8th  Cir. 2001); United States v. Riggs, 314 F.3d 796, 799 (5th Cir. 2002). ""'[A]ny invocation of equity to relieve the strict  application of a statute [*5]  of limitations must be guarded and infrequent, lest circumstances of individualized  hardship supplant the rules of clearly drafted statutes.'"" Jihad, 267 F.3d at 806 (quoting Harris v. Hutchinson, 209  F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir. 2000)). Equitable tolling is only applicable in two instances: ""(1) if there are 'extraordinary circumstances' beyond a  movant's control that would keep him from filing in a timely fashion or (2) if the government's conduct 'lulled' the  movant into inaction through reliance on that conduct."" United States v. Hernandez, 436 F.3d 851, 858 (8th Cir.  2006) (internal citations omitted). ""Equitable tolling only applies when the circumstances that cause the delay in  filing are 'external to the plaintiff and not attributable to his actions.'"" Id. at 858 (citing Maghee v. Ault, 410 F.3d 473,  476 (8th Cir. 2005)) (additional citation omitted). Further, [t]he petitioner must also demonstrate that he acted with  due diligence in pursuing his [§ 2255] petition."" E.J.R.E. v. United States, 453 F.3d 1094, 1097 (8th Cir. 2006). Mr. Bonestroo has the burden to demonstrate the applicability of equitable tolling to his case. He argues that the  government prevented him from timely filing his § 2255 motion by appealing the district court's grant of Mr.  Bonestroo's motion for acquittal. See Docket No. 9. However, this action by the government took place before the  statute of limitations had even began to run on Mr. Bonestroo's § 2255 motion. To recap, the government [*6]   appealed on January 7, 2013; Mr. Bonestroo was sentenced on June 17, 2013; and the United States Supreme  Court denied Mr. Bonestroo's petition for a writ of certiorari on October 18, 2013. It was only upon this latter date  that Mr. Bonestroo's statute of limitations began to run. The government's earlier appeal did not affect the statute of  limitations. Therefore, Mr. Bonestroo has not shown extraordinary circumstances beyond his control kept him from  timely filing his motion. He has also failed to demonstrate that the government's actions lulled him into not filing— this is because the government's actions took place before the statute of limitations for the § 2255 motion had even  begun to run. In addition, in his response to the order to show cause, Mr. Bonestroo does not explain why three years elapsed  between the Supreme Court's denial of the certiorari petition and his filing of the instant § 2255 motion. Without any  explanation, the court finds that Mr. Bonestroo did not act with due diligence by waiting three years to file the instant  motion. Mr. Bonestroo has therefore failed to make the required showing in order for the doctrine of equitable tolling  to apply to his case. Accordingly, the [*7]  court recommends dismissal of Mr. Bonestroo's motion with prejudice.",1
"United States v. Paris, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31212","ORDER REGARDING VARIOUS MOTIONS On December 13, 2006, a federal grand jury in the District of Connecticut returned a twenty-nine count Second  Superseding Indictment charging Dennis Paris with conspiracy, sex trafficking, use of an interstate facility to  promote prostitution, and money laundering. Paris has filed several motions related to discovery and the  indictment. For the following reasons these motions are denied. I. Background The Second Superseding Indictment alleges that Paris operated a prostitution business in the Hartford,  Connecticut area. According to the indictment, Paris attempted to conceal the nature of his business by calling [*2]   it an ""escort service."" The indictment charges that Paris used cellular telephones to promote his business, and that  Page 2 of 3   these cellular telephones were interstate facilities. According to the indictment, a co-conspirator assisted Paris in his  prostitution business by ""selling"" Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 to Paris, and then they were forced to work as  prostitutes by Paris. The indictment also alleges that Paris caused Minor A and Minor B to work as prostitutes.  Finally, the indictment alleges that Paris laundered money associated with his prostitution business. II. The Defendant's Motions A. Motion for Bill of Particulars Paris moves for a bill of particulars providing the identities of the Jane Does and the Minors, and particulars about  the date and nature of any alleged force, fraud and coercion. A defendant is entitled to a bill of particulars when the indictment does not indicate which of his acts are allegedly  criminal. United States v. Torres, 901 F.2d 205, 234 (2d Cir. 1990). The bill enables the defendant to defend the  initial charge properly and to avoid double jeopardy. A bill of particulars avoids impermissibly shifting the burden of  proving criminal [*3]  liability from the government to the defendant. United States v. Bortnovsky, 820 F.2d 572, 575  (2d Cir. 1987). Information that is necessary to give the defendant enough specificity about his allegedly criminal  conduct must be disclosed by the government even if it reveals the government's evidence or theories of the case.  United States v. Barnes, 158 F.3d 662, 665 (2d Cir. 1998). However, a bill of particulars should only be granted  when the particulars sought are necessary for the defendant to prepare his case, not in cases where the information  would merely be helpful. United States v. Young & Rubicam, 741 F. Supp. 334, 349 (D. Conn. 1990). The  defendant bears the burden of showing that the information requested is necessary and that he will be prejudiced  without it so as to justify granting a bill of particulars. Barnes, 158 F.3d at 666. A mere statement that the defendant  will be prejudiced without the bill is insufficient. See id. Even if the indictment does not fully give notice of the  charges, a bill of particulars is still not necessary if the government provides the required notice in ""some  acceptable [*4]  alternate form."" Bortnovsky, 820 F.2d at 574; see United States v. Kaplan, 91 F. Supp. 2d 565, 572  (S.D.N.Y. 2000). 1. Identities of Alleged Victims Paris requests that the government disclose the identities of the victims referenced in Counts Two, Four, Nine and  Ten of the Second Superseding Indictment.  The government opposes this request and maintains that Paris  already has full information about the identities of those victims, except for their birth dates. At oral argument the  government agreed to provide the victims' birth dates. In light of these representations, there is no need for the  Court to order that the government reveal the identities of the alleged victims. 2. Particulars of Alleged Force, Fraud and Coercion Paris argues that Counts Nine and Ten of the indictment are too vague [*5]  about the time, place, and nature of the  alleged force, fraud and coercion, and seeks information about specific instances of allegedly actionable conduct.  The government argues that this aspect of the motion should be denied because the indictment adequately alleges  these portions of the relevant counts and Paris has been provided with open access to the government's files,  which includes that information. The Court concludes that Paris is not entitled to a bill of particulars on this aspect of the indictment. The subject  counts provide sufficient specificity, and through what it describes as ""open file"" discovery, the government has  provided Paris with adequate information about the nature of the alleged threats, violence, and exploitation of the  victims. In addition, the government's Trial Brief [Dkt. No. 457] specifies these claims. Accordingly, Paris's motion for a bill of particulars is denied. B. Motion to Dismiss   Page 3 of 3   Paris filed a motion to dismiss Count One of the Second Superseding Indictment, which alleges that Paris  participated in a conspiracy to use an interstate facility to promote prostitution. At oral argument Paris conceded  that precedent binding upon this Court [*6]  bars a motion to dismiss at this juncture of the case. ""[A]n indictment is  sufficient if it, first, contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge  against which he must defend, and, second, enables him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future  prosecutions for the same offense."" Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2907, 41 L.Ed.2d  590 (1974). ""[T]he sufficiency of the evidence is not appropriately addressed on a pretrial motion to dismiss an  indictment."" United States v. Alfonso, 143 F.3d 772, 777 (2d Cir. 1998). The conspiracy count of the indictment  contains the elements of the offense charged, informs the defendants of the charges against which they must  defend, and protects them from double jeopardy in the future. Accordingly, Paris's motion to dismiss is denied  without prejudice to filing a motion for judgment of acquittal.",1
"Commonwealth v. McGhee, 472 Mass. 405","[**333]  S, J. In this case, we are asked to consider, for the first time, the constitutionality of the Massachusetts  sex trafficking statute. On November 21, 2011, the Legislature approved “An Act relative to the commercial  exploitation of people,” which criminalized sexual servitude, forced labor, and organ [***2]  trafficking as of its  effective date of February 19, 2012. St. 2011, c. 178, §§ 1-31. The portions of the enactment at issue here,  pertaining to the  [*407]  trafficking of persons for sexual servitude, were codified at G. L. c. 265, §§ 49, 50. See  St. 2011, c. 178, § 23. HN1[ ] General Laws c. 265, § 50 (a), states, in relevant part: “Whoever knowingly: (i) subjects, or attempts to subject, or recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides or  obtains by any means … another person to engage in commercial sexual activity … or causes a person to  engage in commercial sexual activity … or (ii) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, as a result  of a violation of clause (i), shall be guilty of the crime of trafficking of persons for sexual servitude and shall be  punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not less than [five] years but not more than [twenty] years and  by a fine of not more than $25,000.” HN2[ ] The phrase “[c]ommercial sexual activity” is defined as “any sexual act on account of which anything of  value is given, promised to or received by any person.” G. L. c. 265, § 49. On December 19, 2012, a Suffolk County grand jury indicted each defendant, Tyshaun McGhee and Sidney  McGee, on nine counts of aggravated rape, G. L. c. 265, § 22 (a), three counts of trafficking persons [***3]  for  sexual servitude, G. L. c. 265, § 50, and two counts of deriving support from the earnings of a prostitute, G. L. c.  272, § 7. The charges arose from allegations by three women (C.C., S.E., and B.G.) that the defendants  approached them, took their photographs to post as advertisements on a Web site called Backpage.com, drove  them to various locations to have sex with men who responded to the advertisements, and then retained some or  all of the money that the women received as payment from these men. The defendants filed a joint pretrial motion to  dismiss the sex trafficking charges on the grounds that G. L. c. 265, § 50, is unconstitutionally vague and  overbroad, both on its face and as applied to them. A judge of the Superior  [**334]  Court denied the motion.  Following a jury trial, Tyshaun was convicted on all three indictments charging him with trafficking persons for  sexual servitude (C.C., S.E., and B.G.), and both indictments charging him with deriving support from the earnings   [*408]  of a prostitute (C.C. and S.E.). He was found not guilty on the indictments charging him with aggravated  rape. Sidney was convicted on all three indictments charging him with trafficking persons for sexual servitude  (C.C., S.E., and B.G.), and he was found not [***4]  guilty on the remaining indictments. Each defendant filed a  timely notice of appeal, and we granted their subsequent applications for direct appellate review.         Page 11 of 22   The defendants contend on appeal that (1) G. L. c. 265, § 50, is unconstitutionally vague as applied to them and,  therefore, violated their rights to due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States  Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; (2) G. L. c. 265, § 50, is unconstitutionally  overbroad on its face in violation of their right to freedom of association under the First Amendment to the United  States Constitution; (3) the phrase “commercial sexual activity” is unconstitutionally overbroad; (4) the judge erred  in allowing the substantive admission of grand jury testimony from one of the Commonwealth's witnesses; [***5]   and (5) the judge violated their right to confrontation by hindering their cross-examination of C.C. with respect to  several pending criminal charges against her and her purported history of prostitution. In addition, Tyshaun  contends that the sentences imposed for his convictions of deriving support from the earnings of a prostitute were  illegal. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that G. L. c. 265, § 50, is constitutional, that the sentences  challenged by Tyshaun were illegal, and that the defendants' remaining claims of error have no merit. Accordingly,  the judgments are affirmed. As to the indictments charging Tyshaun with deriving support from the earnings of a  prostitute, those cases are remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion. 1. Factual background. We summarize the facts the jury could have found, reserving certain details for our  discussion of the issues raised. As mentioned, [***6]  the charges against the defendants arose from their  interactions with three women in the fall of  [*409]  2012. C.C., then approximately twenty-four years old, had a  history of drug and alcohol use, and she had spent time in several treatment facilities. On September 7, 2012, as  she left Boston Medical Center after having been treated for two drug overdoses within one twenty-four hour period,  she encountered the defendants, who were standing outside the hospital. The defendants asked C.C. what she was  doing, and she told them that she was interested in “party[ing].” After offering to give her a ride, the defendants  walked C.C. to an apartment on Eustis  [**335]  Street in Boston, where C.C. observed an older man standing  outside. Tyshaun gave the man some money, and then Tyshaun proceeded inside with C.C. and Sidney. They went  upstairs to a bedroom where all three drank from a bottle of alcohol, C.C. smoked some “crack” cocaine that had  been given to her by Tyshaun, and the defendants purportedly raped C.C. as she cried. Afterward, C.C. got  dressed, all three individuals walked to an apartment on Dudley Street where Tyshaun's mother lived, and C.C. fell  asleep on a couch. She did not attempt to run away because [***7]  she was afraid of what might happen to her. The next morning, the defendants and C.C. walked to a fast food restaurant where Tyshaun purchased some  heroin from a friend and gave it to C.C., who proceeded to inject it into her foot. As they walked away from the  restaurant, the defendants started talking with C.C. about a business arrangement whereby she could “make a lot  of money,” “have a nice car,” and “have a nice apartment.” It was C.C.'s understanding that the defendants were  talking about prostitution. They continued this conversation until they reached the Dudley Street apartment. At the apartment, the defendants prepared to take photographs of C.C., which they planned to post as  advertisements on the Web site Backpage.com. Tyshaun told C.C. that there would be a “rate,” which she  understood as meaning that she would be having sex with people in exchange for money. Although “definitely  hesitant,” [***8]  C.C. agreed to proceed because she was “broke and homeless, and having a nice apartment and  car and money seemed like the best option.” Tyshaun gave C.C. lingerie to wear, and he took photographs of her  with a digital camera in the bathroom of the  [*410]  apartment. C.C. started feeling “uncomfortable” and did not  want to be in the situation in which she found herself. Nonetheless, the defendants transferred the photographs to  Sidney's laptop computer and then posted them on Backpage.com. Tyshaun included his cellular telephone number  with the photographs, and the name indicated on them was “Jamie Lynn.”       Page 12 of 22   After about thirty minutes, Tyshaun's telephone started to ring. He answered it and handed the telephone to C.C.,  having told her what to say to the callers. C.C. would ask them “if they were a cop of any sort,” what they wanted,  and whether they could meet at a particular location that had been chosen by Tyshaun and Sidney. Tyshaun  established prices of one hundred dollars for thirty minutes of sex, and $150 for one hour of sex. When C.C.  arranged to meet a man at the Eustis Street apartment for thirty minutes of sex, the defendants walked with her to  that location, and Tyshaun again gave [***9]  some money to the same older man who had been standing outside  that location the previous day. C.C. was directed to a room, she had sex with the man she had arranged to meet,  she was paid one hundred dollars, and she handed the money over to Tyshaun, keeping none of it for herself. Over the course of the next three to four days, C.C. had sex with five or six other men in various locations. The  defendants always accompanied C.C. to the designated meeting place and would wait for her until she had  finished. She gave all of the money that she was paid to Tyshaun, who arranged the accommodations. At some  point, Tyshaun stopped providing drugs and alcohol to C.C., telling her that she  [**336]  was not making enough  money to support her habits. On September 12, 2012, roughly five days after having met the defendants, C.C. woke up alone in a hotel room.  Although neither defendant was there, Tyshaun's cellular telephone was in the room. C.C. telephoned her father.  He told her to leave the hotel room, and she jogged to a nearby pharmacy, where she telephoned her father again  to pick her up. On the drive to her parents' home, C.C. told her father in response to his questioning that she had  been raped. [***10]  After she arrived home, C.C.'s mother took her to Brockton Hospital where she was  interviewed by a sexual assault nurse examiner and diagnosed with pneumonia and cellulitis. During her  examination, C.C. told the nurse that over the past several days she had engaged in sex with multiple men. At  some point shortly thereafter, C.C. told Boston police officers that she had been sexually assaulted, but she did not  disclose her  [*411]  involvement in prostitution. On October 2, 2012, C.C. was shown a photographic array, and  she identified the photograph of Sidney. Approximately one month later, C.C. told the police about her involvement  with prostitution. On December 12, 2012, C.C. went to Boston police headquarters to view a live lineup, and she  identified Tyshaun. In the fall of 2012, S.E., then approximately twenty-six years old, was homeless, and had a history of drug use. S.E.  met Sidney around September 18, when she was standing in line outside a homeless shelter near the Boston  Medical Center. After asking S.E. several questions, Sidney told her that he could help her, and that she could earn  enough money working as an “escort” to live a better life. S.E. accompanied Sidney to meet Tyshaun, [***11]  and  then the three of them went to the apartment on Dudley Street where Tyshaun's mother lived. Once there, the  defendants told S.E. that they were going to take photographs of her and post them on the Web site  Backpage.com. S.E. agreed, but “wasn't comfortable” with the arrangement. Tyshaun took the photographs using  his cellular telephone, Sidney showed her how to pose, and the defendants posted the photographs online.  Tyshaun included his cellular telephone number with the photographs, and the name indicated on them was  “Natalia.” After a short period of time, calls and text messages started arriving on Tyshaun's telephone. S.E. realized that  Tyshaun was conversing about sex, not merely escorting, only when she questioned him about the prices for her  “services.” Tyshaun told the callers that it would be $150 for “full service,” which meant oral and vaginal sex, and  fifty dollars for just oral sex. Shortly thereafter, a man arrived at the Dudley Street apartment, he and S.E. “engaged  in sexual behavior,” the man paid her some cash, and she gave it to Tyshaun so he could “put gas in the car,” “rent  a hotel room,” and “keep posting the ad.” S.E. subsequently met another individual [***12]  at a different location  that was a few blocks away from the Dudley Street apartment. She was unable to remember what happened at this  second location. S.E. returned to the Dudley Street apartment with the defendants at around 3 .., she performed  oral sex on each defendant at their behest because she “didn't want to get hurt,” she had sexual intercourse with  Tyshaun, and then the defendants fell asleep. The next morning, after the defendants took S.E. to a methadone clinic, they proceeded to check Tyshaun's  telephone for responses to the photographs they had posted on Backpage.com.  [*412]  Over the next twenty-four  hours, the defendants drove S.E. to different locations where she engaged  [**337]  in various sexual acts with  Page 13 of 22   several different men. The defendants always remained nearby in their parked motor vehicle and, once S.E. had  finished, Tyshaun demanded all of the cash that she had received. On her third day with the defendants, Tyshaun again took S.E. to a methadone clinic where she chatted with B.G., a  woman she had met during prior visits to the clinic. After their conversation, B.G. went outside and spoke with the  defendants, whom she already had met. Eventually, all four of them returned [***13]  to the Dudley Street  apartment, where B.G. used a computer to repost photographs of herself that had been submitted to Backpage.com  on an earlier occasion. The defendants also took new photographs of B.G. and posted them on the Web site. Later  that same day, the defendants drove S.E. and B.G. some distance to a hotel where each woman had sex with two  men for money. The defendants waited outside in their car. S.E. and B.G. received $250, which was split evenly,  and S.E. gave her share to Tyshaun when he asked for it. B.G. kept some, if not all, of the money she had received.  Eventually, the group drove back to Boston. Tyshaun and B.G. had an argument about sex and money; Tyshaun  pulled the vehicle over to the side of the road, and the women got out. B.G. removed some personal belongings  from the trunk, and the two women walked away. The defendants drove off. S.E. and B.G. went to Boston Medical Center, and the police were called to the scene. In the waiting room, the  women met with Officer Edward Fleming and told him that they had been forced into prostitution. Boston police  officers subsequently interviewed S.E. and B.G. regarding the events that had transpired with the  defendants. [***14]  On September 26, 2012, S.E. went to a police station to view a photographic array. She  identified Tyshaun, and he was arrested the next day. On September 28, 2012, S.E. returned to the police station to  view another photographic array. She identified Sidney, and he was arrested that same day. 2. Constitutionality of G. L. c. 265, § 50. We begin with a discussion of the defendants' facial and as-applied  challenges to the constitutionality of the sex trafficking statute, which HN3[ ] challenges present questions of law  that we review de novo. See Commonwealth v. Johnson, 470 Mass. 300, 307, 21 N.E.3d 937 (2014), citing  Commonwealth v. Martin, 467 Mass. 291, 301, 4 N.E.3d 1236 (2014). HN4[ ] In accordance with canons of  statutory construction, a statute is presumed to be constitutional. See St. Germaine v. Pendergast, 416 Mass. 698,   [*413]  703, 626 N.E.2d 857 (1993). “Doubts as to a statute's constitutionality ‘should be avoided if reasonable  principles of interpretation permit doing so.’” Commonwealth v. Disler, 451 Mass. 216, 228, 884 N.E.2d 500 (2008),  quoting Staman v. Assessors of Chatham, 351 Mass. 479, 487, 221 N.E.2d 861 (1966). The defendants first contend that G. L. c. 265, § 50 (a), is unconstitutionally vague as applied to them and,  therefore, violated their rights to due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and art. 12. They point  out that § 50 (a) lacks the element of force or coercion as required by the analogous Federal sex trafficking  statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) (2012). As such, the defendants argue  [**338]  that § 50 (a) fails to give them fair  warning of prohibited conduct, noting that by merely assisting [***15]  a consenting adult prostitute, they will be  deemed to have engaged in the trafficking of persons for sexual servitude. Moreover, the defendants continue,               Page 14 of 22   without the element of force or coercion, there is a real risk of arbitrary enforcement of the statute, which also  offends standards of due process. We disagree with the defendants' arguments. HN5[ ] The principles governing a vagueness challenge to a statute are  [*414]  well established. “A basic tenet of  due process requires that a criminal statute be sufficiently clear to give notice of the prohibited conduct.”  Commonwealth v. Reyes, 464 Mass. 245, 248, 982 N.E.2d 504 (2013). See Commonwealth v. Bohmer, 374 Mass.  368, 371, 372 N.E.2d 1381 (1978). “A statute violates due process and is void for vagueness when individuals of  normal intelligence must guess at the statute's meaning and may differ as to its application, thus denying them fair  notice of the proscribed conduct.” Disler, 451 Mass. at 223. See Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385,  391, 46 S. Ct. 126, 70 L. Ed. 322 (1926). “Penal statutes must ‘define the criminal offense with sufficient  definitiveness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited.’” Commonwealth v. Zubiel, 456  Mass. 27, 30, 921 N.E.2d 78 (2010), quoting Commonwealth v. Twitchell, 416 Mass. 114, 123, 617 N.E.2d 609  (1993). See Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 75 L. Ed. 2d 903 (1983). A vague statute also  offends due process because of “its lack of reasonably clear guidelines [***17]  for law enforcement and its  consequent encouragement of arbitrary and erratic arrests and prosecutions.” Commonwealth v. Sefranka, 382  Mass. 108, 110, 414 N.E.2d 602 (1980). See Reyes, supra at 249. See also Grayned v. Rockford, 408 U.S. 104,  108-109, 92 S. Ct. 2294, 33 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1972). Any ambiguity in a criminal statute “must be strictly construed  against the government.” Zubiel, supra at 33. See Commonwealth v. Kenney, 449 Mass. 840, 850, 874 N.E.2d  1089 (2007). HN6[ ] “Proscribed conduct, however, is not always capable of precise legal definition.” Reyes, 464 Mass. at 249.  See Jaquith v. Commonwealth, 331 Mass. 439, 442, 120 N.E.2d 189 (1954). “Accordingly, legislative language  need not be afforded ‘mathematical precision’ in order to pass constitutional muster.” Reyes, supra, quoting  Bohmer, 374 Mass. at 372. See Grayned, 408 U.S. at 110. A statute is not vague “if it requires a  [**339]  person to  conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard.” Commonwealth v. Orlando, 371  Mass. 732, 734, 359 N.E.2d 310 (1977). Its language will be constitutionally adequate if it “conveys [a] sufficiently  definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.”  Commonwealth v. Adams, 389 Mass. 265, 270, 450 N.E.2d 149 (1983), quoting Commonwealth v. Jarrett, 359  Mass. 491, 496-497, 269 N.E.2d 657 (1971). “Uncertainty as to whether marginal offenses are included within the  coverage of a statute does not render it unconstitutional if its scope is substantially clear.” Reyes, supra. See United  States Civil Serv. Comm'n v. National Ass'n of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO, 413 U.S. 548, 579, 93 S. Ct. 2880, 37 L.  Ed. 2d 796 (1973); Jarrett, supra. Moreover, “even a vague statute may be made constitutionally definite by giving it  a reasonable construction.” Sefranka, 382 Mass. at 111.  [*415]  Here, we conclude that because G. L. c. 265, § 50 (a), is sufficiently clear and definite, it did not [***18]   violate the defendants' rights to due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and art. 12. The words of  the statute have commonly accepted and readily understood meanings in the English language, and the phrase  “commercial sexual activity” is amply defined in G. L. c. 265, § 49. The statutory language provided fair notice to  the defendants that the very conduct in which they engaged was the kind of conduct that the Legislature intended to  prohibit and punish. HN7[ ] The fact that G. L. c. 265, § 50 (a), does not include the element of force or coercion does not render the  statute unconstitutionally vague or subject to arbitrary enforcement. The clear and deliberate focus of the statute is  the intent of the perpetrator, not the means used by the perpetrator to accomplish his or her intent. Section 50 (a)  states that an individual shall be guilty of the crime of trafficking of persons for sexual servitude where such  individual “knowingly … subjects, or attempts to subject, or recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides or obtains       Page 15 of 22   by any means … another person to engage in commercial [***19]  sexual activity” (emphasis added). As is its  purview, the Legislature has determined that whether a person being trafficked for sexual servitude has been forced  or coerced into engaging in such activities is immaterial for purposes of ascertaining whether a criminal act has  been committed. The only relevant consideration is whether the perpetrator has engaged in the enumerated  proscribed conduct with the requisite mens rea. HN8[ ] When used in a criminal statute, the word “knowingly” typically “imports a perception of the facts requisite  to make up the crime.” Commonwealth v. Altenhaus, 317 Mass. 270, 273, 57 N.E.2d 921 (1944), quoting  Commonwealth v. Horsfall, 213 Mass. 232, 237, 100 N.E. 362 (1913). A requirement of scienter “has a tendency to  narrow (and thus to clarify) the scope of a criminal enactment.” Commonwealth v. Love, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 541, 546  n.11, 530 N.E.2d 176 (1988). The Supreme Court has long recognized that HN9[ ] the constitutionality of a  purportedly vague statute “is closely related to whether that [statute] incorporates a requirement of mens rea.”  Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 395, 99 S. Ct. 675, 58 L. Ed. 2d 596 (1979). See Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703,  732, 120 S. Ct. 2480, 147 L. Ed. 2d 597 (2000) (rejecting vagueness challenge premised on failure of  [*416]   statute to provide  [**340]  people of ordinary intelligence with reasonable opportunity to understand prohibited  conduct where statute contained requirement of scienter); Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 102, 65 S. Ct.  1031, 89 L. Ed. 1495 (1945) (plurality opinion) (“where the punishment imposed is only for an act knowingly done  with the purpose of doing [***20]  that which the statute prohibits, the accused cannot be said to suffer from lack of  warning or knowledge that the act which he does is a violation of law”). HN10[ ] The language of G. L. c. 265, § 50 (a), requiring the knowing commission of specified acts for the purpose  of enabling or causing another person to engage in commercial sexual activity defines with sufficient clarity the  prohibited conduct. As a consequence, the statute provides comprehensible standards for law enforcement that  discourage arbitrary arrests and prosecutions. What the defendants characterize as “merely assisting” an adult  consenting prostitute will still constitute the crime of sex trafficking in those circumstances where all of the  statutory elements have been satisfied. The absence of any element, notably mens rea, will negate criminality. In  this case, the defendants' actions fell squarely within the conduct unambiguously proscribed by G. L. c. 265, § 50  (a). Contrary to the defendants' contentions, HN11[ ] G. L. c. 265, § 50 (a), does not simply criminalize and punish  more harshly the same conduct already prohibited by G. L. c. 272, § 7. The substantive differences between the  two statutes are evident and meaningful. Therefore, the defendants' arguments that they could not have known  that [***21]  their so-called “pimping” activities would constitute sex trafficking are unavailing. HN12[ ] General Laws c. 272, § 7, provides, in relevant part, that “[w]hoever, knowing a person to be a prostitute,  shall live or derive support or maintenance, in whole or in part, from the earnings or proceeds of his prostitution …  shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for a period of five years and by a fine of [$5,000].” We have  explained that HN13[ ] “[a] conviction of deriving support from the earnings of a prostitute requires the jury to find  that a particular individual was a prostitute, that the defendant knew that the individual was a prostitute, and that  the defendant shared in some way in the earnings or proceeds of this person's prostitution.” Commonwealth v.  Purdy, 459 Mass. 442, 454 n.10, 945 N.E.2d 372 (2011). HN14[ ] The differences in the conduct prohibited by G. L. c. 272, § 7, and by G. L. c. 265, § 50 (a), are primarily  twofold. First, the  [*417]  language of G. L. c. 272, § 7, plainly states that the conduct prohibited by that statute is  the sharing of proceeds earned by a known prostitute. In contrast, under G. L. c. 265, § 50 (a), an individual who  knowingly enables or causes another person to engage in commercial sexual activity need not benefit, either  financially or by receiving something of value, from such conduct in order to be convicted of sex trafficking. [***22]   Indeed, as Sidney points out, he was found not guilty of violating G. L. c. 272, § 7, presumably because the  evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he shared in the money earned by C.C., S.E.,  and B.G. However, his commission of acts proscribed by G. L. c. 265, § 50 (a), resulted in his convictions of sex  trafficking. Second, the knowledge element of G. L. c. 272, § 7, is retrospective. That is to say, an individual  shares earnings or proceeds knowing that they came from an act of prostitution that already has occurred. In  contrast, the knowledge element of G. L. c. 265, § 50 (a), is prospective. An individual engages in statutorily  Page 16 of 22    [**341]  enumerated acts knowing that those acts will result in another person's anticipated engagement in  commercial sexual activity. Although it may appear to the defendants that G. L. c. 272, § 7, and G. L. c. 265, § 50  (a), criminalize essentially the same misconduct, they plainly do not. Therefore, the defendants had fair warning that  their so-called “pimping” activities could subject them to prosecution for deriving support from the earnings of a  prostitute, G. L. c. 272, § 7, as well as for trafficking of persons for sexual servitude, G. L. c. 265, § 50 (a). The defendants next contend that G. L. c. 265, § 50 (a), is unconstitutionally overbroad on its face because it  significantly infringes [***23]  on the right to freedom of association as guaranteed by the First Amendment. In their  view, because § 50 (a) lacks the element of force or coercion, it renders unlawful virtually any interaction between  family members, friends, or organizations and a known prostitute. We disagree. HN15[ ] “A clear and precise enactment may … be ‘overbroad’ if in its reach it prohibits constitutionally protected  conduct.” Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. v. Operation Rescue, 406 Mass. 701, 715, 550 N.E.2d 1361  (1990), quoting Grayned, 408 U.S. at 114. See Commonwealth v. Casey, 42 Mass. App. Ct. 512, 516, 678 N.E.2d  436 (1997).  [*418]  HN16[ ] Freedom of association encompasses “[a] right ‘to enter into and maintain certain  intimate human relationships,’ and a right ‘to associate for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by  the First Amendment — speech, assembly, petition for the redress of grievances, and the exercise of religion.’”  Concord Rod & Gun Club, Inc. v. Massachusetts Comm'n Against Discrimination, 402 Mass. 716, 721, 524 N.E.2d  1364 (1988), quoting Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 617-618, 104 S. Ct. 3244, 82 L. Ed. 2d 462  (1984). See Disler, 451 Mass. at 230. HN17[ ] “[W]here conduct and not merely speech is involved … the  overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute's plainly  legitimate sweep.” Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 615, 93 S. Ct. 2908, 37 L. Ed. 2d 830 (1973). See [***24]   Mendoza v. Licensing Bd. of Fall River, 444 Mass. 188, 200, 827 N.E.2d 180 (2005). HN18[ ] Given that facial  challenges to the constitutionality of a law greatly increase the number of persons who have standing to bring a  claim, the Supreme Court has cautioned that the overbreadth doctrine is to be employed “sparingly and only as a  last resort.” Broadrick, supra at 613. See Commonwealth v. Provost, 418 Mass. 416, 422-423, 636 N.E.2d 1312  (1994); Commonwealth v. Abramms, 66 Mass. App. Ct. 576, 580, 849 N.E.2d 867 (2006). HN19[ ] General Laws c. 265, § 50 (a), does not prohibit all interactions or associations between a prostitute and  family members, friends, or social service organizations. Rather, it forbids such individuals or entities from  knowingly undertaking specified activities that will enable or cause another person to engage in commercial sexual  activity. Conduct of this nature is afforded no constitutional protection. See generally Arcara v. Cloud Books & News  Store, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 698-699, 705, 707, 106 S. Ct. 3172, 92 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1986) (prostitution and lewdness  on premises of “adult” bookstore not protected under First Amendment);  [**342]  Commonwealth v. Walter, 388  Mass. 460, 464, 446 N.E.2d 707 (1983) (constitutional right to privacy not extended to one engaged in  prostitution); State v. Theriault, 157 N.H. 215, 219, 949 A.2d 678 (2008), quoting Webb v. State, 575 N.E.2d 1066,  1070 (Ind. Ct. App. 1991) (“Certainly prostitution is not a constitutionally protected activity”). Accordingly, the  defendants' claims that the statute is overbroad must fail. Finally, the defendants contend that the phrase “commercial sexual activity” as used in G. L. c. 265, § 50 (a), and  as defined by G. L. c. 265, § 49, and by the judge in her jury instructions, is overbroad. In their view, this  phrase [***25]  can encompass many noncriminal sexually oriented activities where money exchanges hands,  including “telephone sex” services, nude dancing, online  [*419]  “chat” sessions, and adult pay-per-view television  shows. That being the case, the defendants continue, the overly broad definition of “commercial sexual activity”  should render G. L. c. 265, § 50 (a), unconstitutional. We disagree.    Page 17 of 22   General Laws c. 265, § 49, defines “[c]ommercial sexual activity” as “any sexual act on account of which anything of  value is given, promised to or received by any person.” The phrase “sexual act” is not further defined in the  statute. HN20[ ] Under well-established principles of statutory construction, “a statute must be interpreted  according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved  usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be  remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.”  Commonwealth v. Figueroa, 464 Mass. 365, 368, 982 N.E.2d 1173 (2013), quoting Harvard Crimson, Inc. v.  President & Fellows of Harvard College, 445 Mass. 745, 749, 840 N.E.2d 518 (2006). The purpose and intent of the  Legislature in enacting G. L. c. 265, § 50 (a), was to prohibit the trafficking of persons for sexual servitude, not to  prohibit all range of sexually oriented activities and expressions. [***26]  Mindful of this distinction, we HN21[ ]  construe the term “commercial sexual activity” as referring to any sexual act for value that involves physical contact.  See G. L. c. 265, § 49. See also Suliveres v. Commonwealth, 449 Mass. 112, 118, 865 N.E.2d 1086 (2007) (“sex  act” includes sexual intercourse); Commonwealth v. Walter, 388 Mass. 460, 463-464, 446 N.E.2d 707 (1983)  (“sexual activity” encompasses coitus, oral-genital contact, and digital manipulation of another person's genitals for  fee). See generally United States v. Taylor, 640 F.3d 255, 258 (7th Cir. 2011) (“sexual act” involves physical   [*420]  contact). This interpretation is consistent with the plain language of G. L. c. 265, § 50 (a), gives force to the  Legislature's  [**343]  intent to protect victims of sex trafficking, and avoids any potential constitutional problems.  As so construed, we believe the statute “avoids any overbreadth problems, and ‘whatever overbreadth may exist  should be cured through case-by-case analysis of the fact situations to which its sanctions, assertedly, may not be  applied.’” Provost, 418 Mass. at 423, quoting Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 615-616. See Disler, 451 Mass. at 229. 3. Substantive admission of grand jury testimony. We begin with some pertinent background. At trial, S.E. testified  that, prior to meeting the defendants, she made the acquaintance of a man named Ray and his cousin, Ethel  Watler. On the day they met, S.E. accompanied Ray to his apartment, where they “hung out.” Later in the  evening, S.E. and Watler went to another man's house where each woman had sex with the man for money. When  the women returned to Ray's apartment, Watler and Ray took the money that S.E. had earned, allowing her  to [***28]  keep only twenty dollars for medication. The next morning, S.E. went to a methadone clinic, she did not  return to Ray's apartment, and she never saw Watler and Ray again. Watler testified at trial pursuant to a grant of immunity. See G. L. c. 233, § 20E. She described her work as a dancer  and an escort. Watler said that she met Tyshaun probably one month after her encounter with S.E., and stated that  she would see Tyshaun two or three times a week. She acknowledged that they had engaged in a sexual  relationship. Watler testified about the evening she had spent in the company of S.E., and she said that she had  told Tyshaun about that evening and had shown him photographs of S.E. When the prosecutor asked Watler  whether Tyshaun had taken photographs of Watler to be posted on Backpage.com, Watler stated that she did not  remember because she had been doing drugs at the time. Watler responded in a similar fashion when the  prosecutor asked her about any conversations she may have had with Tyshaun regarding S.E. and the other  women. The prosecutor attempted, unsuccessfully, to refresh Watler's recollection by having her read to herself portions of  her grand [***29]  jury testimony. Consequently, the prosecutor asked the judge to allow the Commonwealth to use            Page 18 of 22   Watler's grand jury testimony  [*421]  substantively. The judge instructed the prosecutor to lay more of a foundation  regarding Watler's inability to remember facts to which she had testified before the grand jury, namely the  defendants' activities and admissions. After Watler continued to profess her inability to remember such facts, the  prosecutor again asked for the admission of Watler's grand jury testimony. The judge allowed portions of such  testimony to be admitted substantively over the defendants' objections after finding that Watler was feigning a lack  of memory, and that her grand jury testimony did not appear to have been coerced. As to the latter finding, the  judge stated that Watler frequently volunteered additional information in response to the questions she was asked.  The judge also pointed out that because Watler was present in court, defense counsel  [**344]  would have the  opportunity to cross-examine her. The prosecutor proceeded to question Watler, who then read portions of her grand jury testimony in evidence.  Watler stated that Tyshaun told her that S.E. “was making money,” and that he and Sidney had engaged in a  “threesome” with S.E. at the house on Dudley Street. Watler identified the Eustis Street apartment as a place where  Tyshaun told her he had rented rooms, and where he said Watler could bring “customers.” Watler testified that  Tyshaun had taken photographs of her in the bathroom of the Dudley Street apartment, and that he had paid for her  online advertisements with a credit card. Watler further testified that Tyshaun had told her that “he had two white  girls [who] had left him” and that he wished he had S.E. because “she made a lot of money.” On cross-examination,  Watler stated that prior to giving her grand jury testimony, she had asked to consult with an attorney but was told by  someone in the district attorney's office that she did not need an attorney because she “wasn't in any trouble.” She  agreed with defense counsel that her grand jury testimony was what she thought the Commonwealth  wanted [***31]  to hear because “they had a whole bunch of stuff on [her].” Watler testified that S.E. had been a  prostitute before the two women had  [*422]  met, and that S.E. wanted to make money in exchange for sex and  had been “a willing participant.” She also testified that her conversations about S.E. had been with Tyshaun, not  Sidney. On appeal, the defendants contend that the substantive admission of Watler's grand jury testimony was improper.  They argue that they could not cross-examine Watler effectively at trial because of her lack of memory, and the  evidence failed to support the judge's finding that Watler was feigning memory loss. The defendants further assert  that Watler's grand jury testimony was not free from coercion. They point out that she was aware of potential  criminal charges against her if she did not cooperate [***32]  with the Commonwealth, and was not granted  immunity until she testified at trial. Finally, the defendants argue that the substantive admission of Watler's grand  jury testimony was gravely prejudicial, as evidenced by the jury's request for a transcript of this testimony during  their deliberations. We are not persuaded by the defendants' arguments and conclude that the judge did not err. HN22[ ] Generally speaking, Massachusetts has adhered to the traditional rule that prior inconsistent statements  of a witness may be introduced at trial only for the purpose of impeachment. See Commonwealth v. Bookman, 386  Mass. 657, 665, 436 N.E.2d 1228 (1982). See also Mass. G. Evid. § 801(d)(1)(A) (2015). However, in  Commonwealth v. Daye, 393 Mass. 55, 71-75, 469 N.E.2d 483 (1984), as modified by Commonwealth v. Cong Duc  Le, 444 Mass. 431, 432 n.3, 828 N.E.2d 501 (2005), this court deviated from the traditional rule, holding that prior  inconsistent statements by a witness before a grand jury can be admitted as substantive evidence if certain  conditions are met. See Commonwealth v. Stewart, 454 Mass. 527, 533, 911 N.E.2d 161 (2009); Mass. G. Evid.,  supra. First, there has to be an opportunity for effective  [**345]  cross-examination of the witness at trial. See  Daye, supra at 73. “When the witness at trial has no recollection of the events to which the statement relates, this          Page 19 of 22   requirement of an opportunity for meaningful cross-examination is not met.” Id. Second, the statement has to be  “that of the witness, [***33]  rather than the interrogator.” Id. at 74. That is to say, it must be clear that “the  statement was not coerced and was more than a mere confirmation or denial of an allegation by the interrogator.”  Id. at 75. In addition, “apart from these requirements for admissibility of the prior grand jury testimony as substantive  evidence, when that testimony concerns an essential element of the crime, the Commonwealth must offer  [*423]   at least some corroborative evidence if there is to be sufficient evidence to warrant a conviction.” Commonwealth v.  Clements, 436 Mass. 190, 192-193, 763 N.E.2d 55 (2002). See Daye, supra at 74-75. This corroboration  requirement concerns the sufficiency of the evidence, not its admissibility. See Clements, supra. In Commonwealth v. Sineiro, 432 Mass. 735, 745, 740 N.E.2d 602 & n.12 (2000), we extended HN23[ ] the  holding of Daye to include grand jury testimony of a witness who a trial judge determines is “falsifying a lack of  memory.” See Commonwealth v. Maldonado, 466 Mass. 742, 755-756, 2 N.E.3d 145, cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 2312,  189 L. Ed. 2d 192 (2014). “As one commentator has aptly stated: ‘[T]he tendency of unwilling or untruthful  witnesses to seek refuge in a claim of forgetfulness is well recognized. Hence the judge may be warranted in  concluding under the circumstances the claimed lack of memory of the event is untrue and in effect an implied  denial of the prior statement, thus qualifying it as inconsistent.’” Sineiro, supra at 742, quoting [***34]  2 McCormick,  Evidence § 251, at 117 (5th ed. 1999). “Before a witness's grand jury testimony may be admitted under the Daye- Sineiro rule, the judge must make a preliminary finding that the witness's claimed lack of memory has been  fabricated. If that finding is made and is supported by the evidence, it is conclusive.” Commonwealth v. Evans, 439  Mass. 184, 190, 786 N.E.2d 375, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 923, 124 S. Ct. 323, 157 L. Ed. 2d 222 (2003). See Sineiro,  supra at 742-743 & n.6. Once the judge makes a finding of feigned memory, the witness's prior grand jury testimony  may be admitted in evidence for substantive consideration provided that the testimony was not coerced and the  witness is present at trial for cross-examination. See id. at 745 & n.12. Here, the judge acted well within her discretion in finding that Watler was feigning memory loss with respect to the  defendants' activities and admissions concerning S.E. The judge was able to observe Watler's demeanor on the  witness stand and to assess her ability to remember many of her interactions and conversations with Tyshaun, but  not those that had a bearing on the specific facts of this case. As the judge properly found, Watler was available for  cross-examination at trial, and defense counsel took advantage of that opportunity by eliciting testimony that  provided [***35]  context to Watler's grand jury testimony and enabled the jury to evaluate its accuracy. We discern  no error in the judge's determination that Watler's testimony before the grand jury was not coerced. Moreover,  defense counsel raised and explored the possibility of coercion during cross-examination. The judge properly  allowed the substantive admission of limited portions of Watler's  [*424]  grand jury testimony. 4. Cross-examination regarding pending criminal charges. The defendants  [**346]  contend that the judge violated  their right to confrontation by hindering cross-examination of C.C. regarding criminal charges pending against her.  They assert that because a defendant is entitled to reasonable cross-examination of a prosecution witness for the  purpose of showing bias, the judge abused her discretion by precluding defense counsel from impeaching C.C. with  evidence that she had been charged with several drug-related offenses. In the defendants' view, where C.C.  testified that she had been told that the district attorney was not interested in prosecuting her, the defendants  should have been allowed to explore the possibility that she might have been biased in favor of the Commonwealth.  Alternatively, [***36]  the defendants argue that their trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to seek  the introduction of the pending charges against C.C., which could have demonstrated her bias and negated her  credibility. Following an incident that occurred approximately three months after C.C. testified before the grand jury in the  present case, C.C. was charged in the Taunton Division of the District Court Department with possession of a class  A controlled substance, operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of drugs, and being present where  heroin was kept. The Commonwealth filed a motion in limine to preclude any reference to these charges at trial.  After a hearing, the motion was allowed. At trial, before the commencement of empanelment, counsel for Tyshaun  informed the judge that he did not intend to introduce any evidence of such charges, stating, “I don't really see how  a pending charge is going to come in.” Similarly, although not entirely clear from the trial transcript, it appears that  counsel for Sidney did not object to the exclusion of testimony concerning the pending criminal charges against  Page 20 of 22   C.C. To the extent that he did argue for the admissibility of such evidence, [***37]  the basis for his argument was  that evidence of C.C.'s drug use was relevant to her ability to remember what had happened to her, which pertained  to her credibility. Neither defense attorney mentioned the issue of bias. In response to a question from the judge,  the prosecutor represented that the Commonwealth had not made or offered any promises, rewards, or  inducements relating to the pending criminal charges. HN24[ ] As a general matter, “[a]rrest or indictment alone is insufficient for general impeachment purposes.”  Commonwealth v. Haywood,  [*425]  377 Mass. 755, 759, 388 N.E.2d 648 (1979). See G. L. c. 233, § 21. See also  Commonwealth v. Bregoli, 431 Mass. 265, 275, 727 N.E.2d 59 (2000) (witness cannot be impeached by use of  specific act of misconduct not resulting in conviction). However, “it is well established that a criminal defendant is  ‘entitled, as of right, to reasonable cross-examination of a witness for the purpose of showing bias, particularly  where that witness may have a motivation to seek favor with the government.’” Haywood, supra at 760, quoting  Commonwealth v. Dougan, 377 Mass. 303, 310, 386 N.E.2d 1 (1979). See Commonwealth v. Henson, 394 Mass.  584, 586-587, 476 N.E.2d 947 (1985). “A defendant has the right to bring to the jury's attention any ‘circumstance  which may materially affect’ the testimony of an adverse witness which might lead the jury to find that the witness is  under an ‘influence to prevaricate.’” Haywood, supra, quoting Commonwealth v. Marcellino, 271 Mass. 325, 327,  171 N.E. 451 (1930). It follows that a defendant may [***38]  question a witness about pending criminal charges in  order to show that the witness has a motive to cooperate with the Commonwealth. See Commonwealth v. Meas,  467 Mass. 434, 449-450, 5 N.E.3d  [**347]  864, cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 150, 190 L. Ed. 2d 110 (2014), quoting  Commonwealth v. Carmona, 428 Mass. 268, 270, 700 N.E.2d 823 (1998). See also Henson, supra. However, we  have recognized that evidence of an adverse witness's prior arrest is not admissible “in all circumstances.”  Haywood, supra at 761. See Commonwealth v. Santos, 376 Mass. 920, 924-926, 384 N.E.2d 1202 (1978);  Commonwealth v. Allen, 29 Mass. App. Ct. 373, 378, 560 N.E.2d 704 (1990). See also Dougan, supra (judge has  broad discretion in circumscribing proper scope of cross-examination). “[A] defendant is required to furnish some  persuasive explanation why the arrest might indicate bias or a motive to lie.” Allen, supra. See Commonwealth v.  Two Juveniles, 397 Mass. 261, 267, 491 N.E.2d 234 (1986). The explanation is necessary in order for the judge to  “make an appraisal of the materiality of the testimony sought in light of [the defendant's] right ‘to show specific bias  or motive to prevaricate on the part of the government witness.’” Haywood, supra, quoting Santos, supra at 924.  See Allen, supra. In this case, defense counsel made no mention to the trial judge of wanting to use the pending criminal charges  against C.C. to show that, in their view, she was biased in favor of the Commonwealth. There also was no evidence  to suggest that after C.C. was charged with the three drug-related offenses, she changed her version [***39]  of the  events that had transpired with the defendants. We conclude that the judge did not abuse her discretion in  precluding  [*426]  any reference to these charges at trial. In addition, contrary to the defendants' assertions, there  was no ineffective assistance of counsel. During cross-examination of C.C., although counsel for Tyshaun did not  raise the three drug-related offenses pending against her, he did pursue a line of inquiry about whether the  Commonwealth had agreed not to prosecute C.C. for any crimes that she may have committed while she was with  the defendants in exchange for her cooperation and testimony against them. C.C. acknowledged that she had not  been prosecuted for any such crimes, and that someone from the district attorney's office had told her that the  Commonwealth had no interest in prosecuting her. This line of questioning served to alert the jury to the issue of  possible bias, and the jury could consider the matter during their deliberations. 5. Cross-examination regarding history of prostitution. The defendants contend that the judge also violated their  right to confrontation by hindering cross-examination of C.C. regarding her history of prostitution. In their  view, [***40]  the judge erroneously relied on the rape shield statute, G. L. c. 233, § 21B, to prevent such a line of  inquiry. The defendants argue that they were not attempting to elicit evidence of C.C.'s promiscuity as part of a  general credibility attack. Rather, the defendants continue, they sought to show the jury that, contrary to the     Page 21 of 22   Commonwealth's assertion that they forced C.C. into prostitution, C.C. was a willing participant who had a history  of engaging in such activities. We conclude that the judge did not err in excluding evidence of C.C.'s purported  history of prostitution. HN25[ ] A trial judge has broad discretion to determine the proper scope of  [**348]  cross-examination. See  Commonwealth v. Mountry, 463 Mass. 80, 86, 972 N.E.2d 438 (2012); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 431 Mass. 535,  538, 728 N.E.2d 281 (2000). “If a defendant believes that the judge improperly restrained his cross-examination of a  witness, the defendant must demonstrate that the judge abused [her] discretion and that he was prejudiced by such  restraint.” Commonwealth v. Sealy, 467 Mass. 617, 624, 6 N.E.3d 1052 (2014), quoting Commonwealth v. Barnes,  399 Mass. 385, 393, 504 N.E.2d 624 (1987). HN26[ ] General Laws c. 233, § 21B, provides, in relevant part, that [***41]  “[e]vidence of the reputation of a  victim's sexual conduct shall  [*427]  not be admissible in an investigation or proceeding before a grand jury or a  court of the commonwealth for a violation of [G. L. c. 265, § 50].” HN27[ ] The primary purpose of the rape shield  statute is “to prevent a general credibility attack of a victim with evidence of his or her promiscuity.” Mountry, 463  Mass. at 86. Among the reasons for barring the admission of such evidence is that it has little probative value on  the issue of consent because the “victim's consent to intercourse with one man does not imply her consent in the  case of another.” Commonwealth v. Harris, 443 Mass. 714, 722-723, 825 N.E.2d 58 (2005), quoting  Commonwealth v. McKay, 363 Mass. 220, 227, 294 N.E.2d 213 (1973). Irrespective of how the defendants have couched their arguments, they seem to be asserting that because C.C.  purportedly engaged in prostitution in the past, she effectively consented to the defendants' malfeasance, and the  jury should have had the opportunity to consider this evidence. We disagree. As the judge properly determined, the  introduction of evidence pertaining to C.C.'s past sexual conduct with others was plainly barred by G. L. c. 233, §  21B. Moreover, as we have discussed, coercion is not an element of the crime of sex trafficking. See G. L. c.  265, § 50 (a). That being the case, it was irrelevant whether C.C. was a willing participant in the [***42]  defendants'  activities. The exclusion of evidence pertaining to C.C.'s alleged history of prostitution had no bearing on whether  the defendants violated G. L. c. 265, § 50 (a), and such exclusion did not prejudice the defendants' cases. 6. Illegal sentences. Tyshaun contends that his sentences for two counts of deriving support from the earnings of a  prostitute were illegal. He points out that although the applicable statute, G. L. c. 272, § 7, mandates a minimum  sentence of two years and a maximum sentence of five years, he was sentenced to the State prison for a term of  from five years to five years and one day. Therefore, he continues, the judge exceeded the maximum sentence  allowed under G. L. c. 272, § 7. We agree. HN28[ ] “An illegal sentence is one that is not permitted by law for the offense committed.” Commonwealth v.  McGuinness, 421 Mass.  [*428]  472, 475, 658 N.E.2d 150 (1995). See Commonwealth v. Layne, 21 Mass. App.  Ct. 17, 19, 483 N.E.2d 827 (1985) (“An ‘illegal sentence’ is one that is in excess of the punishment [***43]   prescribed by the relevant statutory provision or in some way contrary to the applicable statute”). HN29[ ] General  Laws c. 272, § 7, provides, in relevant part:  [**349] “Whoever, knowing a person to be a prostitute, shall live or derive support or maintenance, in  whole or in part, from the earnings or proceeds of his prostitution … shall be punished by imprisonment in the  state prison for a period of five years and by a fine of [$5,000]. “The sentence of imprisonment imposed under this section shall not be reduced to less than two years, nor  suspended, nor shall any person convicted under this section be eligible for probation, parole, or furlough or       Page 22 of 22   receive any deduction from his sentence for good conduct or otherwise until he shall have served two years of  such sentence.” We have construed HN30[ ] this statute as imposing a maximum term of five years and a minimum term of two  years. See Commonwealth v. Lightfoot, 391 Mass. 718, 721, 463 N.E.2d 545 (1984). The punishment imposed on  Tyshaun was in excess of the statute given that G. L. c. 272, § 7, does not permit a maximum sentence of five  years and one day. Accordingly, Tyshaun's sentences for his convictions of deriving support from the earnings of a  prostitute must be revised to reflect maximum sentences of five years. 7. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, [***44]  the judgments of conviction on the indictments charging Tyshaun  with trafficking persons for sexual servitude and deriving support from the earnings of a prostitute are affirmed.  His sentences following the judgments of conviction on the indictments charging him with deriving support from the  earnings of a prostitute are vacated, and those cases are remanded to the Superior Court for resentencing  consistent with this opinion. The judgments of conviction on the indictments charging Sidney with trafficking  persons for sexual servitude are affirmed. So ordered.",1
"United States v. Raniere, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71679","ORDER Page 2 of 2   NICHOLAS G. GARAUFIS, United States District Judge. Defendant Keith Raniere has been indicted on charges of racketeering conspiracy, racketeering, forced labor  conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, sex trafficking conspiracy, sex trafficking, and attempted sex trafficking.  (Second Superseding Indictment ¶¶ 13-40; 44-48.) On January 9, 2019, Raniere filed a motion to suppress certain  evidence and request for a hearing pursuant to Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d 667  (1978) (the ""Motion""). (See Mot. to Suppress (""Mot."") (Dkt. 269); Mem. in Support of Mot. (Dkt. 269-1).) This court  referred the Motion to Magistrate Judge Vera M. Scanlon fora report and recommendation (""R&R""). (See Feb. 6,  2019 Min. Entry.) On March 14, 2019, Judge Scanlon issued an R&R in which she recommended that the court  deny the Motion in its entirety. (See R&R (Dkt. 451) at 1.) On March 28, 2019, Raniere informed the court that after reviewing the R&R, he ""concluded that [he] do[es] not  have a basis to set aside its findings."" (Letter re: R&R (Dkt. 476).) The time to object to the R&R has also passed.  See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C); Fed. R. Crim. P. 59(a). The court therefore reviews the R&R [*3]  for clear error. See  28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A); Fed. R.

Nov. 19, 2014) (""To accept those portions of the R & R to  which no timely objection has been made, a district court need only satisfy itself that there is no clear error on the  face of the record.""

"State v. Davis, 2023-Ohio-4389","B, Judge.  [*P1]  Before accepting defendant-appellant Gary Lee  Davis's guilty plea, the trial court mistakenly advised him  that he faced a discretionary two-year period of  postrelease control if convicted of robbery under R.C.  2911.02(A)(2). The trial court ultimately imposed a  mandatory one-to-three-year [**2]  period of postrelease  control as was required by R.C. 2967.28. We hold that  Davis entered a guilty plea without understanding the  maximum penalty. Therefore, we reverse the trial court's  judgment and vacate Davis's guilty plea. I. Facts and Procedure  [*P2]  Davis was charged with robbery in violation of  R.C. 2911.02(A)(2). He initially pleaded not guilty.  Following a series of unsuccessful pretrial motions,  Davis signed a written form withdrawing his not-guilty  plea and pleading guilty to an amended charge of third- degree felony robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(3).  [*P3]  At the plea hearing, the state explained that the  charge stemmed from an October 2020 robbery of a  Page 2 of 4 PNC bank branch, where Davis held up a note to bank  employees which read ""give me the money."" Davis's  counsel clarified, ""there was no weapon, or any actual  threat verbalized."" As the trial court proceeded through  its colloquy, it informed Davis that he faced ""from 9 to 36  months in prison,"" and following his release he ""could  be placed on up to two years of post-release control"" for  the offense. The trial court accepted his plea.  [*P4]  At the sentencing hearing, the state recounted  Davis's criminal record, explaining that the robbery in  this case occurred while Davis was on supervised [**3]   release. The trial court imposed a 36-month sentence  consecutive to the sentences in two cases from  Montgomery County, Ohio. The trial court found that  consecutive sentences were necessary because he was  under postrelease control when he committed the  offense and due to his criminal history. In addition, the  trial court imposed a mandatory one-to-three-year  period of postrelease control.  [*P5]  In two assignments of error, Davis challenges his  plea and sentence. II. Law and Analysis  [*P6]  Davis's first assignment of error argues that the  trial court erroneously informed him during its plea  colloquy that he faced a discretionary two-year period of  postrelease control. But R.C. 2967.28 required the trial  court  to  impose  a  one-to-three-year  period  of  postrelease control. Davis maintains that the trial court  breached its duty to advise him of the maximum penalty  under Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a). A. Trial courts must ensure defendants understand the  effect of their pleas.  [*P7]  A defendant's decision to enter a guilty plea is a  solemn and serious one, filled with promise and peril.  State v. Bishop, 156 Ohio St. 3d 156, 2018-Ohio-5132,  124 N.E.3d 766, ¶ 10. Because a guilty plea operates as  a waiver of several constitutional rights, the validity of a  guilty plea turns on whether that plea was ""done  voluntarily, knowingly, [**4]  and intelligently, 'with  sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and  likely consequences.'"" Bradshaw v. Stumpf, 545 U.S.  175, 183, 125 S.Ct. 2398, 162 L.Ed.2d 143 (2005),  quoting Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 748, 90  S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970).  [*P8]  For felony offenses like Davis's, a trial court  ""shall not accept a plea of guilty or no contest without * *  * [d]etermining that the defendant is making the plea  voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the  charges and of the maximum penalty involved."" Crim.R.  11(C)(2)(a). A trial court must ""'convey to the defendant  certain information so that he can make a voluntary and  intelligent decision whether to plead guilty.'"" State v.  Brinkman, 165 Ohio St. 3d 523, 2021-Ohio-2473, 180  N.E.3d 1074, ¶ 17, quoting State v. Veney, 120 Ohio St.  3d 176, 2008-Ohio-5200, 897 N.E.2d 621, ¶ 18.  [*P9]  Postrelease control is a sanction, ""an additional  term of supervision after an offender's release from  prison that imposes certain restrictions on the offender.""  State v. Bates, 167 Ohio St. 3d 197, 2022-Ohio-475,  190 N.E.3d 610, ¶ 21. It is ""part of the 'maximum penalty  involved' in instances where the trial court imposes a  prison term."" State v. Sullivan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos.  111621 and 111917, 2023-Ohio-1036, ¶ 13. Here, the  trial court accurately explained to Davis that he faced 9  to 36 months in prison. Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) required the  trial court to ensure that Davis understood the maximum  term of postrelease control that he would face.  [*P10]  The right to be informed of the maximum  penalty is nonconstitutional, requiring only substantial  compliance with the rule. State v. Morris, 1st Dist.  Hamilton  No.  C-180520,  2019-Ohio-3011,  ¶  16.  ""Substantial  compliance  'means  that  under  the  totality [**5]  of the circumstances the defendant  subjectively understands the implications of his plea and  the rights he is waiving.'"" Id., quoting State v. Nero, 56  Ohio St.3d 106, 108, 564 N.E.2d 474 (1990). But when  ""a trial court fails to substantially comply with Crim.R. 11  regarding a nonconstitutional provision, a reviewing  court must determine whether the trial court partially  complied or failed to comply with the rule."" State v.  Stumph, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-190318, 2021-Ohio- 723, ¶ 8, citing Morris at ¶ 18, and State v. Clark, 119  Ohio St. 3d 239, 2008-Ohio-3748, 893 N.E.2d 462, ¶ 32. B. The trial court failed to comply with Crim.R. 11.  [*P11]  Davis pleaded guilty to robbery in violation of  R.C. 2911.02(A)(3), a third-degree felony. Robbery is an  offense of violence. See R.C. 2901.01(A)(9)(a). The  duration of postrelease control for a third-degree felony  depends on the nature of the offense. See R.C.  2967.28. A defendant convicted of a third-degree felony  ""that is an offense of violence and is not a felony sex  offense [faces] up to three years, but not less than one  year"" of postrelease control. R.C. 2967.28(B)(4). In  Page 3 of 4 contrast, a defendant convicted of a third-degree felony  that is a sex offense faces up to five years of  postrelease control. R.C. 2967.28(B)(1). And if the third- degree felony is neither an offense of violence nor a sex  offense, a defendant faces ""up to two years"" of  postrelease control at the discretion of the parole board.  R.C. 2967.28(C).  [*P12]  The trial court informed Davis, ""[I]f I would send  you to prison, [**6]  upon your release from prison, you  could be placed on up to two years of post-release  control."" The state acknowledges that the trial court  mistakenly advised Davis that he was subject to a  discretionary two-year period of postrelease control but  argues that the plea form provided sufficient notice of  the maximum penalty. We disagree.  [*P13]  The plea form explained that Davis was  pleading guilty to ""Robbery/2911.02(A)(3),"" which is an  ""F3"" with a potential sentence of ""9-36 MOS"" and a  $10,000 maximum fine. While the form indicated that  Davis faced one to three years of postrelease control for  a third-degree felony offense of violence, it also  indicated that he faced ""up to two years as determined  by the parole board for * * * a felony of the third degree  (F3) which does not involve physical harm or threatened  physical harm to a person."" The form failed to specify  that Davis pleaded guilty to an offense involving actual  or threatened physical harm. Rather, it merely identified  robbery as a third-degree felony, while also describing  two potential terms of postrelease control.  [*P14]  At the plea hearing, the state explained the  factual basis for the offense—that Davis ""knowingly  inflicted, attempted to inflict, [**7]  or threatened to inflict  physical harm on another."" But Davis's counsel  emphasized that the robbery consisted of ""a note that  said give me the money, that there was no weapon or  actual threat verbalized."" Later, the trial court asked  Davis if he understood that ""upon your release from  prison, you could be placed on up to two years of post- release control?""  [*P15]  Considering the conflicting information provided  to Davis at the plea hearing, we cannot conclude that  the trial court ensured that Davis had a full  understanding of the consequences of his guilty plea.  We hold that the trial court did not substantially comply  with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a)'s mandate requiring it to  determine that Davis entered his plea with an  understanding of the maximum penalty involved.  [*P16]  Next, we ""must determine whether the trial court  partially complied or failed to comply with the rule.""  Morris, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-180520, 2019-Ohio- 3011, ¶ 17, citing State v. Clark, 119 Ohio St. 3d 239,  2008-Ohio-3748, 893 N.E.2d 462, ¶ 32. Absent a  complete failure to comply with Crim.R. 11(C), a guilty  ""plea  may  only  be  vacated  if  the  defendant  demonstrates prejudice."" Id., citing Clark at ¶ 32. Davis  has not argued that the trial court's incorrect statement  constituted a complete failure, so to demonstrate  prejudice he must show ""'that he would not have  otherwise pled had the court complied with Crim.R.  11(C) [**8] .'"" State v. Fleming, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C- 210297, 2022-Ohio-740, ¶ 6, quoting State v. Littleton,  1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-150056 and C-150057, 2015- Ohio-4143, ¶ 9, citing State v. Nero, 56 Ohio St.3d 106,  108, 564 N.E.2d 474 (1990).  [*P17]   Davis  maintains  that  the  trial  court's  misstatement was prejudicial because his sentence  factored into his decision to enter a plea. As we have  explained, ""[t]he potential sentence hanging over a  pleading defendant is one of the important matters on  his mind, if not the most important."" State v. Wilson, 55  Ohio App.2d 64, 66, 379 N.E.2d 273 (1st Dist.1978).  Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a)'s prescription reflects the principle  that knowledge of the maximum penalty affects a  defendant's ""ability to weigh the risks of taking the case  to trial and perhaps facing a maximum sentence, versus  entering a plea and perhaps receiving a more lenient  sentence."" State v. Allen, 2d Dist. Miami Nos. 2021-CA- 31 and 2021-CA-32, 2022-Ohio-1872, ¶ 9, citing State v.  Burnett, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2013-CA-98, 2016-Ohio- 2655, ¶ 11. ""When a defendant receives a sentence that  exceeds what the trial court previously informed the  defendant was the maximum penalty, the prejudice is  apparent on its face."" State v. Tackett, 8th Dist.  Cuyahoga No. 111998, 2023-Ohio-2298, ¶ 22, 221  N.E.3d 172, citing State v. Drake, 9th Dist. Medina No.  16CA0056-M, 2017-Ohio-4027, ¶ 12.  [*P18]  The record demonstrates that the length of his  potential sentence influenced Davis's decision to enter  into a plea agreement. The trial court apprised Davis of  a discretionary two-year period of postrelease control,  but he ultimately received a mandatory one-to-three- year period of postrelease control. In other words, Davis  received a more severe maximum penalty than the trial  court initially explained.  [*P19]  We find that the sentence imposed by the [**9]   trial court prejudiced Davis. We sustain Davis's first  assignment of error. Davis's second assignment of error  challenging his sentence is moot and we decline to  address it. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c). Page 4 of 4",0
"D.H. v. Tucker Inn Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181264","ORDER This matter is before the Court on Tucker Inn Incorporated's (""Defendant"") Motion to Dismiss [Doc. 10]. This Court  finds as follows: BACKGROUND D.H. (""Plaintiff"") alleges that in September 2015, she was sex trafficked at the Super 8 (the ""Hotel"") when she was  fifteen years old. [Doc. 1, p. 3]. Plaintiff claims that her trafficker kept two rooms rented at the Hotel where she was  made to have sex with as many as twenty older men each day. Id. at 10-11. [*2]  According to Plaintiff, at all times  relevant to her trafficking, Defendant owned, controlled, operated, supervised and managed the Hotel where  Plaintiff was trafficked. Id. at 3, 7. Plaintiff contends that prior to and during her trafficking, prostitution and child sex trafficking was open, obvious and  rampant at the Hotel. Id. at 17-18. Plaintiff witnessed more than ten other sex traffickers operating openly at the  Page 2 of 6 Hotel and Plaintiff estimates that there were 100 or more buyers there each day. Id. at 9. Plaintiff also witnessed at  least twenty other victims being trafficked for sex at the Hotel. Id. Plaintiff describes seeing women and children  wearing lingerie or very little clothing throughout the Hotel. Id. Plaintiff also observed a constant stream of men  visiting the rooms of these women and children for short periods of time, one after another. Id. During her trafficking at the Hotel, Plaintiff alleges that she exhibited numerous well-known and visible signs  common to minor sex trafficking victims, including her age and inappropriate appearance, fatigue, sleep deprivation,  injuries, failure to make eye contact with others, loitering and solicitation of male patrons. Id. at 11. [*3]  Plaintiff  contends that her rooms also evidenced numerous well-known signs of sex trafficking such as many daily, older  male visitors, an excessive number of used condoms and towels and other sex-related paraphernalia. Id. at 11, 13.  Plaintiff's trafficker also paid cash received from Plaintiff's trafficking for an additional day every day at the Hotel,  which Plaintiff avers was an additional sign of sex trafficking. Id. at 12. Plaintiff contends that Defendant's employees had knowledge of and allowed, condoned, facilitated and/or ignored  the widespread prostitution and sex trafficking occurring at the Hotel. Id. at 18. As to Plaintiff specifically, Plaintiff  claims that she regularly interacted with the Hotel's employees and in one instance, an employee confronted  Plaintiff and asked if she was okay. Id. at 12-13. However, when Plaintiff told Defendant's employee that she was  not okay, the employee did nothing. Id. at 13. Moreover, Plaintiff contends that Defendant's employees knew or should have known generally about the sex  crimes being committed at the Hotel based on an extensive history of police reports regarding incidents relating to  sex crimes at the Hotel and public complaints [*4]  from the Hotel's patrons. Id. at 19-22, 24-27. Plaintiff points to  twenty incidents in the four years leading up to Plaintiff's trafficking where the police investigated and/or made  arrests for sex crimes at the Hotel. Id. at 19-22. Plaintiff also points to nine online reviews by patrons of the Hotel  which cited safety concerns and sex crimes that they observed taking place during their stay. Id. at 24-26.  Ultimately, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant provided a market and beds for traffickers to sell women and children for  sex which caused her trafficker to bring her to the Hotel to be sold for sex. Id. at 18. On August 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed this suit against Defendant alleging the following causes of action: (1) violation of  18 U.S.C. § 1595(a), known as the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (""TVPRA""); and (2) nuisance.  See id. In her Complaint, Plaintiff seeks damages including attorney's fees, costs and punitive damages under the  TVPRA and O.C.G.A. §§ 13-6-11, 9-11-68 and 9-15-14. Id. Defendant filed the instant Motion seeking dismissal of  all of Plaintiff's claims on September 21, 2022. [Doc. 10]. The Motion is now ripe for review. LEGAL STANDARD In evaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the court ""accept[s] the [*5]   allegations in the complaint as true and constru[es] them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff."" Traylor v. P'ship  Title Co., 491 F. App'x 988, 989 (11th Cir. 2012). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) provides that a pleading  must contain ""a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Although  detailed factual allegations are not necessarily required, the pleading must contain more than ""labels and  conclusions"" or a ""formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678,  129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). A complaint is insufficient if it only tenders naked assertions devoid of  further factual enhancement. Id. Importantly, ""a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true,  to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'"" Id. (citation omitted). At bottom, the complaint must contain  more than ""an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation,"" id., and must ""plead[] factual content  that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.""  Traylor, 491 F. App'x at 990 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). While all well-pleaded facts must be accepted as true  and construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, Powell v. Thomas, 643 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir. 2011), a  court need not accept as true the plaintiff's legal conclusions, including those couched as factual [*6]  allegations,  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181264, *2 Page 3 of 6 Accordingly, evaluation of a motion to dismiss requires two steps: (1) a court must eliminate any allegations in the  pleading that are merely legal conclusions, and (2) where there are remaining well-pleaded factual allegations, a  court must ""assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.""  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. ANALYSIS In its motion, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's TVPRA and nuisance claims should be dismissed. Defendant also  argues that Plaintiff's claims for attorney's fees, costs and punitive damages should be dismissed. The Court will  address each claim in turn. 1. TVPRA The TVPRA offers a civil remedy to victims of certain types of human trafficking. The civil remedy portion of the  TVPRA provides that a trafficking victim may bring a civil suit against a sex-trafficking perpetrator or ""whoever  knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a venture which that person  knew or should have known has engaged in an act in violation of [the TVPRA]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). In this case,  Plaintiff is not suing the perpetrator, but rather Defendant, who she claims knowingly benefited from the sex  trafficking. To state [*7]  a claim for beneficiary liability under the TVPRA, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that the  defendant: (1) knowingly benefited, (2) from taking part in a common undertaking or enterprise involving risk and potential  profit, (3) that undertaking or enterprise violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff, and (4) the defendant had  constructive or actual knowledge that the undertaking or enterprise violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff. Doe #1 v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 726 (11th Cir. 2021). As to the first element, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant ""knew it was receiving some value from  participating in the alleged venture."" Id. at 724. In this case, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant rented two rooms to  Plaintiff's trafficker and received cash from the room rental. This Court finds that the revenue from the room rental  constitutes a financial benefit sufficient to meet the ""knowingly benefited"" standard. See S.Y. v. Best W. Int'l, Inc.,  No. 2:20-cv-616, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106139, 2021 WL 2315073, at *5 (M.D. Fla. June 7, 2021); see also A.B. v.  H.K. Grp. of Co., No. 1:21-cv-1344, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29214, 2022 WL 467786, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 9, 2022)  (holding that the money received from room rentals constitutes a benefit, knowingly received). The second element requires a plaintiff to allege that a defendant participated in a venture. As to this element, the  Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has made clear that the definition of ""participation in a venture"" is not the same  as [*8]  that found in the criminal provisions of § 1591(e)(4). Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. Instead, in the civil  context, ""participation in a venture"" merely requires that a plaintiff allege that the defendant ""took part in a common  undertaking or enterprise involving risk and potential profit."" Id. at 725. In this case, Plaintiff has made the ""kinds of allegations [that] would establish a hotel operator's participation in a  venture with a sex trafficker."" Id. at 726. Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient because she alleges that Defendant            2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181264, *6 Page 4 of 6 had rented rooms to her trafficker and that Defendant knew or should have known that the trafficker was presently  engaged in sex trafficking with Plaintiff. Plaintiff's Complaint adequately sets forth the reasons why Defendant  should have been on notice of the sex trafficking and how it failed to prevent it. Plaintiff alleges that she regularly  interacted with Defendant's employees and exhibited well-known signs consistent with a trafficking victim.  Moreover, Plaintiff contends that one of Defendant's employees asked Plaintiff if she was okay then did nothing  when Plaintiff responded that she was not okay. At bottom, the allegations are sufficient to allege participation in a  venture. See Best W. Int'l, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106139, 2021 WL 2315073, at *4 (holding that it was [*9]   sufficient for a plaintiff to plead that the defendants participated in a venture by renting rooms to people it knew or  should have known were engaged in sex trafficking). As to the third element, a plaintiff must allege ""that the venture . . . violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff."" Red Roof  Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. The TVPRA criminalizes various acts of human trafficking. In this case, Plaintiff specifically  alleges that she was trafficked in violation of § 1591(a), which makes it a crime to cause a person who has not yet  attained the age of eighteen years to engage in a commercial sex act. Consequently, as to this element, Plaintiff  must therefore plead sufficient facts to plausibly allege that the venture in which Defendant participated committed a  crime against her. Defendant argues that this element is not satisfied because Plaintiff did not allege that Defendant knew or acted in  reckless disregard in furtherance of the alleged child sex trafficking venture. Defendant misstates the standard. In  fact, the Eleventh Circuit has determined that, to establish a violation of § 1591(a), it is sufficient that the plaintiff  allege that she was a minor when she was forced to engage in commercial sex acts and that the Defendant had a  reasonable [*10]  opportunity to observe her on the premises. See United States v. Whyte, 928 F.3d 1317, 1328  (11th Cir. 2019). Here, Plaintiff alleges that she was a minor when she was made to engage in commercial sex acts  with as many as twenty men each day. She further alleges that Defendant had ample opportunity to observe her in  common areas of the Hotel and through her frequent interactions with Defendant's employees, including the time  that Plaintiff told a front desk employee that she was not okay. This Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations are more  than sufficient to show that the venture violated the TVPRA as to Plaintiff. Finally, as to the last element, the allegations must show that a defendant had actual or constructive knowledge that  the venture violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff. Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Knowledge is defined as ""an  awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance."" Id. Conversely, constructive knowledge ""is that knowledge  which 'one using reasonable care or diligence should have.'"" Id. The Court finds that Plaintiff has adequately alleged that Defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of  Plaintiff's sex trafficking at the Hotel. In Plaintiff's Complaint, she alleges that Defendant knew or should have  known about the sex trafficking venture [*11]  based on the following: Plaintiff's age and inappropriate appearance,  her fatigue and sleep deprivation, her injuries, her failure to make eye contact with others, her loitering, her  solicitation of male patrons and the number of men visiting her room. Courts considering similar allegations have  found the allegations sufficient to infer that a defendant knew or should have known of the sex trafficking venture,  and the Court finds these allegations sufficient as well. S.Y. v. Naples Hotel Co., 476 F. Supp. 3d 1251, 1257 (M.D.  Fla. 2020) (collecting cases). As explained in the preceding paragraphs, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to support each element of her  TVPRA claim. As such, to the extent Defendant seeks dismissal of the TVPRA claim, Defendant's motion is  DENIED. 2. Nuisance The Court next evaluates whether Plaintiff adequately alleges a claim for nuisance. Under Georgia law, a nuisance  is defined as ""anything that causes hurt, inconvenience, or damage to another . . . ."" O.C.G.A § 41-1-1. To establish  a nuisance claim, a plaintiff must allege ""the existence of the nuisance complained of, that he or she has suffered  injury, and that the injury complained of was caused by the alleged nuisance."" Bord v. Hillman, 335 Ga. App. 18,  780 S.E.2d 725, 728 (Ga. Ct. App. 2015). Defendant argues that Plaintiff's nuisance claim should be [*12]   2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181264, *8 Page 5 of 6 dismissed because Plaintiff failed to assert that Defendant had control over the alleged harm suffered by Plaintiff. In  other words, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not alleged that Defendant, itself, caused Plaintiff to be sex  trafficked. Because Defendant only challenges Plaintiff's ability to establish the causation element of her nuisance  claim, this Court will focus its analysis on that element. Causation is an essential element of nuisance claims. Alexander v. Hulsey Env't Servs., Inc., 306 Ga. App. 459,  702 S.E.2d 435, 439 (Ga. Ct. App. 2010). To establish proximate cause for a nuisance claim, ""a plaintiff must show  a legally attributable causal connection between the defendant's conduct and the alleged injury."" Id. A successful  nuisance claim cannot be based on mere speculation, conjecture or a possibility of causation. Id. Rather, the  causation standard is that ""it is more likely than not that the conduct of the defendant was a cause in fact of the  result."" Id. Contrary to Defendant's contention, this Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded facts that allow the Court  to draw a reasonable inference that Defendant's conduct caused Plaintiff to be sex trafficked at the Hotel. First,  Plaintiff alleges, and Defendant does not dispute, that Defendant owned and [*13]  operated the Hotel where  Plaintiff was trafficked. Further, as this Court previously concluded, Plaintiff's Complaint adequately sets forth the  reasons why Defendant should have been on notice of the rampant sex trafficking occurring at the Hotel and how it  failed to prevent it. As such, Plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to demonstrate that Defendant's management of  the Hotel in a way which allowed for the widespread commission of sex crimes created a market and beds for sex  traffickers to operate. This sufficiently demonstrates a legally attributable causal connection between Defendant's  conduct and Plaintiff's trafficking. Thus, Defendant's argument for dismissing Plaintiff's nuisance claim fails and  dismissal on that basis is DENIED. 3. Attorney's Fees, Costs and Punitive Damages Finally, this Court examines Plaintiff's claims for attorney's fees, costs and punitive damages. Defendant argues  that Plaintiff did not sufficiently plead her claims for attorney's fees and costs. However, Defendant provides little  context as to why it contends Plaintiff's claims are deficiently pled. Absent any substantive arguments  demonstrating why these claims fail, dismissal of Plaintiff's claims [*14]  for attorney's fees and costs is DENIED. Likewise, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently plead her claim for punitive damages. More  specifically, Defendant contends that Plaintiff has failed to allege factual details of Defendant's actions that  exhibited ""willful misconduct, malice, fraud, wantonness, oppression, or . . . entire want of care which would raise  the presumption of conscious indifference to consequences"" as required to recover punitive damages under  Georgia law. See O.C.G.A. § 51-12-5.1. This Court disagrees. As analyzed above, this Court has concluded that  Plaintiff's Complaint adequately sets forth allegations showing that Defendant knew or should have known about  the rampant sex crimes occurring at the Hotel and yet failed to prevent it. The Court finds that such allegations also  demonstrate the type of misconduct that would support an award of punitive damages. Accordingly, dismissal of  Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages is DENIED.",1
"Baston v. United States, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28222","ORDER On January 19, 2018, Movant, Damion St. Patrick Baston, filed a pro se Motion Under 28 U.S.C. Section 2255 to  Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence [ECF No. 1]. The Clerk referred the case to Magistrate Judge Patrick A.  White for a ruling on all pre-trial, non-dispositive matters and for a report and recommendation on any dispositive  matters. (See [ECF No. 2]). Movant filed the operative Amended Motion [ECF No. 7] and Amended Memorandum  of Law [ECF No. 7-1] on February 20, 2018. The Government filed its Response [ECF No. 9] on May 29, 2018.  Page 2 of 9   Judge Reid entered a Supplemental Report [ECF No. 19] on December 11, 2019, recommending the Amended  Motion be denied on the merits and no certificate of appealability issue. (See id. 26). Movant then filed Objections  [ECF No. 22] to the Supplemental Report, and the Government filed a Response to Movant's Objections [ECF No.  24]. The Court has carefully reviewed the parties' written submissions, record, and applicable [*2]  law. I. BACKGROUND Movant was charged in a multi-count Superseding Indictment [CR ECF No. 36] with sex trafficking by force,  fraud, and coercion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. sections 1591(a)(1), (b)(1), and 1596 (Count 1); sex trafficking by  force, fraud, and coercion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. section 1591(a)(1) and (b)(1) (Counts 2 and 3); importation of  an alien for prostitution, in violation of 8 U.S.C. section 1328 (Count 4); transportation of an individual for  prostitution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. section 2421 (Counts 5-9); false statement in use of a passport, in violation of  18 U.S.C. section 1542 (Count 10); aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. section 1028A(a)(1); reentry  of a removed alien, in violation of 8 U.S.C. sections 1326(a) and (b)(2) (Count 12); and laundering of monetary  instruments, in violation of 18 U.S.C. section 1956 (Counts 13-21). (See Superseding Indictment 1-9). A ten-day jury trial took place. (See Suppl. Report 5). At the close of the Government's case, Movant's counsel  moved for judgment of acquittal, arguing the Government's evidence was insufficient on each count. (See Jun. 23,  2014 Trial Tr. [CR ECF No. 151] 259:23-262:8). The motion was denied. (See id. 266:22). On the last day of trial,  Movant's counsel moved for a directed verdict, which the Court also denied. (See Jun. 27, 2014 Trial Tr. [CR ECF  No. 154] 206:8-207:15). The jury found Movant guilty [*3]  of all 21 counts of the Superseding Indictment. (See  generally Verdict [CR ECF No. 95]). Movant was sentenced to 324 months in prison, followed by a lifetime term of supervised release. (See Judgment  [CR ECF No. 130] 3-4). At sentencing, the Court applied a two-point enhancement, finding Movant committed  perjury while testifying at trial. (See Sentencing Tr. [CR ECF No. 156] 12:10-17). Movant filed an appeal, and on  March 24, 2016, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed Movant's conviction and sentence. See United States v. Baston, 818  F.3d 651, 671 (11th Cir. 2016). On March 6, 2017, the Supreme Court of the United States denied Movant's petition  for a writ of certiorari. (See Suppl. Report 6). Movant timely filed his section 2255 Motion on January 19, 2018 and the operative Amended Motion on February  20, 2018. Movant raises five grounds for relief in his Amended Motion: (1) ineffective assistance of counsel for  sleeping during the majority of the trial and forcing Movant to abandon this claim when he raised it to the Court; (2)  violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury because the Court failed to remove a biased juror  from deliberation; (3) ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to request a new trial or curative instruction  regarding the biased [*4]  juror; (4) ineffective assistance of counsel for causing Movant to appear at trial in prison  garb; and (5) ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to challenge the Court's decision to allow the Government  to introduce uncharged crimes into evidence. (See generally Am. Mem.). II. LEGAL STANDARD When a magistrate judge's ""disposition"" has been properly objected to, district courts must review the disposition de  novo. FED. R. CIV. P. 72(b)(3). When no party has timely objected, however, the court need only ""satisfy itself that  there is no clear error on the face of the record in order to accept the recommendation."" FED. R. CIV. P. 72       2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28222, *1 Page 3 of 9   Advisory Committee's Notes (citation omitted). Although Rule 72 itself is silent on the standard of review, the  Supreme Court has acknowledged Congress's intent was to require a de novo review only where objections have  been properly filed, not when neither party objects. See Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 150, 106 S. Ct. 466, 88 L.  Ed. 2d 435 (1985) (""It does not appear that Congress intended to require district court review of a magistrate[ ]  [judge's] factual or legal conclusions, under a de novo or any other standard, when neither party objects to those  findings."" (alterations added)). III. DISCUSSION The Supplemental Report identifies four claims raised by Movant and recommends [*5]  each be denied on the  merits. (See Suppl. Report 2-3). The Supplemental Report also suggests the Court may, in its discretion,  recommend the Government charge Movant with perjury for his statements in this proceeding. (See id. 22-24).  Finally, the Supplemental Report finds Movant is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on any of the claims and  recommends no certificate of appealability issue. (See id. 24-26). Movant makes four substantive objections to the Supplemental Report. He objects to (1) the recommendation to  deny the claim regarding the allegedly biased juror; (2) the recommendation to deny the claim regarding his  appearance in prison garb at trial; (3) the finding he is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing; and (4) the  recommendation no certificate of appealability issue. (See generally Objs.). The Court first addresses the portions of the Supplemental Report to which Movant has not objected, which are  reviewed for clear error. The Court next reviews de novo the portions of the Supplemental Report to which Movant  has objected. A. Claims to Which Movant Did Not Object The Supplemental Report recommends denying Movant's claims regarding (1) counsel sleeping during most of the  trial and (2) [*6]  the introduction of uncharged crimes into evidence. (See Suppl. Report 11-14, 21-22). Movant  makes no objections as to these recommendations. The Court finds no clear error on the face of the record and  agrees with the Supplemental Report's conclusions. First, Movant argues his counsel was ineffective because he slept during most of the trial, including during witness  testimony and the presentation of adverse evidence. (See Am. Mem. 4-5). Movant asserts when he previously  brought these concerns to the Court's attention, his counsel ""admonished [him] that he would be making a terrible  mistake if he did not withdraw the claim."" (Id. 4 (alteration added)). Movant advises ""the record may or may not  have recorded Counsel's admonishments to [Movant] on this point."" (Id. (alteration added)). The Supplemental Report correctly rejects Movant's claim because his factual allegations are refuted by the record.  On July 3, 2014 — two days after the jury returned its verdict — Movant sent a handwritten letter to the Court  stating his lawyer fell asleep multiple times over the course of the proceedings. (See Suppl. Report 13). On July 18,  2014, the Court held a status conference to address the allegations [*7]  in Movant's letter. (See [CR ECF No.  104]). At the status conference, Movant admitted under oath the statements in his letter were not true and stated he  was voluntarily withdrawing his complaints. (See Jul. 18, 2014 Status Conference Tr. [CR ECF No. 204] 6:3-8, 7:12- 15). Having reviewed the transcripts for each day of trial (see generally Trial Trs. [CR ECF Nos. 146-155]) and the  transcript from Movant's sentencing hearing (see generally Sentencing Tr.), the Court finds no reference to       2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28222, *4 Page 4 of 9   Movant's counsel sleeping. Movant's allegations do not ""overcome the strong presumption of the veracity of his  statements made under oath"" during the status conference regarding this issue. United States v. Pendas-Mechado,  372 F. App'x 915, 917 (11th Cir. 2010). Thus, Movant cannot succeed on his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel  claim. See Martin v. United States, 703 F. App'x 866, 871 (11th Cir. 2017) (affirming denial of ineffective assistance  of counsel claim because the movant's allegations were affirmatively contradicted by the record and the record  conclusively showed the movant was not entitled to relief). Second, Movant argues (1) the Court erred in allowing the Government to introduce evidence of ""uncharged crimes  relating to prostitution"" in other countries under Federal Rules of Evidence 404(b) and 413 (Am. Mem. 11), and (2)  his appellate counsel was ineffective [*8]  in failing to raise this argument on appeal (see id. 11-12). Movant argues  this evidence should have been excluded under Rule 403 because its probative value was substantially outweighed  by the unfair prejudice it caused. (See id. 11). The Court found this evidence admissible under Rules 404(b) and 413 at a pre-trial hearing on the issue. (See  generally May 30, 2014 Hr'g Tr. [CR ECF No. 145]). Movant may not raise a challenge to the admission of evidence  in a section 2255 Motion that was fully litigated during pre-trial proceedings and could have been raised on appeal.  See Lynn v. United States, 365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir. 2004) (""Because collateral review is not a substitute for  a direct appeal, the general rules have developed that: (1) a defendant must assert all available claims on direct  appeal, . . . and (2) relief under 28 U.S.C. [section] 2255 is reserved for transgressions of constitutional rights and  for that narrow compass of other injury that could not have been raised in direct appeal and would, if condoned,  result in a complete miscarriage of justice."" (alterations added; internal alteration, quotation marks, and citations  omitted)). Thus, the issue is whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this challenge on appeal. The Supplemental Report correctly concludes appellate counsel [*9]  was not ineffective because ""[a]ppellate  counsel is not required to raise meritless arguments."" (Suppl. Report 22 (citing United States v. Nyhuis, 211 F.3d  1340, 1345 (11th Cir. 2000)). As the Government asserts, this argument would have been ""without substantial  merit"" (Resp. 19 (quoting Nyhuis, 211 F.3d at 1345)) because ""[t]he Court's finding that the evidence was  inextricably intertwined with the charged crimes and admissible under Rules 413 and 404(b) [was] supported by  substantial evidence"" (id. (alterations added)). And, as noted by the Government at the pre-trial hearing, any unfair  prejudice resulting from the introduction of this evidence would not have substantially outweighed its probative  value under Rule 403. (See May 30, 2014 Hr'g Tr. 10:21-11:4). Because this claim would have been unsuccessful  on appeal, appellate counsel was not ineffective in failing to raise it. Having reviewed the uncontested portions of the Supplemental Report for clear error, the Court agrees these two  claims should be denied. B. Claims to Which Movant Objected Movant makes four objections to the Supplemental Report: (1) counsel was ineffective for failing to address the  issues concerning juror N.A.; (2) counsel was ineffective by causing Movant to appear for trial in prison garb; (3)  Movant is entitled to an [*10]  evidentiary hearing; and (4) a certificate of appealability should issue. (See Objs. 5- 11). The Court addresses each objection in turn. 1. Claim Regarding Juror N.A. Movant claims (1) his Sixth Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury was violated because a biased juror  participated in deliberations, and (2) his counsel was ineffective in failing to challenge the juror's presence on the  panel. (See Am. Mem. 5-9). Judge Reid, construing the claims liberally as an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28222, *7 Page 5 of 9   claim in counsel's failure to have N.A. removed as a juror, move for a mistrial, or seek a curative instruction (see  Suppl. Report 2-3), recommends the claim be denied because Movant's allegations are ""bereft of any factual  support"" and ""affirmatively controverted by the record"" (id. 14). In his Objections, Movant admits he ""incorrectly alleged in his [section] 2255 motion that Juror N.A. expressed that  she was biased against him and had some kind of outburst during the trial."" (Objs. 5-6 (alteration added)). He  explains he did not receive the complete trial transcripts until after he filed his Motion, so he based his allegations  on his memory. (See id. 6). Nevertheless, Movant insists ""there were other factors that should [*11]  have caused  trial counsel to seek that jurors [sic] removal much earlier than the point at which she was ultimately removed."" (Id.).  Recounting the facts accurately this time, Movant argues (1) counsel was ineffective in not requesting N.A.'s  removal after she indicated she was bothered by counsel's cross-examination during trial; and (2) N.A.'s  participation in jury deliberations caused prejudice to the defense, which was not cured by the Court's instruction to  begin deliberations anew after N.A. was ultimately removed. (See id. 5-7). Movant objects to the Supplemental  Report in that it ""does not analyze whether trial counsel's failure to seek Juror N.A.'s removal from the jury earlier  than when she was ultimately removed constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel."" (Id. 7). The Court liberally construes Movant's claim regarding juror N.A. in light of the corrected factual assertions in his  Objections. The relevant facts surrounding juror N.A. are as follows: At voir dire, N.A. stated the facts of this case ""may trigger some emotions and feelings"" because it reminded her of  the death of her cousin, who was murdered in ""a domestic situation."" (Jun. 16, 2014 Trial Tr. [CR ECF No. 146]  59:13-15; [*12]  see also id. 81:19-21 (""My main concern is the emotional trigger as far as it relates to the personal  situation that I have endured, so that's where my concern lies."")). Both parties accepted N.A. as a juror. (See id.  98:17-21). On the third day of trial, N.A. informed the Court she was upset by the way defense counsel was cross-examining a  witness. (See Jun. 18, 2014 Trial Tr. [CR ECF No. 148] 117:24-118:7, 120:3-5). When the Court brought her in for  further questioning, N.A. stated she understood ""everyone has a right to a defense and that's part of the law"" (id.  120:11), she was ""listening objectively"" (id. 122:2-3), and ""personal feelings have nothing to do with the case"" (id.  122:13-14). The Court then instructed N.A. to write a note if she had any other misgivings throughout the trial. (See  id. 122:16-20). The issue was not raised again for the remainder of the trial. (See Suppl. Report 15). In the middle of deliberations, N.A. expressed she did not want to return as a juror because serving on the jury was  financially burdensome. (See Jul. 1, 2014 Trial Tr. 3:8-14). The Court asked the parties how they wanted to  proceed, and the parties each proposed excusing N.A. from the jury [*13]  and replacing her with one of the  alternate jurors. (See id. 4:3-4, 4:25-5:15). The Court asked Movant if he agreed with this proposal, and he  answered affirmatively. (See id. 5:13-15). When the courtroom deputy left to excuse N.A., she discovered N.A. had entered the jury room and was  deliberating with the other jurors. (See Jul. 1, 2014 Trial Tr. 6:2-9). N.A. was then asked to wait outside with the  court security officer while the Court confirmed whether the parties still wanted N.A. replaced by an alternate. (See  id. 6:16-7:6). When the alternate juror arrived, the Court instructed the jury to begin their deliberations anew with the  alternate juror and to follow all the Court's instructions as a whole. (See id. 14:24-15:6). Less than three hours later,  the jury returned a unanimous verdict finding Movant guilty on all counts. (See id. 20:19-21:23). After the verdict, Movant filed a Motion for New Trial, arguing in part N.A.'s involvement in the deliberations ""was  tantamount to a non-Juror participating in deliberations with the Jury."" (Mot. for New Trial 2). The Court denied it,  finding N.A.'s ""brief participation in deliberations while the parties considered whether to have her removed [*14]        2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28222, *10 Page 6 of 9   and after she had been told to wait outside the jury room did not convert N.A. into a 'non-juror' impermissibly  present in the jury room and deliberating with the other jurors."" (Aug. 29, 2014 Order [CR ECF No. 120] 2). The  Court found N.A.'s participation in the jury's initial deliberations did not prejudice Movant because the Court  instructed the jurors to begin their deliberations anew. (See id. 2-3 (citation omitted)). To succeed on his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, Movant must show (1) counsel's failure to request the  removal of juror N.A. was deficient performance, and (2) N.A.'s presence on the jury prejudiced the defense. See  Fennell v. Sec'y, Fla. Dep't of Corr., 582 F. App'x 828, 831 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466  U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984)); see also id. (""We evaluate juror selection claims as we  would any other Strickland claim[.]"" (alteration added; internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Movant's  counsel would be deficient in failing to request removal of N.A. only if she was actually biased. See Bell, 351 F.  App'x at 359 (holding trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to strike a juror for cause because the juror was not  actually biased). ""Actual bias exists if a juror is not 'capable and willing to decide the case solely on the facts before  him.'"" Id. at 359 (quoting Rogers v. McMullen, 673 F.2d 1185, 1190 (11th Cir. 1982)). A party seeking to  exclude [*15]  a prospective juror for cause ""must demonstrate that the juror in question exhibited actual bias by  showing either an express admission of bias or facts demonstrating such a close connection to the present case  that bias must be presumed."" United States v. Chandler, 996 F.2d 1073, 1102 (11th Cir. 1993) (citation omitted). Movant does not show N.A. was biased. In his Objections, Movant points to N.A.'s statements that the case may  ""trigger some emotions and feelings"" (Objs. 6 (citation omitted)) and that she was bothered by defense counsel's  cross-examination of a witness (see id.). Neither of these statements constitutes ""an express admission of bias.""  Chandler, 996 F.2d at 1102 (citation omitted). Although N.A. said during voir dire that the case ""may trigger some  emotions and feelings"" (Jun. 16, 2014 Trial Tr. 59:14-15), subsequent questioning established she could be  impartial. For example, no juror gave an audible response when Movant's counsel asked the jurors whether they  disagreed Movant was covered by the presumption of innocence or whether any was biased in favor of the  prosecution. (See id. 82:17-22, 83:14-84:5); see also Bell, 351 F. App'x at 359-60 (finding fact that juror did not give  affirmative answer to the court's questions about whether jury would be partial toward the [*16]  government  showed ability to be impartial despite juror's previous statements during individual questioning that indicated bias).  And although N.A. said she became upset during defense counsel's cross-examination (see Jun. 18, 2014 Trial Tr.  117:24-118:7, 120:3-5), she stated she understood ""everyone has a right to a defense"" (id. 120:11), she was  ""listening objectively"" (id. 122:2-3), and ""personal feelings have nothing to do with the case"" (id. 122:13-14). N.A.'s  affirmations of impartiality preclude a finding she was actually biased. See Fennell, 582 F. App'x at 833 (finding  juror's corrective statements indicating he was capable of being impartial after initially stating he would have  sympathy for the victim created ambiguity and thus did not give rise to a presumption of actual bias). Counsel was  not deficient in failing to request N.A.'s removal after either her voir dire testimony or her testimony regarding  defense counsel's cross-examination. Even if counsel was deficient, Movant's claim would still fail because he cannot show he was prejudiced by N.A.'s  presence on the jury. Strickland prejudice means ""there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's  unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding [*17]  would have been different."" Khan v. United States, 928  F.3d 1264, 1279 (11th Cir. 2019) (internal quotation marks omitted; quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694). Movant insists N.A.'s participation in the deliberations ""contaminated the entire process"" and the Court's ""instruction  to the jury to completely start over its deliberations after the alternate juror was seated was insufficient to cure the  prejudice."" (Objs. 7). Movant further argues ""the fact that the jury quickly came to a unanimous verdict after that         2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28222, *14 Page 7 of 9   raises questions as to how seriously that instruction was followed"" and indicates prejudice. (Id.). But, as the Court  noted when it denied the Motion for New Trial, ""there is 'no reasonable possibility that the participation of' N.A. 'in  the jury's initial deliberations prejudiced [Movant]'"" after the Court issued the curative instruction. (Aug. 29, 2014  Order 2-3 (alteration added; quoting United States v. Acevedo, 141 F.3d 1421, 1427 (11th Cir. 1998)). The Court's  instruction was ""sufficient to eliminate the threat of prejudice"" resulting from the replacement of N.A. with an  alternate juror, Acevedo, 141 F.3d at 1426, and jurors are presumed to follow their instructions, see id. What is  more, Movant fails to make a showing counsel's alleged deficiency in failing to remove juror N.A. and her  participation in deliberations caused or contributed [*18]  to his guilty verdict. See Khan, 928 F.3d at 1279 (""[The  Strickland] standard contains a 'critical requirement that counsel's deficient performance must actually cause' the  prejudice asserted by the movant."" (alteration added; quoting Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 484, 120 S. Ct.  1029, 145 L. Ed. 2d 985 (2000)). Movant therefore cannot establish prejudice as a result of counsel's failure to seek  N.A.'s removal. Because Movant cannot satisfy either prong of Strickland, his claim regarding juror N.A. is denied. 2. Claim Regarding Movant's Appearance at Trial in Prison Garb Movant argues counsel was ineffective by forcing him to dress in prison garb for most of the trial (see Am. Mem. 9- 10) and that his appearance at trial in prison garb violated his ""due process right to a fair trial."" (id. 10). Movant  asserts counsel did not permit him to dress in civilian clothes and refused to give him the clothes his family  members delivered because Movant did not pay counsel an additional $30,000.00. (See id. 9-10). Judge Reid  recommends the claim be denied because (1) Movant ""fails to properly allege reasonably specific, non-conclusory  facts in support of his claim"" (Suppl. Report 19) and ""there is no indication on the record that Movant was even  wearing an identifiable prison uniform"" (id. 20), and (2) even if Movant [*19]  was dressed in prison garb at trial,  Movant fails to show his right to a fair trial was violated or he received ineffective assistance of counsel (see id. 20). In his Objections, Movant (1) argues Judge Reid erred in not finding Movant was wearing prison garb at trial or in  declining to conduct an evidentiary hearing on this issue, and (2) repeats the argument in his Amended Motion that  counsel was ineffective because the decision to have Movant to appear in his prison uniform was not a reasonable  trial strategy and that decision prejudiced him. (See Objs. 8-10). The Court agrees with the Supplemental Report's conclusion Movant's claim should be denied. Accepting Movant's  allegations as true, Movant still does not show his appearance in prison garb affected the outcome of the trial.  Although the Fourteenth Amendment forbids ""compel[ling] an accused to stand trial before a jury while dressed in  identifiable prison clothes,"" Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S. 501, 512, 96 S. Ct. 1691, 48 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1976)  (alteration added), his conviction need not be reversed if the constitutional error is ""harmless beyond a reasonable  doubt,"" United States v. Harris, 703 F.2d 508, 512 (11th Cir. 1983) (internal quotation marks omitted; quoting  Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967)). ""[O]verwhelming evidence of a  defendant's guilt renders the error occasioned by a defendant's appearance in prison clothes [*20]  at trial harmless  beyond a reasonable doubt."" United States v. Johnson, 634 F. App'x 227, 229 (11th Cir. 2015) (alteration added).  And under Strickland, the prejudice prong asks whether ""there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's  unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different"" — specifically, whether ""the factfinder  would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt."" Castillo v. Florida, 722 F.3d 1281, 1286 (11th Cir. 2013)  (internal quotation marks omitted; quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694-95). Movant cannot succeed under either standard. Movant makes the conclusory assertion ""[p]rejudice should be  presumed from Movant's appearance in prison garb."" (Objs. 10). But Movant bears the burden to ""affirmatively  prove prejudice."" Khan, 928 F.3d at 1279 (internal quotation marks omitted; quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 693).  Movant also objects to Judge Reid's finding of no prejudice because ""the jury deliberated over a period of two days  and sent notes out during deliberations,"" despite the amount of evidence presented against him at trial. (Objs. 10).  Neither of these points undercuts a finding of no prejudice. First, Movant mischaracterizes the length of jury deliberations; the jury was instructed to begin deliberating anew  after juror N.A. was replaced by the alternate and reached a unanimous verdict in less than three hours. (Jul.  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28222, *17 Page 8 of 9   1, [*21]  2014 Trial Tr. 14:24-15:6, 20:19-21:23). In any event, ""[t]he length of a jury's deliberation is not necessarily  relevant to the measure of the evidence against a defendant."" Harris, 703 F.2d at 513. Second, neither of the two questions posed by the jury (see Jury Questions [ECF No. 96]) mentions Movant's  appearance in prison garb or otherwise evidences a causal connection between Movant's appearance in prison  garb and the jury's verdict. See Khan, 928 F.3d at 1279 (""[C]ounsel's deficient performance must actually cause the  prejudice asserted by the movant."" (alteration added; internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). As noted in the Supplemental Report, there was an abundance of evidence presented against Movant, including  ""more than 400 exhibits and more than a dozen witnesses, including the victims, who testified at trial."" (Suppl.  Report 20; see also Jun. 23, 2014 Trial Tr. 259:23-266:22 (denying motion for judgment of acquittal); Jun. 27, 2014  Trial Tr. 206:8-207:15 (denying motion for directed verdict)). Any error in causing Movant to appear at trial in his  prison uniform was therefore harmless because ""the evidence of [Movant's] guilt presented at trial was  overwhelming."" Johnson, 634 F. App'x at 229 (alteration added). The amount of evidence [*22]  against Movant  also precludes a finding of prejudice under Strickland because the jury still would not have had ""a reasonable doubt  respecting guilt"" if Movant had worn civilian clothes at trial. Castillo, 722 F.3d at 1286 (internal quotation marks and  citation omitted). Because Movant fails to show any violation of his right to a fair trial was not harmless or that his  appearance in prison garb prejudiced him, Movant's claim is denied. 3. Evidentiary Hearing The Supplemental Report concludes Movant is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claims. (See Suppl.  Report 24-25). A section 2255 movant seeking an evidentiary hearing must ""allege facts that, if true, would entitle  him to relief."" Saunders v. United States, 278 F. App'x 976, 979 (11th Cir. 2008). Movant argues he is entitled to an  evidentiary hearing on both claims discussed in his Objections. (See Objs. 10-11). Although Movant asks the Court  for an evidentiary hearing to explore the circumstances surrounding the allegation he wore his prison uniform during  trial (see Objs. 8-9), he has not shown his appearance in prison garb contributed to the guilty verdict. Nor has  Movant alleged facts showing counsel was ineffective for failing to remove juror N.A. Thus, an evidentiary hearing is  unnecessary to expand [*23]  the record on these claims. 4. Certificate of Appealability The Supplemental Report recommends the Court not issue a certificate of appealability. (See Suppl. Report 25). A  certificate of appealability ""may issue . . . only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a  constitutional right."" 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2) (alteration added). The Supreme Court has described the limited  circumstances when a certificate of appealability should properly issue after the district court denies a habeas  petition:          2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28222, *20 Page 9 of 9   Where a district court has rejected the constitutional claims on the merits, the showing required to satisfy §  2253(c) is straightforward: The [movant] must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court's  assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong. Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S. Ct. 1595, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542 (2000) (alteration added). Movant's  conclusory assertion that ""[r]esolution of the claims would be debatable among jurists of reason"" (Objs. 11  (alteration added)) fails to satisfy his burden, and the Court shall not issue a certificate of appealability.",1
"Bacon v. Marshall, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 32309","[*1] ORDER AND JUDGMENT* _________________________________ Before BACHARACH, KELLY, and MORITZ, Circuit  Judges. _________________________________ Michael Bacon, proceeding pro se, appeals the district  court's order dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim under Bivens v.  Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), or  42 U.S.C. § 1983.1 Because Bacon waived appellate review by failing to challenge  much of the district court's *After examining the briefs and appellate record, this  panel has determined unanimously that oral argument  would not materially assist in the determination of this  appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R.  34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted  without oral argument. This order and judgment is not  binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of  the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. But it  may be cited for its persuasive value. See Fed. R. App.  P. 32.1(a); 10th Cir. R. 32.1(A). 1 We liberally construe Bacon's pro se filings, but we will  not act as his advocate. See Garrett v. Selby Connor  Maddux & Janer, 425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005). Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 2 order  and  because  the  district  court  correctly  determined that Bacon's allegations constitute a new Bivens context with at least one special  factor counseling against extending that remedy, we affirm. Background [*2]  Bacon alleges that various John Does, Derrik Marshall  (his federal probation officer), and Judicial Supervision Services (JSS, a  private contractor that collects urine samples for probation services) violated his rights  under the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United  States Constitution. In particular, Bacon alleges that Marshall held a grudge against him  because of his involvement in a prior lawsuit that made it more difficult for the  government to protect the identity of its cooperators.2 According to Bacon, Marshall said  Page 2 of 4 that he would make sure Bacon had a ""difficult time"" and ""would not be fair with  [Bacon]."" R. 51 (capitalization standardized). Bacon further alleges that  Marshall caused him to become homeless and then had him arrested because  he was homeless. He also alleges that Marshall fabricated probation violations as  pretext for Bacon's arrest and lied to a magistrate judge about Bacon's conduct so that  Bacon would remain 2This allegation is presumably related to proceedings in  which Bacon sought to unseal the supplement to his  plea agreement because it stated that he had not  cooperated with the government. See United States v.  Bacon, 950 F.3d 1286, 1290 (10th Cir. 2020). The  district court refused to unseal the supplement, citing a  local rule requiring all plea supplements be [*3]  sealed  to create ""uniformity,"" ostensibly to protect the identity of  cooperators. Id. (quoting R. vol. 1, 45). On appeal, we  vacated and remanded the district court's decision after  concluding that it plainly erred by ignoring the common- law presumption of access to judicial records and failing  to make case-specific findings to support sealing. Id. at  1293, 1297. 2 Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 3 incarcerated. In addition, Bacon alleges that JSS, with  Marshall's approval, committed ""a form of sexual assault  and a form of rape"" when it forced him to remove his  clothing before providing a urine sample. Id. at 53  (capitalization standardized). A magistrate judge screened Bacon's in forma pauperis  (IFP) complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B) and  recommended dismissing it sua sponte for failure to  state a claim. The magistrate judge determined that  because Bacon alleged defendants acted under color of  federal law, not state law, his claims were properly  brought under Bivens, not § 1983. And the magistrate  judge further recommended dismissing those Bivens  claims because (1) Bacon's allegations that Marshall  committed perjury to revoke Bacon's supervised release  constituted a new Bivens context [*4]  not previously  recognized by the Supreme Court and (2) Bacon's  ability to bring suit against Marshall under the Federal  Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. § 2674, and the  ""potential interference with the important work of  supervising officers"" counseled against extending the  Bivens remedy. R. 128. The magistrate judge also  concluded that Bacon's Bivens claims against JSS-a  private entity acting under color of federal law-was  precluded by Supreme Court precedent declining to  extend the Bivens remedy to actions against private  federal contractors. See Corr. Servs. Corp. v.Malesko,  534 U.S. 61, 66 (2001). The district court adopted the magistrate judge's report  and recommendation in its entirety over Bacon's  objections. And it later denied Bacon's reconsideration  motion, reiterating that Bacon could not rely on § 1983  to sue JSS or any individual 3 Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 4 defendants because he alleged no facts to support the  proposition that defendants had acted under color of  state law. The district court also noted Bacon failed to  state a claim under the FTCA because he had not  presented his claims to the appropriate federal agency  first. Bacon appeals. Analysis ""We review de novo the district court's decision to  dismiss an IFP complaint under [*5]  28 U.S.C. §  1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim."" Kay v.  Bemis, 500 F.3d 1214, 1217 (10th Cir. 2007). ""In  determining whether a dismissal is proper, we must  accept the allegations of the complaint as true and  construe  those  allegations,  and  any  reasonable  inferences that might be drawn from them, in the light  most favorable to the plaintiff."" Gaines v. Stenseng, 292  F.3d 1222, 1224 (10th Cir. 2002). ""Dismissal of a pro se  complaint for failure to state a claim is proper only  where it is obvious that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the  facts he has alleged and it would be futile to give him an  opportunity to amend."" Curley v. Perry, 246 F.3d 1278,  1281 (10th Cir. 2001) (quoting Perkins v. Kan. Dep't of  Corrs., 165 F.3d 803, 806 (10th Cir. 1999)). On appeal, Bacon asserts simply that he should be able  to sue Marshall and JSS, but he does nothing to  develop that position. At best, he seeks to incorporate  Page 3 of 4 by reference the arguments he raised below, which we  do not permit. See Fed. R. App. P. 28.3(B) (stating that  ""[i]ncorporating by reference portions of lower court or  agency briefs or pleadings is disapproved and does not  satisfy"" our briefing 4 Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 5 requirements). Bacon has therefore waived any  challenge to most of the district court's rulings, including  that his § 1983 claims fail for lack of state action and  that his Bivens claim against JSS is barred by binding  Supreme Court precedent. [*6]  SeeUnited States v.  Fisher, 805 F.3d 982, 990-91 (10th Cir. 2015) (finding  argumentswaived  through  inadequate  appellate  briefing). The only argument even passingly developed  in Bacon's brief is his position that the district court erred  in holding that the FTCA provided an alternative remedy  counseling against extending Bivens to his claims  against Marshall, so this is the only argument we will  consider here. In Bivens, the Supreme Court recognized a cause of  action against federal officials for alleged Fourth  Amendment violations. See Egbert v. Boule, 596 U.S.  482, 490 (2022). And ""[o]ver the following decade, the  Court twice again fashioned new causes of action under  the Constitution-first, for a former congressional staffer's  Fifth Amendment sex-discrimination claim; and second,  for a federal prisoner's inadequate-care claim under the  Eighth Amendment."" Id. at 490-91 (citations omitted).  However, ""[s]ince these cases, the Court has not  implied  additional  causes  of  action  under  the  Constitution."" Id. at 491. The Supreme Court has instructed that when faced with  Bivens claims, lower courts should engage in a two-step  inquiry, as the district court did here. The first question  is whether the case presents a new context in that it is  ""'meaningful[ly]' different from the three cases in which  the Court has implied a damages action."" Id. at 492  (alteration in original) [*7]  (quoting Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582  U.S. 120, 139 (2017)). ""Second, if a claim arises in a  new context, a Bivens remedy is unavailable if there 5 Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 6 are 'special factors' indicating that the [j]udiciary is at  least arguably less equipped than Congress to 'weigh  the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to  proceed.'"" Id. (quoting Ziglar, 582 U.S. at 136).  Moreover, the Supreme Court has explained ""those  [two] steps often resolve to a single question: whether  there is any reason to think that Congress might be  better equipped to create a damages remedy."" Id. Here, the district court concluded that Bacon's  allegations that Marshall committed perjury to revoke  Bacon's supervised release were ""different in a  meaningful way from previous Bivens cases"" because  he did not allege unreasonable search and seizure, sex  discrimination, or deliberate indifference to medical  needs. R. 128; see also Ziglar, 582 U.S. at 139. Bacon  does not purport to challenge the conclusion that this is  a new Bivens context, and other circuits have held as  much in similar circumstances. See Xi v. Haugen, 68  F.4th 824, 834 (3d Cir. 2023) (finding new context  where plaintiff ""allege[d] that federal agents made false  statements and material omissions of exculpatory  evidence [*8]  that led the [g]overnment to investigate,  arrest, and prosecute him""); Cantú v. Moody, 933 F.3d  414, 423 (5th Cir. 2019) (finding new context where  plaintiff alleged that officers ""falsified affidavits""). Given  Bacon's waiver of this issue and this persuasive circuit  authority, we agree with the district court that this is a  new Bivens context. As to special factors counseling hesitation before  expanding Bivens to this new context, we recently  observed that ""expanding Bivens is not just 'a  disfavored judicial activity,' it is an action that is  impermissible in virtually all circumstances."" 6 Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 7 Silva v. United States, 45 F.4th 1134, 1140 (10th Cir.  2022) (quotingZiglar, 582 U.S. at 135). A court will not  expand Bivens if ""Congress is better positioned to  create remedies in the"" new context at hand or if ""the  [g]overnment already has provided alternative remedies  that protect plaintiffs."" Id. at 1141. Here, the district court  found that both special factors applied, reasoning that  Congress was better equipped to create remedies in  this context because of the ""potential interference with  the important work of supervising officers"" and that the  FTCA provided an alternative remedy. Page 4 of 4 On appeal, Bacon purports to challenge only the latter  ruling. But even if we were [*9]  to agree with him that  the FTCA is not an alternative remedy counseling  against extending Bivens, that would not be reason  enough to reverse. The district court's concern about  Congress being better suited to create a remedy to  avoid interfering with the work of probation officers is  sufficient, standing alone, to counsel against expanding  Bivens. See Silva, 45 F.4th at 1141; Carvajal v. United  States, No. 20-CV-567, 2021 WL 2814883, at *4-5 (N.D.  Tex. May 11, 2021) (unpublished) (""Supervision-based  Bivens claims like this . . . could possibly interfere with  the difficult responsibilities of probation officers.""), report  and recommendationadopted, 2021 WL 2808966 (N.D.  Tex. July 6, 2021) (unpublished). And Bacon waived  any argument to the contrary by not making one in his  brief. So we conclude that this case, like ""virtually all""  new Bivens contexts, is not appropriate for extending  the Bivens remedy. Silva, 45 F.4th at 1140. We  accordingly affirm the district court's dismissal order. 7 Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 8 As a final matter, we grant Bacon's motion to proceed  IFP on appeal and deny his motion asking for an order  directing his prison to provide him with certain legal  documents.",1
"United States v. Palms, 21 F.4th 689","[*692]  McHUGH, Circuit Judge. The Government tried Appellant Ramar Palms before a  jury in the Northern District of Oklahoma and obtained  guilty verdicts on three crimes related to sex trafficking.  On appeal, Mr. Palms asks this court to reverse his  convictions and remand for a new trial for two reasons.  First, Mr. Palms argues the district court should have  suppressed the evidence obtained from his cell phone  because the warrant and the search of his cell phone  violated the Fourth Amendment. Second, he argues the  district court abused its discretion when it excluded  sexual behavior evidence under Federal Rule of  Evidence 412 because the exclusion violated the Fifth  and Sixth Amendments. As detailed below, we hold the warrant to search Mr.  Palms's cell phone was sufficiently particular and the  search was reasonable. We also hold the district court  did not abuse its discretion in excluding sexual behavior  evidence under Rule 412. Therefore, [**2]  we affirm Mr.  Palms's convictions. I. BACKGROUND A. Factual History  [*693]  1. Mr. Palms and M.W. In September 2018, Mr. Palms met M.W., a twenty- seven-year-old single mom, at a bar in Tulsa,         Page 2 of 10 Oklahoma. They began to spend time together and went  on a few dates. Eventually, Mr. Palms invited M.W. to  go on a road trip to Louisiana with him. On that road trip,  Mr. Palms told M.W. he was a pimp and that he wanted  her to make money for him. At the time, they were in the  car together ""in the middle of nowhere,"" and M.W. could  not get away from Mr. Palms. ROA Vol. III at 1022. That  night, they stopped at a hotel in Houston, Texas. There,  Mr. Palms assaulted M.W. Then, he advertised M.W.'s  services online and forced M.W. to go on her first ""date.""  Mr. Palms taught M.W. about the pimping industry and  told her she should keep her head down and not look  any man in the eyes because another pimp might steal  her from him. When they returned to Tulsa, Mr. Palms began  controlling every aspect of M.W.'s life. Mr. Palms  required M.W. to quit her two jobs and work for him full- time as a prostitute. He constantly communicated with  M.W. via text messages and phone calls and monitored  her whereabouts. Mr. Palms also [**3]  tracked who  M.W. talked to and controlled her money, car, and  phone. If M.W. did something or talked to a man he did  not approve of, he would hit or strangle her. Mr. Palms posted ads or required M.W. to post ads to  various websites offering commercial sex acts from  M.W. Mr. Palms created a template for her to follow to  ensure she would attract clients. He required M.W. to  post the ads regularly throughout the day and to go on  at least four or five ""dates"" a day. Clients paid Mr. Palms  by Cash App or paid M.W. in cash. In either case, Mr.  Palms required M.W. to give him all the money she  earned. Mr. Palms would occasionally buy M.W. food  and other items, but M.W. had to ask him for money to  support herself and her two children. M.W. could not  cover her utility bills or rent, and eventually she was  evicted. 2. Arrest On November 20, 2018, Tulsa police officer Justin  Oxford was investigating online advertisements for  suspected prostitution. Officer Oxford responded to one  of the ads and was directed to meet M.W. in room 220  at the Peoria Inn in Tulsa. When he arrived, he saw Mr.  Palms parked in a car near room 220. After M.W. let  Officer Oxford into the room, he asked for a sex act  and [**4]  put money on the nightstand. When M.W.  agreed, Officer Oxford identified himself as a police  officer and arrested her. M.W. told Officer Oxford that  she was being forced to work as a prostitute and  identified Mr. Palms as her pimp. Officer Oxford also  saw a text message from Mr. Palms on M.W.'s phone  screen. The police arrested Mr. Palms in the parking lot  and seized his cell phone. 3. Warrant and Search of Mr. Palms's Cell Phone Officer Oxford sought a warrant to search Mr. Palms's  cell phone from a Tulsa County judge. In his affidavit  supporting the warrant, Officer Oxford detailed the  events of November 20, 2018, and the information he  obtained from M.W. about  [*694]  her connection with  Mr. Palms. The judge issued a warrant to search Mr.  Palms's cell phone. The warrant said ""[p]robable cause  ha[d] been shown"" and authorized the police to search  Mr.  Palms's  cell  phone  for  ""[r]ecords,  data,  communications and information which are evidence of  Human Trafficking."" ROA Vol. I at 68. Specifically, the  warrant authorized the police to search Mr. Palms's cell  phone for evidence including, but not limited to, all digital evidence  stored on removable storage and magnetic or  electronic data contained [**5]  in the contents of  such tablet, cell phone, laptop, camera and/or  memory cards, including electronic data storage  devices, which in whole or part contain any and all  evidence related to the subscriber information from  the SIM (subscriber identification module) and/or  ownership information for the device, electronic  mail, call logs, contacts, calendars, location  services information, global positioning (GPS) data  and information, internet chat communications,  browser  cache,  auto-complete  forms,  stored  passwords,  instant  messaging,  SMS  (short  message service), MMS (multimedia message  service),  social  media  account  data  and  information, application data and information,  documents,  photographs,  images,  graphics,  pictures, videos, movies, audio or video recordings,  any associated metadata, and any recorded  documents  depicting  communications,  correspondence  or  storage  of  these  communications, files, graphics, documents, or  other data related to the crime of Human  Trafficking. Id. Officer Brian Booth, a member of the Tulsa Police  Department's intelligence unit, extracted all the data  from Mr. Palms's cell phone pursuant to the warrant.  Officer  Booth  gave  the  extracted  information,  Page 3 of 10 excluding [**6]  the cloud data, to Officer Oxford, who  searched it. B. Procedural History In July 2019, a federal grand jury charged Mr. Palms  with sex trafficking by force, fraud, and coercion in  violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(1)  (Count One); attempted obstruction of sex trafficking  enforcement in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) (Count  Two); and retaliation against a victim and causing bodily  harm in violation 18 U.S.C. § 1513(b)(2) (Count Three). 1. Motion to Suppress Prior to trial, Mr. Palms submitted a motion arguing the  evidence obtained from his cell phone should be  suppressed because the warrant and the search of his  cell phone violated the Fourth Amendment. He made  four arguments in support: (1) the document titled  ""Search Warrant"" was not actually a warrant because it  did not have a sufficient statement of probable cause,  command language, or appropriate headings; (2) the  warrant lacked the particularity required by the Fourth  Amendment because it did not limit the search to  specific materials or to a specific crime; (3) the  extraction and search of the data from  [*695]  the cell  phone was unreasonable; and (4) the good faith  exception did not apply because well-trained officers  would have understood this warrant was invalid. The district court held a limited evidentiary [**7]  hearing  on the search of the cell phone. At the hearing, the                  district court heard from Officer Booth, who extracted  the data from the cell phone, and Officer Oxford, who  searched it. Officer Booth testified that he reviewed the warrant and  extracted the data for the search. Officer Booth  explained that he first tried to perform more limited types  of extractions known as a file extraction and a logical  extraction, but they did not work on Mr. Palms's cell  phone because these extraction methods were blocked  by the phone's software or the carrier. He then resorted  to the last extraction option available on the machine he  was using, which was a broad physical extraction.  Officer Booth did not contact any other agencies to help  him limit his extraction because he believed they would  have the same options he had. The physical extraction  created a byte-for-byte copy of the cell phone with data  and metadata. Officer Booth did not limit the search to  certain types of files. He extracted all the data on the  cell phone. Officer Oxford testified about the methodology he used  to search the data. He informally limited his search to  the relevant time-period from September 2018, when  Mr. Palms met M.W., [**8]  to November 20, 2018,  when they were arrested. His methodology involved  viewing SMS messages, MMS messages, photographs,  and emails. Sometimes he used the search function to  search key words, but he also viewed the evidence in  their locations on the cell phone to determine their  context. When Officer Oxford saw something unrelated  to the crime of human trafficking, he moved on quickly.  At one point, Officer Oxford discovered privileged  attorney-client  communications,  and  he  promptly  stopped his search to contact the prosecutor. He did not  come across evidence of any crimes other than human  trafficking during the search. After the evidentiary hearing, the district court denied  Mr. Palms's motion to suppress. The district court held  the warrant satisfied the Fourth Amendment because it  was supported by probable cause, and it was            Page 4 of 10 sufficiently  particular  because  the  search  was  reasonable under United States v. Loera, 923 F.3d 907  (10th Cir. 2019). Alternatively, the district court  determined both the officers relied in good faith on the  warrant. Mr. Palms asked the district court to  reconsider, but the district court denied that motion. 2. Motion in Limine Under Federal Rule of Evidence 412, evidence of the  victim's prior sexual behavior is generally not admissible  in a civil or [**9]  criminal proceeding involving alleged  sexual misconduct. Prior to trial, the Government   [*696]  submitted a Motion in Limine, invoking Rule 412  and requesting the district court prohibit Mr. Palms from  introducing any evidence that M.W. had engaged in  commercial sex acts before she met Mr. Palms. Mr.  Palms opposed the motion on the ground that this  evidence was necessary to protect his Fifth and Sixth  Amendment rights. He also submitted a notice of sexual  behavior evidence, identifying specific sexual behavior  evidence he sought to admit. This included evidence  that M.W. had voluntarily engaged in commercial sex  before she met Mr. Palms, M.W. had an understanding  of the commercial sex business before she met Mr.  Palms,  and  M.W.  knew  how  to  post  online  advertisements for commercial sex before she met Mr.  Palms.  Mr.  Palms  argued  the  evidence  was  constitutionally required because it supported his  alternative theory that it was M.W. who recruited and  enticed Mr. Palms to join her commercial sex business.  He also said the evidence may be necessary to  impeach her credibility generally and specifically on the  elements of the crimes with which Mr. Palms was  charged. The district court ultimately prohibited Mr. Palms from  presenting [**10]  evidence about M.W.'s prior sexual  behavior under Rule 412. The district court determined  the sexual behavior evidence was generally not  admissible, but it left the final decision for trial because  the evidence may be admissible if it was directly  relevant to Mr. Palms's charges or to correct a  misleading impression created by the testimony. The  district court also ruled the evidence would not be  allowed to impugn M.W.'s credibility generally, but it left  open the possibility that Mr. Palms could use M.W.'s      prior court testimony for direct impeachment purposes. At trial, M.W. testified that prostitution was ""not  something [she] would choose to do on [her] own,"" ROA  Vol. III at 1108. To diminish her credibility, Mr. Palms  sought to introduce the evidence of her commercial sex  acts prior to meeting Mr. Palms. With this evidence, Mr.  Palms sought to dispute M.W.'s testimony about her  fear of Mr. Palms when he identified himself as a pimp  and the impression that Mr. Palms taught her how  prostitution works and how to post solicitation ads  online. The district court denied the request, stating the  evidence of prior sexual behavior was irrelevant to  whether Mr. Palms forced her to advertise and  perform [**11]  commercial sex acts in 2018. 3. Trial and Conviction In December 2019, the Government tried the charges  against Mr. Palms to a jury, but the jury could not reach  a verdict. The district court declared a mistrial, and at  the Government's request, set the case for retrial. Prior  to the second trial, the Government obtained a  superseding indictment containing all three of the  original  charges  and  two  additional  charges:  transporting an individual for prostitution in violation of  18 U.S.C. § 2421(a) (Count Four) and online promotion  and facilitation of prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. §  2421A(a) (Count Five). During the second trial, the district court granted a  motion for acquittal as to Count Five (online promotion  and facilitation of prostitution), but it sent the rest of the  charges to the jury. The jury acquitted Mr. Palms on  Count Three (retaliation against a victim and causing  bodily harm) and found him guilty on Counts One (sex  trafficking  by  force,  fraud,  and  coercion),  Two  (attempted obstruction of sex trafficking enforcement),  and Four (transporting  [*697]  an individual for  prostitution). The district court imposed a sentence of  235 months each on Counts One and Two, and 120  months on Count Four, all running concurrently. [**12]  II. DISCUSSION On appeal, Mr. Palms challenges the district court's  decisions to admit the cell phone evidence and to  exclude evidence that M.W. engaged in commercial sex  acts before she met Mr. Palms. We undertake our  analysis by first considering whether the search and  seizure of Mr. Palms's cell phone satisfied the  requirements articulated in the Fourth Amendment.  Page 5 of 10 Then, we review the district court's exclusion of the  sexual behavior evidence under Rule 412. A. Search and Seizure Mr. Palms appeals the district court's decision denying  the motion to suppress the evidence obtained from his  cell phone because (1) the warrant was invalid under  the Fourth Amendment and (2) the search was  unreasonable. When reviewing a district court's denial of  a motion to suppress, we ""view the evidence in the light  most favorable to the government and accept the district  court's  factual  findings  unless  they  are  clearly  erroneous."" United States v. Grimmett, 439 F.3d 1263,  1268 (10th Cir. 2006). But we review de novo the  ultimate question of reasonableness under the Fourth  Amendment. Loera, 923 F.3d at 915. 1. Applicable Law The Fourth Amendment provides, The right of the people to be secure in their  persons, houses, papers, and effects, against  unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be  violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon  probable cause, supported [**13]  by Oath or  affirmation, and particularly describing the place to  be searched, and the persons or things to be  seized. U.S. Const. amend. IV. In other words, the Fourth  Amendment requires warrants to be supported by  probable cause and to describe with particularity who  and what can be searched and seized. After obtaining a  warrant, the Fourth Amendment also requires officers to  conduct the search and seizure reasonably. Here, Mr.  Palms argues neither the warrant nor the subsequent  search satisfied the constitutional requirements. 2. Warrant Particularity Requirement Mr. Palms argues the warrant was not constitutionally  valid because it did not particularly describe the things  to be seized even though it was limited to evidence of  human trafficking. Thus, we must determine whether      ""the crime of human trafficking"" is a sufficiently specific  crime such that a warrant's limitation to  [*698]  search  and  seize  evidence  of  it  satisfies  the  Fourth  Amendment's particularity requirement. We hold that it  is. The Fourth Amendment's particularity requirement  ""'ensures that the search will be carefully tailored to its  justifications[] and will not take on the character of the  wide-ranging  exploratory  searches  the  Framers  intended to prohibit.'"" United States v. Otero, 563 F.3d  1127, 1131-32 (10th Cir. 2009) (quoting Maryland v.  Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 84, 107 S. Ct. 1013, 94 L. Ed. 2d  72  (1987)).  Because  computers  can  contain  enormous [**14]  amounts of information and relevant  evidence can be stored in any location, the Fourth  Amendment requires warrants for computer searches to  ""affirmatively limit the search to evidence of specific . . .  crimes or specific types of material."" Id. at 1132  (quotation marks omitted). The same standard applies  to  cell  phones  because  they  are  essentially  ""'minicomputers that also happen to have the capacity  to be used as a telephone.'"" United States v. Russian,  848 F.3d 1239, 1245 (10th Cir. 2017) (quoting Riley v.  California, 573 U.S. 373, 393, 134 S. Ct. 2473, 189 L.  Ed. 2d 430 (2014)). The guiding purpose of this standard is to establish  practical guidelines about what can be searched and  seized, leaving nothing to the discretion of the officers                                     Page 6 of 10 executing the warrant. United States v. Leary, 846 F.2d  592, 600 (10th Cir. 1988) (""A description is sufficiently  particular when it enables the searcher to reasonably  ascertain and identify the things authorized to be  seized."" (quotation marks omitted)). Thus, ""practical  accuracy rather than technical precision controls the  determination of whether a search warrant adequately  describes the place to be searched."" Otero, 563 F.3d at  1132 (quotation marks omitted). As Mr. Palms contends, the warrant was not limited to  any specific types of materials, such as text messages,  emails, or pictures. Rather, the warrant said the  information to be searched and seized ""include[d], but  [was] not [**15]  limited to, all digital evidence stored on  removable storage and magnetic or electronic data  contained in the contents of such tablet, cell phone,  laptop, camera and/or memory cards."" ROA Vol. I at 68.  Such a broad authorization is permissible under our  precedent, so long as the warrant contained some  ""limiting principle."" See Russian, 848 F.3d at 1245. The Government contends the warrant contained such a  limitation because it permitted the officers to search and  seize only evidence of ""human trafficking."" But Mr.  Palms argues ""human trafficking"" is not sufficiently  specific because the warrant did not cite a specific  criminal statute and because human trafficking is a  broad term that gave the officers ""carte blanche to  search and seize anything in the phone's contents they  believed might pertain in any way to any human  trafficking, at any time, whether for forced labor, for sex,  for drug trafficking, or anything else arguably tied to the  broad universe of 'human trafficking.'"" Aplt. Opening Br.  at 18. We disagree. To be sufficiently particular, search warrants do not  have to identify specific statutes for the crimes to which   [*699]  they are limited. See United States v. Christie,  717 F.3d 1156, 1165 (10th Cir. 2013) (holding a warrant  was particular when it was limited to information [**16]   ""'related to the murder, neglect, and abuse of'"" a child);  United States v. Brooks, 427 F.3d 1246, 1252-53 (10th  Cir. 2005) (holding a warrant satisfied the particularity  requirement when it authorized officers to search a  computer ""for evidence of child pornography""). Mr.  Palms's contrary suggestion would inject the kind of  technical precision the Fourth Amendment does not  require. Christie, 717 F.3d at 1166 (explaining the  particularity requirement has never ""been understood to  demand of a warrant technical precision or elaborate  detail but only practical limitations affording reasonable  specificity""  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted)).  Therefore, the lack of a statutory citation does not  automatically render a warrant invalid. Rather, we must  determine whether the warrant adequately limited the  scope of the search despite the absence of a statutory  reference. The warrant here is sufficiently limited. Oklahoma state  law explicitly prohibits ""human trafficking."" Okla. Stat. tit.  21, § 748(B) (""It shall be unlawful to knowingly engage  in human trafficking.""). And the definition of ""human  trafficking"" is not as unrestrained as Mr. Palms  suggests. It is defined as ""modern-day slavery that  includes, but is not limited to, extreme exploitation and  the denial of freedom or liberty of an individual for  purposes of deriving [**17]  benefit from that individual's  commercial sex act or labor."" Id. § 748(A)(4). Although Oklahoma's definition of ""human trafficking""  includes both types of human trafficking—sex trafficking  and labor trafficking—it is still a sufficiently specific,  defined crime. See, e.g., United States v. Burgess, 576  F.3d 1078, 1083, 1091 (10th Cir. 2009) (holding a  warrant was sufficiently particular when it authorized a  search for evidence of the sale of any illegal controlled  substance even though probable cause for the warrant  was based on evidence of marijuana and cocaine). It  therefore does not run afoul of our rejection of warrants  that broadly encompass ""any crime."" Cf. Otero, 563  F.3d at 1132-33 (holding a warrant was not particular  when it had ""no limiting instruction whatsoever"" and  authorized ""a wide-ranging search of [the appellant]'s  computer""); Cassady v. Goering, 567 F.3d 628, 635-36  (10th Cir. 2009) (holding a warrant was not particular  when there was only ""probable cause to search for  evidence related to marijuana cultivation, yet the  warrant authorized the seizure of all possible evidence  of any crime in any jurisdiction"").               Page 7 of 10 Because Oklahoma law labels the crime as ""human  trafficking,"" and there is no separate ""sex trafficking""  crime, it is ""difficult to imagine how the . . . warrant could  have been [**18]  phrased more specifically."" United  States v. Le, 173 F.3d 1258, 1275 (10th Cir. 1999).  Indeed, the Oklahoma state judge who issued the  warrant and the Tulsa police officers who executed it  would have understood human trafficking to be a  specific crime. And most importantly,  [*700]  the  existence of a statutory definition of ""human trafficking""  would have enabled the executing Tulsa police officers  to understand what evidence the warrant permitted  them to search and seize. Therefore, the warrant's  limitation to evidence of the crime of human trafficking  satisfied  the  Fourth  Amendment's  particularity  requirement. 3. Reasonableness of the Search and Seizure After obtaining a warrant, the officers ""must conduct  their search 'strictly within the bounds set by the  warrant.'"" Loera, 923 F.3d at 916 (quoting Bivens v. Six  Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics,  403 U.S. 388, 395 n.7, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619  (1971)). ""Determining whether a search exceeds the  scope of its authorizing warrant is, like most inquiries  under  the  Fourth  Amendment,  an  exercise  in  reasonableness assessed on a case-by-case basis."" Id.  In general, ""investigators executing a warrant can look  anywhere where evidence described in the warrant  might conceivably be located."" Id. (citing United States  v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 824, 102 S. Ct. 2157, 72 L. Ed.  2d 572 (1982)). However, that limitation can be difficult  to enforce in a computer search where relevant data  could be stored anywhere. See id. To address this problem, we have focused [**19]  on  how the computer search was conducted rather than  what was searched.See id. at 917. ""Shifting our focus             in this way is necessary in the electronic search context  because search warrants typically contain few—if any— restrictions on where within a computer or other  electronic storage device the government is permitted to  search."" Id. (emphasis in original). The reasonableness  of the search method ""depends on the particular facts of  a given case."" Id. at 920. Mr. Palms first argues the extraction of information from  his cell phone was too broad. Officer Booth testified he  could not perform a more limited file extraction or a  logical extraction on Mr. Palms's cell phone, so he  conducted a broad physical extraction of the entire  contents and metadata. And Officer Booth testified that  seeking help from other agencies would have been  pointless because he believed they had the same  extraction options as he had. He therefore extracted a  byte-for-byte copy of the contents of the cell phone and  captured a vast amount of information, including  personal information unrelated to the suspected crime. Mr. Palms also argues the search of the extracted data  should have been limited so that the officers could not  view [**20]  any information that was not related to the  suspected crime. The district court found that Officer  Oxford limited his search to the time after Mr. Palms met  M.W. The court also determined that Officer Oxford   [*701]  searched SMS messages, MMS messages,  photographs, and some emails, and that he would move  on quickly when he came across information or  communications that were not potentially relevant to the  crime of human trafficking. The district court noted that  Officer Oxford discovered some privileged attorney- client  communications  during  his  search  and  immediately stopped to consult with the prosecutor. We have previously found a similar extraction and  search to be reasonable. In United States v. Burgess,  the officers obtained a warrant to search the defendant's  property for evidence of controlled substances. 576 F.3d  at 1083. During the search, the officers found a hard  drive and searched it. To begin the search, they ""ma[d]e  a byte-for-byte copy of the hard drive."" Id. at 1084.  Although this process captured information beyond the  scope of the warrant, we did not hold the search was  unreasonable. Id. at 1095. Rather, we explained that the  broad extraction was consistent with the reality that        Page 8 of 10 evidence of the crime could be found in various file  types. [**21]  Id. at 1093. The search of the extracted  files then proceeded with the focus on files that might  contain evidence of drug trafficking. Id. at 1094-95. The  officers viewed files even if they were not obviously  labeled with titles related to the suspected crime to  confirm they had not been deceptively labeled, but if the  file did not contain relevant evidence, the officers moved  on immediately. Id. at 1094-95. In Burgess, we  concluded  the  extraction  and  the  search  were  reasonable. Id. at 1095. We reach the same conclusion here. As in Burgess, the  evidence of human trafficking in this case could have  taken many forms, such as text messages, emails,  photographs,  internet  history,  and  transaction  applications. For this reason, the warrant did not limit  the search to one type of information contained on the  cell phone. And the physical extraction of all the data  from the cell phone was reasonable. Likewise, Officer  Oxford limited his search to the time-period when Mr.  Palms knew M.W. and viewed the types of files that  were most likely to contain evidence of the crime of  human trafficking. When he came across unrelated  personal information or communications, he quickly  moved to the next thing. And when he came across  privileged attorney-client communications, [**22]  he  immediately stopped his search and contacted the  prosecutor. This search methodology was sufficiently  limited. Therefore, both the extraction and the search  methodology were reasonable. Because the warrant and the search of the cell phone  complied with the Fourth Amendment, we affirm the  district court's denial of the motion to suppress. B. Federal Rule of Evidence 412 Mr. Palms argues the district court erred by excluding  evidence of M.W.'s prior commercial sex work under  Federal Rule of Evidence 412. Specifically, Mr. Palms  appeals the decision to exclude evidence that (1) M.W.  had knowledge of how to post online advertisements for  commercial sex before she met Mr. Palms, (2)  [*702]          M.W. had voluntarily engaged in commercial sex acts  before meeting Mr. Palms, and (3) M.W. knew about  certain aspects of the commercial sex business before  she met Mr. Palms. He argues exclusion of this  evidence violated the Confrontation Clause and his  federal due process rights. ""To the extent the challenge to the exclusion of  evidence proffered by the defendant is based on a  constitutional objection . . . we review the district court's  ruling excluding that evidence de novo."" United States v.  Pablo, 696 F.3d 1280, 1297 (10th Cir. 2012). Otherwise,  a district court's ruling on the admissibility of evidence is  reviewed for abuse of discretion. United States v. A.S.,  939 F.3d 1063, 1071 (10th Cir. 2019). 1. Applicable [**23]  Law Under Federal Rule of Evidence 412, ""[e]vidence  offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual  behavior"" and ""[e]vidence offered to prove a victim's  sexual predisposition"" are ""not admissible in any civil or  criminal  proceeding  involving  alleged  sexual  misconduct."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(a). The purpose of this  rule is ""to safeguard the alleged victim against the  invasion of privacy, potential embarrassment and sexual  stereotyping."" Fed. R. Evid. 412, advisory committee  notes to 1994 amendments. However, there is an  exception in criminal cases when the exclusion of the  evidence ""would violate the defendant's constitutional  rights."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C). As relevant here, defendants have constitutional rights  to due process and to confront witnesses against them.                     Page 9 of 10 The Fifth Amendment provides, ""[n]o person shall . . . be  deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process  of the law."" U.S. Const. amend. V. This amendment  provides  individuals  with  both  substantive  and  procedural due process rights. As it relates to this  appeal, the Due Process Clause provides a defendant  with the right to a fair trial. Fero v. Kerby, 39 F.3d 1462,  1478 (10th Cir. 1994) (""A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a  basic requirement of due process."" (quoting In re  Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136, 75 S. Ct. 623, 99 L. Ed.  942 (1955))). The Sixth Amendment provides, ""[i]n all criminal  prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be  confronted with the witnesses [**24]  against him."" U.S.  Const. amend. VI. This is known as the Confrontation  Clause, and its purpose is to guarantee defendants ""'an  opportunity for effective cross-examination.'"" Delaware  v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89  L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986) (quoting Delaware v. Fensterer,  474 U.S. 15, 20, 106 S. Ct. 292, 88 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1985)  (per curiam)) (emphasis in original). However, the right  is not limitless. It does not guarantee a defendant the  right to cross-examine witnesses ""in whatever way, and  to whatever extent, the defense might wish."" Id. (quoting  Fensterer, 474 U.S. at 20). Together, the Fifth and Sixth Amendments provide  defendants with the  [*703]  ""right to present a defense.""  United States v. Oldman, 979 F.3d 1234, 1252 (10th  Cir. 2020) (quotation marks omitted). 2. Analysis Mr. Palms argues the exclusion of evidence that M.W.  understood and participated in commercial sex work  before she met him violated his constitutional rights to a  fair trial, to confront witnesses against him, and to  present a full defense. First, he argues the sexual  behavior evidence is relevant because it ""tends to  counter"" the Government's assertion that Mr. Palms  ""enticed or recruited"" M.W. to perform commercial sex  acts—an element of Count One. Aplt. Opening Br. at 28.  Second, he argues the evidence would ""impeach the  credibility of"" M.W. Id. at 30. Pursuant to the Confrontation Clause and the Due  Process Clause, sexual behavior evidence ""may be  required to be admitted . . . where relevant and  probative on a central issue of sexual offense [**25]   charges."" A.S., 939 F.3d at 1072 (quotation marks  omitted). Evidence is considered relevant if it ""has any  tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it  would be without the evidence."" Fed. R. Evid. 401.  However, relevance is not enough; the evidence must  also be probative of a central issue to be required by the  Constitution. In addition, ""the Constitution does not  mandate the admission of irrelevant or general  impeachment evidence."" A.S., 939 F.3d at 1074. Mr. Palms's first argument is not persuasive because  the sexual behavior evidence is not probative of a  central issue in this case. Evidence that a sex trafficking  victim previously engaged in prostitution is irrelevant to  whether that victim was forced or coerced into working  as a prostitute at a later date. See 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)  (prohibiting using ""means of force, threats of force,  fraud, [and] coercion"" to ""cause [a] person to engage in  a commercial sex act""). Other circuit courts have  consistently come to the same conclusion. United  States v. Rivera, 799 F.3d 180, 185 (2d Cir. 2015)  (""Evidence of victims' prior acts of commercial sex is  irrelevant to whether those victims were coerced into  working as prostitutes.""); United States v. Roy, 781 F.3d  416, 420 (8th Cir. 2015) (""The victim's participation in  prostitution either before or after the time period in the  indictment has no relevance to whether Roy [**26]  beat  her, threatened her, and took the money she made from  prostitution in order to cause her to engage in  commercial sex.""); United States v. Cephus, 684 F.3d  703, 708 (7th Cir. 2012) (explaining evidence the victim  had been a prostitute before ""would not be evidence  that she consented to be beaten and to receive no  share of the fees paid by the johns she serviced""); see  also United States v. Brown, 810 F. App'x 105, 108 (3d  Cir. 2020) (unpublished) (""[W]hether Brown's victims  engaged in prostitution before 2011 or after 2014 would  have had little if any probative value.""), cert. denied, 141  S. Ct. 443, 208 L. Ed. 2d 136 (2020); United States v.  Valenzuela, 495 F. App'x 817, 819-20 (9th Cir. Nov. 2,  2012) (per curiam) (unpublished) (""Appellants cannot  show the relevance of questions about prior prostitution  to either Appellants' knowledge of the use of force,  fraud, or coercion, or the victims' consent to work in  prostitution.""). Even if M.W. participated in commercial  sex work in 2017 and knew how to post ads for  commercial sex, that does not tend to prove Mr. Palms  did not force her to engage in prostitution during the  period charged. Indeed, this lack of probative value is  exactly why Rule 412 exists. It ""preclude[s] defendants  from arguing that because the victim previously  consented to have sex—for love or money—her claims  of coercion should not be believed."" Rivera, 799 F.3d at  185.  [*704]  As to the issue of impeachment, Mr. Palms  Page 10 of 10 argues he should [**27]  have been permitted to present  the evidence of M.W.'s prior commercial sex work when  M.W. testified prostitution is ""not something [she] would  choose to do on [her] own."" Aplt. Opening Br. at 29.  Because the sexual behavior evidence is not relevant to  or probative of the issues on trial, this is general  impeachment evidence that is not required by the  Constitution. See A.S., 939 F.3d at 1074 (holding  evidence of prior sexual behavior is not constitutionally  required if it would solely diminish the witness's general  credibility). And we cannot say the district court abused  its discretion in excluding the sexual behavior evidence  under Rule 412. Thus, we affirm the district court's ruling  excluding the evidence of M.W.'s prior commercial sex  work.",1
B.M. v. Wyndham Hotels,"ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN  PART DEFENDANTS WYNDHAM HOTELS &  RESORTS, INC.'S AND CHOICE HOTELS  INTERNATIONAL, INC.'S MOTIONS TO DISMISS  WITH LEAVE TO AMEND; DENYING CHOICE [*2]   HOTELS INTERNATIONAL, INC.'S MOTION TO  STRIKE; ALLOWING PLAINTIFF TO PROCEED WITH  A PSEUDONYM; SETTING CASE MANAGEMENT  CONFERENCE ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2020 AT 10:00  A.M. Plaintiff B.M. is a survivor of sex trafficking. She brings  this action against three hotel chains alleging violation of  Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act  (""TVPRA"") for profiting from her sex trafficking. Before the Court are two motions: (1) Defendant  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.'s (""Wyndham"") Motion  to Dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  12(b)(6) at ECF 32 and (2) Defendant Choice Hotels  International, Inc.'s (""Choice"") Motion to Dismiss under  Rule 12(b)(6) and Motion to Strike under Rule 12(f) at  ECF 49. The Court heard oral arguments on July 9,  2020. For the reasons stated below, the Court GRANTS  IN PART and DENIES IN PART both Motions to  Dismiss WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. Choice's Motion to  Strike is DENIED. I. BACKGROUND Unless otherwise noted, the following factual allegations  are drawn from the Complaint, ECF 1 (""Compl.""). Defendant Wyndham is ""one of the largest hotel brands  Page 2 of 11 in the world with nearly 9,000 branded properties in  more than eighty (80) countries."" Compl. ¶ 10. Super 8®  by Wyndham (""Super 8"") is a Wyndham ""brand  property."" Id. ¶ 10(b). Defendant [*3]  Choice is another  large worldwide hotel brand. Id. ¶ 11. Clarion Inn is a  Choice ""brand property."" Id. ¶ 11(a). Defendant G6  Hospitality, LLC (""G6"") is ""one of the largest motel  brands in the world."" Id. ¶ 12. Motel 6 South (""Motel 6"")  is a G6 ""brand property."" Id. ¶ 12(a). Plaintiff B.M. was trafficked for commercial sex as  minor at hotels in Santa Clara County, California,  including Super 8, Clarion Inn, and Motel 6. Compl. ¶¶  4, 6. B.M. was first subjugated to sex trafficking in  2014 at Defendants' hotels when she was sixteen years  old. Compl. ¶ 67. For two years, B.M.'s traffickers rented  two adjoining rooms at a Super 8 hotel and Clarion Inn.  Id. ¶ 68. B.M. and other girls were forced to perform  commercial sex acts with ten to fifteen men a day. Id. A  procession of adult men would enter B.M.'s room, stay  for 15 minutes to an hour on average, and then leave.  Id. ¶ 71. The adult men arriving at B.M.'s room were  ""typically middle-aged men of a variety of races,"" and  none of them ""appeared to be age-appropriate  contemporaries of the minor Plaintiff."" Id. ¶ 72. None of  her visitors acted ""as though they were a guardian or  relative"" of B.M. Id. B.M. alleges that Defendants knew  or should [*4]  have known that B.M. was being sex  trafficked due to: (1) large amounts of used condoms,  empty lube bottles, and other sex related items in the  hotel room; (2) payments for the rooms in cash; (3)  B.M.'s physical appearance (malnourished, bruised, and  beaten); (4) a continuous procession of older men  entering and leaving B.M.'s room; and (5) excessive  requests for sheets, cleaning supplies, and room  service. Id. ¶ 74. B.M. brings this action pursuant to the TVPRA against  Defendants Wyndham, Choice, and G6 (together,  ""Defendants""). Compl. ¶¶ 2, 8. B.M. alleges that all  Defendants knowingly benefited from facilitating the sex  trafficking venture in which B.M. was victimized in  violation of the TVPRA. Id. ¶¶ 5, 8. As to Wyndham specifically, B.M. alleges that Wyndham  was on notice of repeated incidences of sex trafficking  occurring on its Super 8 branded properties. Id. ¶ 64 (a)- (d). According to Plaintiff, Wyndham failed to implement  its  anti-trafficking  policies  to  prevent  related  misconducts and continues to profit from the business  trafficking brings. Id. ¶ 64(f). The Complaint cites  multiple news reports and online reviews (for example  on www.tripadvisor.com) to allege Wyndham had  actual [*5]  or constructive knowledge of the sex  trafficking occurrences at its Super 8 branded hotels  throughout the country, and argues that Wyndham's  knowledge facilitated the sex trafficking of B.M. Id. ¶  64(n). B.M. further contends that Wyndham was in an  agency relationship with the Super 8 hotels through its  ""exercise of an ongoing and systematic right of control  over Super 8® hotels,"" including how the hotels  conducted daily business. Id. ¶ 64(k). Wyndham also  ""held out Super 8 branded hotels to the public as  possessing authority to act on its behalf."" Id. ¶ 64(l). Similarly, with regard to Choice, B.M. alleges that  Defendant Choice had constructive knowledge of sex  trafficking occurring on its branded hotel properties.  Compl. ¶ 65(c). According to Plaintiff, Choice knew or  should have known that Clarion Inn hotels where  Plaintiff was trafficked ""were in areas known for high  incidences of crime and prone to sex trafficking activity  on and around the hotel premises, including when  Plaintiff was trafficked.""

Motion to Dismiss ""A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil  Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon  which relief can be granted 'tests the legal sufficiency of  a claim.'"" Conservation Force v. Salazar, 646 F.3d  1240, 1241-42 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Navarro v. Block,  250 F.3d 729, 732 (9th Cir. 2001)). When determining  whether a claim has been stated, the Court accepts as  true all well-pled factual allegations and construes them  in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Reese v. BP  Exploration (Alaska) Inc., 643 F.3d 681, 690 (9th Cir.  2011). However, the Court need not ""accept as true  allegations that contradict matters properly subject to  judicial  notice""  or  ""allegations  that  are  merely  conclusory,  unwarranted  deductions  of  fact,  or  unreasonable inferences."" In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig.,  536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation  marks and citations omitted). While a complaint need  not contain detailed factual allegations, it ""must contain  sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a  claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'"" Ashcroft v.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d  868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.  544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). A  claim is facially plausible when it ""allows the court to  draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is  liable [*8]  for the misconduct alleged."" Id. On a motion  to dismiss, the Court's review is limited to the face of the  complaint and matters judicially noticeable. MGIC  Indem. Corp. v. Weisman, 803 F.2d 500, 504 (9th Cir.  1986); N. Star Int'l v. Ariz. Corp. Comm'n, 720 F.2d 578,  581 (9th Cir. 1983). In deciding whether to grant leave to amend, the Court  must consider the factors set forth by the Supreme  Court in Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9  L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962), and discussed at length by the  Ninth Circuit in Eminence Capital, LLC v. Aspeon, Inc.,  316 F.3d 1048 (9th Cir. 2009). A district court ordinarily  must grant leave to amend unless one or more of the  Foman factors is present: (1) undue delay, (2) bad faith  or dilatory motive, (3) repeated failure to cure  deficiencies by amendment, (4) undue prejudice to the  opposing party, or (5) futility of amendment. Eminence  Capital, 316 F.3d at 1052. ""[I]t is the consideration of  prejudice to the opposing party that carries the greatest  weight."" Id. However, a strong showing with respect to  one of the other factors may warrant denial of leave to  amend. Id. 2. TVPRA B.M. brings this action under Trafficking Victims  Protection Reauthorization Act (""TVPRA""). The TVPRA  has two provisions relevant to this case providing (1)  criminal penalties and (2) civil liability. The TVPRA provides for criminal penalties as set forth  in 18 U.S.C. § 1591: (a) Whoever knowingly— (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, ...  recruits, entices, harbors, transports, [*9]  provides,  obtains,  advertises,  maintains,  patronizes,  or  solicits by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting  the violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in  reckless disregard of the fact, that means of  force,  threats  of  force,  fraud,  coercion  described  in  subsection  (e)(2),  or  any  combination of such means will be used to  cause the person to engage in a commercial  sex act, or that the person has not attained the  age of 18 years and will be caused to engage  in a commercial sex act, shall be punished as  provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Section 1591 defines ""participation  in a venture"" as ""knowingly assisting, supporting, or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1),"" § 1591(e)(4),  and defines ""venture"" as ""any group of two or more  individuals associated in fact, whether or not a legal  entity,"" § 1591(e)(6). In Afyare, the Sixth Circuit agreed  with a district court that a defendant must ""actually  participate and commit some 'overt act' that furthers"" the  criminal ""aspect of the venture"" and that the TVPRA ""did  not criminalize"" any lesser conduct. U.S. v. Afyare, 632  Fed. App'x 272, 286 (6th Cir. 2016). Thus, Afyare court  required the prosecution ""to prove that [*10]  the  defendant actually participated in a sex-trafficking  venture."" Id. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *7 Page 4 of 11 TVPRA's civil liabilities are set forth under U.S.C. §  1595: An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). B.M. sues under 18 U.S.C § 1595. As a threshold matter, the Court addresses the parties'  dispute as to whether the ""participation in a venture""  definition from the criminal liability section of the  TVPRA, section 1591(e)(4), applies to the civil liability  section 1595 and concludes that it does not. The Court  agrees with the statutory construction analysis in M.A. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959,  969 (S.D. Ohio 2019), adopted by Judge Orrick in J.C.  v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., No. 20-CV-00155-WHO,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99252, 2020 WL 3035794, at *1,  n. 1 (N.D. Cal. June 5, 2020) that applying the  ""participation in a venture"" definition from the criminal  liability section of the TVPRA to the civil liability section  of the TVPRA, ""would void the 'should have known'  language in the civil remedy"" and ""[t]his violates the  'cardinal [*11]  principle of statutory construction that a  statute ought, upon the whole, to be construed so that, if  it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall  be superfluous, void, or insignificant."" J.C. v. Choice  Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99252, 2020 WL  3035794, at *1, n. 1 (quoting M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels &  Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 969). Accordingly,  B.M. is not required to allege an overt act in furtherance  of or actual knowledge of a sex trafficking venture in  order to sufficiently plead her section 1595 civil liability  claim. See A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., No. CV 19-5770,  455 F. Supp. 3d 171, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70644,  2020 WL 1939678, at *13 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 22, 2020)  (declining to apply the ""participation in a venture""  element from the criminal offense defined by Congress  in section 1591 to a claim or civil remedy). B. Discussion Wyndham and Choice argue that the Complaint's  allegations are insufficient for either direct or vicarious  liability. For the reasons discussed below, the Court  finds that the Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to  make a plausible claim for direct liability and grants  leave to amend for that theory. The Court is satisfied,  however, that Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts that when  taken as true, establish a plausible claim for an agency  theory of liability. 1. Plaintiff's Direct Liability Theory To state a claim under a section 1595(a) beneficiary  theory, B.M. must allege facts from which the Court can  reasonably [*12]  infer that Wyndham and Choice (1)  ""knowingly benefit[ted] financially or by receiving  anything of value""; (2) from participation in a venture; (3)  they ""knew or should have known has engaged in"" sex  trafficking. Wyndham and Choice argue that Plaintiff  fails to allege facts to support the three elements. The  Court recognizes that Wyndham and Choice are  unrelated companies and that Plaintiff must separately  allege facts against each defendant to support her  claims. Where the Court discusses the allegations  against both Defendants, it is based on the Court's  consideration of separate allegations similar in nature  and similar arguments proffered by each Defendant in  their motions. Combining the analysis of the issues is  solely for the purpose of brevity. There is no confusion  by the Court that Plaintiff must separately plead and  prove her case against Choice and Wyndham. a. Knowing financial benefit Wyndham and Choice challenge Plaintiff's allegations  that they knowingly benefited from her trafficking. See  Wyndham Motion at 6-7; Choice Motion at 10-12. They  argue that the ""'benefit' must derive directly from, and be  knowingly received in exchange for, participating in a  sex-trafficking venture."" [*13]  Wyndham Motion at 6.  According to Wyndham and Choice, receiving royalties  from independently owned and operated hotels is not  enough. Id. at 6-7. The Court disagrees. Wyndham and  Choice's  interpretation  of  the  statute  reads  a  requirement for ""actual knowledge"" of criminal sex  trafficking into the civil statute, reading out the ""should  have known"" language. The ""knowingly benefit"" element  of section 1595 ""merely requires that Defendant  knowingly receive a financial benefit"" and the rental of a  room (or Wyndham and Choice's receipt of royalties for  that rental) constitutes a financial benefit from a  relationship with the trafficker sufficient to meet this  element. H.H. v. G6 Hosp., LLC, No. 2:19-CV-755, 2019  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *2 (S.D.  Ohio Dec. 6, 2019). Here, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants received financial  benefits and other incidentals from continuously renting  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *10 Page 5 of 11 rooms to her traffickers. See Compl. ¶¶ 2, 10(h), 11(h),  82, 85. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants directly  benefited from the trafficking of Plaintiff on each  occasion they received payment for rooms that she was  being kept in at the Defendants' branded properties.  See id. ¶ 90. Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to meet  the ""knowingly benefitted"" element of a civil claim under  section 1595 of the [*14]  TVPRA at the motion to  dismiss stage. b. Participation in venture Having found that ""participation in venture"" under  section 1595 of the TVPRA does not require an ""overt  act"" of participation in the sex trafficking itself, the  Court must then examine whether Plaintiff has alleged  sufficient facts for a plausible claim that Wyndham and  Choice ""participated in a venture."" The Court finds that Plaintiff's direct liability theory  against Wyndham and Choice is insufficiently pled as to  the ""participation in venture"" element because the  Complaint fails to connect the dots between Plaintiff's  alleged sex trafficking and these Defendants. Plaintiff's  theory is that Defendants participated in a venture ""by  participating in, and facilitating, the harboring and  providing of B.M. for the purposes of commercial sex  induced by force, fraud, or coercion, by their acts,  omissions, and commissions."" Compl. ¶ 89. Plaintiff  argues that she alleges facts showing that Wyndham  and Choice ""participated in a venture"" because their  branded hotels (Super 8 and Clarion Inn) rented rooms  to people they knew or should have known were  engaged in sex trafficking. See Opp'n to Wyndham at  12 (citing Compl. ¶¶ 62-64), ECF 59. Plaintiff [*15]   further alleges — and the Court accepts as true at this  stage — that B.M. showed visible signs of being sex  trafficked (e.g., visible injuries and consistent foot  traffic from older men to her room) when she was at  one Super 8 and one Clarion Inn facility in San Jose,  California. Compl. ¶¶ 71-72, 74. In addition, Plaintiff  alleges that Clarion Inn employees threatened to eject  Plaintiff B.M. and her traffickers, but never took further  action. Id. ¶ 69. According to Plaintiff, Wyndham (the  ultimate parent company of the franchisor of the Super 8  hotel brand ) and Choice (the franchisor of the Clarion        Inn hotels ) were generally aware that acts of sex  trafficking take place in their franchisee hotels around  the United States. Id. ¶¶ 64, 65. While these allegation might be sufficient to state a  plausible claim against the specific hotels where Plaintiff  was trafficked (who Plaintiff has not sued), they do not  make a plausible claim that Wyndham and Choice  directly participated in a venture that trafficked B.M. at  the specific facilities she alleges her traffickers used. In  other words, the Complaint is devoid of any facts linking  these Defendants (Wyndham and [*16]  Choice) to  the sex trafficking of this Plaintiff (B.M.), and thus  fails to make a plausible claim for Wyndham's and  Choice's direct ""participation in venture"". c. Knew or should have known the venture was  engaged in trafficking While Defendants need not have actual knowledge of  the sex trafficking in order to have participated in the  sex trafficking venture for civil liability under the  TVPRA, Plaintiff must allege facts to support that  Wyndham and Choice, at the very least, rented rooms  to people they should have known were engaging in her  sex trafficking. And she has failed to do so here.  Plaintiff alleges the following facts, specific to her  trafficking: • ""For two years, Plaintiff's traffickers rented two  adjoining rooms at the Super 8 and Clarion Inn.  Plaintiff was one of several other girls that were  being simultaneously trafficked in these two  rooms. Each girl, including minor Plaintiff B.M.,  would be forced to perform commercial sex acts  with ten to fifteen men a day."" Compl. ¶ 68. • ""Clarion Inn employees threatened to eject                         2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *13 Page 6 of 11 Plaintiff B.M. and her traffickers, but never took  further action. Despite these threats, Plaintiff B.M.  and  several  other  victims  continued  to  be  trafficked [*17]  on the premises."" Compl. ¶ 69. • ""Day after day, a procession of adult men would  enter minor Plaintiff B.M.'s room, stay for 15  minutes to an hour on average, and then leave.""  Compl. ¶ 71. • ""The adult men arriving at the Plaintiff's room were  typically middle-aged men of a variety of races —  none of whom appeared to be age-appropriate  contemporaries of the minor Plaintiff. None of these  visitors acted in any manner as though they were a  guardian or relative of the minor Plaintiff."" Compl. ¶  72. Further, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants ""knew  or should have known that Plaintiff B.M. was being  trafficked for sex"" due to the following red flags: • large amounts of used condoms, empty lube  bottles, and other sex-related items in the hotel  room; • payments for the rooms in cash; • Plaintiff's physical appearance (malnourished,  bruised, beaten); • a continuous procession of older men entering  and leaving minor Plaintiff B.M.'s room; • excessive requests for sheets, cleaning supplies,  room service; and • the personal relationship between the front desk  employees and Plaintiff's traffickers. Compl. ¶ 74. But all these allegations support a theory  that  the  staff  at  the  franchisee  hotels  where  Plaintiff [*18]  was trafficked knew or should have  known about her trafficking. The Complaint fails to  allege facts as to how Wyndham (the ultimate parent  company of the franchisor) and Choice (the franchisor)  knew or should have known Plaintiff was being  trafficked. To support her direct liability theory, Plaintiff  must allege facts showing these Defendants knew or  should have known of her trafficking — and she fails to  do so in her Complaint. 2. Plaintiff's Agency Liability Theory Wyndham and Choice argue that Plaintiff's allegations  of vicarious liability are ""conclusory"" and should be  dismissed. Wyndham Motion at 9-10; see also Choice  Motion at 14- 17. The Court disagrees. Under California  law, ""a franchisee may be deemed to be the agent of  the franchisor."" Kuchta v. Allied Builders Corp., 21 Cal.  App. 3d 541, 547, 98 Cal. Rptr. 588 (Ct. App. 1971).  ""The general rule is that, if a franchise agreement gives  the franchisor the right of complete or substantial control  over the franchisee, an agency relationship exists.""  Walker v. Pac. Pride Servs., Inc., 341 F. App'x 350, 351  (9th Cir. 2009) (citing Kuchta, 21 Cal. App. 3d at 547). The Court is satisfied that Plaintiff has alleged sufficient  facts to establish a plausible claim for an agency  relationship between the franchisees and Wyndham and  Choice. For example, Plaintiff alleges that Wyndham  exercises ""ongoing and systemic right of control [*19]   over Super 8® hotels"" by a variety of actions including  ""setting  employee  wages,""  ""making  employee  decisions,"" and ""standardized training methods for  employees."" Compl. ¶ 64(k); id ¶ 65(g) (same  allegations as to Choice and Clarion Inn). While Plaintiff  might  ultimately  not  succeed  in  proving  these  allegations, they are enough to get her past the motion  to dismiss. Similarly, Plaintiff's allegations that Wyndham and  Choice are liable as joint employers of the franchisee  hotel employees survive the motion to dismiss. The joint  employer  doctrine  recognizes  that  ""even  where  business entities are separate, if they share control of  the terms or conditions of an individual's employment,  both companies can qualify as employers."" Johnson v.  Serenity Transp., Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8404,  2016 WL 270952, at *10 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 22, 2016). The  Ninth Circuit has adopted a four-part ""economic reality""  test  to  determine  when  the  employer-employee  relationship exists. See Bonnette v. California Health &  Welfare Agency, 704 F.2d 1465, 1470 (9th Cir. 1983).  These factors include whether the employer: ""(1) had  the power to hire and fire the employees, (2) supervised  and controlled employee work schedules or conditions  of employment, (3) determined the rate and method of  payment, and (4) maintained employment records."" Id.  Plaintiff alleges that Wyndham and Choice had control  over the hotels [*20]  where was trafficked by, for  example,  advertising  for  employment;  making  employment  decisions;  setting  employee  wages;  standardized  or  strict  rules  of  operation;  and  standardized training methods for employees. Compl. ¶  64(k); id ¶ 65(g). These alleged facts state a plausible  claim for joint employment. To be clear, the Court does not read section 1595 of  TVPRA  requiring  hotels  or  their  franchisors  to  affirmatively stop sex trafficking. See A.B. v. Marriott  Int'l, Inc., CV 19-5770, 455 F. Supp. 3d 171, 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 70644, 2020 WL 1939678, at *8 (E.D. Pa.  Apr. 22, 2020) (""We do not read the Act as requiring  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *16 Page 7 of 11 hotels (and other businesses or professions possibly  earning money from trafficking) to affirmatively stop the  trafficking.""). But the Court finds that Plaintiff has  alleged sufficient facts to support a plausible claim that  Wyndham and Choice received financial benefits from a  venture they vicariously participate in (through their  franchisees) that the franchisees should have known  was engaged in sex trafficking of B.M. in violation of  section 1595. Choice and Wyndham argue that ""[t]here is no case law  that supports the idea that a simple agency relationship  [...] is sufficient to create liability under the TVPRA.""  Choice Motion at 14; see also Wyndham Reply at 6, n.5,  ECF 62. The Court disagrees. [*21]  For example, in  A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., Judge Kearney held: We agree A.B. does not plead facts after two  attempts allowing us to reasonably infer Marriott  knew of sex trafficking victimizing her. But A.B.  sufficiently pleads specific facts from which we can  reasonably infer Marriott, under an actual agency  theory subject to discovery, knowingly benefitted  from participating in a venture which it should have  known engaged in her trafficking. This is all  Congress requires a victim to plead. A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70644,  2020 WL 1939678, at *1. Wyndham acknowledges this  holding but disagrees with it. See Wyndham Reply at 6  n. 2 (""The court in A.B. denied a motion to dismiss by a  hotel franchisor on the narrow grounds that the  complaint alleged an agency relationship between the  franchisor and independent third-party franchisees.  A.B., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70644, 2020 WL 1939678,  at *19. The TVPRA, however, does not provide for  secondary liability.""). Neither Wyndham nor Choice has  provided any authority to support the assertion or  explain why the well-established agency liability is  inapplicable to TVPRA claims. See M.A. v. Wyndham  Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 972 (denying  motion to dismiss allegations of vicarious liability under  agency theory for a TVPRA civil claim). 3. Shotgun Pleading Wyndham and Choice contend that the Complaint [*22]   is an impermissible ""shotgun"" pleading. Wyndham  Motion at 3-4; Choice Motion at 4-6. Shotgun pleadings  are pleadings that overwhelm defendants with an  unclear mass of allegations and make it difficult or  impossible for defendants to make informed responses  to the plaintiff's allegations."" Sollberger v. Wachovia  Sec., LLC, No. SACV 09-0766AGANX, 2010 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 66233, 2010 WL 2674456, at *4 (C.D. Cal. June  30, 2010). The Court is not persuaded that the  Complaint in this case is a shotgun pleading. Although the Complaint contains many allegations that  seem to relate to the hospitality industry in general, it  also includes numerous factual allegations specific to  each Defendant. See e.g., Complaint ¶¶ 64 (allegations  specific to Wyndham); 65 (allegations specific to  Choice). Plaintiff identifies the specific hotel locations  where she was allegedly trafficked and ties those  locations to each Defendant. See Compl. ¶¶ 10; 11.  While Plaintiff's allegations regarding her experience at  each hotel is not a model for specificity, she does allege  facts as to each Defendant. See e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 68  (""For two years, Plaintiff's traffickers rented two  adjoining rooms at the Super 8 and Clarion Inn. Plaintiff  was one of several other girls that were being  simultaneously [*23]  trafficked in these two rooms."");  69 (""Clarion Inn employees threatened to eject Plaintiff  B.M. and her traffickers, but never took further action."").  Thus, the Complaint cannot be fairly categorized as an  ""everyone did everything"" pleading. Destfino v. Reiswig,  630 F.3d 952, 958 (9th Cir. 2011). Choice argues that  ""Plaintiff incorporates every prior allegation into her  claim."" But ""a complaint does not employ impermissible  shotgun pleading just because it re-alleges by reference  all of the factual paragraphs preceding the claims for  relief."" Espinosa v. Bluemercury, Inc., No. 16-CV-07202- JST, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41885, 2017 WL 1079553,  at *5 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 22, 2017). As noted at the Hearing, the Court is concerned that  B.M.'s allegations against the three Defendants are  factually independent because the Defendants (all  independent public companies) are not alleged to have  any connection with each other — other than the fact  that B.M was allegedly trafficked in three separate  franchisee hotels related to each Defendant. The Court  also recognizes the practical issues raised by Choice.  For example, Plaintiff fails to allege when she visited  each location at issue, how frequently she visited, and  for what period of time. See Choice Motion at 6. But the  Court is not persuaded that these concerns warrant a  dismissal of [*24]  the entire Complaint as ""shotgun  pleading"", but instead can be resolved through case  management conferences and discovery motions. That  said, because the Court is granting Plaintiff leave to  amend her Complaint, she is instructed to add as many  details as possible about her stays at each location. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *20 Page 8 of 11 III. CHOICE'S MOTION TO STRIKE Choice moves to strike paragraphs 20 to 61 in the  Complaint  because  they  contain  ""salacious  and  impertinent details[.]"" Choice Motion at 6. Choice  contends that the allegations are not related to the facts  in controversy and will only serve to prejudice Choice  and confuse the issues. Id. B.M. responds that the  challenged paragraphs contain contextual and factual  allegations and provide support as to Choice's  constructive notice of the sex trafficking issues on its  properties. Opp'n to Choice at 20-21, ECF 58. B.M. also  contends that Choice fails to prove that it is prejudiced  by the factual allegations. Id. The Court finds that the  challenged paragraphs provide relevant background  information for B.M.'s claims against Defendants, as  uncomfortable as that may be for Choice, and thus,  DENIES Choice's Motion to Strike. A. Legal Standard Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12(f) permits a  court to ""strike [*25]  from a pleading an insufficient  defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or  scandalous matter."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). A matter is  impertinent if it consists of statements that do not  pertain to and are not necessary to the issues in  question. Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty, 984 F.2d 1524, 1527  (9th Cir.1993), rev'd on other grounds, 510 U.S. 517,  114 S. Ct. 1023, 127 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1994).  ""Scandalous"" under Rule 12(f) ""generally refers to any  allegation that unnecessarily reflects on the moral  character of an individual or states anything in repulsive  language that detracts from the dignity of the court.""

""Scandalous"" has also been defined as  allegations that cast a ""cruelly derogatory light"" on  someone. Holmes v. Elec. Document Processing, Inc.,  966 F. Supp. 2d 925, 938 (N.D. Cal. 2013) (citations  omitted). Motions to strike are generally disfavored and ""should  not be granted unless the matter to be stricken clearly  could have no possible bearing on the subject of the  litigation.""

A court should not strike allegations supplying  background or historical material unless it is unduly  prejudicial to the opponent. See LeDuc v. Ky. Cent. Life  Ins. Co., 814 F.Supp. 820, 830 (N.D.Cal.1992). Indeed,  if there is any doubt whether the challenged matter  might bear on an issue in the litigation, the motion to  strike should be denied, and assessment of the  sufficiency of the allegations left for adjudication on the  merits. Rees v. PNC Bank, N.A., 308 F.R.D. 266, 271  (N.D. Cal. 2015). A court should [*26]  view the pleading  in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Id.  Whether to grant a motion to strike lies within the sound  discretion of the district court. Id. B. Discussion While many of the challenged paragraphs are not  directly relevant to B.M.'s claims against Defendants,  they nonetheless supply information regarding the  general issue of sex trafficking and the role of the  hospitality industry. See Compl. ¶¶ 20-61. Viewing the  pleading in the light most favorable to B.M., some of the  paragraphs Choice seeks to strike provide background  information as to Choice's general policy in dealing with  sex trade and its constructive knowledge about such  issues. See e.g., id. ¶¶ 52-53. The background  information is therefore related to the claims against  Choice and helps with a fuller understanding of the  Complaint as a whole. See Sec. & Exch. Comm. v.  Strong Inv. Mgmt., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 232678, 2018  WL 8731559, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 9, 2018) (denying  motion to strike because the challenged allegations  provide some historical background and context to the  claims at issue and they give a full understanding when  read with the complaint as a whole). Moreover, the  challenged paragraphs are not unduly prejudicial to  Choice. Even though the background information may  portray Choice in an unfavorable [*27]  way, Choice will  have opportunities to challenge the allegations by  evidence at a later stage in the proceedings. See Kaiser  Found. Hosp. v. Cal. Nurses Ass'n, 2012 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 16563, 2012 WL 440634, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Feb.  10, 2012) (denying motion to strike even though the  background information portrayed the defendant in an  unfavorable light because defendants would have  opportunities to challenge the allegations as the case  proceeds). Choice also claims that paragraphs 20 to 61 should be  stricken because they are impertinent and scandalous.  Choice Motion at 6. The Court disagrees. As discussed  above, the challenged paragraphs are not impertinent  because they provide relevant background information.  Moreover,  the  challenged  allegations  are  not  scandalous because they do not go into ""salacious"" or  ""needless details."" See Compl. ¶¶ 20-61; Gallegos,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *24 Page 9 of 11 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74207, 2016 WL 3162203, at *3  (holding that the challenged allegations regarding  defendant's long history of sexually harassing conducts  were not scandalous within the meaning of Rule 12(f)  because they did not go into ""salacious"" or ""needless  details"" even though the topic is naturally sensitive and  unseemly). Although the allegations in paragraphs 20- 61 of the Complaint might portray Defendants in an  unfavorable way, they do not rise to the level of being  ""cruelly derogatory."" See Holmes, 966 F. Supp. 2d at  938 (holding that [*28]  the allegations were not  scandalous because they did not rise to the level of  casing the defendant in a ""cruelly derogatory light"").  Therefore, Choice's Motion to Strike is DENIED. IV. B.M.'S USE OF PSEUDONYM In her Complaint, B.M. requests that the Court grant a  protective order and permit her to proceed under a  pseudonym. Compl. ¶ 9(b). B.M. agrees to reveal her  identity to Defendants for the limited purposes of  investigating her claims once the parties have entered  into a protective order. Id. ¶ 9(f). B.M. seeks redactions  of her personal identifying information from the public  docket and assurances that Defendants will not use or  publish her identity in a manner that will compromise her  personal life or future employment prospects. Id. In its motion, Choice argues that B.M. is not entitled to  proceed anonymously in court proceedings because  she has not demonstrated sufficient grounds for her  request and has not filed a motion for a protective order  and leave to proceed anonymously in this Court. Choice  Motion at 18-19. Nevertheless, Defendants do not  oppose B.M. proceeding by pseudonym for purposes of  pre-trial public filings only. Joint Case Management  Statement at 9; ECF 71. In [*29]  her opposition, B.M.  contends that pseudonym status is warranted due to the  sensitive nature of the issues and the risk of harm to her  as a victim of sex trafficking. Opp'n to Choice at 22. In  addition, prejudice to Choice can be reduced as B.M.  will agree to reveal her identity to Choice, and the public  interest will not be threatened because the bulk of the  case will still be on public record. Id. at 22-23. The Court  permits B.M.'s use of pseudonym in this case because  her need for anonymity outweighs the risk of prejudice  to Choice at the current stage and the public interest in  knowing her identity. A. Legal Standard Rule 10(a) commands that the title of every complaint  ""include the names of all the parties."" Fed. R. Civ. P.  10(a). However, the Ninth Circuit allows parties to use  pseudonyms  under  special  circumstances  where  nondisclosure of the party's identity is necessary to  protect a person from harassment, injury, ridicule or  personal embarrassment. Does I through XXIII v.  Advanced Textile, 214 F.3d 1058, 1067-68 (9th Cir.  2000) (citations omitted). A court must balance the need  for anonymity against the risk of prejudice to the  opposing party and the public's interest in knowing the  party's identity. Jane Roes 1-2 v. SFBSC Mgmt., LLC,  77 F. Supp. 3d 990, 993 (N.D. Cal. 2015); Does I  through XXIII, 214 F.3d at 1068. Applying the balancing  test, courts have permitted [*30]  plaintiffs to use  pseudonyms in three situations: (1) when identification  creates a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm; (2)  when anonymity is necessary to preserve privacy in a  matter of sensitive and highly personal nature; and (3)  when the anonymous party is compelled to admit his or  her intention to engage in illegal conduct. Jane Roes 1- 2, 77 F. Supp. 3d at 993 (citing Does I through XXIII,  214 F.3d at 1068). And the Court must determine the precise prejudice at  each stage of the proceedings to the opposing party,  and whether proceedings may be structured so as to  mitigate that prejudice. Does I through XXIII, 214 F.3d at  1068. Finally, the Court must decide whether the  public's interest in the case would be best served by  requiring that the litigants reveal their identities. Id. at  1069. In cases where plaintiff has demonstrated a need  for anonymity, the district court should use its powers to  manage pretrial proceedings under Rule 16(b) and to  issue protective orders limiting disclosure of the party's  name under Rule 26(c) ""to preserve the party's  anonymity to the greatest extent possible without  prejudicing the opposing party's ability to litigate the  case."" Id.; Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b); Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c). B. Discussion The Court permits B.M. to use a pseudonym because  B.M.'s need for anonymity outweighs [*31]  the risk of  prejudice to Defendants at the current stage of this case  and the public interest in knowing the B.M.'s identity.  First, B.M.'s need for anonymity weighs heavily in favor  of granting such permission. B.M. is a victim of sex  trafficking, she was trafficked when she was a minor,  and this case involves the disclosure of sensitive and  highly personal information. See Compl. ¶ 9(d); Opp'n to  Choice at 22. The Court finds it necessary to protect  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *27 Page 10 of 11 B.M.'s privacy in this case. See Doe v. Penzato, No.  CV10-5154 MEJ, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51681, 2011  WL 1833007, at *5 (N.D. Cal. May 13, 2011) (granting  the plaintiff's petition to proceed anonymously where  she alleged she was a victim of human trafficking,  forced labor, and sexual battery); Doe v. Kuo Huei Lee,  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20686, 2014 WL 630936, at * 2  (N.D. Cal. Feb. 18, 2014) (""[B]ecause being taken  advantage of in a sexual manner as a minor is of a  highly sensitive and personal nature, cases of involving  such an issue have often been found to allow for the  use of a fictitious name.""). On the other hand, there is a low risk of prejudice to  Defendants at the current stage, and the public interest  is better served if B.M. is allowed to proceed  anonymously. Prejudice to Defendants is minimal  because B.M. will agree to reveal her identity for  purposes [*32]  of investigating her claims. See Opp'n to  Choice at 24; Compl. ¶ 9(f). In addition, the public  interest in knowing the parties' identities is not  threatened where, as here, there is nothing about the  Plaintiff's identity which makes it ""critical to the working  of justice"" and the basic facts of the case will be on  public record. See Jane Roes 1-2, 77 F. Supp. 3d at  997 (holding that the public interest is not threatened  because there was nothing important about the plaintiff's  identity alone and the facts of the case would be on  public record). Indeed, allowing victims of sexual assault  to proceed anonymously serves strong public interest  because other victims will not be deterred from reporting  such crimes. See Heineke v. Santa Clara Univ., No. 17- CV-05285-LHK, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201163, 2017  WL 6026248, at *23 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 5, 2017) (holding  that the public interest is served in allowing an alleged  victim of sexual harassment to be sued under  pseudonym to avoid deterring other victims from coming  forward). Therefore, B.M. is permitted to proceed  anonymously  because  her  need  for  anonymity  outweighs the risk of prejudice to Defendants and the  public interest in knowing her identity. Choice also argues that B.M. has not filed a motion for  protective  order  and  leave  to  proceed  anonymously [*33]  in this Court. However, the Ninth  Circuit does not require a plaintiff to obtain leave to  proceed anonymously before filing an anonymous  pleading. Doe v. Penzato, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51681,  2011 WL 1833007, at *4 (""Although some Circuits  require plaintiffs to obtain leave of the court before filing  an anonymous pleading, the Ninth Circuit does not."");  see also Doe v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of Am., 164 F.  Supp. 3d 1140, 1144 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (holding that a  plaintiff is not required to obtain leave to proceed  anonymously before filing an anonymous pleading  because any attempt to proceed anonymously would be  pointless if a plaintiff had to use his or her real name  first). B.M. properly requested permission to proceed  anonymously in the Complaint, and the Court hereby  grants her request. See Compl. ¶ 9. In addition, the Court recognizes that it is required to  determine the precise prejudice at each stage of the  proceedings to the opposing party. Does I through XXIII,  214 F.3d at 1068. The Court notes that Defendants do  not oppose B.M.'s use of pseudonym for purposes of  pre-trial  public  filing  at  this  time.  Joint  Case  Management Statement at 9. The dispute at the current  stage is therefore resolved, and any discovery issues (if  presented at all) are matters for another day. V. ORDER For the foregoing reasons: (1) Wyndham's Motion to Dismiss at ECF 32 is  GRANTED [*34]  IN PART WITH LEAVE TO  AMEND as to Plaintiff's direct liability theory and  DENIED IN PART as to Plaintiff's agency liability  theory. (2) Choice's Motion to Dismiss at ECF 49 is  GRANTED IN PART WITH LEAVE TO AMEND as  to Plaintiff's direct liability theory and DENIED IN  PART as to Plaintiff's agency liability theory. (3) Choice's Motion to Strike at ECF 49 is DENIED. (4) Plaintiff may continue to use a pseudonym in  her public filings. Any amended complaint must be filed within 30 days of  this Order. Plaintiff may only amend her claims and shall  not add new claims or new parties without leave of  Court. The Court requests that the chambers copy of  any amended complaint be a redlined version, in color.  Wyndham and Choice must respond to the amended  complaint no later than 30 days from its filing. If  Wyndham and Choice move to dismiss Plaintiff's  amended complaint, they must share the allowed page  limits (25, 25, 15) as set out by the Court's Standing  Order Re Civil Cases. A further case management  conference is hereby set on Friday, September 18,  2020 at 10:00 a.m. IT IS SO ORDERED. Dated: July 30, 2020 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *31 Page 11 of 11 /s/ Beth Labson Freeman BETH LABSON FREEMAN United States District Judge  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *34",1
S.Y. v. Wyndham Hotels(4),"OPINION and ORDER This matter comes before the Court on review of the  following two motions [*2]  to dismiss: (1) defendant  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.'s Motion To Dismiss  Plaintiff's Complaint (Doc. #14) filed on September 30,  2020; and (2) defendant Laxmi of Naples, LLC's Motion  to Dismiss, Motion to Strike, or For a More Definite  Statement and Memorandum of Law in Support Thereof  (Doc. #13) filed on September 28, 2020. Plaintiff filed an  Opposition (Doc. #20) on September 28, 2020. Plaintiff  filed a Memorandum in Opposition to each motion (Doc.  #37; Doc. #41) on November 2nd, and November 4,  2020. Defendant Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. filed  a Reply (Doc. #48) on November 30, 2020. For the  reasons set forth below, the motions are denied. I. The origins of this case began on October 30, 2019,  when Plaintiff and another alleged victim of sex  trafficking filed a case in the Circuit Court of the  Twentieth Judicial Circuit in and for Collier County,  Florida. See S.Y. et al v. Naples Hotel Co.et al, Case  No. 2:20-cv-118 (Doc. #1, p. 3). On December 31, 2019,  the Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint which  asserted ten claims against over forty defendants. Id. at  (Doc. #1, pp. 2-4). The case was removed to federal  court in February 2020. Id. at (Doc. #1). On April 15,  2020, [*3]  the Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended  Complaint. Id. at (Doc. #85). On August 5, 2020, the  undersigned denied various motions to dismiss, but  determined severance of the parties was appropriate.  S.Y. v. Naples Hotel Co., 476 F. Supp. 3d 1251, 1258- Page 2 of 14 59 (M.D. Fla. 2020). Following the Court's severance  order, plaintiff and the other alleged victim filed nearly  thirty new actions against various defendants, including  this case. The Complaint (Doc. #1) in this case was filed on  August 19, 2020, alleging that plaintiff S.Y. was a  resident of Collier County, Florida, and was a victim of  continuous sex trafficking at a certain Super 8  Wyndham Hotel in Naples, Florida (the Super 8)  between 2014 and February 2016. (Id. at ¶¶ 13-14, 22- 24.) The Complaint further alleges that during this time  period defendants Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and  Laxmi of Naples, LLC (Defendants, or Wyndham or  Laxmi)  are  hotel  owners,  operators,  managers,  supervisors, controllers, and/or entities responsible for  hotels at which sex trafficking has taken place,  including the Super 8. (Id. at ¶ 2.) The Complaint sets forth the following six claims:  violation  of  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), 18 U.S.C. § 1595  (Count I); violation of the Florida RICO statute, §  772.104, Florida Statutes [*4]  (Count II); premise  liability (Count III); negligent hiring, supervision, and  retention (Count IV); negligent rescue (Count V); and  aiding and abetting, harboring, confining, coercion, and  criminal enterprise (Count VI). (Id., pp. 33-49.) Counts I  through IV are asserted against both Defendants, while  Counts V through VI are asserted against only Laxmi.  (Id.) II. Defendant's motions seek to have the Court strike  several allegations in the Complaint, as well as raise  several arguments as to why the Complaint in its                 entirety, and each individual claim should be dismissed.  (Doc. #13, pp. 4-23; Doc. #14, pp. 5-25.) The Court will  address each of these arguments in turn. A. Shotgun Pleading Each Defendant argues in its motions, that the  Complaint constitutes a shotgun pleading based upon  Plaintiff grouping the Defendants together as the ""Super  8 Defendants"" (Doc. #1, p. 1 introductory paragraph)  and should be dismissed. (Doc. #13, pp. 7-9; Doc. #14,  pp. 5-6.) One way in which a complaint may constitute an  impermissible shotgun pleading is if it ""assert[s] multiple  claims against multiple defendants without specifying  which of the defendants are responsible for which acts  or omissions, or which of the defendants the claim is  brought against."" Weiland v. Palm Beach Cty. Sheriff's  Office, 792 F.3d 1313, 1323 (11th Cir. 2015); see also  Barmapov v. Amuial, 986 F.3d 1321, 1325 (11th Cir.  2021). Such a pleading fails ""to give the defendants  adequate notice of the claims [*5]  against them and the  grounds upon which each claim rests,"" Weiland, 792  F.3d at 1323, and violates the requirement that a  plaintiff provide ""a short and plain statement of the  claim,"" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The Complaint does in fact repeatedly references the  defendants collectively as the ""Super 8 Defendants.""  The failure to specify a particular defendant is not fatal,  however, when ""[t]he complaint can be fairly read to  aver that all defendants are responsible for the alleged  conduct."" Auto. Alignment & Body Serv. v. State Farm  Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 953 F.3d 707, 733 (11th Cir.  2020)(quoting Kyle K. v. Chapman, 208 F.3d 940, 944  (11th Cir. 2000)). The Complaint typically (but not  always) alleges that ""each and every"" such defendant  was involved in the activity described in the particular  paragraph of the Complaint. See (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 4-5, 8-18,  55-62, 69-83, 87-88, 97-98, 102-08, 126-43, 145, 147- 50, 153-56, 162-67, 169-73, 176-207.) A fair reading of  the Complaint is that each of these defendants was  involved in the identified conduct attributed to the ""Super  8 Defendants."" See Sprint Sols., Inc. v. Fils-Amie, 44 F.  Supp. 3d 1224, 1226-27 (S.D. Fla. 2014)(finding that  reference to ""defendants"" in a complaint was not fatal  where pleading alleged that each of the two defendants  perpetrated the wrongs, often acting together). While  defendants may disagree that such allegations are  accurate, that dispute is for another day. The group  allegations do not fail [*6]  to state a claim, Auto.  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *3 Page 3 of 14 Alignment & Body Serv., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co., 953 F.3d 707, 732-33 (11th Cir. 2020), and the  Complaint does not constitute a shotgun pleading. B. Redundant, Irrelevant, and Scandalous Factual  Allegations In its Motion, Laxmi notes that this Court previously  ordered Plaintiff to remove those allegations ""regarding  sex trafficking in general and its relationship to the  hospitality industry."" S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1259.  Defendant Laxmi, however, argues that contrary to the  Court's prior directive, Plaintiff has included redundant,  irrelevant, and scandalous allegations in her Complaint  that should be struck. (Doc. #13, pp. 4-7.) Pursuant to Rule 12(f), a party may move to strike ""any  redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous  matter"" within the pleadings. The Court enjoys broad  discretion in determining whether to grant or deny a  motion to strike. Northrop & Johnson Holding Co. v.  Leahy, No. 16-cv-63008-BLOOM/Valle, 2017 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 193365, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 22, 2017). ""The  purpose of a motion to strike is to clean up the  pleadings, streamline litigation, and avoid unnecessary  forays into immaterial matters."" Monsoon, Inc. v. BizJet  Int'l  Sales  &  Support,  Inc.,  No.  16-80722-CV- MARRA/MATTHEWMAN, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26987,  2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26987, at *28 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 27,  2017). It is not intended to ""procure the dismissal of all  or part of a complaint."" Id. A motion to strike is a drastic  remedy and is disfavored by the courts. Schmidt v. Life  Ins. Co. of N. Am., 289 F.R.D. 357, 358 (M.D. Fla.  2012). Therefore, a motion [*7]  to strike should be  granted only if ""the matter sought to be omitted has no  possible relationship to the controversy, may confuse  the issues, or otherwise prejudice a party."" Id. Defendant urges the Court to strike ten paragraphs in  the Complaint that it maintains contain ""puffing"" about  sex trafficking and its alleged relationship to the hotel  industry, scandalous matter about Laxmi's knowledge of  the tactics of sex traffickers, and that such tactics are  used against children. (Doc. #13, pp. 6-7.) Upon review  of these allegations (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 3-5, 55-57, 78-80,  146), the Court finds the majority of them relate to  Defendant's knowledge of sex trafficking, its failure to  prevent the alleged criminal conduct, and Defendants'  profiting from the sex trafficking industry. Such  allegations are relevant to the type of claims plaintiff  asserts, S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1259 n.5, and the  Court does not find any to be overly redundant or unduly  prejudicial. See Schmidt, 289 F.R.D. at 358. Admittedly,  general allegations of sex trafficking in paragraph  three and tactics of sex traffickers implemented against  children in paragraph five may be immaterial, but the  Court cannot say that these allegations are unduly  prejudicial to justify the ""drastic"" remedy [*8]  sought.  Schmidt, 289 F.R.D. at 358. The Court therefore denies  Defendant's request to strike the aforementioned  allegations. C. Failure To State a Claim Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires that a  complaint contain a ""short and plain statement of the  claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed.  R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This obligation ""requires more than  labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the  elements of a cause of action will not do."" Bell Atl. Corp.  v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L.  Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). To survive  dismissal, the factual allegations must be ""plausible""  and ""must be enough to raise a right to relief above the  speculative level."" Id. at 555; see also Edwards v. Prime  Inc., 602 F.3d 1276, 1291 (11th Cir. 2010). This requires  ""more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully- harmed-me accusation."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,  678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009)  (citations omitted). In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court  must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true  and take them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197,  167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal conclusions  without adequate factual support are entitled to no  assumption of truth."" Mamani v. Berzaín, 654 F. 3d  1148, 1153 (11th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted).  ""Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of  action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do  not suffice."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Factual allegations  that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability fall  short of being facially plausible. Chaparro v. Carnival  Corp., 693 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir. 2012)  (citations [*9]  omitted). Thus, the Court engages in a  two-step approach: ""When there are well-pleaded  factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity  and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to  an entitlement to relief."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. 1. Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization  Act 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *6 Page 4 of 14 Defendant Wyndham challenges Count I of the  Complaint, alleging that Defendants violated the  TVPRA, 18 U.S.C. § 1595. (Doc. #14, pp. 6-16.) The  TVPRA provides a civil remedy to victims of certain  types of human trafficking. The civil remedy portion of  the Act provides: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). The phrase ""a violation of this  chapter"" refers to Chapter 77 of Title 18 of the United  States Code. The only violation of Chapter 77 relevant  to this case is contained in 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a), which  provides in relevant part: (a) Whoever knowingly — (1) in [*10]  or affecting interstate or foreign  commerce . . . recruits, entices, harbors,  transports,  provides,  obtains,  advertises,  maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any means  a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything  of value, from participation in a venture which  has engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). To state a section 1595(a) claim in  this case, Plaintiff must plausibly allege that she was a  victim of a criminal offense under section 1591(a), and  then must plausibly allege that Defendant (1)""knowingly  benefit[ted] financially or by receiving anything of value,""  (2) from participation in a venture, (3) which Defendant  ""knew or should have known has engaged in"" sex  trafficking under section 1591(a). S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d  at 1255-56 (citing A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc.,, 455 F.  Supp. 3d 171, 181 (Pa. 2020))). Wyndham argues the Complaint's allegations are  insufficient to state [*11]  a claim under section 1595(a),  asserting four pleading deficiencies. (Doc. #14, pp. 6- 16.) (a) ""Participation"" in a ""Venture"" Wyndham first argues that the Complaint lacks well-pled  allegations that it participated in a ""venture,"" as required  by section 1595(a). (Doc. #14, pp. 6-10.) Drawing on the  definition of ""venture"" used in the criminal portion of the  statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(6), Wyndham asserts that  a ""venture"" requires two or more individuals ""associated  in fact."" (Doc. #14, p. 6.) Borrowing from the federal  RICO definition of ""enterprise,"" Wyndham argues that  ""associated in fact"" requires that persons must operate  as a ""continuing unit that functions with a common  purpose."" (Id., p. 7.) Wyndham continues that in the  context of a TVPRA claim against a hotel operator, the  Complaint must ""at least"" allege a ""continuous business  relationship between the trafficker and the hotels such  that it would appear that the trafficker and the hotels  have established a pattern of conduct or could be said  to have a tacit agreement."" (Id., p. 8) (quoting M.A. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959,  970 (S.D. Ohio 2019)); see also Doe v. Rickey Patel,  LLC, No. 0:20-60683, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, at  *14 (S.D. Fla. Sep. 29, 2020)(""In order to plead  defendants participated in a venture, plaintiff must  allege facts from which the Court could reasonably infer  the hotels could be said [*12]  to have a tacit agreement  with the trafficker.""). Wyndham concludes that ""[a]  commercial relationship, such as a hotel owner renting a  hotel room, does not give rise to a reasonable inference  that the participants in such a relationship shared a  common purpose or otherwise 'associated in fact.'""  (Doc. #14, p. 8.) Here, the Complaint alleges Wyndham participated in a  venture ""by engaging in a pattern of acts and omissions  that were intended to support, facilitate, harbor, and  otherwise further the traffickers' sale and victimization of           2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *9 Page 5 of 14 the Plaintiff S.Y. for commercial sexual exploitation by  repeatedly renting rooms at Super 8 Wyndham Hotel to  people"" Wyndham and Laxmi ""knew or should have  known were engaged in sex trafficking."" (Doc. #1, ¶  158.) The Complaint also alleges why Wyndham should  have been on notice of the sex trafficking and how it  failed to prevent it. (Id. ¶¶ 4-16, 56-83, 120-22.) The  Court finds the allegations in the Complaint sufficient to  allege participation in a venture under section 1595(a).  See Doe, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, at *14 (""The  Court finds it sufficient for Plaintiff to plead that  Defendants participated in a venture by renting rooms to  individuals that knew or should have known were  involved in a sex-trafficking [*13]  venture, including  the sex-trafficking victim.""); M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at  971 (""This Court finds Plaintiff has alleged sufficient  facts to show Defendants 'participated in a venture'  under § 1595 by alleging that Defendants rented rooms  to people it knew or should have known where [sic]  engaged in sex trafficking.""). Wyndham also argues that ""participation"" in a venture  requires an allegation of an overt act in furtherance of  the venture, and that failure to prevent sex trafficking is  not such an overt act. (Doc. #14, pp. 8-9.) The Court is  not convinced. S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1256 (""In the  absence of any controlling authority, the Court  concludes  that  actual  'participation  in  the  sex  trafficking act itself' is not required to state a claim  under section 1595. Accordingly, plaintiffs' failure to  allege such actual participation is not fatal to its section  1595 claim under the TVPRA.""). Wyndham has not  identified any controlling authority to the contrary. (b) Knowingly Benefited From Participating in  Venture Wyndham next argues that the Complaint insufficiently  alleges that it knowingly benefitted from participating in  a  venture  that  committed  TVPRA  crimes,  with  knowledge of the causal relationship. (Doc. #14, p. 10- 11.) Wyndham asserts that the allegation that it  financially [*14]  benefited from its relationship with the  franchisees because it received franchise fees is  insufficient, since that money is not ""from"" any act by  Wyndham that could plausibly constitute ""participation""  in a TVPRA ""venture."" (Id.) The Complaint alleges the  Defendants  knowingly  benefited  from  the  sex  trafficking of plaintiff ""by receiving payment for the    rooms rented for Plaintiff S.Y. and her traffickers at the  Super 8 Wyndham Hotel,"" and by receiving ""other  financial benefits in the form of food and beverage sales  and ATM fees from those persons who were engaging  in sex trafficking."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 154.) As to Wyndham as  franchisor, the Complaint alleges it ""received a  significant franchise fee and continuous royalties on the  Super 8 Wyndham Hotel's gross revenue,"" while also  exercising ""ongoing and systematic control over  operations at the Super 8 Wyndham Hotel."" (Id. at ¶¶  43, 111.) The Court finds such allegations sufficient to  satisfy the ""knowingly benefitted"" element. S.Y., 476 F.  Supp. 3d at 1257; S.W. v. Lorain-Elyria Motel, Inc., 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192, at *5 (S.D.  Ohio Mar. 16, 2020); H.H v. G6 Hosp., LLC, 2019 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *2 (S.D.  Ohio Dec. 6, 2019); M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 965. (c) Knew or Should Have Known that Venture was  Committing Sex Trafficking Crimes Wyndham argues the Complaint fails to plausibly allege  that it knew or should have known that the ""venture""  was engaging [*15]  in sex-trafficking crimes, i.e., that  Wyndham knew or should have known that an adult  plaintiff was caused to engage in commercial sex by  force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion. (Doc. #14, pp.  11-13.) Rather, Wyndham argues, the Complaint only  alleges that the hotel staff did not interfere with plaintiff  and witnessed indicia of commercial sex activity. (Id. p.  11.) Wyndham argues that the allegations do not give  rise to a reasonable inference that it knew or should  have known about any forced commercial sex activity at  the Super 8 Hotel. (Id.) The Court disagrees with this argument. First of all,  ""knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind  may be alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b); see Sun  Life Assurance Co. of Can. v. Imperial Premium Fin.,  LLC, 904 F.3d 1197, 1215 (11th Cir. 2018). Pleading  ""generally"" is not without limits, and a complaint must  still comply with ""the less rigid—though still operative— strictures of Rule 8."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 686-87. The  Complaint clearly satisfies this notice pleading standard. Plaintiff has alleged that the following was ""routine  conduct taking place at the Super 8 Wyndham Hotel as  a result of the human sex trafficking enterprise"": a. Plaintiff's sex traffickers frequently rented rooms  at the hotel close to each other; b. Plaintiff's sex traffickers would rent multiple  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *12 Page 6 of 14 rooms — one to [*16]  be used for sex trafficking  and the other to be used for drug sales; c. Plaintiff's sex traffickers often paid cash for the  rooms at the Super 8 Wyndham Hotel where the  Plaintiff engaged in commercial sex acts; d. Plaintiff's sex traffickers booked extended stays  at the Super 8 Wyndham Hotel for themselves and  for the Plaintiff on a routine basis and on a rotating  basis frequently throughout the year; e. Plaintiff and her sex traffickers would have few or  no luggage or personal possessions for these  extended stays; f. Plaintiff was confined in the rooms at the Super 8  Wyndham Hotel for long periods of time; g. Plaintiff's rooms and her sex traffickers' rooms  consistently displayed ""Do Not Disturb"" signs on the  doors to the room where the Plaintiff was engaged  in commercial sex acts; h. Men (""Johns"") frequently entered and left the  rooms at the Super 8 Wyndham Hotel where the  Plaintiff was engaged in illegal commercial sex acts  at all times of day and night; i. The staff and customers at the Super 8 Wyndham  Hotel that was owned, operated, managed,  supervised,  controlled  and/or  otherwise  held  responsible by each and every Super 8 Defendant  saw that the rooms where the Plaintiff engaged in  commercial [*17]  sex acts were messy, and  contained sex and drug paraphernalia and had an  unclean smell; j. The rooms at the Super 8 Wyndham Hotel were  filled with evidence of sex trafficking and drug use; k. Plaintiff's sex traffickers consistently refused  housekeeping  services  and  otherwise  would  prohibit staff from entering their rooms and the  Plaintiff's rooms; l. Plaintiff would frequently request clean towels and  linens; m. Plaintiff dressed in a sexually explicit manner  and would walk the hallways of the Super 8  Defendant [sic]; n. The staff at the Super 8 Wyndham Hotel  routinely observed sex trafficking activities taking  place out in the open, and injured sex trafficking  victims wandering the halls at all hours; o. Excessively loud noises would consistently come  from Plaintiff's rooms; p. During nighttime hours, Plaintiff and her ""Johns""  and drug clients would create noise at the Super 8  Wyndham Hotel and, upon information and belief,  would be a disturbance to other guests using the  hotel for their intended purposes; and q. While at the hotel, the Plaintiff displayed clear  signs of physical abuse, diminished personal  hygiene, submissiveness and inappropriate attire. (Doc. #1, ¶ 96.) Further, the Complaint [*18]  alleges  Wyndham and Laxmi ""knew or should have known  about the nature of the sex trafficking venture at the  Super 8 Wyndham Hotel, including as they related to  Plaintiff S.Y."" due to the following: a. Requests by the traffickers to rent rooms near  exit doors; b. Cash payments for the rooms by the sex  traffickers; c. Refusal of housekeeping services by those  persons engaged in sex trafficking; d. Excessive used condoms located in the rooms  used for sex trafficking; e. Excessive requests for towels and linens in the  rooms used for sex trafficking; f. Hotel staff observing Plaintiff S.Y. and her  traffickers in the hotel; g. Plaintiff S.Y. being escorted by traffickers in and  around the hotel; h. Operation of sex trafficking ventures out of the  same hotel room for multiple days or weeks in  succession; i. Multiple men per day coming and going from the  same  rooms  without  luggage  or  personal  possessions; j. Hotel staff routinely observing the sex trafficking  of Plaintiff S.Y. and other sex trafficking victims;  and k. Knowledge of police and EMS activity at the  Super 8 Wyndham Hotel and at other locations  near the Super 8 Wyndham Hotel that was related  to commercial sex work. (Id. ¶ 155.) The Court finds [*19]  these allegations sufficient to  reasonably infer the defendants knew or should have  known of the sex trafficking venture. S.Y., 476 F.  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *15 Page 7 of 14 Supp. 3d at 1257; A.B., 455 F. Supp. 3d at 193-94; Doe  S.W., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192,  at *5-6; H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL  6682152, at *3; M.A., 425 F. Supp 3d at 967-68. (d) Vicarious Liability Finally, Wyndham suggests the TVPRA claim should be  dismissed because ""[v]icarious liability is not viable  under the TVPRA"". (Doc. #14, p. 13.) The Court  disagrees. See S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1257-58  (finding  plaintiff  made  sufficient  allegations  that  franchisor was vicariously liable under section 1595 of  the TVPRA to survive dismissal); see also J.C. v.  Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc.,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073,  2020 WL 6318707, *10 (N.D. Ca. Oct. 28, 2020) (finding  plaintiff's vicarious liability claim had ""alleged sufficient  facts to support a plausible claim that [defendants]  received financial benefits from a venture they  vicariously participate in (through their franchisees) that  the franchises should have known was engaged in sex  trafficking.""). Wyndham also argues that even if it could be held  vicariously liable under the TVPRA, plaintiff's allegations  ""do not give rise to a plausible inference of an agency  relationship"" between Wyndham and its franchisee,  Laxmi. (Doc. #14, p. 14.) Wyndham argues that  because the Landham Act requires some degree of  supervision by a franchisor, such supervision cannot be  the basis for liability. (Id. at 14-16.) The Court finds that  the allegations in the [*20]  Complaint do create such a  plausible inference. ""It is well-established that a franchise relationship does  not by itself create an agency relationship between the  franchisor and franchisee."" Cain v. Shell Oil Co., 994 F.  Supp. 2d 1251, 1252 (N.D. Fla. 2014). However,  ""[f]ranchisors may well enter into an agency relationship  with a franchisee if, by contract or action or  representation, the franchisor has directly or apparently  participated in some substantial way in directing or  managing acts of the franchisee, beyond the mere fact  of providing contractual franchise support activities.""  Mobil Oil Corp. v. Bransford, 648 So. 2d 119, 120 (Fla.  1995). Here, the Complaint alleges Wyndham was in an  agency relationship with Laxmi during the relevant time  period. (Doc. #1, ¶ 111.) The Complaint further asserts  that in a variety of ways Wyndham exercised control  over the means and methods of how Laxmi conducted  business, such as by profit sharing, standardized  training, standardized rules of operation, regular  inspection, and price fixing. (Id. at ¶ 112.) The Court  finds such allegations sufficient to support a plausible  inference of an agency relationship. See S.Y., 476 F.  Supp. 3d at 1258; A.B., 455 F. Supp. 3d at 195-97; Doe  S.W., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192,  at *7; H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL  6682152, at *6; M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 972. Because the allegations in the Complaint are sufficient  to state a claim under section 1595 of the TVPRA, the  Court denies Wyndham's motion for dismissal [*21]   pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). 2. Florida RICO Violation In Count II of the Complaint, Plaintiff asserts a claim  against both defendants under Florida's civil RICO  statute, section 772.104, Florida Statutes. (Doc. #1, p.  35.) To state a claim under the statute, plaintiff must  allege  plausible  facts  showing  ""(1)  conduct  or  participation in an enterprise through (2) a pattern of  [criminal] activity."" Horace-Manasse v. Wells Fargo  Bank, N.A., 521 F. App'x 782, 784 (11th Cir. 2013)                             2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *19 Page 8 of 14 (quoting Lugo v. State, 845 So. 2d 74, 97 (Fla. 2003)). Each of the motions argue plaintiff has insufficiently pled  the enterprise element of her claim. (Doc. #13, pp. 9-14;  Doc. #14, pp. 16-19.) Florida's RICO statute defines  enterprise to include a ""group of individuals associated  in fact although not a legal entity."" § 772.102(3), Fla.  Stat. ""[A]n association-in-fact enterprise is simply a  continuing unit that functions with a common purpose.""  Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 948, 129 S. Ct.  2237, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1265 (2009). To sufficiently plead  such an enterprise, ""a plaintiff must allege that a group  of persons shares three structural features: (1) a  purpose, (2) relationships among those associated with  the enterprise, and (3) longevity sufficient to permit  these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.""  Cisneros v. Petland, Inc., 972 F.3d 1204, 1211 (11th  Cir. 2020) (marks and citations omitted). The motions  argue the Complaint fails to sufficiently allege a  ""common purpose"" among the defendants. (Doc. #13,  pp. 10-13; Doc. #14, [*22]  p. 18.) ""The purpose prong contemplates 'a common purpose  of engaging in a course of conduct' among the  enterprise's alleged participants."" Cisneros, 972 F.3d at  1211 (quoting United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576,  583, 101 S. Ct. 2524, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1981)). ""An  abstract common purpose, such as a generally shared  interest in making money, will not suffice. Rather, where  the participants' ultimate purpose is to make money for  themselves, a RICO plaintiff must plausibly allege that  the participants shared the purpose of enriching  themselves through a particular criminal course of  conduct."" Id. (citations omitted). Here, the Complaint alleges Laxmi and Wyndham  ""associated with each other and/or the Plaintiff S.Y.'s  sex traffickers for the common purpose of profiting off  an established sex trafficking scheme."" (Doc. #1, ¶  161.)  Plaintiff  asserts  this  ""association-in-fact""  constitutes an ""enterprise"" under Florida's RICO statute,  and that the defendants conducted or participated in  their enterprises through a pattern of criminal activity,  ""related by their common purpose to profit off an          institutionalized sex trafficking scheme."" (Id. ¶¶ 161- 62.) The Court finds these allegations sufficient to allege  the defendants ""shared the purpose of enriching  themselves through a particular criminal course [*23]  of  conduct."" Cisneros, 972 F.3d at 1211; see also United  States v. Church, 955 F.2d 688, 697-98 (11th Cir. 1992)  (noting that ""an association's devotion to 'making money  from repeated criminal activity' . . . demonstrates an  enterprise's 'common purpose of engaging in a course  of conduct'"" (citations omitted)); Burgese v. Starwood  Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc.,, 101 F. Supp. 3d 414,  424 (D. N.J. 2015) (on motion to dismiss Florida RICO  claim, court found that ""Plaintiff's Amended Complaint  can be read to allege a 'common purpose' of furthering  an institutionalized prostitution scheme to increase  profits for the participants,"" and that ""[t]hese allegations,  though thin, are sufficient for purposes of this motion.""). Each of the motions also argues the Complaint fails to  sufficiently plead the ""pattern of criminal activity""  element. (Doc. #13, p. 13; Doc. #14, pp. 18-19.) As  previously stated, ""[i]n order to state a civil cause of  action under the Florida RICO Act, a plaintiff must allege  a pattern of criminal activity."" Arthur v. JP Morgan  Chase Bank, NA, 569 Fed. App'x 669, 682 (11th Cir.  2014) (citing §§ 772.103-104, Fla. Stat.). The statute's  definition of ""criminal activity"" provides ""that a particular  state law crime can serve as the predicate act for a  RICO claim if it is 'chargeable by indictment or  information' and falls within a series of specified  provisions."" Id. (citing § 772.102(1)(a), Fla. Stat.). ""In  order to establish a pattern of criminal activity, the  plaintiff must allege [*24]  two or more criminal acts 'that  have the same or similar intents, results, accomplices,  victims, or methods of commission' that occurred within  a five-year time span."" Id. at 680 (citing § 772.102(4),  Fla. Stat.). As noted by Wyndham (Doc. #14, p. 19), plaintiff's  Florida RICO claim is predicated on the commission of  human trafficking crimes in violation of section 787.06,  Florida Statutes. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 163, 165); see also §  772.102(1)(a)15., Fla. Stat. (listing ""human trafficking""  under Chapter 787 among the types of ""criminal activity""  covered by the Florida RICO statute). This provision  provides various punishments for ""[a]ny person who  knowingly, or in reckless disregard of the facts, engages  in human trafficking, or attempts to engage in human  trafficking, or benefits financially by receiving anything  of value from participation in a venture that has  subjected a person to human trafficking."" § 787.06(3),  Fla. Stat. Given the similarity between this language and  the TVPRA's civil liability provision, Wyndham argues  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *21 Page 9 of 14 the Florida RICO claim fails ""for the same reasons that  Plaintiff failed to state a TVPRA claim."" (Doc. #14, p.  19.) The Court has, however, determined plaintiff's  TVPRA claim is sufficiently pled, and therefore rejects  Wyndham's argument as to the Florida RICO claim. Laxmi [*25]  argues the RICO claim fails to allege a  pattern of criminal activity because the Complaint  ""impermissibly groups"" the defendants together, and  therefore ""[i]t is impossible to discern if Laxmi committed  two or more predicate acts."" (Doc. #13, p. 13.) The  Court disagrees. The Complaint alleges plaintiff was  trafficked on a ""regular, consistent and/or repeated  basis"" at various hotels in Naples, Florida, and at the  Super 8 Hotel from approximately 2014 to February  2016. (Doc. #1, ¶ 84.) The Complaint describes how the  sex trafficking occurred at the Super 8 Hotel and the  ""routine conduct"" taking place as a result, as well as  alleges Laxmi's employees made promises to the  traffickers not to interfere with the trafficking and  knowingly turned a blind eye to it. (Id. at ¶¶ 88, 89-90,  99, 234, 236.) Viewing the allegations in the light most  favorable to plaintiff, the Court finds this sufficient to  allege two or more predicate acts within the applicable  timeframe. Finally, Laxmi argues the Complaint contains insufficient  allegations regarding causation. (Doc. #13, pp. 13-14.)  Under the Florida RICO statute, a plaintiff must  demonstrate that their injuries were proximately caused  by the RICO [*26]  violations. See Bortell v. White  Mountains Ins. Grp., Ltd., 2 So. 3d 1041, 1047 (Fla. 4th  DCA 2009). ""A wrongful act is a proximate cause if it is  a substantive factor in the sequence of responsible  causation."" Green Leaf Nursery v. E.I. DuPont De  Nemours & Co., 341 F.3d 1292, 1307 (11th Cir. 2003)  (marks and citation omitted). Furthermore, a plaintiff  ""must show a 'direct relation between the injury asserted  and the injurious conduct alleged.'"" Id. (quoting Holmes  v. Sec. Inv'r Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268, 112 S. Ct.  1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1992)). ""Indirect harm is  insufficient to sustain a cause of action under the RICO  statutes."" Bortell, 2 So. 3d at 1047; see also O'Malley,  599 So. 2d at 1000 (""[I]ndirect injuries, that is, injuries  sustained not as a direct result of predicate acts . . . will  not allow recovery under Florida RICO.""). Laxmi argues that the Complaint contains no plausible  allegations that it engaged in any conduct that was the  proximate cause of plaintiff's alleged injuries. (Doc. #13,  p. 14.) Laxmi also notes that the Complaint ""is void of  any allegation that that [sic] Laxmi had specific  knowledge of Plaintiff."" (Id.) Plaintiff responds that she  has sufficiently pled proximate cause and consequential  damages by alleging she ""was at the Super 8 Motel as  part of the sexual trafficking scheme and her injuries  were caused by and in furtherance of the sexual  trafficking scheme."" (Doc. #37, p. 16.) Having reviewed  the allegations in the Complaint, the Court agrees with  plaintiff. [*27]  The Complaint alleges each of defendants ""was on  notice of repeated incidents of sex trafficking occurring  on their hotel premises,"" and yet ""failed to take the  necessary actions to prevent sex trafficking from  taking place."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 60.) The Complaint also  alleges numerous ways in which these defendants could  have identified and prevented the sex trafficking from  occurring. (Id. at ¶¶ 62-77.) Finally, the Complaint  alleges the ""acts and omissions of the Super 8  Defendants served to support, facilitate, harbor, and  otherwise further the traffickers' sale and victimization""  of plaintiff ""for commercial sexual exploitation by  repeatedly renting rooms to people they knew or should  have known were engaged in sex trafficking."" (Id. at ¶  129.) ""[B]y knowingly, or with reckless disregard,  repeatedly allowing sex trafficking to occur on their  premises between 2014 and 2016,"" the defendants'  ""acts have yielded consistent results and caused  economic, physical, and psychological injuries"" to  plaintiff. (Id. at ¶¶ 164, 167.) The Court finds these allegations sufficient to plead a  ""direct relation between the injury asserted and the  injurious conduct alleged,"" Holmes, 503 U.S. at 268,  and therefore the Complaint [*28]  adequately pleads  proximate cause. See Burgese, 101 F. Supp. 3d at 422  (finding allegations of physical injury and mental  anguish ""cognizable under the Florida RICO Act"" and  sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss); cf. Berber,  2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 234385, 2018 WL 10436236, at                2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *24 Page 10 of 14 *5 (""Because Plaintiffs' asserted injuries arise from a set  of actions entirely distinct form [sic] the alleged  predicate RICO violations, proximate cause is lacking as  a matter of law.""). 3. Premise Liability Count III of the Complaint asserts a claim of premise  liability against each defendant (Doc. #1, ¶ 173), which  is a form of negligence action. ""The elements for  negligence are duty, breach, harm, and proximate  cause; the additional elements for a claim of premises  liability include the defendant's possession or control of  the premises and notice of the dangerous condition.""  Lisanti v. City of Port Richey, 787 So. 2d 36, 37 (Fla. 2d  DCA 2001). Plaintiff alleges Defendants owed her a  variety of duties, that they breached these duties, and  that as a direct and proximate result, she suffered bodily  injury. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 176-91.) Plaintiff also alleges the  defendants had actual or constructive knowledge of sex  trafficking occurring on the premises, that they knew or  should have known the risk of such criminal conduct  taking place would be unreasonably high without [*29]   appropriate precautions, and that they had actual or  constructive knowledge of Plaintiff being in dangerous  conditions. (Id. at ¶¶ 182-84.) (a) Statute of Limitations Wyndham argues the premise liability claim should be  dismissed because it is barred by the relevant statute of  limitations. (Doc. #14, p. 22.) Under Florida law, the  statute of limitations for negligence claims is four years.  § 95.11(3)(a), Fla. Stat. A statute of limitations bar is ""an affirmative defense,  and . . . plaintiff[s] [are] not required to negate an  affirmative defense in [their] complaint."" La Grasta v.  First Union Sec., Inc., 358 F.3d 840, 845 (11th Cir.  2004) (citation omitted). ""A dismissal for failure to state  a claim on statute of limitations grounds is appropriate  only if it is apparent from the face of the complaint that  the claim is time-barred."" United States ex rel. Hunt v.  Cochise Consultancy, Inc., 887 F.3d 1081, 1085 (11th  Cir. 2018) (marks and citation omitted). Plaintiff alleges the sex trafficking occurred at the  Super 8 Hotel ""[f]rom approximately 2014 to February  2016."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 84.) Wyndham argues that because  the Complaint was filed in August 2020, the premise  liability claim is time barred. (Doc. #14, p. 22.) ""Under Florida law, the statute of limitations begins to  run when the cause of action accrues."" Carnival Corp. v.  Rolls-Royce PLC, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107141, 2009  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107141, 2009 WL 3861482, *5 (S.D.  Fla. Nov. 17, 2009) (citing § 95.031, Fla. Stat.). ""A  cause of action accrues when the last element  constituting [*30]  the cause of action occurs."" §  95.031(1), Fla. Stat. ""Under the continuing tort doctrine,  the cause of action accrues when the tortious conduct  ceases."" Effs v. Sony Pictures Home Entm't, Inc., 197  So. 3d 1243, 1244 (Fla. 3d DCA 2016) (emphasis and  citation omitted). ""A continuing tort is established by  continual tortious acts, not by continual harmful effects  from an original, completed act."" Id. at 1245 (marks,  emphasis, and citation omitted). Here, plaintiff alleges she was a repeat victim of sex  trafficking at the Super 8 Hotel between 2014 and  February 2016. The Court finds such allegations  sufficient to invoke the continuing tort doctrine. See Nat'l  Sourcing, Inc. v. Bracciale, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  199436, 2018 WL 6172430, *2 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 26,  2018) (finding allegation that a defendant's actions  ""continued to this day"" inferred continuous tortious  conduct, thereby making it plausible for the plaintiffs to  assert the continuing tort doctrine as a basis to toll the  statute of limitations). Accordingly, the Court finds that  plaintiff's premise liability claim did not accrue until  February 2016, and therefore she had until February  2020 to file a complaint asserting premises liability. Plaintiff met this deadline by filing her First Amended  Complaint against Wyndham on December 31, 2019.  S.Y. et al v. Naples Hotel Co. et al, Case No. 2:20-cv- 118 (Doc. #1, p. 3). While the Court determined  severance [*31]  of the parties was appropriate in the  original action, S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1259, and this  Complaint was filed in August 2020, it appears that the  December 2019 date is applicable for statute of  limitations purposes under the relation-back provisions  of Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Relation back is a legal fiction employed to salvage  claims that would otherwise be unjustly barred by a  limitations provision. See McCurdy v. United States,  264 U.S. 484, 487, 44 S.Ct. 345, 346, 68 L.Ed. 801  (1924); Moore v. Baker, 989 F.2d 1129, 1131 (11th  Cir. 1993). Under Rule 15, a claim in an amended  complaint relates back to the filing date of the  original complaint if it ""asserts a claim or defense  that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or  occurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in  the original pleading."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B).  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *28 Page 11 of 14 When the facts in the original complaint do not put  the defendant ""on notice that the new claims of  negligence might be asserted,"" but the new claims  instead ""involve[ ] separate and distinct conduct,""  such that the plaintiff would have to prove  ""completely different facts"" than required to recover  on the claims in the original complaint, the new  claims do not relate back. Moore, 989 F.2d at 1132. Caron v. NCL (Bahamas), Ltd., 910 F.3d 1359, 1368  (11th Cir. 2018). Accordingly, since it is not apparent  from the face of the Complaint that the claim is time- barred, dismissal based upon the statute of limitations  affirmative defense is not appropriate. For the same reasons, [*32]  the Court rejects  Wyndham's argument that plaintiff's negligent hiring,  supervision, and retention claim is also barred by the  four-year statute of limitations. (Doc. #14, p. 22.) (b) Failure to State a Claim Both defendants argue the premise liability claim is  insufficiently pled. (Doc. #13, pp. 14-18; Doc. #14, pp.  19-20.) In seeking to have the claim dismissed, Laxmi  first challenges the duty element of the claim. (Doc. #13,  pp. 15-16.) Under Florida law, a property owner  generally owes two duties to an invitee: (1) the duty to use reasonable care in maintaining  the property in a reasonably safe condition; and (2)  the duty to warn of latent or concealed dangers  which are or should be known to the owner and  which are unknown to the invitee and cannot be  discovered through the exercise of due care. Dampier v. Morgan Tire & Auto, LLC, 82 So. 3d 204,  206 (5th DCA 2012). Laxmi argues that it did not have a  duty to warn plaintiff of the danger of sex trafficking  because plaintiff was aware of the trafficking herself.  (Doc. #13, pp. 15-16); see also Emmons v. Baptist  Hosp., 478 So. 2d 440, 442 (Fla. 1st DCA 1985) (""A  prerequisite to the imposition upon the landowner of a  duty to warn is that the defendant's knowledge of the  danger must be superior to that of the business  invitee.""). However, plaintiff's premise liability [*33]   claim is not based upon a duty to warn, but rather a duty  to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition.  (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 177-81.) Accordingly, Laxmi's argument as  it relates to a duty to warn is irrelevant. See Dampier, 82  So. 3d at 206 (""The open and obvious nature of a  hazard may discharge a landowner's duty to warn, but it  does not discharge the landowner's duty to maintain the  property in a reasonably safe condition.""). Alternatively, Wyndham first argues the premise liability  claim fails because it does not allege that Wyndham  possessed or controlled the Super 8 Hotel. (Doc. #14,  pp. 19-20.) The Court disagrees. As noted, a premise  liability claim requires a defendant possess or control  the premises at issue. Lisanti, 787 So. 2d at 37. Here,  the Complaint alleges Wyndham and Laxmi were the  ""owners, operators, managers, supervisors, controllers  and innkeepers"" of the Super 8 Hotel, and that  Wyndham exercised control over the means and  methods of how Laxmi conducted business at the hotel.  (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 28, 115.) While Wyndham may dispute  these allegations, the Court must accept them as true at  this stage of the proceedings and finds them sufficient to  allege Wyndham had sufficient control of the Super 8  Hotel for premise liability [*34]  purposes. Next, Laxmi and Wyndham both argue there could be  no duty to protect plaintiff from the criminal conduct of  third parties because such conduct was not foreseeable.  (Doc. #13, pp. 16-17; Doc. #14, p. 20.) The Court  disagrees with this argument as well. ""Under Florida  law, a business owes invitees a duty to use due care to  maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition.  This includes the duty to protect customers from  criminal attacks that are reasonably foreseeable.""  Banosmoreno v. Walgreen Co., 299 F. App'x 912, 913  (11th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). Foreseeability can be shown by two alternative  means. First, a plaintiff may demonstrate that a  proprietor knew or should have known of a  dangerous condition on his premises that was likely  to cause harm to a patron. Second, a plaintiff can  show that a proprietor knew or should have known  of the dangerous propensities of a particular patron. Id. (marks, citations, and footnote omitted). Such  knowledge must only be pled generally. Fed. R. Civ. P.  9(b). The Complaint contains sufficient allegations that sex  trafficking was occurring at the Super 8 Hotel and that  Laxmi and Wyndham knew or should have known of it.  (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 56-61, 97-98, 102-08, 155-56.) The  Complaint also contains sufficient allegations to [*35]   support a claim of an agency relationship between  Wyndham and Laxmi, and any factual challenge to such  a relationship is premature. See Cain, 994 F. Supp. 2d  at 1253; Mobil Oil Corp., 648 So. 2d at 120. Accordingly,  the Court finds the allegations in the Complaint are  sufficient to satisfy the notice pleading requirements. Finally, Laxmi argues the premise liability claim fails  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *31 Page 12 of 14 because ""Plaintiff cannot establish a causal link  between her purported injuries and Laxmi' [sic]  purported negligence."" (Doc. #13, pp. 17-18.) The Court  disagrees. As noted, the Complaint alleges Laxmi was  on notice of the sex trafficking occurring at the Super 8  Hotel and not only failed to prevent it, but knowingly  turned a blind eye to it in exchange for increased profits.  (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 4, 60, 234, 236.) The Complaint also  alleges that as a result of Laxmi's actions, plaintiff  suffered various injuries and damages. (Doc. #1, ¶ 191.)  Contrary to Laxmi's suggestion that plaintiff's injuries  were the result of a ""freakish and improbable chain of  events,"" (Doc. #13, p. 17), the Court finds the Complaint  sufficiently alleges proximate cause. Accordingly, the  Court denies Laxmi and Wyndham's request to dismiss  the claim as insufficiently pled. 4. Negligent Hiring, Supervision, [*36]  and  Retention Count IV of the Complaint asserts a claim of negligent  hiring,  supervision,  and  retention  against  each  defendant. (Doc. #1, ¶ 192.) ""To state a claim under  Florida law for negligent hiring, supervision and/or  retention, a plaintiff must establish that the employer  owed a legal duty to the plaintiff to exercise reasonable  care in hiring and retaining safe and competent  employees."" Clary v. Armor Corr. Health Servs., No.  6:13-cv-90-Orl-31KRS, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15633, at  *11 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 7, 2014) (citations omitted). ""Florida  law also holds employers liable for reasonably  foreseeable damages resulting from the negligent  training of its employees and agents."" Id. (citing Lewis v.  City of St. Petersburg, 260 F.3d 1260, 1265 (11th Cir.  2001)). ""For an employer to owe a plaintiff a duty, the  plaintiff must be in the zone of risk that was reasonably  foreseeable to the employer."" Id. (citation omitted). Accordingly, to state a claim, the plaintiff must  allege facts that would establish a nexus between  the plaintiff and the tortfeasor's employment from  which a legal duty would flow from the defendant- employer to the plaintiff. The plaintiff must then  establish that the defendant-employer breached  that duty and that the breach caused him damage. Id. (citations omitted). The Complaint alleges each Super [*37]  8 Hotel  defendant was in control of the hiring, instructing,  training, supervising, and terminating of the hotel  employees, and that each defendant had a duty to make  an appropriate investigation of the employees. (Doc. #1,  ¶¶ 198-200.) The Complaint further alleges that the  defendants knew or should have known that hotel  employees were ""allowing criminals to rent rooms for  prostitution and drug dealing,"" ""failing to either identify  and/or  report  the  human  sex  trafficking  and  foreseeable harm"" of plaintiff, and ""failing to refuse  continued lodging services to human sex traffickers.""  (Id. ¶¶ 201-03.) The Complaint concludes that the  defendants were negligent in their hiring, employment,  supervision, and termination decisions regarding the  employees, and that the sex trafficking of plaintiff was  a foreseeable and direct result. (Id. ¶¶ 204-08.) Each of the motions seeks dismissal of the negligent  hiring, supervision, and retention claim based on  pleading deficiencies. Laxmi and Wyndham both argue  that the claim fails because the Complaint lacks  sufficient factual allegations that either defendant knew  or should have known of any unfit employees. (Doc.  #13, p. 19; Doc. #14, pp. 21-22); [*38]  see also Bright  v. City of Tampa, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 218868, 2017  WL 5248450, *8 (M.D. Fla. May 17, 2017) (""When an  employer fails to take a corrective action against an  employee because the employer had no notice of  problems with the employee's fitness, the employer is  not liable under Florida law for negligent supervision or  retention.""). The Court disagrees. The Complaint  sufficiently alleges facts suggesting sex trafficking was  occurring at the hotel, that the employees knew of it and  failed to prevent it, and that due to their control over the  employees, each defendant knew or should have known  of it. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 88-107-08, 195-203.) The Court finds  such allegations sufficient at this stage of the  proceedings. Wyndham also argues the claim should be dismissed  because the Complaint does not plausibly allege that  Wyndham hired or employed any of the employees at  issue. (Doc. #14, p. 22.) The Court is not persuaded, as  it has determined the Complaint's allegations of an  agency relationship between Wyndham and Laxmi are  sufficient. Accordingly, the Court denies the request to            2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *35 Page 13 of 14 dismiss the negligent hiring, supervision, and retention  claim. 5. Negligent Rescue Plaintiff also asserts a claim for negligent rescue in  Count V of the Complaint against Laxmi. (Doc. #1, ¶  209.) The Complaint [*39]  alleges Laxmi, as the owner  and operator of the Super 8 Hotel, had a duty to keep  the premises safe and prevent foreseeable criminal  activity, as well as a duty ""to make safe a dangerous  condition at the Super 8 Wyndham Hotel and to rescue  their [sic] hotel guests, specifically Plaintiff S.Y., from  the peril they [sic] created."" (Id. ¶¶ 211, 214, 220.) The  Complaint alleges that by various acts and omissions,  Laxmi breached these duties and that the continuous  sex trafficking of plaintiff was the direct and  foreseeable result. (Id. ¶¶ 216-18, 222-23, 225.) Laxmi  argues the negligent rescue claim should be dismissed  because it is insufficiently pled. (Doc. #13, p. 21.) There is no common law duty to rescue a stranger.  Estate of Ferguson v. Mascara, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  157824, 2010 WL 11558195, *2 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 7,  2010) (citing Bradberry v. Pinellas Cty., 789 F.2d 1513,  1516 (11th Cir. 1986)). ""A well-established exception to  this rule, however, provides that an innkeeper is 'under  an ordinary duty of care to [a guest] after he knows or  has reason to know the [guest] is ill or injured.'"" De La  Flor v. Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co., L.L.C., 2013 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 5403, 2013 WL 148401, *3 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 14,  2013) (quoting L.A. Fitness, Int'l, LLC v. Mayer, 980 So.  2d 550, 557 (Fla. 4th DCA 2008)); see also Abramson v.  Ritz Carlton Hotel Co., LLC, 480 Fed. App'x 158, 161  (3d Cir. 2012) (""Generally, there is no duty to  affirmatively assist an injured person unless a special  relationship, such as that between an innkeeper and its  guests, exists between the parties."") (citation omitted). Laxmi argues the negligent rescue claim should [*40]   be dismissed because it is insufficiently pled under the  ""rescue doctrine."" (Doc. #13, p. 21.) Under Florida law,  the rescue doctrine holds a tortfeasor liable for injuries  to a third party who is hurt in attempting to rescue the  direct victim of the tortfeasor. Zivojinovich v. Barner, 525  F.3d 1059, 1070 (11th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted). ""The  basic precept of this doctrine 'is that the person who has  created a situation of peril for another will be held in law      to have caused peril not only to the victim, but also to  his rescuer, and thereby to have caused any injury  suffered by the rescuer in the rescue attempt.'""  Menendez v. W. Gables Rehab. Hosp., LLC, 123 So. 3d  1178, 1181 (Fla. 3d DCA 2013) (quoting N.H. Ins. Co. v.  Oliver, 730 So. 2d 700, 702 (Fla. 4th DCA 1999)). As plaintiff correctly argues in response (Doc. #37, p.  21), the rescue doctrine is not implicated by plaintiff's  negligent rescue claim. See Krajcsik v. Ramsey, 2017  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143003, 2017 WL 3868560, *2 n.4 (D.  Md. Sept. 5, 2017) (""The rescue doctrine is related to,  but separate from, the affirmative duty to rescue an  imperiled party that the courts impose on persons in  some situations.""). Accordingly, because the rescue  doctrine is not applicable, Laxmi's request for dismissal  based on the doctrine is denied. 6. Aiding and Abetting, Harboring, Confining,  Coercion and Criminal Enterprise Finally, Count VI of the Complaint asserts a claim of  aiding and abetting against Laxmi. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 226.)  Plaintiff [*41]  accuses Laxmi of ""aiding and abetting  unlawful  activity  including  unlawful  confinement,  imprisonment, assault and battery by [plaintiff's] sex  traffickers and 'Johns.'"" (Id.) Laxmi argues the claim  must be dismissed because (1) it asserts Laxmi ""aided  and abetted the criminal act of sex trafficking in  violation of the TVPRA,"" and (2) the TVPRA does not  provide a cause of action for aiding and abetting. (Doc.  #13, p. 22.) Having reviewed the allegations in the  Complaint and the relevant case law, the Court finds  Laxmi is misinterpreting the claim. Florida courts have recognized aiding and abetting the  commission of a tort as a standalone claim. See Gilison  v. Flagler Bank, 303 So. 3d 999, 1002 (Fla. 4th DCA  2020) (aiding and abetting fraud); MP, LLC v. Sterling  Holding, LLC, 231 So. 3d 517, 527 (Fla. 3d DCA 2017)  (aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty). This Court  has previously listed the following elements that must be  alleged ""to state a claim for aiding and abetting a  common law tort"" under Florida law: ""(1) an underlying         2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *38 Page 14 of 14 violation on the part of the primary wrongdoer; (2)  knowledge of the underlying violation by the alleged  aider and abetter [sic]; and (3) the rendering of  substantial assistance in committing the wrongdoing by  the alleged aider and abettor."" Angell v. Allergan Sales,  LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142768, 2019 WL 3958262,  at *8 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 22, 2019); see also Lawrence v.  Bank of Am., N.A., 455 F. App'x 904, 906 (11th Cir.  2012) (applying the above elements to three [*42]   Florida tort claims). These cases demonstrate Florida  recognizes a common-law claim of aiding and abetting  tortious conduct. Here, the Complaint alleges Laxmi aided and abetted  plaintiff's  unlawful  harboring,  confinement,  imprisonment, assault and battery, and to the extent the  claim alleges Laxmi has actual knowledge, the Court  finds it sufficient to state a claim. Accordingly, the Court  denies Laxmi's request for dismissal. D. More Definite Statement Finally, Laxmi asserts that the Complaint is vague,  ambiguous, and fails to provide sufficient information to  allow Laxmi to formulate a response. (Doc. #13, pp. 22- 23.) Laxmi requests the Court exercise its discretion and  order plaintiff provide a more definite statement  pursuant to Rule 12(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure. (Id.) Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e), ""[a]  party may move for a more definite statement of a  pleading to which a responsive pleading is allowed but  which is so vague or ambiguous that the party cannot  reasonably prepare a response."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e);  see also Euro RSCG Direct Response, LLC v. Green  Bullion Fin. Servs., 872 F. Supp. 2d 1353, 1358 (S.D.  Fla. 2012) (quoting Ramirez v. FBI, No. 8:10-cv-1819-T- 23TBM, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132271, 2010 WL  5162024, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 14, 2010)) (""A Rule 12(e)  motion is appropriate if the pleading is so vague or  ambiguous that the opposing party cannot respond,  even with a simple denial, in good faith, without  prejudice to [itself].""). [*43]  The Court finds the Complaint is not ""so vague or           ambiguous"" that Defendant could not reasonably  respond. Euro RSCG Direct Response, 872 F. Supp. 2d  at 1358 (""[A Rule 12(e)] motion is intended to provide a  remedy for an unintelligible pleading, rather than a  vehicle for obtaining greater detail.""); Eye Care Int'l, Inc.  v. Underhill, 92 F. Supp. 2d 1310, 1316 (M.D. Fla. 2000)  (noting that ""motions for a more definite statement are  not favored in light of the liberal discovery practice,"" and  that ""a motion for more definite statement is not to be  used as a substitute for discovery""); cf. LeBlanc v. LVNV  Funding, LLC, No. 2:19-cv-285-FtM-99MRM, 2019 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 99983, at *1 (M.D. Fla. June 14, 2019)  (granting motion for more definite statement, finding ""the  Complaint contains no facts"" and was ""not sufficiently  specific to place defendant on notice of the claims  against it""). Here, Plaintiff has provided specific facts about the  elements of each cause of action, Defendant's  purported knowledge and participation in ongoing and  continuous sex trafficking at the Super 8 by Wyndham  Naples in Naples, Florida, that occurred from 2014  through February 2016 with respect to Plaintiff, and its  failure to prevent this criminal conduct, which ultimately  resulted in Defendant profiting from the trafficking. The  Court finds such allegations are sufficiently specific to  place Defendant on [*44]  notice of the claims against it,  and as such, Defendant's Motion for a More Definite  Statement is denied. Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED: 1. Defendant Laxmi of Naples, LLC's Motion to  Dismiss, Motion to Strike, or For a More Definite  Statement and Memorandum of Law in Support  Thereof (Doc. #13) is DENIED. 2. Defendant Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.'s  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint (Doc. #14) is  DENIED. DONE and ORDERED at Fort Myers, Florida, this 6th  day of May, 2021. /s/ John E.

Plaintiff  Wilson was terminated on April 15, 2020. Id. ¶¶ 10-11.  The reason given for his termination was that he had  been observed sleeping on the job on February 23,  2020. Id. ¶ 11. Plaintiff Wilson denies ever falling asleep on  the job, and he asserts that between the date of the  alleged infraction and the date of his termination, no one  addressed the incident with him. Id. ¶¶ 13-14. The  acting director, who handed Plaintiff Wilson his  termination letter, allegedly said that if Plaintiff Wilson  had kept his mouth shut, he would not have lost his job.  Id. ¶¶ 11, 45. Plaintiff Wilson filed a complaint with the Connecticut  Commission on Human Rights  and  Opportunities  (""CHRO""),  which  was  Page 2 of 12 dismissed on January 18, 2022.4 Id. ¶ 15; see also ECF  No. 14-3.

Plaintiff Del Valle also alleges that she has not been  permitted to wear shoes other than steel-toed boots, but  a white colleague is permitted to do so and ""to go  where[]ever she wants."" Id. ¶ 21. The complaint also  describes an incident where a white female colleague  broke some equipment but was not disciplined for the  error. Id. ¶ 20. Plaintiff Del Valle speculates that a  minority employee would have been scrutinized if they  had made the same [*4]  mistake. Id. She does not  describe any other incident that would support her  speculation, though. She also states that she has heard her crew leader  comment that women should not be working for  Defendant, and that her supervisor and her crew leader  have referred to Hispanic employees as ""you people.""  Id. ¶¶ 24-25. Finally, she asserts that over the course of  her  employment,  she  has  been  given  fewer  opportunities for overtime than her peers who are not  Hispanic women. Id. ¶ 26.

On  May 15, 2020, the acting director and a supervisor told 5 A substantial part of the complaint is devoted to  describing an incident earlier in January where Plaintiff  Del Valle argued with the acting director and Plaintiff  Wilson's supervisor about an apparent discrepancy in  Plaintiff Wilson's paycheck. The director and the  supervisor allegedly [*5]  told her that Plaintiff Wilson  was a liar and a poor worker, and they accused Plaintiff  Del Valle of using the office computers to collect  information about her son's paycheck, which she  denied. ECF No. 1 ¶ 28-40. Plaintiff Del Valle accused  the others of being disrespectful. The altercation  culminated in Plaintiff Del Valle's office keys being  confiscated. These allegations are never relied upon for  any of Plaintiffs' claims, and their relevance are unclear,  so the court will not discuss them in any further detail. 3 her that they had known her complaint would go  nowhere, and that now they would get rid of her.

She claims that her multiple requests to be assigned to  the position of backup clerk have been denied because  she is restricted to light duty, but she asserts that her  physical limitations do not prevent her performing the  tasks of a backup clerk. Id. ¶ 48-49. She also asserts  that she has been denied access to certain trainings  although her physical limitations would not prevent her  being able to participate in those trainings. Id. ¶¶ 42, 51- 52. Plaintiff [*6]  del Valle filed a complaint of discrimination  and retaliation with the CHRO on June 30, 2020. Id. ¶  54. On March 23, 2022, a Release of Jurisdiction was  issued. Id. Plaintiffs filed their complaint on April 23, 2022,  asserting six claims. See generally ECF No. 1. Counts One and Two raise Title VII claims  as to both the plaintiffs (racial discrimination and  retaliation, respectively). Counts Three and Four allege  discrimination against Plaintiff Del Valle on the basis of  her disability in violation of the Americans with  Page 3 of 12 Disabilities Act (""ADA"") and the Connecticut Fair  Employment Practices Act (""CFEPA""), respectively.  Counts Five and Six allege gender discrimination as to  Plaintiff in violation of Title VII and the CFEPA,  respectively. Plaintiffs seek damages plus costs and  fees. II. LEGAL STANDARD It is axiomatic that federal courts have limited jurisdiction  and must dismiss actions where subject matter  jurisdiction is lacking. See Nike, Inc. v. Already, LLC,  663 F.3d 89, 4 94 (2d. Cir. 2011). A party may move to dismiss a claim  where the federal courts do not have jurisdiction to hear  it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). In resolving a motion to  dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, a district  court may refer to evidence outside the pleadings.  Makarova v. United States, 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir.  2000). Dismissal also is appropriate where the [*7]  facts  alleged in the complaint are insufficient to state a  plausible claim for relief. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.  662, 678 (2009). To avoid dismissal under Federal Rule  of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a plaintiff must plead  ""enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible  on its face,"" and not merely ""conceivable."" Bell Atl.  Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). When  reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6),  the court must accept as true all factual allegations in  the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in the  nonmovant's favor. See ATSI Commc'ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d  87, 98 (2d Cir. 2007). Although a complaint ""does not  need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff's obligation  to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitle[ment] to relief'  requires more than labels and conclusions, and a  formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action  will not do."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555; see also  Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at 684 (concluding that the Twombly  pleading standard applies in ""all civil actions""). III. DISCUSSION Defendant alleges that all the claims must be dismissed.  With respect to Plaintiff Wilson's two claims, they argue that both his  discrimination and retaliation claim (Counts One and  Two, respectively) must be dismissed because he has  failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. They also  argue that he has failed to state a claim for 5 discrimination. And with respect to Plaintiff Del Valle's  claims, [*8]  they argue that the Eleventh Amendment  bars her CFEPA and ADA claims (Counts Three, Four,  and Six), that she has failed to exhaust administrative  remedies for her disability claim under the CFEPA  (Count Four), and that she has failed to state any of her  claims. Because the Eleventh Amendment argument calls  jurisdiction into question, the court will begin there. 1. CFEPA and ADA Claims The Eleventh Amendment bars federal courts from  hearing suits brought against a state by its citizens. See  generally Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890). But ""[a]  sovereign's immunity may be waived, and the [Supreme  Court of the United States] consistently has held that a  State may consent to suit against it in federal court."" Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S.  89, 99 (1984). Such a waiver of immunity must be  expressed in clear terms. Id. Similarly, Congress ""has  power with respect to the rights protected by the  Fourteenth Amendment to abrogate the Eleventh  Amendment immunity,"" but this exercise of power also  must be done unequivocally. Id. A state agency enjoys the protection of the Eleventh  Amendment where it functions as an ""arm of the State.""  Regents of the Univ. of California v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425,  429- 30 (1997). Where an action names a state agency  as a defendant, but the suit ""is in essence one for the  recovery of money from the state, the state is the real,  substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its  sovereign immunity from suit . . . ."" Id. [*9]  At 429  (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury of  Ind., 323 U.S. 459 (1945)). Because a suit against the  Connecticut Department of Transportation essentially is  a suit against the State of Connecticut, the court finds  that Defendant is entitled to exercise 6 sovereign immunity where that protection has not been  waived. See Martires v.Connecticut Dep't of Transp.,  596 F. Supp. 2d 425, 445 (D. Conn. 2009) (finding that  the Connecticut Department of Transportation was  protected by sovereign immunity against civil rights  claims). Page 4 of 12 And it is well settled that Connecticut has not consented  to defend CFEPA claims in federal court. See Lyon v.  Jones, 168 F. Supp. 2d 1, *6 (D. Conn. 2001)  (dismissing CFEPA claims as barred by the Eleventh  Amendment). To the contrary, the CFEPA specifies that  suits may be brought only in the state's superior court.  Pawlow v. Dep't ofEmergency Servs. & Pub. Prot., 172  F. Supp. 3d 568, 578 (D. Conn. 2016). Therefore, this  federal court may not hear the CFEPA claims brought in  this action. Plaintiffs argue that the court may hear the CFEPA  claims pursuant to supplemental jurisdiction, but  supplemental  jurisdiction  cannot  defeat  Eleventh  Amendment immunity. Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 121  (""[N]either pendent jurisdiction nor any other basis of  jurisdiction may override the Eleventh Amendment."");  see also Vadenv. Connecticut, 557 F. Supp. 2d 279,  289 (D. Conn. 2008) (""[T]he Eleventh Amendment  necessarily also bars exercise of federal statutory  supplemental jurisdiction over suits against a State."").  Therefore, it is clear that Counts Four6 and Six must be  dismissed. Plaintiff Del Valle's ADA claim is barred for [*10]  the  same reason. The Supreme Court has held, clearly and  unequivocally, that the Eleventh Amendment shields  state employers from claims arising under Title I of the  ADA, which is the part of the ADA that addresses  discrimination in employment. Bd. of Trustees of Univ.  of Alabama v. Garrett, 6 Because the court concludes that Count Four is  barred by sovereign immunity, the court need not reach  the question of whether Plaintiff Del Valle exhausted her  administrative remedies with respect to this claim. 7 531 U.S. 356, 360 (2001); see also Mary Jo C. v. New  York State & Loc. Ret. Sys., 707 F.3d 144, 171 (2d Cir.  2013) (""A public employee may not bring a Title II claim  against his or her employer, at least when the defendant  employer employs fifteen or more employees."").7 Thus,  there can be no argument that Count Three also must  be dismissed.8 2. Title VII Claims The Eleventh Amendment does not bar citizens from  suing state agencies under Title VII, though. The court  therefore turns to Counts One, Two, and Five. Counts  One  and  Two  assert  claims  of  racial  discrimination and retaliation, respectively, as to each  plaintiff. Count Five asserts gender discrimination as to  Plaintiff Del Valle. Defendant argues that all these  counts must be dismissed as they relate to Plaintiff Del  Valle because they fail to state a claim. And Defendant  argues  that  Counts  One  and  Two  must  be  dismissed [*11]  as they relate to Plaintiff Wilson  because he failed to exhaust his administrative  remedies. Finally, Defendant argues that Plaintiff Wilson  has failed to state a claim in Count One (the  discrimination claim). i. Exhaustion The court takes up the exhaustion argument first. There  is a comprehensive administrative framework in place to  address claims arising under Title VII. Plaintiffs must  first file a complaint with the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission (""EEOC""), who 7 The complaint names 14 of Defendant's employees by  name, and references others more generally, so the  court is satisfied that this case fits within the ambit of  Mary Jo C. 8Plaintiffs have filed a motion to amend the complaint,  see ECF No. 25, asserting that such amendment is  necessary to incorporate the fact that the CHRO and the  EEOC have issued a release of jurisdiction and a notice  of right to sue in relation to a complaint of disability  discrimination from Plaintiff Del Valle. The court finds  the proposed amendment would be futile, since this new  factual allegation does not save the disability claims  from dismissal under the Eleventh Amendment. The  motion to amend therefore must be denied, and the  court  need  not  address  the  additional  communications [*12]  from the CHRO or the EEOC any  further. 8 investigates the allegations and determines whether  they ought to bring claims against the employer, or  whether they ought to release jurisdiction and allow the  plaintiff to pursue their claims individually. 42 U.S.C.A. §  2000e-5(b), (e). Many states, Connecticut among them,  have an analogous state agency that also reviews  allegations  of  employment  discrimination.  In  Connecticut, it is the CHRO.9 The EEOC is required to  defer to the CHRO for 60 days following the filing of a  discrimination complaint to allow the state to handle the  claim, if it chooses to do so. 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-5(c).  After this deferral period, the EEOC has jurisdiction to  Page 5 of 12 review the claim. Id. If the EEOC fails to make any  determination as to the complaint within 180 days of  having jurisdiction over it, the EEOC ""shall"" so notify the grievant, and the grievant then has  90 days to commence a civil suit. 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e- 5(f)(1). The administrative timeline for Plaintiffs is not entirely  clear. It appears that each plaintiff filed their grievance  with the CHRO, which in turn sent each complaint to the  EEOC for dual filing. ECF Nos. 14-2, 14-4. Plaintiff Del  Valle's complaint is dated June 30, 2020, and is stamped as being received by the State  of Connecticut [*13]  on July 10, 2020. ECF No. 14-4.  Plaintiff Wilson's complaint is dated June 30, 2020, and  is stamped as being received by the State of  Connecticut on July 21, 2020. ECF No. 14-2. Plaintiff Del Valle asserts that the CHRO released its  jurisdiction as to her complaint on March 23, 2022,  though the release itself was not docketed. ECF No. 1 ¶  54. Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff Del Valle  has exhausted the administrative remedies for her Title  VII claims, and so the court will accept that there is no  procedural impediment to her claims in Counts One,  Two, and Five. 9 There are specific time periods within which a  complaint must be filed with the CHRO and the EEOC,  but there is no argument that Plaintiffs' complaints were  untimely. 9 However, it appears that Plaintiff Wilson never received  a release of jurisdiction from the CHRO. Rather, on  January 18, 2022, he received a final agency action of  ""No Reasonable Cause,"" ECF No. 14-3, which is a dismissal  for the reason that there is ""no reasonable possibility  that investigating the complaint will result in a finding of  reasonable cause."" Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 46a-83(c).  Defendant argues in the Motion that this final agency  action does not serve to exhaust Defendant's [*14]   administrative remedies absent an official release of  jurisdiction. The court need not address this argument, though,  because whatever happened with the CHRO, it is clear  that Plaintiff Wilson did receive a right-to-sue notice  from the EEOC on June 14, 2022. See ECF No. 17-1.  The court finds that this notice satisfies the exhaustion  requirement as to his Title VII claims. Defendant's argument to the contrary is unavailing.  Defendant contends that Plaintiff Wilson's Title VII  claims still should be dismissed because he was  required to wait until after he had received this release  to file this action, but he filed suit well before receipt of  the notice, and thus his claims were premature. Defendant concedes, though, that under Title VII, the  exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional, and so it  may be waived or estopped where appropriate. Pietras  v. Bd.of Fire Comm'rs of Farmingville Fire Dist., 180  F.3d 468, 474 (2d Cir. 1999) (""The Supreme Court has  stated that 'filing a timely charge of discrimination with  the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in  federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of  limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable  tolling.'"") (quoting Zipes v.Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455  U.S. 385, 393 (1982)). Still, Defendant argues that  allowing these claims to proceed under these [*15]   circumstances would defeat the purpose of 10 exhaustion, namely, to allow an administrative agency  the first opportunity to take remedial action. The court is unpersuaded. In the first instance, the  EEOC had ample time to exercise its authority to  adjudicate the complaint, and it declined to take any  remedial action with respect to Plaintiff Wilson's claims.  Moreover, according to the relevant regulations, Plaintiff  Wilson should have received a release of jurisdiction  long before he did. By the court's calculation, had the  EEOC disposed of his complaint within 180 days of  having jurisdiction over it, Plaintiff Wilson would have  had his right-to-sue notice by March 18, 2021.10 But, of  course, a global pandemic can affect an agency's ability  to function efficiently, and for that same reason, the  court finds it appropriate to approach Plaintiff Wilson's  complaint with appreciation for the unique challenges  presented in navigating the administrative process when  the administration is not operating at full capacity. Moreover, even absent a global emergency, the court  finds  equitable  modification  of  the  exhaustion  requirement to be uniquely necessary in the present  circumstances. The court [*16]  recognizes that district  courts often dismiss premature Title VII claims, but  without prejudice to refiling once the right to sue has  been issued. See, e.g., Hladki v.Jeffrey's Consol., Ltd.,  652 F. Supp. 388, 393 (E.D.N.Y. 1987). In this case,  though, the notice did not issue until after this case had  Page 6 of 12 been initiated and the Motion had been filed, and so  refiling a separate action may well have rendered  Plaintiff Wilson's claim subject to claim preclusion. But  the 90-day period to initiate a civil suit has long expired  by the 10 This date is 240 days from the date the State of  Connecticut stamped its receipt of the complaint, which  represents the 180 days the EEOC has to investigate a  claim, plus 60 days for which it was required to defer  jurisdiction to the CHRO. 11 date of this ruling, which may well preclude Plaintiff  Wilson from pursuing his claims in a separate suit.  Thus, the court finds it in the interest of justice to grant  Plaintiff Wilson equitable relief in this case, and to  excuse him from strict compliance with the exhaustion  requirement. See Pinkard v. Pullman-Standard, 678  F.2d 1211, 1219 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982), reh'g en banc  denied, 685 F.2d 1383, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1105  (1983) (waiving exhaustion where procedural anomalies  related to class actions caused a plaintiff to miss his  opportunity to file suit after receipt of the right to  sue [*17]  notice). Because failure to exhaust is Defendant's only argument  for dismissing Plaintiff Wilson's retaliation claim in Count  Two, the Motion is denied with respect to that claim. 3. Failure to State a Claim Finally,  Defendant  argues  that  Plaintiff  Wilson's  discrimination claim and each of Plaintiff Del Valle's  remaining claims should be dismissed because they fail  to state a cognizable claim under Title VII. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that it is  unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an  employee because of that employee's race, color, or  sex. 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-2. The statute is intended ""to assure  equality of employment opportunities and to eliminate  those discriminatory practices and devices which have  fostered racially stratified job environments to the  disadvantage of minority citizens."" McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 800  (1973), holding modified by Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,  507 U.S. 604 (1993). ""Title VII prohibits both intentional  discrimination (known as 'disparate treatment') as well  as, in some cases, practices that are not intended to  discriminate but in fact have a disproportionately  adverse effect on minorities (known as 'disparate  impact')."" Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 577 (2009). Recognizing that ""most discrimination and retaliation is  not carried out so openly as to 12 provide direct proof of it,"" Sanders v. New York City  Hum. Res. Admin., 361 F.3d 749, 755 (2d Cir. 2004),  plaintiffs asserting [*18]  disparate treatment claims11  may show discriminatory intent by either direct or  circumstantial evidence of animus, Radwan v.Manuel,  55 F.4th 101, 132 (2d Cir. 2022). Direct evidence of discriminatory animus includes  employer policies, practices, or decisions that expressly  rely upon a protected characteristic. Young v. United  ParcelServ., Inc., 575 U.S. 206, 213 (2015). Plaintiffs do  not allege that Defendant took any action against them  explicitly because of their race or gender, so there is no  direct evidence of discrimination. The absence of direct  evidence is not fatal to their claims, though. They still  may show circumstantial evidence of discriminatory  animus using the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. First,  they must make out a prima facie case by showing that  they are a member of a protected class, that they are  qualified for the positions they held or continue to hold,  that they suffered an adverse action, and that the facts  imply a discriminatory intent. Radwan, 55 F.4th at 130.  With respect to the third element, an adverse action is  defined as a materially adverse change in the terms and  conditions of employment. Sanders, 361 F.3d at 755. It  must be more than an inconvenience or a change in an  employee's responsibilities. Id. And with respect to the  fourth element, there are several recognized methods  by  which  a  Title  VII  plaintiff [*19]   can  show  circumstances which might lead a reasonable juror to  infer discriminatory animus, one of which is to point to  comparators who are similarly situated to the plaintiff,  but who are not of the same protected class, and who  were not treated as harshly as the plaintiff. Radwan, 55 F.4th at 132. 11 Plaintiffs do not proceed under a disparate impact  theory. 13 If the plaintiffs successfully present a prima facie case of  discrimination, the burden shifts to Defendant to proffer  a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse  Page 7 of 12 action. Id. at 130. Then the burden shifts back to  Plaintiffs to show that the proffered reason is pretextual.  Id. There is no dispute that Plaintiffs have satisfied the first  and second elements of the prima facie test (that they  are members of a protected class and are qualified for  the work they were hired to perform). Defendant argues,  however, that neither plaintiff has alleged an adverse  action nor any facts that support an inference of  discrimination. i. Discrimination as to Plaintiff Wilson With respect to Plaintiff Wilson, Defendant argues that  the alleged denial of ""special privileges"" does not qualify as an adverse  action for purposes of Title VII. The court hesitates to  find that [*20]  the denial of perquisites made available  to some workers can never provide the basis for a Title  VII claim, but it agrees with Defendant in this instance.  Absent any description in the complaint of what these  ""special privileges"" were, the court cannot assess  whether they qualify as materially adverse changes to  the terms of Plaintiff Wilson's employment. Accordingly, the Motion is  granted insofar as Count One seeks to recover for the  denial of these ""special privileges."" However, it cannot be argued that Plaintiff Wilson's  termination qualifies as an adverse action sufficient to  carry his Title VII claim. Thus, the court finds the third  element of the prima facie case satisfied with respect to  Plaintiff Wilson in Count One. 14 The court also finds the fourth element satisfied.12  There are two facts which, when taken together, may  lead a reasonable factfinder to infer discriminatory  animus. First, Plaintiff Wilson was fired for an incident  (which he denies occurs at all) that allegedly occurred  over a month before he was fired, for which he received  no intervening discipline before his termination. And  second, at the termination itself, Defendant's acting  director allegedly told Plaintiff [*21]  Wilson that if he  had ""kept his mouth shut"" then he would not have been  losing his job. That remark appears to refer to Plaintiff  Wilson's complaints about racial discrimination, and the  fact that the remark was made at the moment of his  termination is sufficient to allow a reasonable factfinder  to infer that the termination was motivated by  discriminatory animus.13 Although the McDonnell Douglas framework has two  additional steps, Defendant does not make any  argument as to their burden at the next step. That is to  say, Defendant does not argue that they had a  legitimate reason for terminating Plaintiff Wilson. But  even assuming that they were to point to the same  justification given at the time of the termination (Plaintiff  Wilson's alleged nap on the job), the court would find  that these same two facts would support an inference  that the justification is pretextual. Accordingly, the Motion must be denied with respect to  Plaintiff Wilson's Title VII claim for discrimination in  Count One. 12Defendant argues that Plaintiff Wilson has not  described any similarly-situated individuals, and this is  true, but that argument related to the individuals  receiving ""special treatment,"" which the court already  has [*22]  found is not an adequately-pled adverse  action. Thus, the court will not address this argument  here. 13The court acknowledges Defendant's point that  Plaintiff Wilson made his complaint to his union representative and not to his manager, but again, the  fact that a manager referred to it allows the court to  draw the reasonable inference from the alleged facts  that the complaint had made its way to Defendant. 15 ii. Discrimination as to Plaintiff Del Valle Plaintiff Del Valle asserts that she has experienced  adverse action in the denial of training and overtime  opportunities, the assignment of more arduous tasks,  fewer perquisites, and the rejection of her request to be  the backup clerk. Plaintiff Del Valle points out that courts have concluded  that the denial of opportunities for professional  development, like trainings, can qualify as an adverse  action, where those opportunities ""bear on either [the]  plaintiff's opportunities for professional growth and  career advancement or directly on [the] plaintiff's  compensation."" Nakis v. Potter, No. 01 CIV. 10047 (HBP), 2004 WL  2903718, at *20 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 2004). But it is not  alleged that the trainings from which Plaintiff Del Valle  was excluded had any effect on her career or  Page 8 of 12 compensation. The only trainings she cites are one on  [*23] ""the double wing"" and one involving ""signs and  markings,"" the latter of which enabled employees to  earn some sort of ""fuel certification."" There is no  explanation of what it would mean for Plaintiff Del  Valle's career if she were trained on the double wing, or  if she had the referenced certification. Plaintiff Del Valle  never alleges that these trainings (or any other) would  have enabled her to progress in her career. For this  reason, the court cannot conclude that the exclusion  from trainings qualifies as an adverse action.14 Similarly, it is not clear that the position of backup clerk  is superior in any way to Plaintiff Del Valle's current position. The simple fact that  an individual has sought but has been denied a  particular position is not, in itself, an adverse action.  There must be some affirmative indicia as to why the  denied position is more desirable, perhaps because it 14 The court notes, too, that Plaintiff Del Valle's  allegation with respect to the signs-and-markings  training appears to be that she was excluded from the  training because she was on light duty at the time,  which she claims was an example of disability  discrimination. But, as discussed previously, the  disability [*24]  claims have been dismissed. 16 has better pay or better hours. See Beyer v. Cnty. of  Nassau, 524 F.3d 160, 164 (2d Cir. 2008) (""A denial of a  transfer may also constitute an adverse employment  action, but we require a plaintiff to proffer objective  indicia of material disadvantage; 'subjective, personal  disappointment[ ]' is not enough."") (quoting Galabya v.  N.Y. City Bd. of Educ., 202 F.3d 636, 640 (2d Cir.2000))  (alteration in original). But here again, Plaintiff Del Valle  fails to offer any specifics as to the backup clerk  position. Consequently, the court cannot find that the  failure to make her the backup clerk qualifies as an  adverse action for the purposes of her discrimination  claim. Plaintiff Del Valle also asserts that she has been denied  certain perquisites and has been made to perform more  arduous tasks than others. But, here, too, there are  insufficient facts from which the court can find an  adverse action. With respect to perquisites, she alleges  that one white coworker is permitted to wear shoes that  do not have steel toes and may ""go where[]ever she  wants."" ECF No. 1 ¶ 21. In the first instance, it is not  clear what Plaintiff Del Valle is alleging when she says  this other individual may go where she wants. The court  will assume for this discussion that the allegation is that  this colleague [*25]  is permitted to be off-task without  being disciplined. Even with that assumption, though,  the court cannot find that these de minimus allowances  for other coworkers materially affects the terms and  conditions of Plaintiff Del Valle's employment. While in  some cases the inconsistent application of discipline  may qualify as an adverse action, Plaintiff Del Valle  does not allege that she was subjected to discipline for  these workplace violations. She states that she ""was not  permitted"" to wear shoes without steel toes, but it is not  clear  whether  she  was  disciplined  for  wearing  nonconforming shoes, and if so, what discipline was  meted out. The same is true for the 17 alleged allowance of a white coworker to have long  lunch breaks. Thus, even making several inferences (or  perhaps assumptions) in Plaintiff Del Valle's favor, the  court cannot find that these alleged facts show an  adverse action. And with respect to her work assignments, generally  speaking, ""[t]he assignment of tasks that are within the  description or duties of the position, even if less  desirable, do not rise to the level of an adverse  employment  action.""  Nidzon  v.  Konica  Minolta  Bus.Sols., USA, Inc., 752 F. Supp. 2d 336, 350  (S.D.N.Y. 2010). Plaintiff Del Valle does not assert that  the tasks she was asked to [*26]  perform were not  within her usual job description, and her ""subjective  dissatisfaction with her assignments is insufficient"" to  show an adverse action, even in combination with all  Plaintiff Del Valle's other allegations. Reckard v. Cnty. of Westchester, 351 F. Supp. 2d 157,  161 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). The only alleged conduct that may satisfy the ""adverse  action""  requirement  is  the  denial  of  overtime  opportunities. The allegation, though, is devoid of any  specifics. The entire assertion states, ""Consistently  throughout her employment by DOT Del Valle has been  given less overtime opportunities [sic] than employees  who are not Hispanic women."" ECF No. 1 ¶ 26. It is  difficult to ascertain from this single, unsupported  statement whether this alleged denial rises to the level  of an adverse action. But the court need not make any conclusions as to the  sufficiency of the factual allegation because it is clear  Page 9 of 12 that Plaintiff Del Valle's discrimination claim still fails at  the next element. Even if the court were to accept this  bald accusation as a plausibly-pled adverse action, the  court could not infer from that single sentence any  discriminatory animus. 18 Plaintiff Del Valle has not asserted any facts that could  show that the women who were given overtime instead  of her [*27]  were similarly situated to her. She does not  specifically identify these comparators in any way, much  less state their positions or level of experience, or even  their relevant demographic characteristics. There simply  is insufficient information from which the court could  conclude that the referenced comparators are similarly  situated to Plaintiff Del Valle. And there are no other alleged facts from which the  court could infer that the denial of overtime resulted  from discriminatory animus. Although Plaintiff Del Valle  alleges that her crew leader made disparaging  comments about women working for the Department of  Transportation and that her supervisor referred to  Hispanics as ""you people,"" this is insufficient to show  discriminatory animus as to the denied overtime. In the first instance, it is nowhere alleged that the crew  leader and supervisor had anything to do with the denial  of her overtime. And even assuming that they did  control her schedule, it is unclear whether their remarks  were sufficiently inflammatory or frequent. Stray  comments ""do not amount to the 'steady barrage of  opprobrious ... comments' sufficient to alter the conditions"" of Plaintiff  Del Valle's employment. Brennerv. City of New York  Dep't of Educ., 659 F. App'x 52, 54 (2d Cir. 2016)  (quoting [*28]  Tolbert v. Smith, 790 F.3d 427, 439 (2d  Cir. 2015)) (alteration in original). Plaintiff asserts that  her crew leader says things ""to the effect"" that women  should not be working for Defendant, but she gives no  specifics. The court therefore cannot assess the content  and context of these comments to corroborate her  conclusion. Similarly, while referring to a particular  group as ""you people"" certainly can denote a bias  relevant to a Title VII claim, the allegation in the  complaint is only that Plaintiff Del Valle's crew leader  and supervisor 19 have used this reference. Again, absent any context for  these comments, it is difficult for the court to conclude  that these comments alone can sustain her claim. It also is unclear when and how often these comments  were made. Plaintiff Del Valle alleges that she has  heard her crew leader comment about the unsuitability  of women to Defendant's work ""[f]rom the beginning of  her employment,"" but she does not allege the frequency  of these comments. And her allegation as to the use of  ""you people"" could just as easily show a single incident  as several. Accordingly, even assuming that Plaintiff Del  Valle's denied overtime opportunities constitute an  adverse employment action, she has not adequately  pled [*29]   discriminatory  animus  such  that  her  discrimination claims could survive dismissal. Accordingly, Counts One and Five are dismissed (Count  One as it relates to Plaintiff Del Valle). iii. Retaliation as to Plaintiff Del Valle15 Retaliation claims follow a similar burden-shifting  framework as discrimination claims follow. ""First, the  plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of retaliation  by showing: '(1) participation in a protected activity; (2)  that the defendant knew of the protected activity; (3) an  adverse  employment  action;  and  (4)  a  causal  connection between the protected activity and the  adverse employment action.'"" Hicks v. Baines, 593 F.3d  159, 164 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Jute v. Hamilton  Sundstrand Corp., 420 F.3d 166, 173 (2d Cir.2005).  Again, success at this step shifts the burden to  Defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory  reason for the adverse action. Id. And finally, 15 As noted supra, Defendant does not argue for  dismissal of Plaintiff Wilson's retaliation claim. 20 the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to proffer evidence  from which a factfinder reasonably could infer a  retaliatory motive for the adverse action. Id. Here, Plaintiff Del Valle complained about discrimination  in the workplace, which qualifies as protected activity for  purposes of Title VII. See Littlejohn v. City of New York,  795 F.3d 297, 319 (2d Cir. 2015) (finding [*30]  that  internal complaints of discrimination are protected  activities). And, since she complained directly to  management, Defendant certainly knew of the protected  activity. Thus, the first two elements clearly are satisfied. The third and fourth elements prove as problematic for  Plaintiff Del Valle's retaliation claim as they were for her  discrimination claim, though, despite the more lax  Page 10 of 12 standard applied to retaliation claims. ""An adverse  employment action in a retaliation case includes  conduct that is 'harmful to the point that it could well  dissuade a reasonable worker from making or  supporting a charge of discrimination.'"" Duplan v. City of  New York, 888 F.3d 612, 626-27 (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting  Shultz v. Congregation Shearith Israel, 867 F.3d 298,  309 (2d Cir. 2017)). ""This definition covers a broader  range of conduct than does the adverse-action standard  for claims of discrimination under Title VII . . . ."" Vegav.  Hempstead Union Free Sch. Dist., 801 F.3d 72, 90 (2d  Cir. 2015). ""[T]he antiretaliation provision, unlike the  substantive [discrimination] provision, is not limited to  discriminatory actions that affect the terms and  conditions of employment."" Id. (quoting Burlington N.  &Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 57 (2006))  (alterations in original). There is no bright-line test courts  employ in determining whether particular conduct  constitutes an adverse employment action. Fincher v.  Depository Tr. & Clearing Corp., 604 F.3d 712, 721 (2d  Cir. 2010). Rather, courts take a fact-intensive  approach, scrutinizing [*31]  each case to determine  whether a challenged action rises to the level required  by the statute. Id. 21 Thus, although Plaintiff Del Valle could not show an  adverse action for purposes of her discrimination claim,  the court must reassess that conduct (denial of training  and overtime, denial of appointment as backup clerk,  denial of perquisites, and assignment to more arduous  tasks) to determine whether it yet can satisfy the  requirements of her retaliation claim. The Second Circuit has held that the assignment of  more difficult tasks, see Vega, 801 F.3d at 91 (finding  that a teacher's assignment of more difficult classes  qualified as an adverse employment action), and the  denial of overtime, see Lewis v. TriboroughBridge &  Tunnel Auth., 31 F. App'x 746, 748 (2d Cir. 2002)  (affirming a jury verdict in a plaintiff's favor where the  plaintiff alleged, inter alia, denial of overtime as the  basis for her retaliation claim), may qualify as an  adverse employment actions for purposes of a Title VII  retaliation claim. But Plaintiff Del Valle clearly fails to  establish that she experienced these actions following  her January 22, 2020, complaint to management. To the  contrary, Plaintiff Del Valle clearly asserts that she has  been made to perform harder tasks and has been  denied  overtime  throughout [*32]   her  time  with  Defendant. Thus, the causal connection between this  conduct and the protected activity is absent. Similarly, without any specifics as to when the alleged  denial of perquisites and longer breaks occurred, the  court cannot find the requisite causal connection to that  conduct, even assuming it could qualify as an adverse  employment action. See Chungv. City Univ. of New  York, 605 F. App'x 20, 23 (2d Cir. 2015)(stating that  where ""timing is the only basis for a claim of retaliation,  and gradual adverse job actions began well before the  plaintiff had ever engaged in any protected activity, an  inference of retaliation 22 does not arise."") (quoting Slattery v. Swiss Reins. Am.  Corp., 248 F.3d 87, 95 (2d Cir.2001). And with respect to the denial of training opportunities  and her request to be backup clerk,16 here, again,  Plaintiff Del Valle fails to allege that these trainings had  any effect on her progression in her career, or that the  position of backup clerk was superior in any way to her  usual role. Absent some allegation that these trainings  would have led to some advantage to Plaintiff Del Valle,  the court cannot find that exclusion therefrom would  dissuade a reasonable person from asserting charges of  discrimination. See Leiferv. New York State Div. of  Parole, 391 F. App'x 32, 34 (2d Cir. 2010) (finding that  failing to provide a training to the plaintiff, inter alia, was  insufficient [*33]   to  demonstrate  an  adverse  employment action). Even if this conduct could qualify as an adverse  employment action for purposes of her retaliation claim,  there is nothing from which the court could infer  discriminatory motivation. One of the trainings she  specifically mentions (of only two) was held in  November 2021, over a year and a half after she had  made her internal complaint and over a year after she  had filed her complaint with the CHRO. Similarly, her  request to be stationed at the backup clerk position  came at some point after May 2021,17 over a year after  the internal complaint and almost a year after the CHRO  complaint. The lengthy period between the protected  activity and the allegedly retaliatory conduct attenuates  any causal connection. Thus, even taking as given that  Plaintiff Del Valle experienced an 16Again, the court acknowledges that these actions  appear to be pleaded in connection with Plaintiff Del Valle's disability discrimination claims, but the court  addresses them here nonetheless. 17While it is clear that Plaintiff Dell Valle made several  Page 11 of 12 requests for the backup clerk position, it is not clear  when she first made the request. But it appears from the  complaint that [*34]  her first request came after her on- the-job accident, since management told her she could  not be backup clerk while on light duty, and since she  was on light duty after the accident. ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 46- 49. So, because the accident occurred in May 2021, her  pleading shows that her request could not have been  before that time. 23 adverse employment action that satisfied the third  element of her prima facie case, she has not  established a causal connection between her internal  complaint and those actions that satisfies the fourth  element. However, though it is not clearly stated in the complaint  or thoroughly argued in Plaintiff Del Valle's opposition, the court finds that she  does have an actionable claim for Plaintiff Wilson's termination. Title VII's antiretaliation  provision covers a broad range of employer conduct.  Burlington, 548 U.S. at 62-63 (discussing the broader  language Congress employed in the antiretaliation  provision  as  compared  to  the  antidiscrimination  provision). Violative actions need not affect the  employee's terms of employment or employment  conditions. Id. at 63. It need only dissuade an employee  from engaging in protected activity, and actions taken  against a third party may certainly serve that  purpose. [*35]  See Thompson v. N. Am. Stainless, LP,  562 U.S. 170, 175 (2011) (""We think there is no textual  basis for making an exception to [the broad standard for  retaliatory conduct] for third-party reprisals . . . .""). And  while the Supreme Court of the United States has  declined to explicitly list those relationships that could  support a retaliation claim, this court finds that the  plaintiffs' relationship as mother and son certainly is  close enough to render adverse action against one to be  adequate deterrence for the other. Id. at 174. (""We think it obvious that a reasonable worker might be  dissuaded from engaging in protected activity if she  knew that her fiancé would be fired.""). Furthermore, the court finds that Plaintiff Del Valle has  alleged sufficient facts to support the rational inference  of a causal connection. First, Plaintiff Del Valle's  complaint (in January 2020) and Plaintiff Wilson's  termination (in April 2020) were close enough in time  that temporal proximity alone may carry the requisite  causal inference. Second, the 24 clear closeness of the plaintiffs' relationship, as  indicated by Plaintiff Del Valle's attention to her son's  employment concerns (namely, her attention to the  discrepancy in his paycheck), would indicate to others at  her job [*36]  a maternal sense of affection and  responsibility toward him.18 And finally, the threat  Plaintiff Del Valle received from her higher-ups that they  would ""get rid"" of her after her internal complaint had  been disposed of indicates a retaliatory predilection that,  though the threat postdated her son's termination, yet  could lead a factfinder to conclude that Plaintiff Wilson's  termination was a result of that predilection. Accordingly, the court finds that Plaintiff Del Valle has  stated a cognizable claim for retaliation under Title VII.",0
"United States v. Mujahid, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170568","FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION REGARDING MOTION TO EXCLUDE EVIDENCE OF PRIOR BAD  ACTS BASED ON LACK OF REASONABLE NOTICE UNDER FED. R. EVID. 404(b) [Doc. 311] I. MOTION PRESENTED    Page 2 of 3   Defendant Sabil Mujahid is charged in this multi-defendant case with a variety of crimes. Of the forty-one counts in  the Second Superceding Indictment, found at Docket 83, all but six apply to him. Most of the charges against  Defendant Mujahid involve allegations of [*2]  sex trafficking of children and adults and promotion of prostitution.  Mujahid is also charged with a child pornography offense, conspiracy to commit tax fraud, and identity theft. In September of 2010, Mujahid's counsel filed the motion at Docket 311 on behalf of Mujahid. Through counsel,  Mujahid requests that the Court prohibit the Government's introduction of certain ""bad acts"" evidence pursuant to  Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. He references a letter the Government sent to defense counsel on  April 30, 2010 that disclosed known Brady, Giglio, and Rule 404(b) prior bad acts evidence that it plans to use  during trial. The Government made these disclosures pursuant to this Court's order at Docket 134. Based on what  was disclosed in that letter, Mujahid argues that the information the Government indicated it would introduce at trial  is not specific enough to allow him to respond to its potential admissibility under 404(b). The Government argues that Mujahid misapprehends the nature of the April 30, 2010 letter. The letter was meant to  disclose what Brady and Giglio material the Government had at that time and to disclose evidence of other crimes  and bad acts it intends to introduce at trial pursuant to the Court's scheduling [*3]  order at Docket 134. The letter  disclosed that the Government plans to introduce various phone calls and witness statements already found in the  discovery material but the letter does not provide any details about those calls or statements. The Government  argues that these phone calls and statements are not actually other ""bad acts"" that must be noticed under Rule  404(b) because they are actually acts committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. It also argues that regardless of  whether some of the telephone conversations and witness statements are actually ""other crimes, wrongs, or acts""  under Rule 404(b), the general notice explaining that phone calls and statements will be introduced is sufficient to  meet the notice requirements in Rule 404(b) and that it is up to the defense counsel to go through those materials,  even if voluminous, and raise any admissibility issues with the Court. II. DISCUSSION Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence states as follows: Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show  action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive,  opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake [*4]  or accident, provided that  upon request by the accused, the prosecution in a criminal case shall provide reasonable notice in advance of  trial, or during trial if the court excuses pretrial notice on good cause shown, of the general nature of any such  evidence it intends to introduce at trial. Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). Evidence of other ""bad"" acts may be admitted under Rule 404(b) if: ""1) the evidence tends to  prove a material point; 2) the act is not too remote in time; 3) the evidence is sufficient to support a finding that the  defendant committed the other act; and 4) (in cases where knowledge and intent are at issue) the act is similar to  the offense charged."" United States v. Castillo, 181 F.3d 1129, 1134 (9th Cir. 1999). Rule 404(b) does not require exclusion of intrinsic evidence—evidence that is inextricably intertwined with the  crimes charged. Advisory Committee Notes, 199 Amendment; see also United States v. Williams, 989 F.2d 1061,  1070 (9th Cir. 1993); United State v. Williams, 900 F.2d 823, 825 (5th Cir. 1990). In other words, if the crime  charged and the evidence related to other bad acts are part of a single criminal episode or if other acts sought to be  admitted are ""necessary preliminaries"" to the crimes charged, then the evidence is not extrinsic bad act evidence  excluded under Rule 404(b). Williams, 900 F.2d at 825. It is unclear based the material provided in this motion what other 404(b)-type evidence the Government plans  to [*5]  introduce at trial on the grounds that such evidence shows intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or  absence of mistake or accident. The Government indicates in the letter that recorded telephone conversations  previously produced during discovery could be introduced and some witness statements could be introduced, but it  2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170568, *1 Page 3 of 3   does not clarify whether such evidence is going to be introduced as intrinsic evidence or whether it will be  introduced as extrinsic evidence that is nonetheless admissible under Rule 404(b) to prove something other than  propensity. The Court does not have enough information to make that determination for the parties at this time. The possible 404(b) evidence mentioned in the Government's letter is a broad category of materials given the  volume of discovery in this case. While notice under Rule 404(b) can be general in nature, the complexity of this  case and number of calls and statements involved cause the Court to conclude that the notice provided does not  fulfill the purpose of 404(b)'s notice requirement. The purpose of the 404(b) notice requirement is to reduce surprise  and promote early resolution of admissibility issues. United States v. Vega, 188 F.3d 1150, 11153 (9th Cir. 1999).  The defendants cannot raise an adequate 404(b) challenge [*6]  prior to trial without knowing more information  about which of the many phone calls and statements the Government considers extrinsic to the charges but  nonetheless admissible under 404(b). There can be no resolution of this notice issue until the Court knows what  evidence is considered extrinsic to the parties and more information is provided to narrow down which calls and  statements could have 404(b) issues. The Court recognizes that many of the phone calls and statements could very likely be intrinsic to the case,  especially given the date ranges in the conspiracy charges and the broad nature of those conspiracy charges. If the  Government considers all the calls and statements part of the intrinsic evidence in this case, then it need not  provide further notice, but the defendants may raise objections at trial to any evidence it feels should have been  more specifically noticed as extrinsic 404(b) evidence, which could delay trial and result in unexpected exclusions of  evidence. Some time has passed since the filing of this motion. The defense may be more familiar with the discovery at this  time, including the phone calls. If there is a specific issue regarding the admissibility of [*7]  any phone calls, the  defense should raise it before trial in order to avoid any unnecessary delay.",1
"United States v. Gil, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217887","[*1] Jason M. Frierson, United States Attorney and  Thomas W. Flynn, Trial Attorney, Tax  Division, as counsel for the United States of America,  and George P. Kelesis and Sunethra Muralidhara, as counsel for the defendant, Raul Gil, hereby stipulate  that the Plea Agreement for Defendant Raul Gil Pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(A) and (B) [ECF 7]  (""Plea Agreement"") filed in the above-entitled action on August 2, 2022, be amended to incorporate an  amendment to the federal sentencing guidelines that became effective November 1, 2023 and which will  be in effect at the time set for sentencing in this matter. This Stipulation is entered into for the following reasons:  1. On August 2, 2022 Defendant Raul Gil appeared  before the court and entered a plea  of guilty to a single count of tax evasion pursuant to 26  U.S.C. § 7201 as more fully set forth in the Criminal Information filed that same date [ECF 5] and  the contemporaneously filed Plea Agreement [ECF 7]. 2. The Plea Agreement including a number of stipulated  sentencing factors for the   court's consideration, including an acknowledgment  that ""[t]he District Court will determine   defendant's  criminal  history  category  under  the  sentencing guidelines.""  3. In April 2023, the U.S. Sentencing Commission [*2]   promulgated amendments,  including Amendment 821 to the federal sentencing  guidelines, which became effective November 1, 2023. 4. Part B of Amendment 821 creates a new section to  the guideline manual which  reads in pertinent part:  §4C1.1. Adjustment for Certain Zero-Point Offenders (a)Adjustment.- If the defendant meets all of the  following criteria: (1) the defendant did not receive any criminal history  Page 2 of 4 points from Chapter Four, Part A; (2) the defendant did not receive an adjustment under  §3A1.4 (Terrorism); (3) the defendant did not use violence or credible  threats of violence in connection with the offense; (4) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily  injury; (5) the instant offense of conviction is not a sex offense; (6) the defendant did not personally cause substantial  financial hardship; (7) the defendant did not possess, receive, purchase,  transport, transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of a firearm or other dangerous  weapon (or induce another participant to do so) in connection with the offense; (8) the instant offense of conviction is not covered by  §2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights); (9) the defendant did not receive an adjustment under  §3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable  Victim)  or  §3A1.5  (Serious  Human  Rights [*3]  Offense); and (10) the defendant did not receive an adjustment under  §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise, as  defined in 21 U.S.C. § 848; decrease the offense level determined under Chapters  Two and Three by 2 levels. 4. Defendant Gil has no prior criminal history and meets  all criteria for application of  the  2-level  adjustment  under  the  foregoing  recommended amendment.  5. Accordingly, the parties stipulate that Section VII  (Sentencing Factors), paragraphs  15 and 16, and Section VIII (Positions Regarding  Sentencing), paragraph 18, be amended to incorporate the provisions of the Amendment 821 to the Guidelines  Manual that will be effective at the time of sentencing as follows: VII. SENTENCING FACTORS   * * *  15. Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility: Under  USSG § 3E1.1(a), the United   States will recommend that defendant receive a two- level downward adjustment for   acceptance of responsibility unless defendant (a) fails  to truthfully admit facts  establishing a factual basis for the guilty plea when  defendant enters the plea; (b) fails  to truthfully admit facts establishing the amount of  restitution owed when defendant   enters the guilty plea; (c) provides false or misleading  information to [*4]  the United  States, the Court, Pretrial Services, or the Probation  Office; (d) denies involvement  in the offense or provides conflicting statements  regarding defendant's involvement   or falsely denies or frivolously contests conduct  relevant to the offense; (e) attempts  to withdraw defendant's guilty plea; (f) commits or  attempts to commit any crime;  (g) fails to appear in court; or (h) violates the conditions  of pretrial release.  Under USSG § 3E1.1(b), if the District Court determines  that defendant's total  offense level before operation of § 3E1.1(a) is 16 or  Page 3 of 4 higher, and if the United States   recommends  a  two-level  downward  adjustment  pursuant to the preceding paragraph,   the United States will move for an additional one-level  downward adjustment for  acceptance of responsibility before sentencing because  defendant communicated  defendant's decision to plead guilty in a timely manner  that enabled the United States   to avoid preparing for trial and to efficiently allocate its  resources. The United States  anticipates recommending a three-level reduction  pursuant to USSG §§3E1.1(a) and  (b).  16. Criminal History Category. Defendant acknowledges  that the District  Court may base defendant's sentence in part on  defendant's criminal [*5]  record or   criminal history. Assuming that Defendant has zero  points for his criminal history  category and is a ""zero-point offender"" under the criteria  established by section  §4C1.1. in Amendment 821, the total applicable offense  level in this matter is 21. A   total offense level of 21 results in a guideline range of  37-46 months.  VIII. POSITIONS REGARDING SENTENCING  18. The parties will jointly recommend that the District  Court impose a sentence   of 37 months' imprisonment. The parties agree that a  sentence of 37 months is  sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with  the purposes of 18 U.S.C. §  3553. The parties also agree that a term of supervised  release of three years is   appropriate, and that given the amount of mandatory  restitution to be paid by  Defendant, a fine is not necessary.  The parties acknowledge and agree that all other terms,  conditions, obligations, rights and  responsibilities set forth in the August 2, 2022 Plea  Agreement [ECF 7] shall remain in effect.   The parties represent this stipulation is made in good  faith for the purpose of promoting the   ends of justice.   DATED this 6th day of December 2023.  COOK & KELESIS, LTD.

"United States v. Woods, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150676","Page 2 of 4   MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER GRANTING GOVERNMENT'S MOTION IN LIMINE TO PROHIBIT  DISCUSSION OF POSSIBLE PENALTIES THIS MATTER comes before the Court upon the Government's Motion in Limine seeking an Order prohibiting  Defendant Woods, his counsel, and/or any witnesses from asking any question, introducing any evidence or [*2]   making any statement or argument that directly or indirectly, implicates Defendant's potential sentence of the time  he has already spent incarcerated (""possible-penalties evidence"") while the jury is present. The motion was filed on  June 1, 2020 (Doc. 419). Having reviewed the parties' briefing and the applicable law, the Court finds that the  motion is well-taken and, therefore, is granted. Defendant, however, shall be permitted limited inquiry on cross- examination regarding Ms. Galloway's plea agreement, as described below. BACKGROUND The Government contends that providing jurors with possible-penalties evidence would distract and confuse the  jury. See Shannon v. United States, 512 U.S. 573, 579, 114 S. Ct. 2419, 129 L. Ed. 2d 459 (1994) (providing jurors  sentencing information ""invites them to ponder matters that are not within their province, distracts them from their  fact-finding responsibilities, and creates a strong possibility of confusion""). The Government also argues that  allowing possible-penalties evidence would both unfairly prejudice the United States and invite error by injecting  irrelevant, confusing, and potentially inflammatory evidence into the jury's consideration: The authorities are unequivocal in holding that presenting information to the jury about [*3]  possible  sentencing is prejudicial. Breach of this standard has often been grounds for reversal. A jury is obligated to  reach its verdict without regard to what sentence might be imposed"") (internal quotations omitted) (citing, inter  alia, Rogers v. United States, 422 U.S. 35, 40, 95 S. Ct. 2091, 45 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1975). See United States v. Greer, 620 F.2d 1383, 1385 (10th Cir. 1980). Defendant, however, assures the Court that he has ""no desire"" to present evidence of his own sentencing exposure  to the jury, acknowledging that doing so could potentially cause the jury to return a ""nullifying"" verdict of acquittal if it  perceived the sentencing potential as unjust. Rather, Defendant wishes to explore, during cross-examination of co- defendant Danielle Galloway, the deal she struck with the Government that involved the dropping of five charged  counts and her guilty plea to conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. §371. Defendant contends that not being permitted to  cross-examine Ms. Galloway for possible bias or motivation deprives him of his right to cross-examine under the  Confrontation Clause. See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 678, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986)  ('the exposure of a witness' motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally  protected right of cross-examination""). DISCUSSION As the Supreme Court has recognized, there is simply no reason to allow possible-penalties evidence before [*4]   the jury. See Shannon v. United States, 512 U.S. 573, 579, 114 S. Ct. 2419, 129 L. Ed. 2d 459 (1994) (""The jury's  function is to find the facts and to decide whether, on those facts, the defendant is guilty of the crime charged."").  The Tenth Circuit has adopted a bright-line rule that ""[u]nless a statute specifically requires jury participation in  determining punishment, the jury shall not be informed of the possible penalties."" United States v. Parrish, 925 F.2d       Page 3 of 4   1293, 1299 (10th Cir. 1991), abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Wacker, 72 F.3d 1453 (10th Cir.  1995). The statute at issue here, regarding sex trafficking, does not require jury participation in punishment  determinations. See 18 U.S.C. § 1591. Defendant offers no case precedent that would convince this Court that defense counsel should be allowed to  question Ms. Galloway on the particulars of her plea agreement with the Government. Instead, Defendant points out  that there is a ""circuit split"" on the issue of whether defendants should be prohibited from asking cooperating  witnesses, and former co-conspirators, details about their sentences and sentencing agreements with the  government in order to expose the witnesses' bias. See United States v. Lanham, 617 F.3d 873, 884 (6th Cir. 2010)  (noting that the Sixth Circuit has not considered the issue in a published decision and comparing decisions from  courts addressing the issue). The Tenth Circuit has addressed the issue only [*5]  obliquely, following an appeal from a case before the  undersigned. In U.S. v. Mirabal, et al., this Court permitted defense counsel to cross-examine a co-conspirator  about his plea agreement with the Government and how he expected to benefit from a lighter sentence due to his  cooperation. 13-cr-01152 WJ-LF, Doc. 288, filed 11/23/15. Defendant was not allowed, however, to use the plea  agreement itself or inquire into how much the witness expected his sentence to drop because of his cooperation  with the Government. See also 13-cr-01152 Doc. 288 (Order Granting Gov't's First Mot. in Limine to Prohibit  Discussion of Applicable Penalties). On appeal, the defendant in Mirabal claimed that the Court's ruling violated his rights under the Confrontation  Clause. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals did not tackle the question head-on, but only ""assume[d] for the sake of  argument that the restriction violated the Confrontation Clause."" United States v. Mirabal, 876 F.3d 1029, 1035  (10th Cir. 2017). Even so, the court concluded that any error would be harmless: based on the strength of the  prosecution's case and defendant's ""extensive"" cross-examination of the witness, the jury would still have returned  a guilty verdict. Id. at 1036-37. Here as well, the Court takes no issue with allowing Mr. Woods' defense counsel [*6]  to cross-examine Ms.  Galloway about her plea agreement in a general sense, including her expectation of a lighter sentence because of  her cooperation. But inquiring into further details (such as asking how much her sentence dropped from what would  have been potential exposure) would permit Defendant to elicit evidence from which the jury could speculate, infer  or even deduce the possible penalties for the offenses with which Defendant is charged, should he be found guilty.  Also, since Ms. Galloway was charged differently from Mr. Woods, any attempt by the jury to speculate would lead  to juror confusion. The jury would require a crash course in federal sentencing to even begin to understand the  issues—which would lead to even more confusion. Cross-examination of Ms. Galloway is still available to Mr. Woods. He can delve into the plea agreement in  sufficient detail to draw out any evidence of Ms. Galloway's bias or motivation without trying to sidestep the Tenth  Circuit's prohibition against informing the jury of possible penalties, whether it is done directly as to Defendant's  charges, or indirectly through a co-defendant's plea deal. See United States v. Courtney, 816 F.3d 681, 686 (10th  Cir. 2016) (when jury has no sentencing function, it ""should [*7]  reach its verdict without regard to what sentence  might be imposed) (citing Rogers v. United States, 422 U.S. 35, 40, 95 S. Ct. 2091, 45 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1975)  (emphasis added). Defendant suggests that one resolution to the issue would be a stipulation from the Government to an ""adequately  weighty statement of the benefits that Ms. Galloway stands to receive from cooperating"" as it would eliminate the  need for an in-depth cross-examination. Doc. 430 at 3. Defendant also would ""welcome the opportunity"" to have the       Page 4 of 4   Court ""lay out the metes and bounds"" of permissible cross-examination for the same reason. The Court will not be  taking up Defendant's suggestion that it design a permissible cross-examination for defense counsel, other than  what the Court has already described. Additionally, the Court will not require any stipulation by the Government of  the sort Defendant is recommending, as both parties likely have different ideas of what an ""adequately weighty  statement"" might be, and the Court does not intend to become a referee for what could become an endless  exercise. The idea of a stipulation between parties is not foreclosed, however, if it can be achieved without Court  intervention.",1
"United States v. Thompson, 896 F.3d 155","[*158]  SL.C, Circuit Judge: Following a jury trial, Alvaun Thompson was convicted in 2015 on nine counts related to his prostitution of two  minor victims in New York City in 2013 and 2014. On appeal from the judgment entered in the Eastern District of  New York (Glasser, J.), Thompson challenges his convictions for violating 18 U.S.C. § 1591 (""Sex trafficking of  children or by force, fraud, or coercion"") and 18 U.S.C. § 2251 (""Sexual exploitation of children""). He argues that  section 1591 is unconstitutionally overbroad; that his indictment was deficient as to the section 1591 count, in that it  failed to allege that he knew one of his minor victims was younger than 14 years of age; and that, as to his  conviction under section 2251, the government failed to prove that venue was proper in the Eastern District of New  York. For the reasons set forth below, we reject these challenges. In relevant part, HN1[ ] section 1591 proscribes ""harbor[ing] . . . or maintain[ing]"" a person under the age of 18,  knowing that the person ""will be caused to engage [**3]  in a commercial sex act."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Thompson  premises his constitutional overbreadth challenge to the statute principally on the theory that charities and religious  organizations, as well as family members of minor prostitutes, could be prosecuted under section 1591 for providing  food, shelter, and other support to young persons engaged in prostitution.  [*159]  Such prosecutions, he argues,  would violate those entities' or individuals' First Amendment expressive associational and intimate associational  rights. We decide that, even assuming that the statute could reasonably be construed to permit such prosecutions  as he hypothesizes, Thompson has demonstrated neither that section 1591 substantially burdens First Amendment  rights in an ""absolute sense,"" United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 292, 128 S. Ct. 1830, 170 L. Ed. 2d 650  (2008), nor that it substantially burdens First Amendment rights relative to its broad legitimate sweep. Thompson also fails to persuade us that, because the indictment did not allege that he knew that one minor victim  was under 14 years of age, his conviction under subsections (a) and (b)(1) of section 1591 must be reversed.  Rather, we conclude that HN2[ ] the statutory language requires that the defendant know or recklessly disregard  the fact that a minor was younger than 18 years old. It does not mandate, to support the increased punishment in  subsection (b), that the government [**4]  prove that a defendant knew or recklessly disregarded that a minor was  under the age of fourteen. Page 8 of 20   Finally, Thompson's venue challenge to his conviction under section 2251 after a jury trial in the Eastern District of  New York is also unavailing. As relevant here, HN3[ ] section 2251 criminalizes the production of child  pornography. Although Thompson physically produced the pornographic video at issue in the Southern District of  New York, the government presented ample evidence that elements of Thompson's criminal conduct—his  persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of the minor victim, leading her to engage in the sex acts  depicted in the video—occurred in the Eastern District. Based on this evidence, the jury was entitled to find that  venue for prosecution lay in the Eastern District of New York. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court. BACKGROUND HN4[ ] Because Thompson appeals from a judgment of conviction entered after a jury trial, we ""draw the facts  from the evidence presented at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the government."" United States v. Allen,  864 F.3d 63, 69 n.8 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thompson began his relationship with the two minor female victims of concern here—identified as M1 and M2—in  early 2013, [**5]  when he was twenty-six years old and they were thirteen and fifteen years old, respectively.  Thompson soon began directing the minors to engage in prostitution: he instructed them to offer their prostitution  services on the ""Penn Track""—a notorious area in Brooklyn's East New York neighborhood—and he advertised  their services as prostitutes on the now-defunct website www.backpage.com (""Backpage""). Thompson's Backpage  postings displayed the minors semi-nude and in sexually suggestive poses, and offered to sell the prostitution  services of each. On several occasions from March through November 2013, the girls were each arrested on the  Penn Track for prostitution. From those early 2013 encounters through the 2015 arrest of Thompson that led to the convictions he now appeals,  Thompson employed a variety of methods to gain and maintain control over the girls. He shared an address in  Brooklyn with them for at least some of the time during which he sold their prostitution services, and he exercised  stringent control over the girls' finances. He professed affection for them and, at the same time, threatened  [*160]   them with violence and cursed at them. Thompson personally tattooed his alias—""LP""—under [**6]  M2's eye, and  M1 had his first name tattooed on her breast. The record contains numerous transcripts and recordings of  conversations between Thompson and each of the teenagers that depict this controlling and manipulative  relationship. These interactions reflect the girls' conviction that they were engaging in prostitution out of a devotion  to him. The control that Thompson exercised over the girls was powerful. In September 2013, Thompson was arrested for  a robbery that had occurred a month earlier and was incarcerated on Rikers Island from then until July 2014, when,  after being convicted of petit larceny and sentenced to time served, he was released. Nonetheless, from his first  day on Rikers Island until the end of his confinement there eleven months later, he continued to manage and  prostitute the girls, directing their activities through phone calls to his confederates and to the girls themselves.  Even from the remove of that jail, he was able to dictate where the girls would live, what rooms they would rent for  their prostitution activities, and what prostitution services they would offer to customers. He also continued to  collect his portion of the proceeds of their [**7]  prostitution, successfully demanding that the girls place his  claimed share in his commissary account at the jail. His threats, harassment, and emotional abuse of the girls also  persisted during this period.      Page 9 of 20   In July 2014, soon after his release from jail, Thompson rejoined M1 and M2. Over the next six months, he posted  dozens of advertisements for their prostitution services on Backpage. Thompson also transported M1 and M2 to  Maryland and Pennsylvania, advertising their services in those states. During this time, he sent the girls semi-nude  photos of each other and of other prostitutes who were working for him. In December 2014, following a vice-unit investigation that lasted eighteen months, New York City police officers  arrested Thompson in a Bronx motel, where they found him with M1 and M2. Although, notwithstanding their  lengthy investigation, they soon released Thompson, the officers seized his mobile phone in connection with the  arrest. On that phone, they found a video made earlier in December and later ascertained to have been made in the  Bronx of M1 performing oral sex on Thompson. In January 2015, the FBI arrested Thompson on the federal  charges that led to the convictions [**8]  he now contests. After a four-day trial in November 2015, a jury found Thompson guilty on nine counts. Eight counts were related to  his prostitution of the girls: three counts of sex trafficking of minors in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) and (b);  one count of promoting prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1952(a); two counts of illicitly transporting minors in  violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); and two counts of interstate prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422(a).   [*161]  The ninth count charged sexual exploitation of a child through the production of child pornography in  violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a). That charge was based on the video found on Thompson's phone at the time of his  arrest in December 2014. In preparation for sentencing and in response to the presentence report, the District Court conducted a hearing  under United States v. Fatico, 603 F.2d 1053 (2d Cir. 1979), and found by a preponderance of the evidence that  Thompson was responsible for a September 2013 murder related to a dispute with a rival over control of M2. Based  on this finding and the nine counts of conviction, the District Court calculated the applicable Guidelines range to be  life imprisonment. The court sentenced Thompson, then age 29, principally to thirty years' imprisonment. Thompson timely appealed. DISCUSSION As noted above, Thompson raises three [**9]  challenges to his convictions. He argues, first, that section 1591  (outlawing certain acts in connection with sex trafficking) is unconstitutionally overbroad; second, that section  1591(a) and (b)(1) must be construed to contain an additional mens rea element (knowledge not only that the victim  was a minor, but also that he or she was under fourteen years of age) and the government erred in not so charging;  and third, that the government failed to prove, for the video-related charge under section 2251(a), that venue for his  prosecution properly lay in the Eastern District of New York. We address each argument in turn. I. Overbreadth challenge          Page 10 of 20   Thompson first contends that section 1591 violates the First Amendment because it is facially overbroad, therefore  requiring reversal of his convictions under that statute. HN5[ ] We review de novo a district court's analysis of an  overbreadth challenge. United States v. Farhane, 634 F.3d 127, 134 (2d Cir. 2011). When Thompson was convicted of violating section 1591, the statute provided in relevant part: Whoever knowingly— (1) . . . recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains, or maintains by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture which has engaged  in an act described in violation of paragraph (1), knowing, or in reckless [**10]  disregard of the fact, . . . that the person has not attained the age of 18 years  and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished . . . . 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) (2014) (emphasis added).  [*162]  Two different types of improper prosecution could occur under this statute, according to Thompson, and  each of these would violate the relevant defendant's First Amendment associational rights. First, he urges that  under a plain reading of this statute, and particularly in view of its use of the phrase ""maintains by any means,""  prosecutors could charge charities and religious organizations for providing assistance to child prostitutes.  Punishing these entities and those who work for them for providing such assistance, Thompson suggests, interferes  unlawfully with the entities' expressive associational rights. Second, Thompson argues that family members of  minors engaging in commercial sex are vulnerable to prosecution under the statute if they provide care for those  minors, and that the exposure intrudes unlawfully on the family members' intimate associational rights. According to  Thompson, these First Amendment intrusions are so substantial that the minor victim trafficking provision must be  struck down as unconstitutionally [**11]  overbroad. The District Court rejected Thompson's overbreadth challenges, concluding that the intrusive prosecutions posited  by Thompson were ""absurd[ ]"" and ""unrealistic"" in light of the statute's text and legislative history. United States v.  Thompson, 141 F. Supp. 3d 188, 199-200 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). After concluding that  Thompson's reading of the statute was ""not persuasive"" and ""incompatible with its purpose,"" id. at 199, the court did  not go on to compare the statute's legitimate sweep with the substantiality of any burden it imposes on  constitutional rights, as later steps in the overbreadth analysis require. Because of the broad language of the statute  and the complexity of the social problem that it addresses, we believe that Thompson's arguments merit more  extensive analysis before they can fairly be adjudicated.                Page 11 of 20   HN6[ ] Premised on a concern that ""enforcement of an overbroad law may deter or 'chill' constitutionally protected  [First Amendment activity],"" Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U.S. 113, 119, 123 S. Ct. 2191, 156 L. Ed. 2d 148 (2003),  overbreadth challenges present ""an exception to the general rule against third-party standing,"" Farrell v. Burke, 449  F.3d 470, 498 (2d Cir. 2006). Thus, a defendant making such a  [*163]  challenge ""claims that[,] although a statute  did not violate his or her [own] First Amendment rights, it would violate the First Amendment rights of hypothetical  third parties [**12]  if applied to them."" Farrell, 449 F.3d at 498. All overbreadth challenges are therefore facial  challenges. Id. Because ""invalidat[ing] all enforcement of a challenged law . . . is 'strong medicine,'"" Farhane, 634  F.3d at 136-37 (emphasis in original) (quoting United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 292, 128 S. Ct. 1830, 170 L.  Ed. 2d 650 (2008)), the challenging party ""must demonstrate from the text of [the law] and from actual fact that a  substantial number of instances exist in which the [l]aw cannot be applied constitutionally,"" N.Y. State Club Ass'n,  Inc. v. City of New York, 487 U.S. 1, 14, 108 S. Ct. 2225, 101 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1988). Moreover, to be struck as  overbroad, the statute must be overbroad ""not only in an absolute sense, but also relative to the statute's plainly  legitimate sweep."" Williams, 553 U.S. at 292. Notably, HN7[ ] overbreadth doctrine has developed primarily in the context of laws that include within their ambit  a substantial amount of speech protected by the First Amendment. See, e.g., Williams, 553 U.S. at 292 (""According  to our First Amendment overbreadth doctrine, a statute is facially invalid if it prohibits a substantial amount of  protected speech."" (emphasis added)); Hicks, 539 U.S. at 124 (""Rarely, if ever, will an overbreadth challenge  succeed against a law or regulation that is not specifically addressed to speech or to conduct necessarily  associated with speech (such as picketing or demonstrating).""). Less common are cases in which a litigant argues  that a statute is unconstitutionally overbroad [**13]  because it interferes with associational activity, expressive or  intimate, that is protected by the First Amendment. Cases falling into this latter category—like this one—do,  however, arise. See, e.g., N.Y. State Club Ass'n, 487 U.S. at 14-15; Sanitation & Recycling Indus., Inc. v. City of  New York, 107 F.3d 985, 995-98 (2d Cir. 1997); see also URI Student Senate v. Town of Narragansett, 631 F.3d 1,  11-13 (1st Cir. 2011). As set forth below, we ultimately agree with the District Court, and the other courts within our Circuit to consider the  question, that the specter of unconstitutionality that Thompson sketches is largely illusory. HN8[ ] As applied to  charitable and religious organizations, we conclude that section 1591 applies to these organizations' non- expressive conduct and thus does not in the end implicate their First Amendment right to expressive association.  And even assuming that section 1591 could be interpreted and enforced as broadly as Thompson suggests as to  families, he has failed to demonstrate that any burden on family members' intimate associational rights is  substantial either in an absolute sense or relative to the plainly legitimate sweep of section 1591. We therefore  reject Thompson's overbreadth challenge to section 1591. A. Expressive associational rights: charitable and religious organizations First, in our view, the expressive associational rights of the types of organizations  [*164]  to which Thompson refers  are simply not implicated by the statute. [**14]             Page 12 of 20   The Supreme Court has ""long understood as HN10[ ] implicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the  First Amendment a corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social,  economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends."" Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 622 (1984). This  derivative right is the right to engage in expressive [**15]  association. See Sanitation & Recycling Indus., Inc., 107  F.3d at 996. When, on the other hand, an individual engages in conduct that does not manifest an ""intent to convey  a particularized message,"" the First Amendment does not come ""into play."" Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404,  109 S. Ct. 2533, 105 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because ""[i]t is possible to find some  kernel of expression in almost every activity a person undertakes—for example, walking down the street or meeting  one's friends at a shopping mall""—the fact that an activity contains a ""kernel of expression"" does not compel the  conclusion that the activity qualifies as a form of ""expressive association"" and is shielded by the First Amendment.  City of Dallas v. Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 25, 109 S. Ct. 1591, 104 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1989). Thompson argues that limiting the activities (such as providing support services to young trafficking victims) in  which charitable and religious groups may engage ""is plainly a substantial 'intrusion into the internal structure or  affairs of [the] association.'"" Appellant's Br. at 11 (alteration in original) (quoting Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530  U.S. 640, 648, 120 S. Ct. 2446, 147 L. Ed. 2d 554 (2000)). In support of his position that section 1591 could be  used to infringe on these organizations' associational rights, Thompson places great weight on Boy Scouts of  America v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640 (2000), in which the Supreme Court found to be overbroad a law requiring a  nonprofit organization, the Boy Scouts, to admit as a member someone whose membership, [**16]  in the  organization's view, undermined its core tenets. Id. at 656-61. But Dale is inapt. Even under Thompson's broad reading of the statute, HN11[ ] section 1591(a) does not require  any organization to admit as members individuals like the minor victims (the issue in Dale), prohibit it from doing so,  or prevent such a group from advocating on behalf of minor victims. Cf. Johanns v. Livestock Mktg.  [*165]  Ass'n,  544 U.S. 550, 568, 125 S. Ct. 2055, 161 L. Ed. 2d 896 (2005) (describing expressive associational rights as  ""prohibit[ing] the government from coercively associating individuals or groups with unwanted messages"" (citing  Dale, 530 U.S. at 653, and Hurley v. Irish-Am. Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Grp. of Boston, Inc., 515 U.S. 557, 576-77,  115 S. Ct. 2338, 132 L. Ed. 2d 487 (1995))). HN12[ ] To the extent that the minor victim trafficking provision restricts the activities of charitable or religious  groups, it places limits on the non-expressive conduct in which they may engage, rather than on their right to  associate for the purpose of expressing their views. See Appellant's Br. at 13 (expressing concern that statute  makes criminals of documentary ""filmmakers who buy meals for the minors they follow"" and ""journalists and social  scientists who compensate trafficked minors for interviews""). Whether section 1591 restricts the universe of  activities these organizations may pursue—and whether section 1591 might incidentally curb their ability to help  minors involved in the sex trade to find food and shelter—they [**17]  have no First Amendment right to engage in  much of the conduct Thompson references. See Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 706-07, 106 S. Ct.                Page 13 of 20   3172, 92 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1986) (identifying only those laws targeting ""conduct with a significant expressive element""  and ""statute[s] based on a non-expressive activity that ha[ve] the inevitable effect of singling out those engaged in  expressive activity"" as triggering ""'least restrictive means' scrutiny""); Young v. New York City Transit Auth., 903 F.2d  146, 154 (2d Cir. 1990) (""Speech simply is not inherent to the act; it is not the essence of the conduct.""). Thompson paints with far too broad a brush when he implies that an organization's activities of this sort would be  protected by the First Amendment simply because the organization earnestly believes those activities are  important. HN13[ ] Insofar as the statute, read literally, might be cited as prohibiting an organization from  providing certain types of direct support services to minor prostitutes, it does not present a First Amendment  problem. Cf. Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 40, 130 S. Ct. 2705, 177 L. Ed. 2d  [*166]  355 (2010)  (rejecting First Amendment challenge to statute ""prohibit[ing] certain forms of speech that constitute material  support"" to terrorist groups); Agency for Int'l Dev. v. All. for Open Soc'y Int'l, Inc., 570 U.S. 205, 218, 133 S. Ct.  2321, 186 L. Ed. 2d 398 (2013) (concluding that federal funding condition that ""demand[ed] that funding recipients  adopt—as their own—the Government's view on an issue of public concern"" violated First Amendment). Thompson also mentions that some [**18]  of the organizations he identifies are religious and thus, he briefly  suggests, their activities are entitled to ""special solicitude."" See Appellant's Br. at 12 (quoting Hosanna-Tabor  Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. E.E.O.C., 565 U.S. 171, 189, 132 S. Ct. 694, 181 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2012));  Appellant's Reply Br. at 10-11 (same). Thompson overstates the significance of Hosanna-Tabor, the single case he  cites in support of this proposition. In Hosanna-Tabor, the Supreme Court held only that the ""ministerial exception""  doctrine ""protects religious employers from employment discrimination lawsuits brought by their ministers."" Penn v.  N.Y. Methodist Hosp., 884 F.3d 416, 418 (2d Cir. 2018). The Court in Hosanna-Tabor expressly distinguished  ""government regulation of only outward physical acts""—which it found to be permissible—from impermissible  ""government interference with an internal church decision that affects the faith and mission of the church itself."" 565  U.S. at 190 (distinguishing Emp't Div., Dep't of Human Res. of Or. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S. Ct. 1595, 108 L.  Ed. 2d 876 (1990)). We have little difficulty in concluding that the proscriptions imposed by section 1591 fall within  the former, permissible category. In sum, therefore, HN14[ ] section 1591 does not impose a substantial burden on the expressive associational  rights of charitable and religious organizations because it affects, if anything, those organizations' non-expressive  conduct only. B. Intimate associational rights: minor victims' family [**19]  members Second, Thompson fails to persuade us that the statute substantially infringes families' intimate associational  rights. In Roberts v. United States Jaycees, HN15[ ] the Supreme Court recognized a right to intimate               Page 14 of 20   association that allows individuals to ""enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships [without] undue  intrusion by the State."" 468 U.S. at 617-18. The Court identified ""[t]he personal affiliations that exemplify these  considerations"" as including ""those that attend the creation and sustenance of a family—marriage, childbirth, the  raising and education of children, and cohabitation with one's relatives."" Id. at 619-20 (citations omitted). The  Jaycees decision likely permits (or  [*167]  even compels) recognition, we think, of a right to intimate association  between, for example, a parent and his or her minor child who is engaged in prostitution. See id. This is the right  upon which the minor victim trafficking provision unconstitutionally intrudes, according to Thompson. Ordinarily, HN16[ ] the first step in an overbreadth analysis is to ""construe the challenged statute."" Williams, 553  U.S. at 293; see also id. (""[I]t is impossible to determine whether a statute reaches too far without first knowing what  the statute covers.""). [**20]  Although the statutory language at issue here is decidedly broad, we share the District  Court's skepticism about the interpretations Thompson offers to illustrate his argument. We need not determine,  however, whether the minor victim trafficking provision can reasonably be read to permit the prosecutions  Thompson envisions, because, even assuming that it may, Thompson has failed to demonstrate that individuals'  intimate associational rights are substantially burdened in relation to the plainly legitimate sweep of the statute. See  Farhane, 634 F.3d at 136 (noting that HN17[ ] Supreme Court ""rigorously enforces the burden on the challenging  party""). HN18[ ] The statute's legitimate sweep is apparent: it allows conviction of individuals like Thompson, who has  forced minors into prostitution and maintained them through varied means. In enacting the Victims of Trafficking  and Violence Protection Act of 2000, in which section 1591(a) first appeared, Congress sought to allow prosecution  of those responsible for trafficking in the United States and made specific findings about the extent of this scourge  at the time of the bill's enactment. See Pub L. No. 106-386, § 102(b)(1), 114 Stat. 1464, 1466,, codified at 22  U.S.C. § 7101(b)(1) (finding at least ""700,000 persons annually, primarily women and children,"" trafficked [**21]   worldwide, and ""[a]pproximately 50,000 women and children . . . trafficked into the United States each year"").  Thompson offers no evidence suggesting that child prostitution, or sex trafficking generally, has diminished in the  past eighteen years, and the opposite seems more likely, see, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Justice, The National Strategy for  Child  Exploitation  Prevention  and  Interdiction:  A  Report  to  Congress  78  (Apr.  2016),  https://www.justice.gov/psc/file/842411/download (""While the total number of children exploited through sex  trafficking in the United States is immeasurable, the number of child victims reported missing, identified, and  recovered in on-going sex trafficking investigations continues to increase.""). Absent from the record, on the other hand, is evidence showing circumstances that would justify a substantial  number of prosecutions under Thompson's proposed reading of the statute that might infringe the rights to intimate  association of minor prostitutes' family members. As Congress observed in connection with the Act's passage,  many minors engaging in prostitution have been purposefully removed from, or themselves have taken leave of,  the [**22]  support structure of their families, making  [*168]  the unlawful provision of sustenance by their families,  while possible, unlikely in fact. See Pub. L. No. 106-386, § 102(b)(5), 114 Stat. at 1466 (""Traffickers often transport  victims from their home communities to unfamiliar destinations, including foreign countries away from family and             Page 15 of 20   friends, religious institutions, and other sources of protection and support, leaving the victims defenseless and  vulnerable.""). Further, even were we to assume that many minors engaging in prostitution have available to them supportive  family members with whom they often interact, the record provides no basis to expect that these family members  would have the mens rea required to support conviction under Thompson's construction of section 1591: for the  government to obtain a conviction, the family member would need to be providing support ""knowing, or in reckless  disregard of the fact, that"" the minor will, at a later time, ""be caused to engage in a commercial sex act."" 18 U.S.C.  § 1591(a) (2014). The record Thompson has made on this point is hardly well developed or compelling. Thompson has thus failed to ""demonstrate from the text of [the law] and from actual fact that a substantial number  of instances exist in which the [l]aw cannot be applied constitutionally."" N.Y. State Club Ass'n, Inc., 487 U.S. at 14.  Although declaring the entire statute unconstitutionally overbroad would be improper in this case and on this record,  we note again that if an arguably unlawful prosecution, in one of the unlikely scenarios Thompson identifies, were  ever pursued, it ""could of course be the subject of an as-applied challenge."" Williams, 553 U.S. at 302. For these  reasons, we reject Thompson's overbreadth challenge to the minor victim trafficking provision. II. Adequacy of the indictment Thompson next argues for reversal of his conviction under section 1591(a) and (b)(1) for sex trafficking of a child  under the age of fourteen, contending that the indictment failed to allege that he knew M1 was under age 14, a  mens rea element that he claims was required to support conviction. The District Court rejected this contention. See  Thompson, 141 F. Supp. 3d at 200-01. HN19[ ] We review that conclusion de novo. United States v. Daugerdas,  837 F.3d 212, 225 (2d Cir. 2016). As relevant here, HN20[ ] section 1591(a)—set forth more fully above, see supra Discussion Part I—establishes  criminal liability for a person who ""knowingly . . . recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, [**24]  obtains, or  maintains by any means a person"" (the first mens rea requirement) ""knowing, or in reckless disregard of the fact . . .  that the person has not attained the age of  [*169]  18 years"" (the second mens rea requirement) ""and will be  caused to engage in a commercial sex act"" (the third mens rea requirement). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) (2014). Section  1591(b), in turn, prescribes the ""punishment[s] for an offense under subsection (a),"" increasing the penalty for  cases in which the minor victim was especially young. That penalty is: (1) if the offense was effected by means of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion . . . , or by any  combination of such means, or if the person recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, or obtained  had not attained the age of 14 years at the time of such offense, by a fine under this title and imprisonment for  any term of years not less than 15 or for life; or (2) if the offense was not so effected, and the person recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, or  obtained had attained the age of 14 years but had not attained the age of 18 years at the time of such offense,  by a fine under this title and imprisonment for not less than 10 years or for life.           Page 16 of 20   Id. § 1591(b) (emphases added). Count One of [**25]  the indictment charged a violation of section 1591(a) and (b)(1). It alleged three mens rea  elements: first, that Thompson ""did knowingly and intentionally recruit, entice, harbor, transport, provide, obtain and  maintain by any means"" a minor victim, M1 (the first section 1591(a) mens rea element); second, that he ""engaged  in such acts, knowing, and in reckless disregard of the fact, that [M1] had not attained the age of 18 years"" (the  second section 1591(a) mens rea element); and third, that he ""engaged in such acts, knowing, and in reckless  disregard of the fact, that [M1] . . . would be caused to engage in one or more commercial sex acts"" (the third  section 1591(a) mens rea element). Appellant's App. at 18-19. It further alleged, with reference to section  1591(b)(1), that M1 ""had not yet attained the age of 14 years,"" but did not allege any mental state as to that fact.  Appellant's App. at 18. Thompson argues that imposition of the enhanced penalty established by section 1591(b)(1) requires proof that the  defendant knew not only that the victim was under 18 years of age, as required for conviction under section  1591(a), but also that the defendant knew or recklessly disregarded that the minor victim was under fourteen years  of age. We are not persuaded. HN21[ ] Read literally, the statute defining the crime, section 1591(a), contains a single mens rea requirement  regarding the age of the victim: ""know[ledge], or . . . reckless disregard of the fact . . . that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years."" The text demands no additional mens rea to support the increased punishment  imposed  [*170]  in section 1591(b)(1) for ""an offense under subsection (a)"" concerning a victim under age 14.  The [**27]  indictment in this case alleged that one of the two minor victims was in fact under the age of 14 and that  Thompson knew she was under 18; by the literal language of the statute, this charge is sufficient. See United States  v. Bout, 731 F.3d 233, 240 (2d Cir. 2013) (""[W]e have consistently upheld indictments that do little more than to  track the language of the statute charged . . . ."" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Thompson observes that courts have on occasion engrafted additional mens rea requirements onto a criminal  statute notwithstanding congressional silence and urges us to do so here. By way of illustration, he correctly cites  several cases in which we and the Supreme Court have applied mens rea requirements that appear in one part of a  criminal statute to other elements of the offense of conviction. But the circumstances present in those cases are not  here. For example, in Flores-Figueroa v. United States, 556 U.S. 646, 129 S. Ct. 1886, 173 L. Ed. 2d 853 (2009),  the Supreme Court considered a statute imposing a mandatory minimum sentence if ""the offender 'knowingly  transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person.'"" 556 U.S. at 647  (emphasis omitted) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1)). It construed the statute to contain a broad mens rea  requirement, explaining that ""it seems natural to read the [**28]  statute's word 'knowingly' as applying to all the  subsequently listed elements of the crime."" Id. at 650 (emphasis added). We cannot say the same, however, of  section 1591: unlike 18 U.S.C. § 1028A, section 1591 separates into different subdivisions the mens rea  requirement Thompson seeks to impose and the increased penalty based on the victim's age. HN22[ ] Although courts are generally ""reluctan[t] to simply follow the most grammatical reading of the statute""  where general principles of Anglo-American criminal law would suggest that a mens rea requirement ought to            Page 17 of 20   attach to certain elements of a crime, United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 70, 115 S. Ct. 464, 130  L. Ed. 2d 372 (1994) (discussing Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 255, 72 S. Ct. 240, 96 L. Ed. 288  (1952)), there is no common law tradition that crimes involving sexual offenses against minors invariably require a  specific mental state with respect to the victim's age. Indeed, in United States v. Robinson, 702 F.3d 22 (2d Cir.  2012), we rejected a defendant's challenge to jury instructions which, in his view, did not correctly articulate the  requirements for conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(c). See 702 F.3d at 30-34. We discussed in some detail our  approach to mens rea requirements in the definition of sex crimes involving children, as follows: We are mindful that HN23[ ] criminal statutes are generally construed to include mens rea requirements. But  that presumption does not apply to sex crimes against minors, at least when [**29]  the perpetrator confronts  the underage victim personally. Moreover, the presumption applies when someone engages in otherwise  innocent conduct, including constitutionally protected conduct, and thus has little purchase for [defendant], who  was engaged in sex trafficking. Id. at 32-33 (internal quotation marks, citations, and footnote omitted). Like the defendant in Robinson, Thompson  engaged in sex trafficking (and personally confronted his underage victims), and thus the presumption does not  apply. Nor would the absence of an additional mens rea requirement in the minor victim trafficking provision permit  prosecution of an  [*171]  individual who did not have ""knowledge of wrongdoing sufficient to support the finding of  mens rea ordinarily necessary to impose criminal responsibility on a defendant."" United States v. Bronx Reptiles,  Inc., 217 F.3d 82, 88 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding that defendant must act with knowledge of ""inhumane or unhealthful  conditions"" of animal importation to sustain conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 42(c)). Indeed, where, as here, the statute  concerns the exploitation of children, imposition of strict criminal liability with regard to the age of a victim is not out  of the ordinary, as we have observed elsewhere. See Robinson, 702 F.3d at 33 (""[F]ederal child-protective statutes  . . . have been [**30]  interpreted to lack [ ] mens rea requirements with respect to [the victim's] age."" (alterations in  original) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Because it alleged the mens rea necessary for conviction under section 1591(a) and (b)(1), the indictment  adequately charged a violation of those provisions. III. Venue Finally, Thompson contends that the government offered insufficient evidence to support the jury's determination  that venue properly lay in the Eastern District of New York for his trial on charges of sexual exploitation of a child  through the production of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a). Section 2251(a) provides in  relevant part: Any person who employs, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any minor to engage in, or who has a  minor assist any other person to engage in, . . . with the intent that such minor engage in, any sexually explicit  conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct or for the purpose of transmitting a  live visual depiction of such conduct, shall be punished . . . . 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a). HN24[ ] For each count of an indictment, the government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the  evidence that venue is proper. United States v. Tzolov, 642 F.3d 314, 318 (2d Cir. 2011). When a defendant  challenges the propriety of the trial [**31]  venue after conviction by a jury, however, we ""review the sufficiency of  the evidence as to venue in the light most favorable to the government,"" crediting ""every inference that could have  been drawn in its favor."" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). If ""the facts are not in dispute, venue challenges  raise questions of law, which we review de novo."" Id. HN25[ ] The Constitution requires that ""[t]he Trial of all Crimes . . . be held in the State where the said Crimes  shall have been committed . . . ."" U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 3. In Rule 18, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure  echo that directive: ""Unless a statute or these rules permit otherwise, the government must prosecute an offense in  a district where the offense was committed."" Congress has further effected the constitutional requirement by  Page 18 of 20   statute, permitting ""offense[s] . . . begun in one district and completed in another . . . [to] be inquired of and  prosecuted in any district in which such offense was begun, continued, or completed."" 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a).  Accordingly, we have instructed that ""[v]enue may lie in more than one place if the acts constituting the crime and  the nature of the crime charged implicate more than one location."" United States v. Lange, 834 F.3d 58, 68 (2d Cir.  2016) (internal quotation marks omitted); see [**32]  also United States v. Holcombe, 883 F.3d 12, 15 (2d Cir.  2018). In support of its prosecution of Thompson under section 2251(a), the government offered evidence that Thompson  filmed  [*172]  himself engaging in sex acts with the younger of the minor victims on December 14, 2014, in the  Bronx, a part of New York's Southern District, where venue of a prosecution based on those acts would plainly have  been proper. The government maintained, however, that venue for this prosecution properly lay also in the Eastern  District of New York, where Thompson was tried for the other crimes that we have described, related to the  prostitution of M1 and M2. The government argued to the jury that venue in the Eastern District was proper based  on evidence that at least part of the actus reus of the crime—the persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion  of the minor victim who appeared in the video—occurred in Brooklyn, within the Eastern District of New York. The  government responds to Thompson's challenge to venue on appeal by arguing that the jury reasonably could have  relied on Thompson's earlier enticement or inducement of M1 in the Eastern District to conclude that venue there  was proper. Thompson does not dispute that he violated section 2251(a) when, in the Southern District, he created [**33]  a  video of himself engaging in sexual acts with the younger of the minor victims. Nor does he contend that the jury  was incorrectly instructed as to venue. He argues, rather, that his conduct in the Eastern District related to his  prostitution of the victim and not to his later creation of the video that was the subject of the prosecution under  section 2251(a). Accordingly, he urges, no reasonable jury could find that venue in the Eastern District was proper  for the production crime. Thompson so urged the District Court, unsuccessfully, in a Rule 29 motion made at the  close of the government's evidence. Two other circuit courts have recently encountered similar facts and rejected similar arguments. In United States v.  Sullivan, 797 F.3d 623 (9th Cir. 2015), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 2408, 195 L. Ed. 2d 783 (2016), the government  presented evidence that, although the video at issue was produced in the Eastern District of California, the  defendant ""established and maintained physical and mental control over the relationship between himself and the  girl from the time she first entered his car . . . in the Northern District [of California], and [he] used this control to  coerce her into making a sex video."" 797 F.3d at 631 (internal quotation marks omitted). The defendant in Sullivan  maintained that this evidence did not [**34]  suffice to establish venue, arguing ""that his interactions with [the victim]  in the Northern District of California were merely preliminary, or were for the sole purpose of recruiting [her] to  become a prostitute, and therefore were not essential steps towards making the video."" Id. The Ninth Circuit  reasoned that ""the persuasion, inducement, enticement and coercion that led to the video's filming in [the Eastern  District of California] had their genesis in the Northern District,"" making venue in the district of the preceding  interactions lawful. Id. Similarly, in United States v. Engle, 676 F.3d 405 (4th Cir. 2012), the Fourth Circuit concluded that the government  presented sufficient evidence to support a jury's determination that venue lay in the district of prosecution despite  the absence of ""evidence that [the defendant] directly informed [his victim] from [the district in  [*173]  which he was  tried] of his intent or desire to videotape or photograph her engaging in sexually explicit conduct."" Id. at 418. In that  court's view, ""a jury could reasonably find by a preponderance of the evidence that [the defendant's] sexually  themed communications with [his victim] . . . were part of his effort to 'groom' her for [the] purpose [of making the  illicit [**35]  video], which is sufficient to establish enticement under § 2251(a)."" Id.    Page 19 of 20   We find the reasoning of these courts persuasive. Although the video in question here was created in the Southern  District of New York, the government offered evidence that, over a lengthy period—from early 2013 until December  2014, when the video was made—Thompson enticed and groomed M1 in the Eastern District of New York, training  this teenager to do his bidding. The grooming involved M1's prostitution in the Eastern District of New York at his  behest, and Thompson's sending lewd photographs of other minors to M1 while both he and M1 were in Brooklyn. And the jury heard ample evidence from which it could reasonably find—particularly given that it was required to  make the finding only by a preponderance of the evidence—that these actions had precisely the effect that  Thompson intended and the government described: namely, that they ""entice[d]"" or ""induce[d],"" 18 U.S.C. §  2251(a), M1 to participate in the sex acts recorded in the video. In line with this understanding, we note that the  government presented evidence showing that, just two months before he produced the video, M1 sent Thompson a  Facebook message that laid bare both Thompson's [**36]  power over her and her conflicted feelings towards him.  She wrote: ""I haven't stop thinkin. About u or the thought of touching you or the thought of putting dollars in ya  pocket u say I'm your number one b**** why I don't feel like it."" Government App. at 63. Thompson's manipulation  over the previous eighteen months rendered M1 (only fifteen years old at the time the video was produced)  susceptible to the request (or demand) that was to come. Thus, the jury could reasonably have determined Thompson enticed M1 in Brooklyn, and that his acts in the  Eastern District over the previous 20 months laid the groundwork for the video made in the Bronx, in the Southern  District. The jury could reasonably rely on this determination to conclude that the government established venue for  the crime. See Sullivan, 797 F.3d at 631; Engle, 676 F.3d at 418. Thompson resists this conclusion, contending that it relies on too sweeping a conception of ""enticement"" to support  venue. Our precedent, however, supports applying a broad definition of enticement in this context: that definition  would reasonably include Thompson's grooming of the minor victims to act as he desired with regard to many  matters over the months before he made the video. See United States v. Dorvee, 616 F.3d 174, 180 (2d Cir. 2010)  (concluding that photos were [**37]  ""intended to entice a minor"" because they ""were sent as part of a grooming  process"" (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. Brand, 467 F.3d 179, 203 (2d Cir. 2006) (""[The  defendant's] grooming behavior provide[s] additional evidence in support of the jury's finding that [he] attempted to  entice a minor.""). We thus have little trouble concluding that the jury could reasonably have found that Thompson's  activity with M1 in the Eastern District, before he created the video, ""persuade[d], induce[d], [or] entice[d],"" 18  U.S.C. § 2251(a), M1 to engage in the sexual conduct in the video for the purpose of creating that depiction, see  Engle, 676 F.3d at  [*174]  418 (citing Dorvee, 616 F.3d at 180; Brand, 467 F.3d at 203). Thompson cites principally to two cases in support of his contrary position. Both are readily distinguishable. First, in  United States v. Broxmeyer, 616 F.3d 120 (2d Cir. 2010), we reversed a defendant's conviction under section  2251(a) not for want of venue, but because the record contained no evidence that the defendant ""inspired"" the  production of the photos at issue. See 616 F.3d at 124-27 (""[W]hether [the photos at issue] were taken before or  after [Broxmeyer] solicited photos of her[ ]one can only guess.""). We face no such sequencing question here.  Second, Thompson points to United States v. Sirois, 87 F.3d 34 (2d Cir. 1996), in which we held that ""a jury [could]  find a violation of § 2251(a) so long as the evidence shows that illegal sexual activity [**38]  for the production of  visual depictions of that activity was one of the dominant motives for the interstate transportation of the minors, and  not merely an incident of the transportation."" 87 F.3d at 39. There, however, we were called to opine on the motive  that caused the defendant to have the minors transported across state lines, rather than to draw the contours of  ""entice[ment],"" as that word is used in section 2251. In addition, reading Sirois as broadly as Thompson invites us  to would put that decision in tension with our more recent discussions of grooming as a form of ""entice[ment]."" See  Dorvee, 616 F.3d at 180; see also United States v. Weisinger, 586 F. App'x 733, 736 (2d Cir. 2014) (summary  order) (affirming district court's admission of evidence about minor victim's ""past physical abuse"" because such  evidence was ""probative to demonstrate how [defendant] gained control over the minor victim and how he groomed  her to participate in and transmit the charged pornographic images of herself""). We are bound here by our decision  in Dorvee, and decline Thompson's invitation to introduce such tension into our caselaw. Page 20 of 20   Because the government offered sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that venue properly lay in the Eastern  District of New York, we reject Thompson's challenge to his [**39]  conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a).",1

To survive  dismissal, the factual allegations must be ""plausible""  and ""must be enough to raise a right to relief above the  speculative level."" Id. at 555. See also Edwards v.

Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009)  (citations omitted). In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court  must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true  and take them in the light most favorable to plaintiff,  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167  L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal conclusions without  adequate factual support are entitled to no assumption  of truth,"" Mamani v.

Thus, the  Court engages in a two-step approach: ""When there are  well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume  their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly  give rise to an entitlement to relief."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at  679. II. Plaintiff filed the Complaint as a survivor of sex  trafficking pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) against Holistic Health  Healing, Inc. (Holistic) doing business as the Conty's  Motel. Plaintiff alleges that Holistic was involved with  staffing and operation of Conty's location in Naples,  Florida, and Holistic knowingly benefited or received  something of value from its facilitation [*3]  of or  participation in a venture that violated the TVPRA.  Holistic owns and operates the property and manages  Page 2 of 3 the business known as Conty's Motel. Plaintiff was allegedly trafficked in the same room at  Conty's for 10 to 14 days where she was forced to  perform sex acts. When plaintiff checked out, the  employee would check the room and would see the  used condoms, excessive amounts of dirty linens, and  plaintiff being handed an envelope with cash. Plaintiff  alleges defendant profited from the sex trafficking by  leasing a room to her trafficker and receiving a steady  stream of income. In Count One, plaintiff alleges that defendant had a  ""statutory obligation not to benefit financially from a  venture"" that violates the TVPRA and that defendant  ""breached this duty by participating in a venture which  facilitated the harboring and providing of A.D. for the  purposes of commercial sex induced by force, fraud, or  coercion, by their acts, omissions, and commissions.""  (Doc. #1, ¶ 53.) Plaintiff alleges that defendant has  financially benefited by keeping operating costs low,  maintaining loyalty of customers seeking to participate  in the sex trade, and from payments for rooms. (Id., ¶  54.) III. The TVPRA [*4]  is a criminal statute that also provides  a civil remedy to victims of sex trafficking. Section 1591  of the Act imposes criminal liability for sex trafficking,  while section 1595 provides the following civil remedy: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Thus, a sex-trafficking victim may  not only sue a sex-trafficking perpetrator for civil liability  through a private right of action but may also seek to  hold liable ""whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by  receiving anything of value from participation in a  venture which that person knew or should have known  has engaged in an act in violation of [the TVPRA]."" Id. To state a claim under a section 1595(a) beneficiary  theory, Plaintiff must allege facts which permit the Court  to plausibly infer that the defendant ""(1) knowingly  benefited (2) from participating in a venture; (3) that  venture [*5]  violated the TVPRA as to [A.D.]; and (4)  [Defendants] knew or should have known that the  venture violated the TVPRA as to [A.D.]."" Doe v. Red  Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 723 (11th Cir. 2021).  Accordingly, Section 1595(a) requires factual allegations  which permit the Court to plausibly infer that defendant  should have known that Plaintiff was being forced or  coerced to commit commercial sex acts against her will.  See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a), 1595(a). 1. Knowingly Benefited ""'Knowingly  benefits'  means  'an  awareness  or  understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of mind  in which a person has no substantial doubt about the  existence of a fact.' Knowledge, Black's Law Dictionary  (11th ed. 2019). And Section 1595(a) explains that a  defendant may benefit 'financially or by receiving  anything of value.' Accordingly, a plaintiff like [A.D.]  must allege that the defendant knew it was receiving  some value from participating in the alleged venture.""  Doe #1 v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 723-24  (11th Cir. 2021). Plaintiff generically alleges ""Defendant profited from the  sex trafficking of A.D. and knowingly or negligently  aided, enabled, and facilitated the sex trafficking of  A.D."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 38.) Plaintiff alleges that ""Defendant  profited from the sex trafficking of A.D. and knowingly or  negligently aided and participated with A.D.'s trafficker  with his criminal activity."" [*6]  (Id., ¶ 42.) Plaintiff further  alleges: 44. The Defendant all financially benefited from the  sex trafficking of A.D., and other victims like her,  and developed and maintained business models  that attract and foster the commercial sex market  for traffickers and buyers alike. 45. Defendant benefit from the steady stream of  income that sex traffickers bring to their hotel. 46. Defendant financially benefit from their ongoing  reputation for privacy, discretion, and the facilitation  of commercial sex. (Id., ¶¶ 44-46.) The Court finds that plaintiff has  generically alleged a profit, the same profit received  from all room rentals, but no facts are stated as to  Holistic's actual knowledge of sex trafficking on the  premises. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32258, *3 Page 3 of 3 2. Participation in a Venture ""The ordinary meaning of ""venture"" is an undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit"" and ""[t]he  ordinary meaning of participate or participation is to take  part in or share with others in common or in an  association."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Plaintiff alleges that defendant ""actively participated in  this illegal endeavor by knowingly or negligently  providing lodging in which to harbor A.D. while he was  trafficking her."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 41.) This is the only [*7]   allegation of active participation, and no allegations are  made that defendant did so with, or an association with,  the traffickers for a common goal of sex trafficking or to  profit from sex trafficking. The only factual allegation of  a direct interaction is an employee witnessing plaintiff  being handed an envelope. (Doc. #1, ¶ 36.) 3. Knew or Should Have Known Count One alleges that plaintiff is a victim of sex  trafficking within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a),  and that defendant knew or should have known not to  benefit from a venture engaged in violations of 18  U.S.C. § 1591(a). Under Section 1591(a), whoever  knowingly  ""recruits,  entices,  harbors,  transports,  provides, obtains, advertises, maintains, patronizes, or  solicits"" ""by any means a person"" or benefits ""from  participation in a venture which has engaged"" in such  acts knowing that ""means of force, threats of force,  fraud, coercion"" ""will be used to cause the person to  engage in a commercial sex act"" shall be punished. 18  U.S.C. § 1591(a). ""But observing something is not the  same as participating in it."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at  727. Other than observing ""well-known red flags"" such as  payments in cash, a continuous procession of men  entering and leaving A.D.'s room, there are no  allegations that defendant participated in [*8]  a violation  of the TVPRA. In paragraphs 37f and 37g, plaintiff  alleges a ""personal relationship between various hotel  staff and A.D.'s trafficker"" and ""direct employee  encounters with A.D. and her trafficker inside the  Conty's Motel Naples."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 37.) This is the only  reference with no supporting facts as to how, how often,  or when these alleged encounters occurred. IV. Defendant also seeks to strike the allegations in  paragraph one of the Complaint as immaterial and  unsupported. The Court agrees. See A.D. v. Cavalier  Mergersub LP, No. 2:22-CV-095-JES-NPM, 2022 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 169985, 2022 WL 4357989, at *2 (M.D. Fla.  Sept. 20, 2022) (citing Doe v.

"People v. Hawkins, 2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1261","In this appeal, we address an exception to a criminal defendant's right to confront witnesses, the doctrine of  forfeiture by wrongdoing. Defendant Kenneth Lequiez Hawkins was Sarah Doe's pimp. He was arrested shortly  after an incident in which he beat her and forced her to go into a vehicle and perform oral sex on a man. Doe gave  two statements to the Sacramento police inculpating defendant. When she failed to appear, the trial court, over  defendant's objection, granted the prosecution's motion to admit her two statements to a police officer and a  detective, finding the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception applied because defendant had facilitated Doe's failure to  appear. Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of human trafficking (Pen. Code, § 236.1, subd. (b) —count one),  pimping (§ 266h, subd. (a)(1)—count two), and pandering (§ 266i, subd. (a)(1)—count three). The trial court  sustained a strike allegation and sentenced defendant to a 40-year state prison term. The trial court subsequently  recalled the sentence and modified the term to 28 years in state prison.  Page 2 of 14   On appeal, defendant contends admitting Doe's statements [*2]  to the police violated his right to confrontation,  there was insufficient evidence to support the human trafficking conviction, and the imposition of certain  mandatory fines and fees without determining his ability to pay was a deprivation of various constitutional rights. The trial court's finding that defendant induced Doe not to testify through wrongdoing was based on preliminary  hearing testimony showing defendant was in a control relationship with Doe, a call he made to her from Sacramento  County jail in which defendant told Doe she needed to fix what happened, calls to other parties from jail in which  defendant emphasized the importance of Doe not testifying, and evidence that Doe had been contacted by others  who appeared to be acting on defendant's behalf and in defendant's interest while defendant was awaiting trial. This  is substantial evidence supporting the trial court's finding. Since substantial evidence supports the human  trafficking conviction and his claim regarding fines and fees is both forfeited and without merit, we shall affirm. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND A. Prosecution Case 1. Parking Lot Incident Tung Tran was working at a store on Franklin Boulevard in Sacramento [*3]  in the afternoon on March 1, 2020,  when he saw a group of men standing in the parking lot. Walking outside, Tran saw a woman sitting in the middle of  the parking lot, crying, and yelling. A man was talking and yelling at the woman. An older man approached and  interacted with the first man. Tran went back into the store for five to ten minutes. When he went back outside, Tran  saw the man, who was yelling, driving to the back of the parking lot of the store while the older man and the woman,  who was still crying, walked there. Tran went back into the store. When he went back out again, Tran saw the yelling man forcing the woman and the  older man into the front passenger seat of a vehicle. The first man punched the woman, yelling, ""Eat it, Eat it,"" and  ""I need the money right now."" The woman was crying, and on her knees while the older man dropped his pants  down to the floor. Tran could not see what the woman was doing because his view was blocked. He heard her say,  ""No, please,"" after which Tran went back into the store. When he came out again, Tran saw the woman on her  knees and crying, while the man who had been yelling was holding a baseball bat. Tran called 911 at around 4:27 p.m. [*4]  He reported that a man forced a woman to perform oral sex on a random  man in a dark blue Lincoln or Mercury vehicle in the parking lot. Tran saw the first man holding a baseball bat  aggressively, but the man did not swing it. He saw the abusive man and the woman leaving together in the vehicle. An Instagram video showed events similar to Tran's description of the incident. In the video, a group of men yelled  at a woman to ""choose up,"" while another man ordered the woman to sit in the middle of the parking lot, which she  did. The vehicle in the video matched Tran's description of the vehicle the abusive man was driving. 2. Arrest and Aftermath On the day of the incident, March 1, 2020, Sacramento police identified the abusive man in the video, defendant,  and arrested him. The woman in the video, Doe, was with defendant and was visibly injured. There were multiple  bloodstains on the front passenger area of defendant's vehicle. The vehicle contained three cell phones, along with  dozens of condoms and lubricant in bags that were known as ""tools of the trade"" that sex workers carry. Defendant  asked officers to retrieve his cell phone from his nearby apartment. Within the apartment, officers [*5]  found a  baseball bat which matched the description later given by Doe. Doe was taken to the hospital. She sustained a laceration above her eye that required nine stitches. Doe also had  minor injuries to her arms, legs, torso, and left breast, and she had swollen hands. 2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1261, *1 Page 3 of 14   3. Doe's Statements Sacramento Police Officer Michael Nelson took a recorded statement from Doe at the hospital. Doe had known  defendant for about two months, meeting him at Wellness and Recovery Center where she used to work. She gave  him her number and they started dating. According to Doe, defendant had ""anger issues."" He would put his hands on her or try to have others do the same.  Defendant was not violent at the beginning of their relationship; he got violent when he thought she was being  sneaky or doing things behind his back. Doe and defendant were with each other much of the time; they usually rented a room or slept in the vehicle.  Defendant first asked her to have sex with someone else about a month before the interview and had asked her to  ""trick"" between five and ten times. Doe did not always comply with the requests. When she told defendant she did  not want to comply, defendant would start to hit Doe in front [*6]  of other people, telling her, ""[N]obody aint gonna  save you! Nobody's going to fucken save you."" This embarrassed her, so Doe would tell defendant to just stop as  she did not want to get law enforcement involved. Doe set her own prices. When asked by Officer Nelson, ""[h]ow much money do you make doing that,"" she  answered, ""[p]robably like four [hundred], depending on how I feel."" She would charge $150 for an hour-long date  and give defendant $100 of that, even though Doe thought defendant did not deserve it. She met customers online,  over the phone, or on the street. Doe met customers in their house or on ""car dates,"" with defendant driving her to  the dates. Doe learned about prostitution from her cousin and had been engaged in it for around two years. Doe told Officer Nelson the blood in defendant's vehicle was from her injury. She injured her hand a couple of days  earlier when she held it up to block defendant from striking her face. Doe's injuries were caused by defendant's  attacks on that day and a few days before. Defendant had told Doe, ""go out there and get me some money!""; when  she declined, defendant got mad, slapped Doe, and took her to his cousin's to have someone jump her [*7]  ""for  lying and not telling him the truth."" Doe sustained the injury above her eye in San Pablo, outside San Francisco,  when defendant pushed her, causing her to fall. The incident at the parking lot started when defendant got mad because he wanted to get money from a ""trick"" but  Doe had walked the wrong way. When they got to the parking lot, defendant opened the door and his ""homeboys""  were there recording her and saying, ""choose up! Choose up! . . . . I know you wanna choose up bitch!"" Defendant  saw a man walking down the street and asked him, ""you want some pussy?"" The man pulled out his penis and  defendant told Doe to suck it, but she said that she did not want to. Defendant told her the man had paid for it, but  Doe knew he had not paid. As the man sat inside the car while Doe was on her knees, defendant told Doe, ""[S]uck  it! I don't give a fuck. You gonna do whatever the fuck I tell you to."" He also told her to ""suck his dick, this is what  you like to do for free."" Defendant was holding a blue metal baseball bat with a black grip. He threatened to hit her  with the bat if she did not perform oral sex on the man. Doe told defendant she would not, but nonetheless  pretended to perform [*8]  oral sex on the man. She had only touched the man's penis and put her hands on top of  each other. The incident ended when someone said police were coming. Defendant never forced Doe to have sex with him but would force her to have sex with other people when she did  not want to. When that happened, defendant would get mad at Doe and expected her to listen to what he told her.  She last had sex with a ""trick"" a few days before the interview when defendant drove her to San Francisco. He last  got mad at Doe for not having sex with another man about a week before the interview with Officer Nelson.  Defendant would try to embarrass her; Doe would run away but defendant would threaten to kill her. She told  defendant she was afraid and wanted to be taken home, but defendant said he would not take her home and told  Doe she would be with him for the rest of her life.   2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1261, *5 Page 4 of 14   Doe told Officer Nelson she did not want anyone to know where she was because defendant's cousins told Doe  they would find her and beat her if she put defendant back in jail. Defendant had previously told Doe, ""I should just  kill you since you don't want to live,"" and had said something like this that day, before the parking lot incident. [*9]   He had also told Doe, ""I should just kill you for not motherfucking listening . . . . I should just go get the gun and just  kill you."" Doe was glad the police came as she had been trying to get away from defendant for ""hecka long."" She never  called the police because defendant took her phone and would give it to her when she was ""out making some  money."" Doe was interviewed later that day by Sacramento Police Detective Jason Collins. Defendant had become  angry at her for not making gas money. She called defendant her boyfriend, but ""everybody"" called him her pimp.  She started working for defendant while they were dating; it was ""all cool"" until defendant thought she was being  sneaky and lying. Doe had started ""working"" when she was 15 years old and had been working on her own without any ""dudes."" She  posted ads and liked what she did because it paid well. Doe stopped for two years after she had her child. She  identified defendant as her ""dude."" Defendant had been fine with Doe being a prostitute; she told him about a week after they started dating. He  started hitting her and accusing her of lying about a month into their relationship. Defendant thought she had  ""choosed up on somebody else"" [*10]  but this was not true. When Doe told defendant she had gone to see a  customer, defendant would accuse her of lying and questioned how much money she was giving him. Doe primarily posted her advertisements on the websites List Crawler or Skip The Game and used her own phone  number. She did the ads without defendant's help, although he would drive Doe to her dates. She gave defendant  about $150, depending on how much she made. Doe charged $100 to $150 for a 30-minute date, $200 for an hour,  and $60 for a ""quickie."" She did primarily ""car dates"" and would make about $400 a night working every other day.  In exchange for Doe giving him money, defendant would buy her food and clothes. Doe believed she had given defendant $500 in the two months they had been together. Although defendant did not  get very ""pimpy"" with her, he would get aggressive with her when he thought she was lying and would threaten to  beat her up. Defendant considered himself her pimp and was managing her. He was trying to get money from her  and would put his hands on her if she did not follow his instructions and directions. Defendant would take her down  to the ""blade"" every day, where she would work from 8:00 p.m. to midnight. [*11]  While there, defendant would tell  her what to do and how to do it, and he would threaten her. Defendant had threatened Doe's life. He told Doe he would shoot her or find her and beat up Doe and whoever she  was talking to. Doe did not know if defendant would carry out the threats, but she wanted to get away from him. 4. Expert Testimony Detective Collins specialized in human trafficking cases. He had met women who claim they are voluntarily  engaged in prostitution but were in fact exploited by a pimp. A primary rule between a pimp and sex worker is  that you do not talk about your pimp to law enforcement, which established a level of control and a layer of  protection for the pimp. The terms ""the life"" and the ""game"" are used by sex workers and pimps to describe the life of prostitution or the  game of pimping. ""Working"" means engaging in prostitution. A ""date"" is the sex act between the sex worker and  customer, with a ""car date"" being the buyer picking up the worker and having sex in the buyer's car in a remote  location. Sex workers usually refer to their pimps as ""daddy,"" ""dude,"" or ""boyfriend."" The phrase ""put their hands on  them"" refers to physical abuse like getting slapped or hit. ""Choosing [*12]  up"" happens when the sex worker  switches to a new ""better pimp.""  2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1261, *8 Page 5 of 14   Various websites are used for sex workers to advertise their services, including List Crawler and Skip The Games.  Sex workers also walk up and down a street and try to get the attention of prospective customers in an area known  as ""the blade."" It is very difficult for a woman to get out of ""the life"" because the pimp usually makes her afraid that the woman or  her family will suffer violence if she leaves. The sex worker also may lack the resources to support herself if she  leaves. Detective Collins had asked Doe if defendant was not very ""pimpy"" to try to gauge whether she was minimizing her  circumstances, as some sex workers do. Soon after this characterization, Doe started talking about defendant's  actual level of control over her on the street, such as taking her to the ""blade,"" making her stay on the phone so he  could monitor her on a date and having her give him money. By the end of the interview, Detective Collins  concluded defendant was a pimp who controlled the business parts of Doe's work. Sex workers are apprehensive when speaking to law enforcement, potentially minimizing their experience until  becoming comfortable [*13]  enough to tell what happened. For example, Doe began the interview by saying  defendant was cool with her sex work, but by the end gave specific instances of how defendant managed her work. The rates Doe quoted Detective Collins were consistent with his experience. Pimps often set a quota that the sex  worker must earn each night. Not meeting the quota can lead to physical abuse from the pimp. Doe did not have defendant's number saved on her phone, which is common for sex workers, as it provides  another layer of protection between the worker and her pimp. Sacramento Sherriff's Sergeant John Sydow testified as an expert on pimping and human trafficking subculture.  Pimps can be a ""Romeo pimp"" who use romance and promises of a better life, or a ""gorilla pimp"" who uses force  and fear, although most pimps use both tactics. Sergeant Sydow opined that the video of the parking lot incident  indicates pimping and human trafficking. Given a hypothetical of the facts of this case, Sergeant Sydow opined  the hypothetical facts were consistent with pimping and pandering. 5. Other Evidence Of the three phones found in defendant's car, one phone matched the number Doe gave for her phone, another  matched the [*14]  number she gave for defendant's phone, and the third matched the number Doe provided in her  ads. The phone associated with the ads was an old prepaid model meant to be thrown out when the minutes were  used up. A prosecution investigator opined the prepaid phone belonged to either defendant or Doe or might have  been shared by them. The data from the prepaid phone could not be downloaded, but the data from the other two  phones was retrievable. There were a number of conversations between defendant and Doe on defendant's phone. One text message, ""eat,  eat, MOBE,"" meant defendant would bring her something to eat when she was working. The message also said,  ""[s]ecure our spot love,"" which referred to working in a particular area. Another text message suggested exchanging  sex for rent or a place to stay. Two text messages had defendant directing Doe to continue working and to give him  money. Other text messages showed defendant telling Doe where to stand on the street, and to continue working until she  made a couple of hundred dollars. Defendant and Doe also exchanged texts while Doe was arranging sex with a  customer. In another text message, defendant directed Doe to earn $1,000 that night [*15]  by ""trapping hard,"" or  working hard as a prostitute. There were also text messages on defendant's phone about Doe setting up dates  with sex buyers, discussing rates, and setting locations. Doe told Sacramento County District Attorney's Investigator Annette Fucles that defendant had asked her not to  testify, by contacting her by phone while using his and other inmates' personal identification number assigned to  each inmate (PIN) from jail. Doe did not come to several meetings with Fucles and did not appear in court even  2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1261, *12 Page 6 of 14   though she had been served with a subpoena. On September 7, 2020, Fucles found several ads Doe had posted  on escort websites for services in Palm Springs. She also posted ads in Sacramento and Southern California dated  after July, 2020. Sacramento County Sheriff's Deputy Michael Headley investigates crimes at the Sacramento County jail. The jail  uses PINs and voice recognition software to determine who is calling from jail. Deputy Headley testified regarding  two calls made to Doe from the jail. Doe received a call from an inmate, not the defendant, in which the inmate told  Doe not to come to court and Doe said she would not come. Another time, defendant called Doe using [*16]   another inmate's PIN. B. The Defense Testifying on his own behalf, defendant said he had a romantic relationship with Doe, with whom he had sex on  their first date. He did not like it when he learned she was a prostitute a couple of weeks into their relationship. She  continued to work as a prostitute and would lie and sneak around. Doe never asked for defendant to be her pimp.  She would ask defendant for rides; defendant at first did not know these were for her sex dates. After defendant  learned she was a prostitute by looking at her phone, he asked her to stop. Doe said that she would. Doe's head injury occurred during an argument over panhandling for gas money; she got additional injuries from  fighting other people. The parking lot incident happened after they returned to Sacramento. Defendant was yelling  at Doe because a man with whom she had cheated was there. A ""white guy"" defendant did not know but had seen  before, walked by and asked defendant if he wanted to buy drugs. It was a drug sale and defendant did not tell Doe  to perform oral sex. Defendant held a bat but did not hit anyone. After getting some marijuana, defendant and Doe  went to his place to smoke marijuana and relax. [*17]  Defendant was not Doe's pimp; she gave him money voluntarily. He had people talk to her about not coming to  court ""to a certain extent,"" but defendant did not recall personally telling Doe not to come to court. Defendant said  ""choose up"" at the parking lot because others were saying it as well. Only a small number of the text messages on  Doe's phone were from defendant, and all three phones belonged to Doe. Defendant did not send Doe the text  messages about pimping and prostitution. C. Rebuttal Sacramento Police Officer Conner Lawrence interviewed defendant on March 1, 2020, and told him they had the  Instagram video. Defendant said he had an argument with Doe because she was cheating on him. He said the  laceration over Doe's eye was an old injury not from him. Defendant said the blood in the vehicle was also old.  Defendant admitted holding the bat and said he used it to ""flex a little bit more with her."" DISCUSSION I Doe's Statements to the Police Defendant contends the admission of Doe's statements to the police violated his right to confrontation. We  disagree. A. Background The prosecution moved pretrial to admit Doe's statements to the police. The following facts were adduced at the  Evidence [*18]  Code section 402 hearing on the matter. On March 23, 2020, defendant called Doe from the Sacramento County jail. During the call, defendant told Doe she  should try to ""write a email explaining, you know, saying everything. Because at this stage of the game, they'll be  fixing to let go folks out the people. I might qualify for that shit."" He told Doe, ""I don't feel its right for me to be up in  here and you doing you know what I'm saying. You living your life and I'm up in here you just feel me."" Defendant  2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1261, *15 Page 7 of 14   said that he wanted to ""be able to live my life how you living yours right now,"" and ""for that to happen shit, you gotta  do some things sh-you know, to fix what occurred."" After telling Doe that his attorney had told him about her statements to the police, defendant said, ""All that shit was  fairy tale, you feel me. So you have to fix that somehow, someway, I don't know the procedures or what you gotta  do to go about. But I would truly appreciate that. So I can go on about my life."" He later told Doe, ""Like, come on,  baby. Now, you supposed to better than that for me. I thought you was gonna really hold me down and represent  me the right way. But I'm feeling and you gotta understand. . . we done [*19]  shared something intimately before,  right? So, every time you're doing something, I feel every time you do it."" Doe replied, ""Yeah, when we were good  we shared."" When Doe later called defendant a ""weirdo,"" he replied, ""You is hella out of pocket,"" and later told her, ""why is you  being so difficult . . . ? Like this . . . is some out of pocket shit ever love."" On July 20, 2020, Doe was served with a subpoena to appear in court for this case. The following day, Investigator  Fucles received a voicemail from Doe expressing concerns about being contacted by defendant. Fucles called Doe  at the number she provided. Doe told Fucles she did not want defendant to be able to contact her on a different  number, and that she wanted a restraining order against him. Doe told Fucles that defendant had not threatened  her, but he had told Doe not to testify. A no-contact order was issued on July 28, 2020. On August 19, 2020, Fucles and Doe made plans to meet in two days. Fucles called and texted Doe after she failed  to show up; Doe replied that she had a family emergency and needed to reschedule. They agreed to meet on  August 24, 2020, but Doe neither appeared nor responded to Fucles' messages. Fucles drove [*20]  to an address  Doe gave her; the man who answered the door said Doe was not present and did not live there. Fucles texted Doe  the following day to remind her of her August 2020 court date, but Doe did not respond. Doe was scheduled to appear in court on August 26, 2020. While Doe responded to Fucles' text that day and  affirmed she was coming, Doe did not appear. Doe called Fucles at the end of the day and asked if a warrant had  been issued for her. Fucles told her a stayed bench warrant was issued that day. They agreed to meet on  September 2, 2020. On August 31, 2020, Doe received a call from another Sacramento County jail inmate, Devon Smith. Smith told Doe  that ""Kinki"" was going to court that day and he ""just want to make sure you don't come and shit like that."" Doe  replied that she was not going to court. Smith told Doe, ""Alright Yeah well he said try to uh he said he said if you  had me and he said stop talking to the DA you know what I mean cause he's trying to get out and shit and he said  just uh he says it's just uh you know like uh it's probably just play things in his favor do you know what I mean?. . .  .Because the negative is trying to he's trying to beat this case you hear [*21]  me?"" Doe stated that she understood. Smith continued, ""And he's going to trial today so you just want to make sure that you don't you know I mean just  don't show up to like no court date you know they just they'll stay away from the DA don't talk to him and everything  like that hear me?"" Doe replied, ""Uh huh."" Doe did not show for her September 2, 2020, meeting with Fucles. Doe did not reply to a text message from Fucles  offering to pick her up. Fucles found that an ad featuring Doe was posted in Palm Springs on September 7, 2020. The following day,  Fucles texted Doe a reminder that she had to be in court the next day. Doe replied ""okay."" Doe did not show up for  her September 9, 2020, court appearance. Fucles could not find Doe at two of her known addresses. She also left a  voicemail and sent her a text message that showed a read receipt.    2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1261, *18 Page 8 of 14   On September 9, 2020, defendant made a call using another inmate's PIN to Doe's number and spoke to a woman  other than Doe. Defendant told the woman she needed to ""knock her."" The woman asked, ""Knock who?"" and  defendant replied, ""The one you been tappin in with? Man you need to go ahead and knock her bruh."" When the  woman said she was not doing it, defendant [*22]  told her, ""[Y]ou're doing what we have to do to in order for us to  win."" The woman asked defendant what happened in court. He replied that a bench warrant was issued for ""lil mama that  I'm in here for."" Defendant told the woman, ""Now, they're like, if she uses her identification or anything, they can  use it to hunt her down, so now they're on a hunt trying to like find out where this person is through her phone, or  um, you know what I am saying. Trying to track her down . . . ."" He later said, ""so they may more than likely just  drop this case but they're like, 'you're [sic] honor if we arrest her, we gonna bring her in, in cuffs,' you see what I'm  saying. If she's not in our county, we can have her arrested in whatever county she's in and then ship her back to  our county. You see what I'm saying so at the end of the day all she gotta do is lay low. Stay out of the way and  don't come in contact with no police."" The woman replied, ""Well, I'll tell her that when I talk to her."" Defendant told the woman, ""I aint supposed to have no contact with her, even though I want to talk to her hellabad,  you feel me, I aint gonna lie, I'm trying to slide up to her."" Later, the woman told defendant that [*23]  upon hearing  that ""she put your ass in jail [N-word] I beated her ass and I don't give a fuck but for her just to think it's okay and  have my [N-word] or my husband in jail behind your ass, bitch no."" The woman had asked Doe to go to Las Vegas  with her, but she declined. Defendant replied, ""All we on is making sure motherfuckers is in the right state of mind."" Defendant said that if ""she go to court, I'll get sixty years because no matter what she say, they're going to go off  the paper."" When the woman responded, ""what if she go to court and say that was all a lie,"" defendant countered,  ""they gonna put her on the stand and say that she lying."" Defendant told the woman, ""All they want her to do is get  on the stand and say yeah your honor I said that. I get sixty years for that . . . ."" The woman told defendant she talked to ""her"" last night and she said that she was in Sacramento and wondered if  defendant had called her. The woman told her, ""I don't want anything to do with you. I'm only dealing with you  because Ken Ken wanted me to deal with you."" Defendant instructed the woman, ""when you do communicate with  her, you gotta let her know to stay out the way, you feel what I am saying."" [*24]  When the woman said she would  call her, defendant replied, ""they're going to drop this but tell her she need to quit communicating with them people.  You feel what I'm saying, she need to quit talking to them cause that was making them feel like they got a case.  They were still offering me twenty-one years."" Defendant reiterated, ""she don't need to show up, cause we don't  need her getting on the stand. We don't need her getting on the stand."" The woman suggested getting her out of  town on the train, ""because if she's in Sacramento and gets arrested, there's nothing I can do."" When defendant  asked the woman if she would do everything she could to get him out, the woman replied that she would talk to her  and ""choke her;"" defendant said not to choke her, just ""knock her."" The trial court lifted the stay for Doe's bench warrant on September 11, 2020. On September 14, 2020, the  prosecutor informed the trial court they could not find Doe over the weekend and summarized the efforts to find her. Following argument on the People's motion, the trial court ruled: ""The court does find, based upon the hearing had on Friday and the evidence adduced in that hearing and further  information provided today, [*25]  that, A, [Doe], the witness, is unavailable, and that, B, her unavailability was  facilitated by Mr. Hawkins, that he engaged in or aided and abetted in wrongdoing intended to procure the  unavailability of Ms. Doe as a witness. ""I am satisfied that the elements of Evidence Code 1390 are met squarely here. I do find factually that the specifics  of the communications—telephone recorded conversations—standing independently constitute a basis to find that  the prior statements are admissible as an exception under [Evidence Code section] 1390. ""I would add that there's another layer of persuasiveness in the People's position on this, and that there's also been  evidence—I read the preliminary hearing transcript—that there is a preexisting control relationship between the  2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1261, *21 Page 9 of 14   Defendant and Ms. Doe, which, of course, is not unusual in the situation of the charges presented here, but is not  something I'm concluding simply based on the charges. I have looked at actual evidence presented, and I'm  satisfied that not only standing alone the evidence I heard on Friday but also the—that's enough to satisfy the  [Evidence Code section] 1390 elements, but there's another layer on that cake, and that layer is a control dynamic  that it appears [appellant] held over [*26]  Ms. Doe. ""So the ruling is that the People's motion to admit prior statements—assuming they are otherwise relevant and  otherwise admissible under the Evidence Code—shall not be inadmissible as a consequence of being hearsay and  that they come within the exception of [section] 1390 of the Evidence Code."" B. Analysis Defendant contends the trial court's decision to admit Doe's statements to the police under the forfeiture by  wrongdoing exception deprived him of his right to confrontation. Assessing the admissibility of out-of-court statements involves a two-part analysis. (People v. Sanchez (2016) 63  Cal.4th 665, 680, 204 Cal. Rptr. 3d 102, 374 P.3d 320.) We must first decide whether the statement is hearsay and  if a hearsay exception applies. (Evid. Code, § 1200; People v. Alvarez (1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 185, 58 Cal. Rptr. 2d  385, 926 P.2d 365.) If the hearsay statement is otherwise admissible under a hearsay exception, we next determine  whether admissibility is limited by the Sixth Amendment's confrontation clause. (Sanchez, supra, at p. 680.) As interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in Crawford v. Washington (2004) 541 U.S. 36 [124 S. Ct. 1354,  158 L.Ed.2d 177] and its progeny, the Confrontation Clause generally bars admission of ""testimonial"" hearsay  statements against a defendant unless the declarant is unavailable to testify, and the defendant had a previous  opportunity to cross-examine the witness. (Id. at pp. 53-54, 59, 68 [158 L.Ed.2d at pp. 194, 197, 203]; People v.  Sanchez, supra, 63 Cal.4th at pp. 680, 687.) One recognized exception to the confrontation clause is when a  witness's absence is procured through the defendant's own wrongdoing. (Crawford, supra, at p. 62 [158 L.Ed.2d at  p. 199.) [*27]  This exception, commonly known as ""forfeiture by wrongdoing,"" has its foundation in the equitable  maxim that ""no one shall be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong."" (Reynolds v. United States (1879) 98  U.S. 145, 159 [25 L.Ed. 244, 248].) The United States Supreme Court has explained the theory behind the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing doctrine in the  following manner: ""[W]hen defendants seek to undermine the judicial process by procuring or coercing silence from  witnesses and victims, the Sixth Amendment does not require courts to acquiesce. While defendants have no duty  to assist the State in proving their guilt, they do have the duty to refrain from acting in ways that destroy the integrity  of the criminal-trial system."" (Davis v. Washington (2006) 547 U.S. 813, 833 [126 S. Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224,  244].) The forfeiture-by-wrongdoing doctrine is ""grounded in 'the ability of courts to protect the integrity of their  proceedings'"" by ""removing the otherwise powerful incentive for defendants to intimidate, bribe, [or] kill the  witnesses against them . . . . "" (Giles v. California (2008) 554 U.S. 353, 374 [128 S. Ct. 2678, 171 L.Ed.2d 488, 504]  (Giles).) For the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception to apply, a defendant must have caused a witness to be unavailable by  wrongful conduct intended to cause the witness to be unavailable. (Giles, supra, 554 U.S. at p. 367 [171 L.Ed.2d at  p. 500]; People v. Merchant (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 1179, 1185, 253 Cal. Rptr. 3d 766.) The exception applies ""not  only when the defendant intends to prevent a witness from testifying in court [*28]  but also when the defendant's  efforts were designed to dissuade the witness from cooperating with the police or other law enforcement  authorities."" (People v. Banos (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 483, 501, 100 Cal. Rptr. 3d 476.) The exception applies if ""at  least one"" of the defendant's reasons for committing the wrongdoing was to make the declarant unavailable as a  witness. (People v. Quintanilla (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 1039, 1049, 259 Cal. Rptr. 3d 431.) Forfeiture by wrongdoing is codified in Evidence Code section 1390, which provides: ""Evidence of a statement is  not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement is offered against a party that has engaged, or aided and  abetted, in the wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness.""  (Evid. Code, § 1390, subd. (a).) The party seeking to introduce evidence under this hearsay exception (here, the  2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1261, *25 Page 10 of 14   prosecution) must establish admissibility in a foundational Evidence Code section 402 hearing. The hearsay may be  used in the foundational hearing, but there must also be independent corroborative evidence to support admission  of the hearsay evidence at trial. (Evid. Code, § 1390, subd. (b).) A trial court's ruling on the admissibility of evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. (People v. Quintanilla,  supra, 45 Cal.App.5th at pp. 1049-1050.) But where the issue is whether the trial court erred in finding that the  factual predicates for application of Evidence Code section 1390 were met, the substantial evidence [*29]  test  applies. (Quintanilla, at p. 1050.) Defendant's argument centers on whether the three phone calls from Sacramento County jail admitted at the  Evidence Code section 402 hearing provide substantial evidence for the trial court's finding that the forfeiture by  wrongdoing exception applies. He notes that the only call between himself and Doe, the March 23, 2020 call,  involved no attempt to dissuade Doe from testifying in his upcoming trial. He contends this call involves nothing  more than his expressing a belief that he is wrongly in jail and a desire for Doe to make things right by telling  officers what really happened. According to defendant, encouraging Doe to ""fix"" what happened is the opposite of  dissuading her from testifying, as remedying her allegedly false narrative would lead Doe to come to court. Defendant admits it is reasonable to conclude that the unidentified recipient of the second call, the August 31, 2020  call made by Devon Smith, is Doe. He also notes that during the call Smith did try to dissuade Doe from testifying  However, defendant claims that Smith's statements during the call that ""'he'"" (defendant) wanted Doe to stop talking  to the prosecution and that the same ""'he'"" (defendant), was going [*30]  to trial that day and did not want Doe to  show up at court, were inadmissible hearsay. Although Evidence Code section 1390 allows for hearsay evidence to  be admitted at the hearing to determine whether to apply the wrongdoing by forfeiture exception defendant argues  that Smith's call to Doe involves two levels of hearsay, ""as Smith's statements are made out of court and he is  supposedly relaying appellant's statements that are also made out of court."" Regarding the last, September 9, 2020, call between defendant and an unidentified female, defendant notes that  this call was made after Fucles found an ad Doe had posted in Palm Springs the previous week. According to  defendant, Doe's decision to leave town before the call cannot be as a result of this call. Regarding the trial court's finding that defendant exerted a ""'control dynamic'"" over Doe, defendant asserts there is  no evidence he exercised that control to dissuade Doe from testifying. Defendant concludes the trial court's finding  that these three calls establish the elements of Evidence Code section 1390 cannot withstand scrutiny, and the  erroneous admission of Doe's statements was prejudicial. Defendant did not directly ask Doe to refrain from testifying when he called [*31]  her from the Sacramento County  jail. He did tell Doe that her statement to the police was false, it had harmed him, leaving him in jail while she was  free, and asked Doe to help him, telling her, ""I don't know the procedures or what you gotta do to go about. But I  would truly appreciate that. So I can go on about my life."" This open-ended request for help does not necessarily  suggest that Doe rectify the matter by testifying in court and refuting her prior statements. During the call, defendant  suggests a different means of helping him, asking Doe to ""write an email explaining everything, you know, saying  everything"" and to ""fix what occurred."" Although defendant never addressed whether Doe should testify, he did try  to instill guilt in her for her statements to the police implicating him when he told Doe it was not right for him to be in  jail while Doe was ""living your life . . . ."" Defendant also told Doe that she was ""out of pocket,"" which according to  Fucles' testimony at the hearing, refers to a prostitute not behaving or acting in a manner that her exploiter  expects.     2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1261, *28 Page 11 of 14   Although defendant did not directly ask or tell Doe not to testify, after Doe was subpoenaed, she told Fucles  that [*32]  defendant had contacted her and told Doe not to testify, which in turn led to the no-contact order. This in  turn must be evaluated in light of that other factor cited by the trial court, the preliminary hearing testimony  regarding defendant's relationship with Doe. The preliminary hearing testimony largely consisted of Officer Nelson  and Detective Collins relating the contents of their respective interviews with Doe. This testimony included Doe  describing to Officer Nelson how defendant acted as her pimp and how he would use violence against her, how he  had threatened to harm Doe and those with her if she ever left him, and how he would monitor Doe when she was  working to control her. Doe's reaction to defendant's conversation is better understood and more reasonable when  viewed in the context of their relationship. (See Giles, supra, 554 U.S. at p. 377 [171 L.Ed.2d at p. 506] [noting that  ""[a]cts of domestic violence often are intended to dissuade a victim from resorting to outside help . . . .""]; Davis v.  Washington, supra, 547 U.S. at pp. 832-833 [165 L.Ed.2d at pp. 243-244] [domestic violence offenses are  notoriously susceptible to intimidation or coercion of the victim].) The second and third calls both show that attempts were made to directly dissuade Doe from testifying in  defendant's case. The unidentified woman [*33]  with whom defendant spoke in the third call told defendant she  had contacted Doe and took instructions from defendant on what to do when she contacted Doe again. She had  apparently already contacted Doe before the call, as she told defendant she had beaten Doe after the woman  heard that Doe was responsible for defendant being in jail. During the call, defendant correctly states that having  Doe appear and refute her prior statements through testimony would not prevent the prior statements from being  admitted into evidence. He accordingly discussed with the woman the importance of Doe not testifying and how to  keep her from testifying in his case. During the discussion, defendant tells the woman to ""knock"" Doe, a reference  to hitting her. In so doing, defendant tells the woman that ""you're doing what we have to do to in order for us to win.""  Defendant also admits that he was legally banned from contacting Doe, but nonetheless he was trying to ""slide up""  to her. While this conversation took place on September 9, 2020, after Doe had placed an ad in Palm Springs, this does  not mean, as defendant argues, that Doe already was rendered unavailable when the third call happened. Although  Doe [*34]  had failed to make appearances or keep appointments associated with the case by the time of this call  and had placed the ad in Palm Springs before the call, this call nonetheless took place before the September 11,  2020, Evidence Code section 402 hearing and on the same day Doe had been scheduled to appear in court. The  fact that Doe was potentially in another location, such as Palm Springs or Las Vegas at some point before the call  does not render her unavailable; she could change her mind and subsequently decide to testify. In the third call  defendant expressed his desire for Doe not to testify and instructed the woman he called to keep Doe from  testifying. The trial court could reasonably conclude that this was successful, and Doe was persuaded not to testify. The third call also provides important context for the second call involving Doe and another inmate at Sacramento  County jail, Smith. The third call shows defendant's willingness to employ other inmates to help him keep Doe from  testifying without it being traced back to him. There is no evidence that Smith had any prior relationship with Doe or  reason to be interested in a case against defendant in which Doe is expected to be the primary [*35]  witness.  Given the circumstances of the third call, it is reasonable to infer that as in that call, the second call involved  defendant utilizing a fellow inmate and a third person to keep Doe from testifying without it coming directly from  defendant. In applying the substantial evidence test, "" a reviewing court 'presumes in support of the judgment the existence of  every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.' [Citation.]"" (People v. Edwards (2013) 57 Cal.4th  658, 715, 161 Cal. Rptr. 3d 191, 306 P.3d 1049.) The inferences the trial court made in finding the forfeiture by  wrongdoing exception applied were reasonable. Defendant was in an abusive relationship with Doe, told Doe he  wanted her to fix the problems caused by her inculpatory statements, and later successfully used other people to try  to dissuade her from testifying, in oneF case discussing having force used on Doe. This is substantial evidence  showing defendant committed acts causing Doe to be dissuaded from testifying, and in so doing intended for her   2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1261, *31 Page 12 of 14   not to testify. Substantial evidence supports the trial court's ruling that the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception  applied. II Substantial Evidence of Human Trafficking Defendant contends there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction [*36]  for human trafficking. The standard of review for insufficient evidence claims is well-established. ""'When considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we review the entire  record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidence—that is,  evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value—from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the  defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.] We presume in support of the judgment the existence of  every fact the trier of fact reasonably could infer from the evidence. [Citation.] If the circumstances reasonably  justify the trier of fact's findings, reversal of the judgment is not warranted simply because the circumstances might  also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding. [Citation.] A reviewing court neither reweighs evidence nor  reevaluates a witness's credibility.' [Citation.]"" (People v. Covarrubias (2016) 1 Cal.5th 838, 890, 207 Cal. Rptr. 3d  228, 378 P.3d 615.) ""The California human trafficking statute provides, in pertinent part, that '[a] person who deprives or violates the  personal liberty of another with the intent to obtain forced labor or services, is guilty of human trafficking.' (§  236.1, subd. (a).) As summarized in [*37]  the official standard jury instructions for criminal cases, the elements of  this offense are (1) the defendant either deprived another person of personal liberty or violated that other person's  personal liberty; and (2) when the defendant did so, he or she intended to obtain forced labor or services from that  person. [Citation.] As the phrase is used in the definition of this crime, unlawful '""[d]eprivation or violation of the  personal liberty of another"" includes substantial and sustained restriction of another's liberty accomplished through  force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury to the victim or to another  person, under circumstances where the person receiving or apprehending the threat reasonably believes that it is  likely that the person making the threat would carry it out.' (§ 236.1, subd. (h)(3).)"" (People v. Halim (2017) 14  Cal.App.5th 632, 643, 223 Cal. Rptr. 3d 491. ""The total circumstances, including the age of the victim, the  relationship between the victim and the trafficker,. . . and any handicap or disability of the victim, shall be factors to  consider in determining the presence of 'deprivation of liberty' . . . ."" (§ 236.1, subd. (i).) Defendant asserts that Doe's history of engaging in prostitution both before she met [*38]  defendant and after  their relationship was severed is ""a factor when considering whether the offense involves force, fear, or violence.""  He finds that the record ""upon careful examination, reveals two things; that S. did not prostitute herself out of  force, fear, or violence coming from appellant, and that this record is insufficient to support the conviction because  of the incomplete and fragmentary nature of the statement given by S. to officers."" According to defendant, his  testimony provides the only complete picture of his relationship with Doe. He notes Doe's statement that she gave  defendant $500 during the time they were together is inconsistent with a finding that he deprived Doe of her liberty  in order to force her to engage in prostitution. Defendant also points out alleged inconsistencies in Doe's  statements, such as her claiming to give $100 out of every $150 she made, meaning that if she gave him a total of  $500, then Doe made only $750 during the two month period they were together. Defendant claims the prosecution's theory of guilt was based on snippets from Doe's statements to law  enforcement, but those statements, when viewed as a whole, show Doe was only referring [*39]  to a domestic  dispute. According to him, the prosecution relied on Doe's statement, ""I be, like, get away from me. Leave me  alone, and he'll come back and chase me down the street or do anything, and I'll be like, just get away from me,""  but this statement was immediately preceded by her saying, ""when he kicked me out his car and told me to get  away from him, he comes back and follows me. . . he come back and follows me."" He finds this entire snippet  showing a domestic dispute rather than defendant depriving Doe of her liberty. 2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1261, *35 Page 13 of 14   According to defendant, there are two conclusions that can be drawn from the evidence, either Doe earned a lot of  money and gave defendant only a little or she earned only a little money and thus did not work much as a  prostitute. He argues both conclusions are inconsistent with a finding that he restricted Doe's liberty within the  meaning of section 236.1 and accordingly did not commit the crime of human trafficking. Defendant's argument misapplies the standard of review for the sufficiency of the evidence. An apparent or possible  inconsistency in the victim's account does not invalidate the portions of the victim's statement which establish the  element of the charged offense. [*40]  ""'Resolution of conflicts and inconsistencies in the testimony is the exclusive  province of the trier of fact. [Citation.] Moreover, unless the testimony is physically impossible or inherently  improbable, testimony of a single witness is sufficient to support a conviction.' [Citation.]"" (People v. Brown (2014)  59 Cal.4th 86, 106, 172 Cal. Rptr. 3d 576, 326 P.3d 188.) The fact that Doe said she gave defendant only $500  does not invalidate her statements that she made good money working as a prostitute or that she gave defendant  $100 out of every $150 she earned. Detective Collins provided expert testimony that some sex workers would  minimize their experiences and that Doe did this when she said defendant was not very ""pimpy."" The jury could  reasonably infer Doe was minimizing when she said she gave defendant only $500, and in fact gave much more, as  her other statements to the police showed she made much more than $750 during the two months defendant was  her pimp. Doe's statements and her text messages with defendant showed he exerted control over her sex work,  provided her with transportation, and would have to engage in sex work when she did not want to. Defendant would  also use violence or the threat of violence to enforce his dictates. The parking lot incident [*41]  is particularly vivid evidence of defendant's use of violence and humiliation to exert  control over Doe's sex work. According to Doe's statement, the incident was precipitated by a dispute between  defendant and Doe over sex work; defendant wanted to get money from a ""trick"", but Doe walked the wrong way.  Doe's statements, Tran's testimony, and the parking lot video show that defendant struck Doe, threatened her with  a baseball bat, and had his associates surround and yell at her so she would perform oral sex on the man against  her will. Even if no money was exchanged for the sex act (or simulated sex act if Doe's statement is believed), this  supports defendant's use of threats and violence to get Doe to comply with his directives over her sex work. The fact that defendant's testimony paints a more consistent and self-servingly exculpatory picture of their  relationship is irrelevant. Doe's statements, supplemented by other evidence, provides ample evidence that  defendant deprived her of liberty through violence and threats in order for her to engage in prostitution for his  financial benefit. Substantial evidence supports the human trafficking conviction. III Dueñas Without objection, the [*42]  trial court imposed a restitution fine of $8,000 (§ 1202.4); a stayed $8,000 parole  revocation restitution fine (§ 1202.45); $120 in court operations fees (§ 1465.8); and a $90 conviction assessment.  (Gov. Code, § 70373). Citing People v. Dueñas (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th 1157, defendant contends the imposition of these fines, fees, and  assessments without a finding of his ability to pay deprived him of due process.        2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1261, *39 Page 14 of 14   Defendant was sentenced on October 16, 2020, long after Dueñas was decided. His failure to raise his ability to pay  forfeits the contention on appeal. (Cf. People v. Castellano (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 485, 489, 245 Cal. Rptr. 3d 138  [finding the defendant did not forfeit Dueñas argument because it was decided after sentencing]; see People v.  Aguilar (2015) 60 Cal.4th 862, 866-867, 182 Cal. Rptr. 3d 137, 340 P.3d 366 [the defendant's failure to object at  sentencing to certain fees on the basis of his inability to pay forfeited the challenge on appeal].) Our Supreme Court is now poised to resolve the issues raised in Dueñas, having granted review in People v. Kopp  (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 47, 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 852, review granted November 13, 2019, S257844, which agreed with  the court's conclusion in Dueñas that due process requires the trial court to conduct an ability to pay hearing and  ascertain a defendant's ability to pay before it imposes court facilities and court operations assessments under  section 1465.8 and Government Code section 70373, but not restitution fines under section 1202.4. (Kopp, at pp.  95-96.) In the meantime, we join several other courts in concluding that the [*43]  principles of due process do not require  determination of a defendant's present ability to pay before imposing the fines and assessments at issue in Dueñas  and in this proceeding. (People v. Cota (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 786, 794-795, 259 Cal. Rptr. 3d 419; People v.  Kingston (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 272, 279, 254 Cal. Rptr. 3d 118; People v. Hicks (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 320, 329,  253 Cal. Rptr. 3d 116, review granted Nov. 26, 2019, S258946; People v. Aviles (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 1055, 1069,  252 Cal. Rptr. 3d 727; People v. Caceres (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 917, 928, 252 Cal. Rptr. 3d 709.) Defendant's  claim pursuant to Dueñas is without merit. Since we find the claim to be without merit, we need not address defendant's claim that the failure to raise an  objection below was ineffective assistance of counsel DISPOSITION The judgment is affirmed.

"J.M. v. Choice Hotels Int_l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84861","ORDER Defendant Red Roof Inns, Inc., a hotel franchisor,  moves to dismiss plaintiff J.M.'s perpetrator and direct  beneficiary  claims  under  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), 18 U.S.C. §  1595. For the reasons below, the court denies the  motion to dismiss. I. BACKGROUND The court has summarized the history of this case in a  prior order, Prior Order (Oct. 17, 2022), ECF No. 42,  and incorporates that summary by reference in this  order. As relevant here, plaintiff alleges she was [*2]   trafficked at a franchisee hotel over the span of multiple  weeks. See generally Second Am. Compl. (SAC), ECF  No. 52. She claims hotel staff not only witnessed her  being trafficked but helped her trafficker perpetrate the  crime. Id. In its prior order, the court dismissed plaintiff's  direct beneficiary liability claim with leave to amend and  allowed plaintiff to bring a perpetrator liability claim in an  amended complaint. Prior Order (Oct. 17, 2022) at 12. Plaintiff then filed a second amended complaint  containing similar facts and allegations to the first  amended complaint. Compare SAC with First Am.  Compl.

LEGAL STANDARD A party may move to dismiss for ""failure to state a claim  upon which relief can be granted."" Fed. R. Civ. P.  12(b)(6). The motion may be granted if the complaint  lacks a ""cognizable legal theory"" or if its factual  allegations do not support a cognizable legal theory.  Godecke v.

But  this  rule  demands  more  than  unadorned  accusations; ""sufficient factual matter"" must make the  claim at least plausible. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. In the  same vein, conclusory or formulaic recitations of  elements do not alone suffice. Id. (citing Twombly, 550  U.S. at 555). III. ANALYSIS The TVPRA provides both criminal and civil penalties for  sex trafficking. See 18 U.S.C. § 1591, § 1595. Section  ""1595(a) creates civil liability [*4]  for two categories of  defendants: (1) those who have themselves committed  a criminal offense under § 1591 of the TVPRA (i.e.,  perpetrator liability), and (2) those who are not  themselves subject to criminal liability but who  knowingly benefitted from participation in a venture that  they knew or should have known was committing an  offense under § 1591 of the TVPRA (i.e., beneficiary  liability)."" A.D., v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., No.  19-120, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 250759, 2020 WL  8674205, at *2 (E.D. Va. July 22, 2020) (emphasis  omitted). Plaintiffs may bring either direct or indirect  beneficiary liability claims. See J.C. v. Choice Hotels  Int'l, Inc., No. 20-00155, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073,  2020 WL 6318707, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 28, 2020). This  court previously found plaintiff pleaded a claim for  indirect, or vicarious, beneficiary liability, see Prior Order  (Oct. 17, 2022) at 8, and plaintiff again pleads this claim  again without defendant's objection. Defendant now  moves to dismiss plaintiff's claims for perpetrator and  direct beneficiary liability. A. Perpetrator Liability Civil perpetrator liability under section 1595 imputes  section 1951's elements for criminal liability. See 18  U.S.C. § 1595. Section 1951 imposes criminal sanctions  on ""whoever knowingly"" ""recruits, entices, harbors,  transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains,  patronizes, or solicits by any means a person with  knowledge that ""means of force, threats of force, fraud,  coercion described in subsection (e)(2), or any  combination of such means will be used [*5]  to cause  the person to engage in a commercial sex act."" 18  U.S.C. § 1591(a); see also Noble v. Weinstein, 335 F.  Supp. 3d 504, 514-15 (S.D.N.Y. 2018); Doe v.  FitzGerald, No. 20-10713, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  130445, 2022 WL 2784805, at *3 (C.D. Cal. May 13,  2022). As a result, plaintiffs must allege defendants  knowingly harbored or maintained a person ""with  knowledge that fraud or force would be used to cause  her to engage in a commercial sex act."" Fitzgerald, 2022  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130445, 2022 WL 2784805, at *4;  A.D., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 250759, 2020 WL 8674205,  at *2 n.1 (""Section 1591 imposes an actual knowledge  requirement""). While courts have examined civil  perpetrator liability claims, see, e.g., Fitzgerald, 2022  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130445, 2022 WL 2784805, the court  has not located any other decision interpreting the  statute's perpetrator liability provisions against a  franchisor hotel. Defendant argues plaintiff has not alleged actual  knowledge. ECF No. 55; Reply at 9. Knowledge does  not require ""certainty as to a future act"" but rather ""is a  state of mind in which the knower is familiar with a  pattern of conduct."" United States v. Todd, 627 F.3d  329, 334 (9th Cir. 2010). ""What the statute requires is  that the defendant kn[ew] in the sense of being aware of  an established modus operandi that will in the future  cause a person to engage in prostitution."" Id.; see also  Noble, 335 F. Supp. 3d at 517-18 (""Defendant enticed  Plaintiff with knowledge that means of force or fraud  would be used to cause a commercial sex act to take  place.""). Plaintiff plausibly pleads defendant's actual knowledge  of her trafficking. See Opp'n at 16. Specifically,  plaintiff [*6]  alleges franchisee hotel staff: • Took cash payments from her trafficker, SAC ¶  62;      2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84861, *3 Page 3 of 5 • Rented plaintiff and her trafficker rooms away  from other guests, id. ¶ 58; • Witnessed ""lots of male visitors coming in and out  of [her] room"" and heard ""loud noises of abuse or  other  emergency  [sic]""  including  noises  of  ""beatings, banging, crying, and screaming for help,""  id. ¶¶ 61, 62; • Witnessed ""large numbers of male visitors asking  for [her] and her trafficker at the front desk,"" id. ¶  62; • Instructed ""johns"" to ""hurry up"" as they entered  and left her room, id. ¶ 60; • Noticed ""unusual numbers of used condoms in the  garbage bins"" and signs of drug use in plaintiff's  rooms, id.¶ 62; • Saw ""visible signs of prior physical abuse"" on her  body, id.; and • Saw plaintiff solicit ""johns"" ""from the [hotel] lobby  and the parking lot,"" id. ¶ 59. These allegations make it plausible the franchisee hotel  staff knew plaintiff was being trafficked. Plaintiff says  she resided at the franchisee hotel for weeks at a time,  and the trafficking behavior was ""open and obvious to  anyone working"" there. Id. ¶¶ 37, 64. Moreover, plaintiff's allegations link the franchisee staff's  knowledge to defendant because plaintiff alleges [*7]   defendant required all employees of franchisee hotels to  report potential criminal activity or ""indices of human  trafficking"" to ""[d]efendant['s] corporate executives and  upper-level management."" Id. ¶¶ 80, 83. Based on these  allegations, the court can reasonably conclude—and  plaintiff has ""sufficiently put defendant on notice"" that  she alleges—staff followed this protocol and reported  plaintiff's trafficking to defendant. SAC ¶ 83 (""employees  . . . would have reported suspected red flags of human  trafficking to [d]efendant['s] corporate executives""); see  also Opp'n at 16; Cutera, Inc. v. Lutronic Aesthetics,  Inc., No. 2:20-00235, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153424,  2020 WL 4937129, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 24, 2020).  Taking the allegations in the light most favorable to  plaintiff and drawing reasonable inferences in her favor,  as the court must do at this early stage, plaintiff has pled  the knowledge requirement of perpetrator liability:  defendant was aware of the trafficker's ""modus  operandi,"" including the use of force, and was familiar  with the trafficker's conduct. Todd, 627 F.3d at 334. As  such, the court denies defendant's motion to dismiss  plaintiff's claim based on perpetrator liability. B. Beneficiary Liability To state a direct beneficiary claim under section 1595,  plaintiff must allege defendant (1) knowingly benefitted  (2) ""from participation in [*8]  a venture"" (3) that it ""'knew  or should have known has engaged in'"" trafficking the  plaintiff. J.C., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL  6318707, at *4 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a)). In its prior  order, the court found plaintiff plausibly alleged the first  element of this claim. Prior Order (Oct. 17, 2022) at 5-6.  The court now addresses whether plaintiff sufficiently  alleges the second and third elements. 1. Participation in a Venture In its prior order, this court applied the plain meaning of  ""participation in a venture,"" which requires plaintiffs to  ""allege that the franchisors took part in a common  undertaking or enterprise involving risk and potential  profit."" Doe #1 v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 725  (11th Cir. 2021). The court found plaintiff's complaint  contained  allegations  describing  only  a  general  franchisor-franchisee venture without allegations that  defendant directly participated in the sex-trafficking  venture, but observed plaintiff might be able to cure this  deficiency. Prior Order (Oct 17, 2022) at 7-8. Plaintiff's  operative complaint now specifically alleges defendant's  participation. See SAC ¶¶ 66-67, 80, 83; J.C., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at *7 (""She  therefore plausibly pleads that defendant[] directly  'participated in a venture' by providing lodging to people  it knew or should have known were engaged in her sex  trafficking."" (emphasis [*9]  in original)). As reviewed above, plaintiff alleges defendant required  franchisee hotels to report sex trafficking to upper-level  management, SAC ¶ 80, and hotel employees  ""witnessed the obvious signs of [her] trafficking,"" and  ""would have reported suspected red flags"" to defendant,  id. ¶ 83. Plaintiff plausibly pleads defendant's full  participation because she alleges ""defendant[] w[as] the  primary facilitator or participant in the renting of rooms.""  Id. ¶¶ 66-67. Defendant ""controlled booking and  payment processing for the renting of rooms at [its]  branded  properties""  and  ""required  [its]  branded  properties to use software operated and controlled by [it]  for room booking and reservations"" and credit card  processing. Id. ¶ 67. Defendant also ""fixed the price of  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84861, *6 Page 4 of 5 room rentals"" for its franchisees. Id. Thus, plaintiff  alleges defendant, in controlling the booking and  payment processing, was the entity directly renting  rooms to plaintiff's trafficker and has ""allege[d] at least a  showing of a continuous business relationship between  the trafficker and [defendant] such that it would appear  that the trafficker and [defendant] have established a  pattern of conduct or could be said to have [*10]  a tacit  agreement."" H.H v. G6 Hosp., LLC, No. 2:19-755, 2019  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *4 (S.D.  Ohio Dec. 6, 2019); see also M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels &  Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959, 971 (S.D. Ohio  2019). In response, defendant argues ""observing something is  not the same as participating in it,"" and suggests plaintiff  has not sufficiently alleged active participation in the  venture. See Mot. at 7 (citing Doe #1, 21 F.4th at 727).  It argues, for instance, its ownership of the booking  software is similar to that of the ""simple act of renting a  room to a trafficker without knowledge of his activity,""  Reply at 1-3, and cites cases in which courts have  refused to hold the TVPRA requires hotels to  affirmatively stop trafficking, see id. at 6-7 (collecting  cases). But plaintiff does not just claim defendant failed  to prevent her trafficking. She alleges defendant actively  participated in facilitating the operation, as explained  above. See SAC ¶¶ 66-67, 80-85. Those allegations,  taken in the light most favorable to plaintiff, show it is  plausible defendant actively participated in the operation  through its rental of rooms to her trafficker. See J.C.,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at  *7. Because plaintiff has ""connect[ed] the dots"" between  herself and defendant, she has now met the second  element of her direct beneficiary liability claim. B.M. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., No. 20-00656, 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *5 (N.D.  Cal. July 30, 2020). 2. Knew or Should Have Known Lastly, plaintiff must allege defendant knew, or should  have [*11]  known, about plaintiff's sex-trafficking;  allegations  about  sex  trafficking  generally  are  insufficient. See S.J. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 473 F.  Supp. 3d 147, 154-55 (E.D.N.Y. 2020); J.C., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at *4 (""[Plaintiff]  must allege facts to support that defendants, at the very  least, rented rooms to people they should have known  were engaging in her sex trafficking.""). While plaintiff  had previously pled sufficient facts to the effect the  franchisee hotels knew or should have known plaintiff  was being trafficked, the court found the complaint did  not allege defendant possessed this knowledge. Prior  Order (Oct. 18, 2022) at 8-9. In the amended complaint, plaintiff has added specific  allegations regarding defendant's actual knowledge, as  reviewed in section A above. J.C., 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at *5. These factual  allegations closely mirror those in J.C., in which the  court denied a motion to dismiss a TVPRA direct  beneficiary claim against hotel franchisors because the  plaintiff adequately alleged the defendants knew of the  tracking of her individually, monitored criminal activity at  franchisee hotels and implemented policies for reporting  and tracking sex trafficking, among other details. 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073, [WL] at *6. Plaintiff's allegations that defendant had exclusive  knowledge of certain information, including what  defendant knew, are [*12]  enough to satisfy the ""knew  or should have known"" prong at this stage. See Park v.  Thompson, 851 F.3d 910, 928-29 (9th Cir. 2017)  (""Because many of the relevant facts here are known  only to the defendant, . . . we conclude that [plaintiff] has  pleaded sufficient facts to state a plausible claim . . ."");  Concha v. London, 62 F.3d 1493, 1503 (9th Cir. 1995).  Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the second and third  prong of her direct beneficiary claim. The court denies  defendant's motion to dismiss.",1
"United States v. Dexter, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111","ORDER SUSAN RICHARD NELSON, United States District  Judge This matter is before the Court on Defendant Charles  William Dexter, III's Objection [Doc. No. 98] to United  States Magistrate Judge Becky Thorson's June 6, 2022  Report and Recommendation (""R&R"") [Doc. No. 96]. In  the R&R, Magistrate Judge Thorson recommends that  Dexter's Motion to Dismiss for Selective, Discriminatory,  Vindictive Prosecution [Doc. No. 44], Second Motion to  Dismiss for Vindictive Prosecution [Doc. No. 65], and  Motion to Suppress Evidence Obtained as a Result of  Searches and Seizure and for a Franks Hearing [Doc.  No. 39] be denied. For the reasons set forth below, the  Court overrules Dexter's Objection, adopts the R&R in  full, and DENIES Dexter's motions. I. BACKGROUND The factual background of this case is more fully set  forth in the R&R, which the Court incorporates by  reference. (R&R [Doc. No 96] at 2-15.) Dexter is  charged with Sex Trafficking of a Minor, Sex Trafficking  by Force, [*2]  Fraud, and Coercion, and Use of  Interstate Facility To Promote Unlawful Activity in  violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 1594(a), and 1952(a)(3).  (Superseding Indictment [Doc. No. 58] at 1-4.) Dexter moves for a hearing pursuant to Franks v.  Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d  667 (1978), arguing that five search warrant affidavits  for search warrants executed by the Government  contained deliberate falsehoods or averments in  reckless disregard for the truth. (Def.'s Mot to Suppress  [Doc. No. 39] at 2-3.) Dexter further contends that  evidence obtained during the execution of all five  Page 2 of 9 warrants should be suppressed because the affidavits  supporting the warrants failed to establish probable  cause. (Id.; Def.'s Supp. Mem. Mot. to Suppress [Doc.  No 88] at 1.) Finally, Dexter moves for dismissal of his  case based on selective and vindictive prosecution.  (Mot. Dismiss for Selective, Discriminatory, Vindictive  Prosecution [Doc. No 44] at 5; Mot. Dismiss for  Vindictive Prosecution [Doc. No. 65] at 1-2.) A. The Warrant for the Cadillac On August 14, 2020, Bloomington Police Department  Detective Kristin Boomer obtained a search warrant to  search a 2009 Cadillac. (USA Decl. [Doc. No. 73], Ex. 2  (""Cadillac Warrant"") [Doc. No 74-1].) In the warrant  affidavit, Detective Boomer averred that the [*3]   department received a tip from the United States  Marshal Service that ""an adult male who was a  Registered Predatory Offender was possibly staying at a  Bloomington hotel with a juvenile female."" (Id. at 2.)  Detective  Boomer  summarized  the  department's  investigative efforts to find the juvenile female, including  locating two online advertisements soliciting prostitution,  searching the phone number listed in one of the  advertisements, and responding to that advertisement.  (Id. at 2-3.) While responding to the advertisement,  Detective Boomer averred that officers were told, via  text message, to go to a specific room at a Courtyard  Marriott Hotel in Bloomington, Minnesota. (Id.) Upon  arriving at the hotel, officers found that the room was  unoccupied, but officers observed condoms lying in  plain view. (Id. at 2.) Officers then located two  individuals near the hotel: a 14-year-old girl, MMV, and  a 21-year-old woman, TLRB. (Id. at 3.) Detective Boomer then summarizes a discussion  officers had with MMV in which she explained that she  was ""going to have sex in exchange for money""  because ""Dexter wanted her to."" (Id. at 3.) She also  described her relationship with Dexter, including the fact  that [*4]  she ""had sex with Dexter earlier in the day,""  that Dexter coached her on how to interact with  ""clients,"" and that he drove her to the hotel in a silver  Cadillac. (Id.) MMV also mentioned that a woman  named ""Shonda"" may have created the advertisement  to which the officers responded. (Id.) The warrant  affidavit indicates that MMV was then transported to the  hospital to complete a sexual assault exam. (Id. at 4.) The warrant affidavit also describes a conversation  between officers and TLRB in which TLRB explained  that she was driven to the hotel by a man matching  Dexter's description, and a second woman nicknamed  ""Honey,"" for purposes of having sex for money. (Id. at 3- 4.) Detective Boomer than averred that officers located and  impounded an unoccupied Cadillac registered to Dexter  in the Marriott parking lot. (Id.) The warrant affidavit  notes that officers observed two boxes of condoms in  the car. (Id.) After Dexter was identified, officers put a ""probable  cause pick up alert for [him.]"" (Id. at 4.) Detective  Boomer explained that officers used Dexter's phone and  officer surveillance to locate Dexter and a woman  named L.G. (Id.) Detective Boomer averred that Dexter  then called the police [*5]  department to locate the  impounded Cadillac, went to retrieve the vehicle at the  police department, and was arrested upon his arrival.  (Id. at 4-5.) B. The Warrant for a DNA Sample On the same day, August 14, 2020, Detective Boomer  obtained a second search warrant to obtain a DNA  Sample from Dexter. (Id., Ex. 1 (""DNA Warrant"") [Doc.  No 74] at 6-7.) In the warrant affidavit, Detective  Boomer restated much of the content contained in the  warrant affidavit to search the Cadillac, but included  some additional observations. Detective Boomer averred that she went to the hospital  to speak with MMV, and that she spoke to a social  worker who confirmed that MMV had a Sexual Assault  Evidence (SAE) Kit completed during a SAE exam. (Id.)  Detective Boomer reviewed hospital paperwork, and  learned that MMV admitted to having sexual relations  with Dexter. (Id.) The warrant affidavit then requests a  DNA sample, so officers could compare it to DNA  evidence and other evidence from the SAE kit collected  from MMV. (Id.) C. Warrant for LG Smartphone On August 15, 2020, Officer Jacob Lucas of the  Bloomington Police Department obtained a third warrant  to search an LG Smartphone found in Dexter's  possession at the [*6]  time of his arrest. (Id., Ex. 3  (""Phone Warrant"") [Doc. No. 74-2] at 1.) The warrant  affidavit for the LG Smartphone contained many of the  same facts recited in the warrant affidavit for the  Cadillac. 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111, *2 Page 3 of 9 Officer Lucas also stated that he knew from his ""training  and experience, [that]electronic devices such as smart  phones are often used by sex traffickers and those  involved in prostitution to set up 'dates' and discuss  other illegal matters."" He averred that the phone may  contain ""information about the sex trafficking and  prostitution along with information about Dexter's  relationship with minor victim MMV."" (Id. at 5.) D. Warrant for Dexter's Residence and Other  Vehicles On August 19, 2020, Detective Boomer obtained a  fourth search warrant for Dexter's residence, and for two  more vehicles. (Id., Ex. 4 (""Vehicle and Residence  Warrant"") [Doc. No. 74-3].) The warrant affidavit for this  fourth search warrant contained many of the same facts  recited in warrant affidavit for the LG Smartphone. Detective Boomer also included details about the arrest  of L.G. and Dexter, and a forensic interview with MMV in  which she detailed multiple sexual assaults that  occurred in various parts of Dexter's home. [*7]  (Id. at  5-6.) Detective Boomer also described evidence  indicating the presence of guns in Dexter's home,  including information provided by Hennepin County  Child  Protection  Investigator  Jodie  Glaspie  who  interviewed Dexter's child, and photos of guns  recovered from Dexter's phone. (Id. at 6.) Additionally,  the warrant affidavit describes a phone call Dexter made  from jail asking another person to go to his home and  retrieve money. (Id. at 7.) Detective Boomer averred that ""[a]n unannounced entry  [wa]s necessary []to prevent the loss, destruction or  removal of the objects of the search and to protect the  safety of the peace officers[]."" (Id.) She knew from  previous investigations that ""individuals who are  engaged in the promotion of prostitution and sexual  assault crimes maintain methods to destroy evidence in  a rapid and expedient manner and they will sometimes  maintain weapons for their protection and the protection  of the women engaged in the prostitution."" (Id.) Further,  she averred that an unannounced entry would allow  officers to maintain an ""element of surprise"" that would  ""preserve officer safety but also the safety of other  citizens in the neighborhood and any suspects in  the [*8]  residence."" (Id.) E. Warrant for Cell Phone Records On August 24, 2020, Detective Boomer obtained a fifth  search warrant for records and data connected to two T- Mobile phone numbers associated with L.G. and  Defendant. (Id., Ex. 5, (""T-Mobile Phones Warrant"")  [Doc. No. 74-4].) The warrant affidavit for this fifth  warrant contained many of the same facts recited in the  warrant affidavit for the Cadillac. Detective Boomer also  noted that Dexter denied ever being at the Courtyard  Marriott. Detective Boomer further noted that the cell  phone data stored by T-Mobile would ""assist in  determining the location and activities of"" Dexter. (Id. at  5.) F. Indictment and Superseding Indictment On February 18, 2021, Dexter, was indicted on one  count of sex trafficking a minor. On March 20, 2022, a  Superseding Indictment charged two additional counts:  (1) sex trafficking by force, fraud, and coercion and (2)  use of an interstate facility to promote unlawful activity.  (Indictment [Doc. No. 3] at 1; Superseding Indictment at  1-4.) Dexter was offered a plea deal prior to the  Government obtaining the Superseding Indictment. (See  Gov. Mot. Frye/Lafler Hr'g [Doc. No. 51] at 2.) G. Magistrate Judge Thorson's Report [*9]  and  Recommendation The magistrate judge first found that a Franks hearing is  not warranted, as Dexter failed to make ""a substantial  preliminary showing that the affiants made intentional or  reckless false statements or that the warrant affidavit,  with  the  at-issue  statement  omitted,  would  be  insufficient to support a finding of probable cause.""  (R&R at 21.) Second, she found that the warrants at  issue were all supported by probable cause, and that,  even if not, the Leon good faith exception would apply.  (R&R at 22-29.) Finally, she found that Dexter's  allegations of selective and vindictive prosecution are  not supported by the record. (Id. at 31-36.) H. Dexter's Objection Dexter raises specific objections to: (1) the magistrate  judge's reference to TLRB as a victim; (2) her  recommendation that a Franks hearing be denied; and  (3) her finding that the warrants for the Cadillac and his  residence were supported by probable cause. (Obj.  [Doc. No. 98] at 1-4.) He also raises objections to her  denial of his motions to dismiss his claims for vindictive  and selective prosecution. (Obj. at 4-9.) 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111, *6 Page 4 of 9 II. DISCUSSION A. Standard of Review The district court reviews de novo those portions of the  R&R to which a specific [*10]  objection is made and  ""may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the  findings or recommendations made by the magistrate  judge."" 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); accord D. Minn. L.R.  72.2(b). B. Magistrate Judge's Reference to TLRB as a  Victim Dexter takes issue with the magistrate judge's reference  to TLRB as a victim, arguing that the indictment does  not identify her as such. (Obj. at 1.) The Government  responds that victims need not be specifically identified  in an indictment to be referred to as such in a court  order. (Gov. Resp. to Obj. [Doc. No 100] at 2-3, n. 1.)  This reference is neither inappropriate, nor does it  impact the Court's analysis of the Defendant's motions. C. Defendant's Motion for a Franks Hearing Dexter is entitled to a Franks hearing only if he makes  ""a substantial preliminary showing that 'the probable  cause determination relied on an affidavit containing  false statements or omissions made knowingly and  intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth."" '  U.S. v. El-Alamin, 574 F.3d 915, 924-25 (8th Cir. 2009)  (citing United States v. Snyder, 511 F.3d 813, 816 (8th  Cir.)). ""This substantiality requirement is not met lightly  and requires a defendant to offer specific allegations  along with supporting affidavits or similarly reliable  statements."" U.S. v. Mayweather, 993 F.3d 1035, 1043  (8th Cir. 2021), reh'g denied (May 19, 2021) (citing  Snyder, 511 F.3d at 816). Additionally, Dexter  must [*11]  ""show that the alleged false statement or  omission was necessary to the finding of probable  cause."" United States v. Engler, 521 F.3d 965, 969 (8th  Cir. 2008). Each of the warrant affidavits that Dexter challenges  contained information about a tip officers received from  the US Marshal Service ""that an adult male who was a  Registered Predatory Offender was possibly staying at  the Bloomington hotel with a juvenile female."" (See e.g.,  USA Decl., Ex. 2 (""Cadillac Warrant"") at 2.) Dexter does  not suggest that the Bloomington Police Department did  not receive this tip. Instead, Defendant argues that  because the Bloomington Police Department had  access to Dexter's criminal history and could have  confirmed that he was not a predatory offender, this  detail was recklessly or intentionally included in the  warrant affidavit. (Obj. at 2-3.) In response, the  Government argues that Dexter has failed to meet his  substantial burden to warrant a Franks hearing. (Gov.  Resp. to Obj. at 4.) The Court agrees that Dexter has failed to make the  requisite  preliminary  showing  that  the  officers  intentionally or recklessly included a false statement in  the warrant affidavit because Dexter fails to submit any  evidence that the agent acted deliberately or recklessly.  U.S. v. Carpenter, 422 F.3d 738, 745 (8th Cir. 2005)  (finding [*12]   no  evidence  officers  recklessly  or  intentionally omitted from a warrant affidavit the fact that  a state court had suppressed an earlier search, as  Defendant did not demonstrate the omission was  intentional as opposed to negligent). Dexter suggests  Detective Boomer ""had actual knowledge"" that Dexter  was not a registered sexual offender because she had  access to his criminal record. (Def.'s Supp. Mem. Mot.  to Suppress at 3.) However, he provides no evidence ""to  establish that [Detective Boomer] deliberately or  recklessly omitted [this] information in an attempt to  mislead the issuing judicial officer."" Engler, 521 F.3d at  970 (affirming denial of Franks hearing when defendant  had no proof officers acted recklessly or intentionally in  drafting affidavit). At most, the record suggests this  could have been a negligent mistake, ""and unintentional  errors like those involved here are not the type of errors  that require suppression under Franks."" U.S. v. Juneau,  No. 19-cr-274-WMW-KMM, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  251041, 2020 WL 9170452, at *11 n. 12 (D. Minn. Dec.  21, 2020), R&R adopted, No. 19-cr-0274 (WMW/KMM),  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39805, 2021 WL 806368 (D.  Minn. Mar. 3, 2021) (finding no evidence of reckless or  intentional misconduct when an officer erroneously  overstated the criminal history of two individuals in a  warrant affidavit). Even if the Court were to assume that Dexter met his  substantial burden of [*13]  establishing that the agent  intentionally or recklessly included a false statement in  the warrant affidavit, his argument would still fail  because the affidavits established probable cause even  absent the challenged information. Engler, 521 F.3d at  970. The affidavits describe evidence that Dexter drove  an underaged girl to a hotel, that he sexually assaulted  the girl, and that he was involved in the sex trafficking of  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111, *9 Page 5 of 9 a minor. After an independent de novo review of the  files, records and proceedings in the above-entitled  matter, the Court finds that the affidavits at issue fully  support probable cause, even without the challenged  information. In light of the above, the Court denies Defendant's  motion for a Franks hearing. D. Probable Cause: Four-Corner Review of the  Search Warrant Affidavits The Fourth Amendment requires probable cause to be  shown before a search warrant is authorized. U.S.  Const. amend. IV; United States v. Williams, 477 F.3d  554, 557 (8th Cir. 2007). Probable cause exists where  there is a ""fair probability that contraband or evidence of  a crime will be found in a particular place given the  circumstances set forth in the affidavit."" United States. v.  Tellez, 217 F.3d 547, 549 (8th Cir. 2000). When the issuing judge relies solely upon a supporting  affidavit to issue the search warrant, ""only that  information which is found within the four corners  of [*14]  the affidavit may be considered in determining  the existence of probable cause."" United States v.  O'Dell, 766 F.3d 870, 874 (8th Cir. 2014). Judges  issuing  search  warrants  may  ""draw  reasonable  inferences from the totality of the circumstances"" when  reading a warrant application to determine whether  probable cause exists. United States v. Keele, 589 F.3d  940, 944 (8th Cir. 2009). Reviewing courts afford ""great  deference"" to the issuing judge's ""initial, on-the-scene  determination  that  probable  cause  has  been  established."" United States v. Colbert, 605 F.3d 573,  576 (8th Cir. 2010). As long as the issuing judge had a  ""substantial basis"" for determining that the search would  ""uncover evidence of wrongdoing,"" the Court must  uphold the probable cause determination. United States  v. Horn, 187 F.3d 781, 785 (8th Cir. 1999). Probable  cause ""does not require evidence sufficient to support a  conviction, nor even evidence demonstrating that it is  more likely than not that the suspect committed a  crime."" U.S. v. Miller, 11 F.4th 944, 953 (8th Cir. 2021),  cert. denied, 21-7753, 142 S. Ct. 2796, 2022 WL  1914258 (June 6, 2022) (citing United States v.  Donnelly, 475 F.3d 946, 954 (8th Cir. 2007)). 1. Probable Cause for Search of 2009 Cadillac Dexter contends that there was no nexus established  between the alleged crime and the Cadillac, and he  argues that the magistrate judge's probable cause  determination erroneously relied on the tip from the  informant, and the two boxes of condoms located in  plain sight in the Cadillac. (Obj. at 5.) The Court finds that the search warrant affidavit  established [*15]  a sufficient nexus between the place  to be searched and the evidence of a crime. The  affidavit linked Dexter to suspected sex-trafficking and  sexual assault through officer observations, text  messages, and interviews with MMV and TLRB, (USA  Decl., Ex. 2 (""Cadillac Warrant"") at 3-4), and linked  Dexter to the Cadillac through the same interviews, as  well as through a public record search and a phone call  from Dexter asking after the vehicle. (Id. at 3-5.) Officers  were able to link the Cadillac to the alleged crimes  through the interviews with MMV and TLRB, as both  victims explained that they were driven to the hotel by a  man matching Dexter's description, in a Cadillac  matching the description of the vehicle that was subject  to the warrant. (Id. at 3.) Further, Officers were able to  see two boxes of condoms in plain sight in the vehicle.  (Id. at 4.) The Court notes that ""[w]hether probable cause exists to  issue a search warrant is a commonsense, practical  question  to  be  judged  from  the  totality-of-the- circumstances."" Donnelly, 475 F.3d at 954 (cleaned up)  (citation omitted). When considered together, the facts  set forth in the warrant affidavit demonstrate a ""fair  probability"" that evidence of Defendant's criminal [*16]   activity would be found in the Cadillac. Tellez, 217 F.3d  at 549. Thus, the information in the affidavit established  the requisite nexus between the Cadillac and the  alleged crime. 2. Probable Cause Existed for Search of Dexter's  Residence and Two Vehicles Dexter contends that any link between his residence  and the alleged sexual assault and sex trafficking was  highly attenuated, and that the search warrant affidavit  failed to state with any specificity ""why any of the items  sought would be in the residence at the time the warrant  was sought."" (Obj. at 6.) The Court agrees with the magistrate judge that the  affidavit in question contained sufficient detail to  establish a nexus between Dexter's residence and the  alleged crime. In the affidavit, Detective Boomer averred  that MMV described multiple sexual assaults in the  residence, and the use of multiple cars to drive her to  meet clients. (USA Decl., Ex. 4 (""Vehicle and Residence  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111, *13 Page 6 of 9 Warrant"") at 6.) These facts indicate a ""fair probability""  that evidence of Defendant's alleged criminal activity  would be found in his home and other vehicles. Tellez,  217 F.3d at 549. Additionally, the officer explained that guns are  frequently kept by individuals involved in sex trafficking  as a form of [*17]  protection for themselves and the  women they are trafficking. (Id. at 7.) The affidavit  described pictures of guns found on Dexter's phone,  and an interview with his daughter in which she  described finding a gun in a pillowcase. (Id. at 6-7.)  Because the warrant established probable cause that  Nelson unlawfully possessed firearms, probable cause  existed to search his residence for firearms, as people  ""generally keep [firearms] at home or on their persons.""  United States v. Cowling, 648 F.3d 690, 696 (8th Cir.  2011). 3. Probable Cause for Warrants for DNA, Cell  Phones, and Cell Phone Data Dexter does not assert any specific objection to the  magistrate judge's analysis of probable cause for the  warrant affidavit for Dexter's DNA. After an independent  de novo review of the files, records and proceedings in  the above-entitled matter, the Court finds that the  search warrant for Dexter's DNA was supported by  probable cause. Dexter also did not assert any specific objections to the  magistrate judge's analysis of probable cause for the  warrant affidavits for the searches of Dexter's cell phone  and for the cell data stored by T-Mobile. After an  independent de novo review of the files, records and  proceedings in the above-entitled matter, the Court  finds [*18]  that there was probable cause for those  searches. E. Good-Faith Exception Moreover, even if probable cause did not exist, the  good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule would  apply here. Although evidence obtained in violation of  the Fourth Amendment must generally be excluded, if  officers obtained the evidence pursuant to a warrant and  reasonably relied on the issuing judge's probable cause  determination, the disputed evidence will be admitted.  United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 906, 104 S. Ct.  3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984); United States v.  Hudspeth, 525 F.3d 667, 676 (8th Cir. 2008). ""[T]he fact that a neutral [judge] has issued a warrant is  the clearest indication that the officers acted in an  objectively reasonable manner, or in objective good  faith."" Messerschmidt v. Millender, 565 U.S. 535, 546,  132 S. Ct. 1235, 182 L. Ed. 2d 47 (2012) (internal  quotation omitted). There is no evidence here to  suggest that the officers' reliance on the warrants was  unreasonable or not in good faith. Accordingly, even if  probable cause was lacking with respect to the search  warrant affidavits, the evidence is admissible under the  good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule. F. No-Knock Warrant Dexter maintains that the no-knock warrant executed at  his residence violated his Fourth Amendment rights.  (Obj. at 6.) The Eighth Circuit has held that the  requirements for a valid search warrant under the  Fourth  Amendment  incorporate  the  common-law  requirement that police [*19]  officers entering a dwelling  must ""knock and announce"" their presence and purpose  before attempting forcible entry. Doran v. Eckold, 409  F.3d 958, 962-63 (8th Cir. 2005) (citing Wilson v.  Arkansas, 514 U.S. 927, 929, 115 S. Ct. 1914, 131 L.  Ed. 2d 976 (1995)); Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U.S.  385, 387, 117 S. Ct. 1416, 137 L. Ed. 2d 615 (1997).  However, the Fourth Amendment does not forbid all no- knock searches, ""[r]ather, it requires that searching  officers justify dispensing with the knock-and-announce  requirement."" U.S. v. Scroggins, 361 F.3d 1075, 1081  (8th Cir. 2004) (analyzing whether a no-knock warrant  was properly issued and executed). The showing that officers must make to obtain a no- knock warrant ""is the same showing they must make to  justify their own decision to dispense with the knock- and-announce requirement. Only the timing differs."" Id.  at 1082. A no-knock entry is justified if officers ""show  they had a reasonable suspicion that knocking and  announcing  their  presence  under  the  particular  circumstances would threaten officer safety, be futile, or  inhibit the investigation of the crime."" Id. Thus, when ""a  warrant applicant gives reasonable grounds to expect  futility or to suspect that one or another such exigency  already exists or will arise instantly upon knocking, a  magistrate judge is acting within the Constitution to  authorize a 'no-knock' entry."" U.S. v. Banks, 540 U.S.  31, 36 (2003), 124 S. Ct. 521, 157 L. Ed. 2d 343. First, to the extent that Dexter asks the Court to find that  the magistrate judge misapplied Hudson v. Michigan,  547 U.S. 586, 126 S. Ct. 2159, 165 L. Ed. 2d 56 (2006),  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111, *16 Page 7 of 9 his objection [*20]  is overruled. As the magistrate judge  explained, the proper remedy for an improper no-knock  warrant is not to exclude evidence retrieved during the  search. (R&R at 30-31.) Thus, this Court will not  suppress evidence retrieved during the execution of the  no-knock warrant. See also United States v. Gaver, 452  F.3d 1007, 1008 (8th Cir. 2006) (citing Hudson, 547  U.S. at 589-90) (""The exclusionary rule does not apply  to violations of the knock-and-announce requirement of  the Fourth Amendment.""). The Court also notes that the unannounced entry  authorized by the search warrant was appropriate given  information in the affidavit suggesting that there were  likely firearms in Dexter's residence and that others had  access to his residence, and thus those firearms. See  United States v. Stevens, 439 F.3d 983, 988-989 (8th  Cir. 2006) (finding that a no-knock search warrant was  justified based on the presence of a firearm in a  common area of the house as reported by a confidential  informant). Additionally, the affidavit contained sufficient  averments that officers were concerned that evidence  would be destroyed during the execution of the warrant.  (USA Decl., Ex. 4 (""Vehicle and Residence Warrant"") at  9 (""Your affiant knows from previous investigations that  individuals who are engaged in the promotion of  prostitution  and  sexual  assault  crimes  maintain  methods [*21]  to destroy evidence in a rapid and  expedient manner. . . . An unannounced entry presents  a higher likelihood to allow police to gain entry and  control any suspects prior to them having the  opportunity to arm themselves or destroy evidence."").)  See U.S. v. Tyler, 238 F.3d 1036, 1040 (8th Cir. 2001)  (holding a no-knock warrant was appropriate when  officers attested that a defendant was likely to destroy  evidence of his drug crimes). Accordingly, the no-knock  warrant did not violate Dexter's Fourth Amendment  rights. G. There is No Evidence of Vindictive or Selective  Prosecution Dexter objects to the magistrate judge's finding that  there is no evidence of selective or vindictive  prosecution. He alleges that he has established he is  the victim of selective prosecution based on the  disparate treatment of his co-conspirator, L.G. (Obj. at  8-9.) He further contends that the Government sought a  superseding indictment because he refused to sign a  plea agreement, which he argues establishes a  presumption of vindictive prosecution. (Id. at 9.) 1. There is No Evidence to Support a Claim Of  Selective Prosecution A defendant asserting a claim of selective prosecution  must demonstrate: ""[(1)] that he has been singled out for  prosecution while others similarly situated [*22]  have  not been prosecuted for similar conduct and [(2)] that  the government's action in thus singling him out was  based on an impermissible motive such as race,  religion, or the exercise of constitutional rights."" United  States v. Leathers, 354 F.3d 955, 963 (8th Cir. 2004)  (citation omitted). A defendant bears the burden of  proving that the government engaged in selective  prosecution. United States v. Hirsch, 360 F.3d 860, 864  (8th Cir. 2004). This ""evidentiary burden is a heavy  one."" U.S. v. Peterson, 652 F.3d 979, 981 (8th Cir.  2011) (citing Leathers, 354 F.3d at 961). Dexter has failed to show that persons similarly situated  to him were not prosecuted for similar conduct.  ""Defendants  are  similarly  situated  when  their  circumstances present no distinguishable legitimate  prosecutorial factors that might justify making different  prosecutorial decisions with respect to them."" United  States v. Heying, No. 14-cr-30 (JRT/SER), 2014 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 147499, 2014 WL 5286153, at *12 (D. Minn.  Aug. 15, 2014), report and recommendation adopted,  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147799, 2014 WL 5286155, at  *1, 7 (D. Minn. Oct. 15, 2014); see also United States v.  Smith, 231 F.3d 800, 810 (11th Cir. 2000) (holding that  individuals are similarly situated for purposes of a  selective  prosecution  claim  when,  among  other  requirements, they ""committed the same basic crime in  substantially the same manner as the defendant—so  that any prosecution of that individual would have the  same deterrence value and would be related in the  same way to the Government's enforcement priorities  and enforcement plan""). Moreover, the evidence [*23]   against the unprosecuted person must be ""as strong, or  stronger, than that against the defendant."" Smith, 231  F.3d at 810. As the magistrate judge discussed, there are marked  differences between Dexter's conduct here and L.G.'s  involvement. (R&R  at 33 (""[T]here are several  distinguishable legitimate prosecutorial factors that  justify the Government's decision to federally prosecute  Defendant and not L.G., including that, unlike the  Defendant, L.G. did not recruit the victim to perform  commercial sex acts, sexually assault the victim, or  arrange for sexual buyers from which he took half the  proceeds."").) The Court concludes that these issues are  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111, *19 Page 8 of 9 clearly ""distinguishable legitimate prosecutorial factors""  that preclude a finding that L.G. was similarly situated to  Dexter. Heying, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147499, 2014  WL 5286153, at *12. Nor has Dexter demonstrated that prosecutors acted  with discriminatory purpose. A defendant may not  simply assert that gender was a factor in a prosecutor's  decision, instead he must offer ""credible evidence"" of  impermissible motive. See Hirsch, 360 F.3d at 864.  Here, Dexter offers ""no credible evidence"" that gender  played a role in the Government's charging decisions,  Peterson, 652 F.3d at 981, and instead he offers  unsupported speculation and conjecture. Thus, Dexter  has failed to meet [*24]  the second prong. Because  Defendant has not met his burden with respect to either  element of his selective prosecution claim, his claim  fails, and his motion to dismiss based on selective  prosecution is denied. 2. There is No Evidence to Support a Claim Of  Vindictive Prosecution After offering Dexter a plea deal, which he refused, the  government sought a Superseding Indictment, charging  Dexter with two additional Counts: (1) sex trafficking by  force, fraud, and coercion and (2) use of an interstate  facility to promote unlawful activity. (Superseding  Indictment at 1-4.) Dexter contends that the decision to  seek a superseding indictment from the grand jury was  intended to punish him for refusing the plea deal. (Obj.  at 9.) ""Vindictive prosecution occurs when a prosecutor seeks  to punish a defendant solely for exercising a valid legal  right."" United States v. Williams, 793 F.3d 957, 963 (8th  Cir. 2015) (citing Leathers, 354 F.3d at 961). As the  Magistrate Judge noted, the Supreme Court has found  that due process is not violated when a prosecutor  carries out a threat made during plea negotiations to  have the accused reindicted on more serious charges if  he does not plead guilty. Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434  U.S. 357, 365, 98 S. Ct. 663, 54 L. Ed. 2d 604 (1978);  see also United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 102  S. Ct. 2485, 73 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1982) (finding no  presumption of vindictiveness where a defendant faced  additional charges [*25]  after he decided not to plead  guilty). A defendant bears a heavy burden ""to show that the  prosecution was vindictive, in light of the discretion  prosecutors are given in performing their duties."" United  States v. Robinson, 809 F.3d 991, 1000 (8th Cir. 2016).  The Court must remain ""mindful of the broad discretion  given to prosecutors in carrying out their duty to enforce  criminal statutes."" Leathers, 354 F.3d at 961 (citing  United States v. Kelley, 152 F.3d 881, 885-86 (8th Cir.  1998)). In the R&R, the magistrate judge properly observed that  charging a defendant with a more serious charge after  he declines to plead guilty to a lesser charge, without  more, does not violate due process. Bordenkircher, 434  U.S. at 363 (""[I]n the ""give-and-take"" of plea bargaining,  there is no such element of punishment or retaliation so  long as the accused is free to accept or reject the  prosecution's offer.""); Goodwin, 457 U.S. at 380 (""[J]ust  as a prosecutor may forgo legitimate charges already  brought in an effort to save the time and expense of  trial, a prosecutor may file additional charges if an initial  expectation that a defendant would plead guilty to lesser  charges proves unfounded."")). Thus, Dexter's claim for  vindictive prosecution fails. In sum, the Court fully agrees with the magistrate judge  that there is no basis to dismiss the Superseding  Indictment on grounds of vindictive prosecution. [*26]   Dexter's motion to dismiss on this basis is therefore  denied.",1
"United States v. Bhula, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233394","MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER Page 2 of 9   This matter is before the Court on Johnathan Craft's Motion for a Bill of [*2]  Particulars (Doc. 269), which  codefendant Kamal Bhula joined (Doc. 297). The Government responded in opposition (Doc. 271), to which  Defendant replied (Doc. 285). The Court held a hearing on the motion on December 15, 2022. After considering the  motion, briefs, arguments, and relevant law, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the motion as described  herein. A. BACKGROUND In November 2019, a federal grand jury returned a ten-count superseding indictment that charged Defendants with  conspiracy to commit sex trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1594(c) (Count 1); four substantive counts of sex  trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion (Counts 2-4) and benefiting financially from a sex trafficking venture  (Count 5) in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a); using a facility engaged in interstate commerce - the Best Choice Inn -  to carry out unlawful activity (Count 6) in violation of the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952(a); maintaining and conspiring  to maintain a drug-involved premises (Counts 7-8) in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 856; maintaining a drug- involved premises within 1,000 feet of a school in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 856 (Count 9); and, conspiracy to commit  money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h). See Superseding Indictment, Doc. 68, at 2-10. On April 14, 2022, Defendants moved for a [*3]  bill of particulars containing at least 46 requests for clarification of  the Superseding Indictment. According to Defendants, the Government has disclosed ""400 gigabytes of data, over  18,500 documents, 35 hours of audio recordings, 17 hours of video recordings, 18 excel spreadsheets with cell  phone and other records ... several boxes of hotel business records, and approximately 1400 people involved in the  government's investigation...."" Doc. 269, at 3. Without a bill of particulars, Defendants state that it will be  ""impossible to synthesize all of the unrelated and irrelevant discovery from the relevant discovery."" Id. On April 28, 2022, the Government responded that the Superseding Indictment tracks the statutory offenses in  detail to sufficiently notify Defendants of the charges against them and that the Government has already provided  substantial information via voluminous discovery and prior motion practice. For instance, the Government states  that the parties have engaged in ""significant pretrial litigation,"" including detention hearings, a James hearing, and  litigation of Fed. R. Evid. 412 and trial severance motion. Doc. 271 at 12. In each pleading and hearing, states the  Government, it has ""aired [*4]  [its] theory"" of Defendants' liability. Id. The Government therefore argues that the  combination of sufficiently specific allegations, abundant discovery, and prior motion practice has adequately  informed Defendants of the nature of the charges against them so that they can prepare their defenses, avoid  prejudicial surprise at trial and plead double jeopardy as a bar to further prosecution. On May 13, 2022, Defendants replied. They argue that the sheer volume of discovery makes a bill of particulars  even more necessary since it inhibits their preparation of trial. In addition, Defendants state that they are entitled to  know, through a bill of particulars, the identities of the Jane Does in indictment. See Doc. 285, 5. B. LEGAL STANDARD    2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233394, *1 Page 3 of 9   Under Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1), an indictment must contain a ""plain, concise, and definite written statement of the  essential facts constituting the offense charged."" An indictment is sufficient if it meets certain ""minimal constitutional  standards,"" United States v. Edwards, 782 F.3d 554, 562 (10th Cir. 2015), namely, it must ""set[ ] forth the elements  of the offense charged, put[ ] the defendant on fair notice of the charges against which he must defend, and enable[  ] the defendant to assert a double jeopardy defense."" United States v. Chisum, 502 F.3d 1237, 1244 (10th Cir.  2007). ""Therefore, where [*5]  the indictment quotes the language of a statute and includes the date, place, and  nature of illegal activity, it need not go further and allege in detail the factual proof that will be relied upon to support  the charges."" United States v. Redcorn, 528 F.3d 727, 733 (10th Cir. 2008) (quoting United States v. Dunn, 841  F.2d 1026, 1029 (10th Cir. 1988)); United States v. Doe, 572 F.3d 1162, 1173-74 (10th Cir. 2009) (""The indictment  need only ""quote[ ] the language of a statute and include[ ] the date, place, and nature of illegal activity."") If an indictment does not comply with Rule 7(c)(1), then Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(f) provides that ""[a] court may direct the  government to file a bill of particulars."" Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(f). ""A bill of particulars is a formal written statement by the  prosecutor providing details of the charges against the defendant."" Charles Alan Wright & Andrew D. Leipold,  Federal Practice & Procedure: Criminal § 130 (4th ed. 2008). A defendant can move for such a bill ""before or within  14 days after arraignment or at a later time if the court permits."" Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(f). The purpose of a bill of  particulars is ""to inform the defendant of the nature of the charge against him with sufficient precision to enable him  to prepare for trial, to avoid or minimize the danger of surprise at the time of trial and to enable him to plead his  acquittal or conviction in bar of another prosecution for the same offense when the indictment [*6]  itself is too  vague and indefinite for such purposes."" Wyatt v. United States, 388 F.2d 395, 397 (10th Cir. 1968). A defendant is ""not entitled to know all the evidence the government intends to produce, but only the theory of the  government's case,"" and therefore ""the district court [does] not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion  for a bill of particulars where defendant has been served with a sufficient indictment."" United States v. Levine, 983  F.2d 165, 167 (10th Cir. 1992); United States v. Ivy, 83 F.3d 1266, 1281 (10th Cir. 1996) (""if the indictment sets  forth the elements of the offense charged and sufficiently apprised the defendant of the charges to enable him to  prepare for trial"" then a bill of particulars is ""not necessary."") A bill of particulars may not be used as a discovery  device. Dunn, 841 F.2d at 1029; see also United States v. Barbieri, 614 F.2d 715, 719 (10th Cir. 1980) (a bill of  particulars may not be used as a ""request for evidentiary detail."") Another consideration in deciding whether  particulars should be granted is whether other sources, such as discovery, are already available to a defendant  before trial. See United States v. Sturmoski, 971 F.2d 452, 460 (10th Cir. 1992) (district court did not abuse its  discretion in denying bill of particulars where defendant received full discovery and showed no prejudice). Grant or  denial of a bill of particulars is within the trial court's discretion. United States v. Hedges, 458 F.2d 188, 191 (10th  Cir. 1972). C. ANALYSIS Defendants' motion requests at least 46 discrete particulars [*7]  detailing the allegations described in Counts 1  through 10. The Court will analyze the counts in the following order: the Conspiracy Counts (Counts 1, 7, 10); the  Sex Trafficking Counts (Counts 2-5); the Travel Act Count (Count 6); and the Maintenance of a Drug Premises  Counts (8-9). Conspiracy Counts (Counts 1, 7, 10)     2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233394, *4 Page 4 of 9   Count 1 charges Defendants with conspiracy to commit sex trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a) and  1594(c). Under § 1591(a), whoever knowingly ""recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains, advertises,  maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any means a person; or benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value,  from participation in a venture which has engaged in"" any of these acts shall be punished. 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). The relevant language of Count 1 is as follow: Beginning ... no later than on or about September 2017, and continuing to on or about June 18, 2019, in  Bernalillo County, in the District of New Mexico, and elsewhere, the defendants, KAMAL BHULA, JOHNATHAN  CRAFT, EDDIE HILL, WILLIE HORTON, and PRAGNESHKUMAR ""PETE"" PATEL ... did knowingly ... conspire  ... with each other and with other persons whose names are known and unknown to the Grand Jury to recruit,  entice, harbor, transport, provide, [*8]  obtain, and maintain women by any means, and to benefit, financially  and by receiving anything of value, from participating in a venture which has engaged in recruiting, enticing,  harboring, transporting, providing, obtaining, and maintain women by any means, known ... that means of  force, threats of force, fraud, and coercion would be used to cause Jane Does 1, 2, and 3 to engage in  commercial sex acts .... Superseding Indictment, Doc. 68, at 2 (bold font omitted). Defendants claims that the Superseding Indictment is vague and ask for the following eight requests concerning  Count 1: (a) When did Mr. Craft join the alleged conspiracy to commit sex trafficking? (b) When did he actually participate in the conspiracy? (c) With whom did Mr. Craft conspire under this count? (d) Who was the person for Mr. Craft's alleged conspiracy under this count that was purportedly 'recruited,  enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, or maintained? Who were the victims of Mr. Craft's  conduct? (e) What sort of value did Mr. Craft obtain from the conspiracy? (f) How did Mr. Craft know that women were being maintain by means of force, threats of force, fraud, or  coercion? Do all subsections apply? (g) [*9]  What conduct constituted Mr. Craft's participation in the conspiracy? (h) What are the true identities of Jane Does 1, 2, and 3? Doc. 269, at 10-11. Defendants make similar - if not identical - requests for details concerning the other conspiracy counts of the  Superseding Indictment, Count 7 (conspiracy to maintain a drug premises) and Count 10 (conspiracy to commit  money laundering). The Court denies Defendants' requests (a), (b), (c), (e), (f) and (g) of Count 1 because those are requests for  details of the conspiracy that Defendants are not entitled to obtain through a bill of particulars. ""'[T]he general rule in  conspiracy cases is that the defendant is not entitled to obtain detailed information about the conspiracy in a bill of  particulars.'"" United States v. Sanford Ltd., 841 F. Supp. 2d 309, 317 (D.D.C. 2012) (quoting United States v. Diaz,  303 F. Supp. 2d 84, 89 (D. Conn. 2004)). The rationale for this rule is that it is not the prosecution's burden at trial  to establish a precise chronology as to when each defendant joined a conspiracy or how the defendant's acts  furthered that conspiracy. See United States v. Bin Laden, 92 F. Supp. 2d 225, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). Courts  therefore generally deny motions seeking particulars about the ""whens,"" ""wheres"" and ""with whoms"" regarding a  conspiracy. United States v. Ray, No. 20-CR-110 (LJL), 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139880, 2021 WL 3168250, at *6  (S.D.N.Y. July 27, 2021) (""A criminal defendant is not entitled to a bill of particulars setting forth the 'whens,' [*10]   'wheres,' and 'with whoms' regarding [a] conspiracy."") (citation internal quotation marks omitted); United States v.  Galloway, No. 1:17-CR-01235-WJ, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100775, 2018 WL 2994409, at *3 (D.N.M. June 14, 2018)  (denying motion for a bill of particulars because ""[t]he Government is not required to prove exactly 'when or how a  conspiracy was formed or when a particular defendant joined the scheme....'"") (quoting Bin Laden, 92 F. Supp. 2d  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233394, *7 Page 5 of 9   at 242). Moreover, this applies when the indictment labels coconspirators as ""known and unknown."" Ray, 2021 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 139880, 2021 WL 3168250, at *6 (""the law has long been clear that the Government is not required to  specify those 'known and unknown' by a bill of particulars."") Defendants' requests (a), (b), (c), (e), (f) and (g) are  ""whens,"" ""wheres"" and ""with whoms"" regarding a conspiracy that Defendants may not obtain through a bill of  particulars. This ruling applies equally to Defendants' requests for details of the conspiracies alleged in Counts 7  and 10. Therefore, Defendants' requests (a), (b), (c), (d) of Count 7 are denied. The Court also denies Defendants'  requests (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) of Count 10. The Court will, however, require the Government to provide a bill of particulars to Defendants concerning  Defendants' requests (d) and (h) which seek information of the identities of persons, including victims, identified in  the Superseding [*11]  Indictment. The Government argues that Defendants essentially know the victims' identities  by now. Even if that is true, the Court believes that fundamental fairness dictates that a bill of particulars identifying  the victims of offenses that the Government intends to prove at trial is warranted. In summary, Defendants' requests (d) and (h) concerning Count 1 are granted; the balance of Defendants' requests  are denied. The Government will provide the bill to Defendants within seven days of entry of this Order. Counts 2 - 5 (Substantive Counts of Sex Trafficking) Counts 2-4 charge Defendants with substantive counts of sex trafficking Jane Does 1, 2, and 3 by force, threats,  coercion. The Counts differ only in the victim and timeframe. Each count states that Defendants ""did knowingly  recruit, entice, harbor, transport, provide, obtain and maintain by any means a person, [Jane Doe 1, 2, or 3],  knowing and in reckless disregard of the fact that means of force, threats of force, fraud, and coercion would be  used to cause [Jane Doe 1, 2, or 3] to engage in a commercial sex act."" Superseding Indictment at 3, Doc. 68.  Count 5 charges Defendants with a subpart of § 1591(a) for benefiting financially for [*12]  sex trafficking. Defendants pose the following requests for particulars for Counts 2 - 5 - which vary from details of the commission  of the crime, what financial benefits accrued to Mr. Craft, questions of aiding and abetting liability, and the identity of  the victims: (a) When did Mr. Craft actually engage in this conduct? (b) Is it alleged that Mr. Craft actually committed sex trafficking? (c) How did Mr. Craft aid and abet others in committing sex trafficking? (d) If Mr. Craft was only aiding and abetting others, who was the principal actor? (e) Who was the person for Mr. Craft's alleged trafficked or aided or abetted to be trafficked, recruited, enticed,  harbored, transported, provided, obtained, or maintained? Which did Mr. Craft do or help do? (f) Who is Jane Doe 1? (g) How did Mr. Craft engage in or help others engage in .... maintaining women by means of force, threats of  force, fraud, or coercion? Do all subsections apply? Concerning Count 5, Defendants repeat their requests for victims' identities in requests (d) and (e) and also pose  an additional question(s) about the financial details of Mr. Craft's alleged crime: (g) What is the government's theory regarding Mr. Craft financially [*13]  benefiting from sex trafficking? Does  the government suggest that Mr. Craft received money? That his salary was inconsistent? That his wages were  not hourly based, but rather based upon a nexus to sex trafficking? Defs'. Mot., Doc. 269 at 11-12. 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233394, *10 Page 6 of 9   The Court grants Defendants' requests (e) and (f) of Counts 2-4 and requests (d) and (e) of Count 5 because these  are requests for victims' identities that the Defendants are entitled to know, as explained supra. Concerning Defendants' requests for information about aiding and abetting liability described in (c) and (d), the  Court grants Defendants' request (c) for Counts 2-4. Although aiding and abetting is not an independent crime  under 18 U.S.C. § 2, see United States v. Cook, 745 F.2d 1311, 1315 (10th Cir. 1984), the problem is that Counts  2-4 only mention 18 U.S.C. § 2 without setting forth any aiding and abetting allegations. Cf. Edwards, 782 F.3d at  563 (upholding indictment which stated that two defendants ""did aid and abet one another to unlawfully, knowingly  and intentionally possess with the intent to distribute"" marijuana and methamphetamine). The Government  therefore will issue a bill of particulars setting forth sufficient aiding and abetting allegations under these counts. Concerning Defendants' request (d), which is also based on aiding [*14]  and abetting liability, the Government has  no obligation to respond to this request. ""[A]n aider and abettor may be charged and convicted as a principal."" Id.  (citation omitted). ""As such, the fact that an indictment charges two defendants with aiding and abetting one another  to commit a crime does not limit the government to a conviction based solely on a theory of aiding and abetting."" Id.  The Government is not obligated to answer whether Mr. Craft was ""only"" an aider and abettor and the identity of the  principal given that the Defendants can be charged as aiders and abettors and, in the alternative, principals. The remainder of Defendants' requests are also denied. ""An indictment is sufficient if it sets forth the elements of  the offense charged,"" which is the case here. United States v. Washington, 653 F.3d 1251, 1259 (10th Cir. 2011).  Counts 2-4 track the language of the underlying statutory offense on which they are based. Compare Counts 2-4 of  the Superseding Indictment, Doc. 68, with 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1) (""[w]hoever knowingly ... recruits, entices,  harbors, transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any means a person ... in  reckless disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion ... or any [*15]  combination of  such means will be used to cause the person to engage in a commercial sex act,"" shall be punished). Similarly,  Count 5 charges Defendants with a subpart of § 1591(a) for ""benefiting financially"" for sex trafficking and tracks  the statutory language of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2), (b)(1). Finally, the Government plausibly states that it has laid out  its theory of the case in discovery, motion practice, and hearings. Defendants have therefore been apprised of the  Government's theory through other available sources. In summary, the Court grants Defendants' requests (c), (e), and (f) of Counts 2-4 and request (d) and (e) of Count  5; the remainder of Defendants' requests are denied. The Government will issue the bill of particulars within seven  days of entry of this Order. Count 6: Travel Act Violation Count 6 charges Defendants with a violation of the Travel Act, which prescribes criminal penalties to anyone who  ""travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses the mail or any facility in interstate or foreign commerce, with  intent to ... otherwise promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment,  or carrying on, of any unlawful activity."" 18 U.S.C. § 1952 (a)(3)(A). The statute lists a number of predicate crimes  that [*16]  qualify as ""unlawful activity,"" including ""any business enterprise involving ... narcotics or controlled  substances ... or prostitution offenses in violation of the laws of the State in which they are committed or of the  United States."" Id. § 1952(b). A Travel Act violation requires proof that the defendant: ""(1) traveled or used facilities  in interstate commerce; (2) with the intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on or facilitate the promotion,  management, establishment, or carrying on of a prohibited activity; and (3) thereafter attempted to or did in fact  engage in one of the proscribed activities."" United States v. Johnson, 961 F.2d 1488, 1491 (10th Cir. 1992). Defendants make the following seven requests concerning Count 6: (a) When did Mr. Craft actually engage in this conduct?   2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233394, *13 Page 7 of 9   (b) Who did Mr. Craft cause to travel? Who did Mr. Craft aid in this conduct? (c) Who purportedly travelled? (d) Is it alleged that Mr. Craft knowingly engaged in racketeering? (e) What was the underlying conduct alleged as racketeering? (f) How did Mr. Craft aid and abet others in racketeering? (g) If Mr. Craft was only aiding and abetting others, who was the principal actor? Defs.' Mot., Doc. 260 at 12. For the same reasons explained in the analysis concerning the allegations [*17]  in Counts 2-4, the Court will grant  Defendants' request (f) of Count 6 because the count mentions 18 U.S.C. § 2 (the aiding and abetting statute) but  does not actually set forth set forth aiding and abetting allegations. The Court will thus order that the Government  issue a bill of particulars setting forth sufficient aiding and abetting allegations under this count. The Court will deny Defendants' request (b) and (c) even though there seems to be some uncertainty on the part of  Defendants regarding the Government's theory of Count 6. A violation of the Travel Act can be based on traveling  in interstate commerce or using the mail or using a facility in interstate commerce with the intent to promote  unlawful activity. See 18 U.S.C. § 1952 (a)(3)(A). Defendants' requests indicate they may not be entirely clear about  the Government's theories since the requests are based on details regarding traveling in interstate commerce.  However, the Court finds the Superseding Indictment makes clear the Government's theory is that Defendants  knowingly used a facility or facilities in interstate commerce with intent to carry on unlawful activity, not that  Defendants traveled in interstate commerce with the intent to promote unlawful activity. The [*18]  Court will  therefore deny Defendants' request (b) and (c). The rest of Defendants' requests concerning Count 6 are also denied. As for requests (d) and (e), the Superseding  Indictment already provides Defendants notice of the answers they seek. The Superseding Indictment defines the  ""unlawful activity"" at issue by specifically referring to two statutes defining ""unlawful activity."" Compare § 1952  (a)(3)(A) (""[w]hoever ... uses ... any facility in interstate commerce ... to ... carry on, or facilitate the promotion,  management, establishment, or carrying on, of any unlawful activity.""), with Superseding Indictment, Doc. 68 at 4-5  (Defendants ""knowingly used ... one or more facilities ... to ... carry on ... an unlawful activity, that is a business  enterprise involving narcotics and controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. 846 §§ 856(a) and 860(a) and  prostitution offenses in violation of the laws of the state of New Mexico, N.M. Stat Ann. §§ 30-9-2, 30-9-3-, 30-9-4,  and 30-9-4.1""). The Superseding Indictment therefore complies with the Travel Act's requirement of allegations of  ""a prohibited activity,"" Johnson, 961 F.2d at 1491, since it specifically refers to state prostitution laws and federal  drug laws. The Tenth Circuit's decision in United States v. Barbieri, 614 F.2d 715, 719 (10th Cir. 1980) also demonstrates that  the Superseding Indictment sufficiently [*19]  puts Defendants on notice of the charges. In Barbieri, the Tenth  Circuit upheld denial of a bill of particulars motion which sought information about, among other things, ""[t]he  specific event, facts, conduct, or circumstances"" of a Travel Act violation and ""the exact nature of the facts or acts .  . . which establish[ed] that defendant allegedly conspired to and did travel in interstate commerce . . . , and the  names and addresses of the witnesses to said facts or acts"" because the indictment listed the identity of the  conspirators, it detailed overt acts, and it specified the interstate facilities used. Like the indictment in Barbieri, the  Superseding Indictment specifies that the Best Choice Inn was the interstate facility in question, contains an overt  acts section, and it identifies the codefendants by name. Because the Superseding Indictment sufficiently informs  Defendants of the nature of the allegations against them, the remainder of Defendants' requests are denied. In summary, within seven days of entry of this Order, the Government will provide a bill of particulars answering  request (f) of Count 6. The remainder of Defendants' requests concerning Count 6 are denied. Counts 8-9 Maintenance [*20]  of a Drug Premises Count 8 charges Defendants with a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 856(a)(1), which prohibits ""knowingly ... maintain[ing]  any place, whether permanently or temporarily, for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using any  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233394, *16 Page 8 of 9   controlled substance."" To obtain a § 856(a)(1) conviction, the government must prove ""that the defendant (1)  knowingly (2) opened or maintained a place (3) for the purpose of manufacturing by repackaging, distributing, or  using any controlled substance."" United States v. Verners, 53 F.3d 291, 295 (10th Cir. 1995). Count 9 is based on the Drug Free School Zones Act, which increases penalties for an § 856(a)(1) violation  occurring with 1,000 feet of certain places like schools or playgrounds. The Act provides that ""[a]ny person who  violates section 856 ... by distributing, possessing with intent to distribute ... a controlled substance ... within one  thousand feet of, the real property comprising a public or private elementary,"" shall be subjected to enhanced  penalties. 21 U.S.C. § 860(a). In order to prove a 21 U.S.C. § 860(a) violation, ""the government must prove beyond  a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly and intelligently possessed a controlled substance with the intent  to distribute and possessed those drugs within 1,000 feet of a school."" United States v. Stephens, 23 F.3d 553,  555, 306 U.S. App. D.C. 245 (D.C. Cir. 1994). Defendants seek the following seven request [*21]  for particulars about Counts 8 and 9: (a) When did Mr. Craft actually engage in this conduct? (b) How is it alleged that Mr. Craft maintained a property? (c) How did Mr. Craft aid and abet others, in an illegal manner, in maintaining a property? (d) If Mr. Craft was only aiding and abetting others, who was the principal actor? (e) Who is alleged to have sold drugs at the property? (f) When was the property knowingly used to sell drugs? By whom? (g) Who bought the drug[s] alleged to have been sold at the property? Defs.' Mot. at 13, Doc. 269. For the same reasons explained in the analysis concerning the allegations in previous counts, the Court will grant  Defendants' request (c) of Count 8 because the count mentions 18 U.S.C. § 2 (the aiding and abetting statute) but  does not actually set forth set forth aiding and abetting allegations. The Court will thus order that the Government  issue a bill of particulars setting forth sufficient aiding and abetting allegations under this count. The remainder of Defendants' requests for particulars for Counts 8-9 are denied. The Superseding Indictment  tracks the elements of the statutory offenses by stating that on or about September 2017 through June 18, 2019,  Defendants [*22]  ""knowingly ... opened, leased, rented, used, and maintained,"" the Best Choice Inn, and  ""managed and controlled"" the premises by ""renting, leasing, profiting from, and making it available for the purpose  of"" storing, distributing, and using methamphetamine and heroin within 1,000 feet of PB&J, a public elementary,  and within 1,000 feet of All Seasons Day School, a private elementary. Doc. 68 at 6. These allegations are sufficient  to inform Defendants of the charges against them so they can prepare for trial. Moreover, the Government has  plausibly stated that it has detailed its theory of the case and counts in discovery, motion practice, and hearings and  therefore Defendants are on notice of the Government's theories concerning Counts 8-9.",1
G.G. v. Salesforce,"[*629]  MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER When G.G. was thirteen years old, she ran away from  home and fell into the hands of a sex trafficker. The  trafficker posted advertisements for sex with G.G. on  the classified ad website run by Backpage.com  [*630]   (""Backpage"").  As  alleged  in  the  complaint,  Backpage [**2]  did not just allow but encouraged these  types of illegal ads, to the point of becoming a dominant  force in online sex trafficking. Beginning in 2013,  Backpage contracted with Defendant Salesforce.com,  Inc.  (""Salesforce"")  to  provide  it  with  customer  relationship management (""CRM"") business software  and support. That relationship allegedly helped grow  Backpage's  operations,  including  promoting  the  business of sex traffickers. G.G. and her mother,  Deanna Rose, (together, ""Plaintiffs"") have now sued  Salesforce pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1595, alleging that,  through its contracts with Backpage, Salesforce violated  the federal anti-trafficking laws by knowingly benefiting  from and participating in a venture that it knew, or  should have known, was engaged in illegal sex  trafficking. Salesforce has filed a motion to dismiss the  complaint in its entirety pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil  Procedure 12(b)(6). (Dkt. No. 63.) For the reasons given  below, the Court grants the motion. BACKGROUND      Page 2 of 15 For purposes of Salesforce's motion to dismiss, the  Court accepts as true all well-pleaded facts in the Third  Amended Complaint (""TAC"") and views those facts in  the light most favorable to Plaintiffs as the non-moving  parties. Killingsworth v. HSBC Bank Nev., N.A., 507  F.3d 614, 618 (7th Cir. 2007). The TAC alleges as  follows. Backpage [**3]  was established in 2004 as an online  marketplace for various goods and services. (TAC ¶ 16,  Dkt. No. 62.) Among other things, Backpage allowed  classified ads for sex. (Id.) In 2008, Backpage's primary  competitor, Craigslist, made it harder for users to post  ads for sex on its platform. Capitalizing on the displaced  ad volume, Backpage entered into a period of explosive  growth, soon becoming the most popular online  classified site for adult advertisements and deriving the  vast majority (up to 99%) of its revenue from such ads.  (Id. ¶¶ 16, 23-24.) Salesforce is the world's top CRM platform, selling  software to help companies manage their relationships  with customers, improve profitability, and streamline  processes. (Id. ¶¶ 29-30.) Specifically, Salesforce sells  ""software as a service"" (""SaaS"") technology consisting  of a set of applications that, among other things, can  help businesses manage sales and marketing functions,  assist with customer service and support, provide  customer data integration and support, permit both  internal communications and communications with  customers, offer business intelligence analytics, and  process other forms of data. (Id. ¶ 31.) The Salesforce  platform [**4]  also has a ""customer org""—that is, a  portal that serves as a point of interaction between  Salesforce and its customers. (Id. ¶ 32.) The customer  org is confidential to each Salesforce customer and  consists of that customer's users, data, and automation.  (Id.) Additionally, to help its customers achieve their  business goals, Salesforce also provides personalized  support. (Id. ¶ 33.) As Backpage grew, it required more support and better  CRM tools and capabilities to keep up with customer  demand and scale its platform. (Id. ¶ 35.) To meet this  need, Backpage contracted with Salesforce in 2013. (Id.  ¶ 37.) As set forth in the Master Service Agreements  between Salesforce and Backpage, Salesforce retained   [*631]  the right to delete or restrict access to  Backpage's customer org if Backpage's actions or  content was tortious. (Id. ¶ 47.) During their negotiations  in November 2013, Backpage's Chief Executive Officer  (""CEO"") Carl Ferrer and another high-level executive  met with a certified Salesforce Consulting Partner to  assess Backpage's needs and goals as a business and  to determine how Salesforce could help. (Id. ¶ 53.) An  in-house Salesforce account executive continued those  conversations, which [**5]  eventually culminated in a  deal between the companies. (Id. ¶ 54.) Over the next  five years, Salesforce sold Backpage access to several  products, including the premium ""Enterprise Edition"" of  its CRM software. (Id.) An in-house Salesforce  executive recommended the Enterprise Edition, which is  described as ""fully customizable."" (Id. ¶ 45.) And, in  2015,  Salesforce  provided  the  technological  infrastructure for Backpage to move its business  overseas, allegedly to help it evade law enforcement  scrutiny in the United States. (Id. ¶ 46.) Overall,  Backpage purchased a new application, requested  support, or renewed a contract with Salesforce on at  least five occasions. (Id. ¶ 48.) Each of those times,  Backpage consulted with Salesforce about how best to  assess and meet its operational needs. (Id.) Using the sophisticated CRM tools, as well as platform  support, provided by Salesforce, Backpage was able to  scale its operations and expand its business. (Id. ¶¶ 39- 42.) The nature of those operations—and Salesforce's  knowledge of them—are at the center of the present  lawsuit. Plaintiffs allege that Backpage was primarily (or  even solely) a sex-trafficking business. As early as  2008, Backpage had [**6]  been publicly identified by  law enforcement and state and federal officials as being  associated with sex trafficking. (Id. ¶ 18.) And over the  next decade, Backpage faced calls to remove its adult  services section by, among others, a group of state  attorneys general. Backpage refused, resisting efforts to  shut down its site on First Amendment grounds. (Id. ¶  21.) Yet, even in the midst of persistent controversy and  allegations regarding sex trafficking on Backpage,  Salesforce continued to provide software and support to  Backpage throughout this period. (Id. ¶ 50.) Eventually, Backpage and its corporate leadership faced  federal criminal charges. (Id. ¶¶ 25-26.) Backpage's  CEO pleaded guilty to charges that he conspired to  facilitate prostitution using a facility in interstate or  foreign commerce and engaged in money laundering,  while the corporation pleaded guilty to conspiring to  engage in money laundering. (Id. ¶¶ 25 n.17, 26 n.18;  see also Plea Agreement, United States v. Ferrer, No.  2:18-cr-00464-DJH (D. Ariz. Apr. 5, 2018); Plea  Agreement, United States v. Backpage, No. 2:18-cr- 00465-DJH (D. Ariz. Apr. 5, 2018.) As part of its plea  agreement with the government, Backpage admitted to  having operated [**7]  as a site for the sale of illegal sex  and to receiving benefits from the sex trafficking of  603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *630; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **2 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *630; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **2 Page 3 of 15 minors. (Id. ¶¶ 26-27.) G.G. was one of those sex-trafficking victims. In 2016,  when she was thirteen years old, G.G. ran away from  home and was soon picked up by her trafficker. (Id. ¶¶  74, 76.) While searching for her daughter, Rose found  an ad featuring G.G. on Backpage's Escort Page. (Id.)  Rose notified Backpage that G.G., a child, was being  advertised for sex on their website and requested that  the ads be taken down. (Id.) Backpage, however, did  not remove the ads and instead merely referred Rose to  the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  (Id.) Although G.G. is no longer under the control of her  trafficker,  she  suffered  significant  physical  and  emotional injuries as a result of her tragic ordeal and still  suffers from the effects of  [*632]  being trafficked at  such a young age. (Id. ¶ 79.) DISCUSSION To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must  contain sufficient factual allegations to ""state a claim to  relief that is plausible on its face."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556  U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868  (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.  544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). In  evaluating a motion to dismiss, the Court accepts as  true all well-pleaded facts and draws all reasonable  inferences from those facts [**8]  in the plaintiff's favor.  Bell v. City of Country Club Hills, 841 F.3d 713, 716 (7th  Cir. 2016). While a complaint need not contain detailed  factual allegations, there ""must be enough to raise a  right to relief above the speculative level."" Twombly, 550  U.S. at 545.""A claim has facial plausibility when the  plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to  draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is  liable for the misconduct alleged."" Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at  678. Federal law provides for both criminal sanctions against  sex traffickers and civil remedies for victims of sex  trafficking. Relevant to this case, 18 U.S.C. § 1591  creates both primary and secondary liability for the sex  trafficking of minors, and 18 U.S.C. § 1595 allows any  victim of such trafficking to sue for damages.  Specifically, § 1595 allows victims of sex trafficking  violations under § 1591 to ""bring a civil action against  the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in violation of  [§ 1591]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Beyond the requirement  that there be an underlying violation of § 1591, a plaintiff  seeking to impose liability under § 1595 must establish  that the defendant (1) knowingly benefited from (2)  participating in a venture that (3) the person knew [**9]   or should have known violated § 1591. See M.A. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959,  969 (S.D. Oh. 2019). Here, Plaintiffs seek to hold Salesforce liable under §  1591 for the trafficking of G.G. by her trafficker as  facilitated by Backpage. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege  that a sex trafficker used ads on Backpage to traffic  G.G., a minor, in violation of § 1591. Plaintiffs further  allege that Backpage facilitated and assisted the use of  its site by sex traffickers such as the one who trafficked  G.G., and that Salesforce, in turn, helped Backpage  expand its business with those sex traffickers.  Salesforce asks this Court to dismiss Plaintiffs'  complaint against it for two reasons: first, Salesforce  contends that Plaintiffs' claims are barred by the  affirmative defense to liability under § 1595 provided by  § 230 of the Communications Decency Act (""CDA""), 47  U.S.C. § 230; and second, Salesforce argues that  Plaintiffs have failed to state an actionable claim under  18 U.S.C. § 1595. As the defense under § 230, if  applicable, is determinative and would warrant dismissal  with prejudice, the Court begins its analysis there. I. Section 230 Section 230 acts as a bar against liability for certain  types of claims against certain defendants—specifically,  it provides that ""[n]o provider or user of an interactive  computer service shall [**10]  be treated as the  publisher or speaker of any information provided by  another information content provider."" 47 U.S.C. §  230(c)(1). Thus, so long as a defendant can establish  that it is (1) a provider or user of an interactive computer  service and (2) the claims against it seek to treat it as a  publisher of a third party's content,  [*633]  § 230 will bar  those claims. See Chi. Lawyers' Comm. for Civ. Rights  Under Law, Inc. v. Craigslist, Inc., 519 F.3d 666, 671  (7th Cir. 2008) (explaining that ""[w]hat § 230(c)(1) says  is that an online information system must not 'be treated  as the publisher or speaker of any information provided  by' someone else"" for purposes of establishing liability).  Specifically in the context of sex trafficking claims,  including under § 1595, courts have found that § 230  precludes liability where the allegations are predicated  on  the  posting  of  user  content—that  is,  the  advertisements trafficking the plaintiffs. See, e.g., M.A.  ex rel. P.K. v. Vill. Voice Media Hldgs, LLC, 809 F.  603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *631; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **7 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *631; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **7 Page 4 of 15 Supp. 2d. 1041, 1052, 1056 (holding that § 230 barred  claims against Backpage because there was ""no  allegation that Backpage was responsible for the  development of any portion of the content of the [sex  trafficker's] posted ads or specifically encouraged the  development of the offensive nature of that content."").  Section 230's protection against such claims, however,  is not absolute—as relevant here, Congress amended §  230 through the Allow States [**11]  and Victims to Fight  Online Sex Trafficking Act (""FOSTA"") to explicitly  exempt certain kinds of sex trafficking claims. FOSTA,  Pub. L. No. 115-164, 132 Stat. 1253 (2018). As a result,  § 230(e)(5)(A) now clarifies that ""nothing in this section .  . . shall be construed to impair or limit any claim in a civil  action brought under [§ 1595], if the conduct underlying  the claim constitutes a violation of [§ 1591]."" Section 230 functions as an affirmative defense. See,  Doe v. GTE Corp., 347 F.3d 655, 657 (7th Cir. 2003);  Bonilla v. Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., No. 20-C- 07390, 574 F. Supp. 3d 582, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  233870, 2021 WL 5795306, at *4 (N.D. Ill. 2021).  Typically, the existence of a potential affirmative  defense does not ""render the claim for relief invalid,""  and ""courts should usually refrain from granting Rule  12(b)(6) motions"" on that basis. Brownmark Films, LLC  v. Comedy Partners, 682 F.3d 687, 690 (7th Cir. 2012).  However, ""[a]n exception applies when the allegations  of the complaint set forth everything necessary to satisfy  the affirmative defense."" Hyson USA, Inc. v. Hyson 2U,  Ltd., 821 F.3d 935, 939 (7th Cir. 2016) (internal  quotation marks omitted). And courts often address the  question of § 230's applicability on a motion to dismiss.  See, e.g., Marshall's Locksmith Serv. Inc. v. Google,  LLC, 925 F.3d 1263, 1267, 441 U.S. App. D.C. 196  (D.C. Cir. 2019) (affirming dismissal of a complaint on §  230 grounds and citing cases in which courts had acted  similarly). As the D.C. Circuit explained in Marshall's  Locksmith Service, Inc., invocation of § 230 immunity in  a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is ""[c]onsistent with Congress'  intent to confer broad immunity for the re-publication of  third-party content."" Id.; see also Nemet Chevrolet, Ltd.  v. Consumeraffairs.com, Inc., 591 F.3d 250, 254 (4th  Cir. 2009) (""Section 230 immunity, like other [**12]   forms of immunity, is generally accorded effect at the  first logical point in the litigation process.""). Still, for a  defendant to raise the defense at the motion to dismiss  stage successfully, ""plaintiff[s] must affirmatively plead  [themselves] out of court."" Hyson USA, 821 F.3d at 939  (internal quotation marks omitted). Salesforce contends  that Plaintiffs here have done just that, arguing that the  allegations of the TAC unambiguously establish that §  230 precludes Plaintiffs' claims against it and that no  exception to § 230's protections apply. A. Salesforce as an Interactive Computer Service First, Salesforce asserts that it qualifies for § 230's  protections because it is a provider of an ""interactive  computer service."" Section 230 defines ""interactive   [*634]  computer service"" as ""any information service,  system, or access software provider that provides or  enables computer access by multiple users to a  computer server, including specifically a service or  system that provides access to the Internet."" 47 U.S.C.  § 230(f)(2). Salesforce argues that it falls under the  definition of ""access software provider,"" which is defined  as ""a provider of software (including client or server  software) or enabling tools which do any one or more of  the following: (a) filter, screen, [**13]  allow, or disallow  content; (b) pick, choose, analyze, or digest content; or  (c) transmit, receive, display, forward, cache, search,  subset, organize, reorganize, or translate content."" 47  U.S.C. § 230(f)(4). Indeed, applying the plain language of the statutory  definition to the allegations in the TAC, Salesforce  plainly qualifies as an ""interactive computer service."" At  oral argument on this motion, Plaintiffs conceded that  Salesforce is a software company, and the complaint  alleges that ""Backpage paid the money that it earned  from trafficking to Salesforce in exchange for the  Salesforce technology and support necessary for  Backpage to operate and expand its business."" (TAC ¶  77.) Looking further into details of the complaint, the  support Salesforce provided Backpage involved the  provision  of  technological  capabilities—specifically,  software that allowed Backpage employees to analyze  and digest customer data as well as applications  providing for the transmission of both internal employee  communications and external customer outreach and  support. Plaintiffs' claims can best be summarized             603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *633; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **10 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *633; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **10 Page 5 of 15 thusly: ""Salesforce provided support to Backpage in the  use of [Salesforce's sophisticated software and related]  technologies [**14]  and had knowledge of the manner  in which Backpage operated with these enhanced  capabilities."" (TAC ¶ 87(b).) Put differently, Salesforce,  through its software, provided multiple users access to a  set of enabling tools that allow those users to analyze,  organize, arrange, transmit, and display content  provided by a third-party (here, Backpage). This  description, which aligns with the statutory definition,  unambiguously establishes that Salesforce is an  ""interactive computer service.""  [*635]  Nonetheless, Plaintiffs argue that Salesforce  has not established that it is an interactive computer  service because it was not involved in the management  of content posted to Backpage. Instead, Plaintiffs  contend,  Salesforce  only  managed  relationships  between Backpage and its customers—most of whom,  Plaintiffs maintain, were sex traffickers. But managing  those relationships did require Salesforce to analyze  content—content provided by Backpage about its  customers. (See, e.g., TAC ¶ 87(f) (alleging [**16]  that  Salesforce ""provid[ed], assist[ed], support[ed], and  facilitat[ed] surveillance and analysis of customer and  user activity with regard to access to ads"").)                                To avoid this result, Plaintiffs ask the Court to read an  additional requirement into the statutory definition of  interactive  service  provider.  Specifically,  Plaintiffs  appear to take the position that § 230 only covers  providers who host publicly accessible platforms.  Salesforce's applications, of course, were only available  internally to Backpage employees. But nothing in either  the statutory text or case law supports this view. It is  true, as Plaintiffs note, that § 230 most commonly has  been applied to bar liability for defendants who host  public platforms. See, e.g., Bennett v. Google, LLC, 882  F.3d 1163, 1167-68, 434 U.S. App. D.C. 311 (D.C. Cir.  2018) (applying § 230 to bar claims against a public  internet search engine); Klayman v. Zuckerberg, 753  F.3d 1354, 1356-58, 410 U.S. App. D.C. 187 (D.C. Cir.  2014) (applying § 230 to bar claims against a social  networking website). But the mere fact that the  defendants that have successfully involved § 230 to  avoid liability have been publicly accessible does not  mean that such accessibility is a statutory requirement.  See, e.g., Fields v. Twitter, Inc., 217 F. Supp. 3d 1116,  1128 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (""[A] number of courts have  applied the CDA to bar claims predicated on a  defendant's transmission of nonpublic messages, and  have done so without [**17]  questioning whether the  CDA applies in such circumstances."" (citing cases)),  aff'd on other grounds, 881 F.3d 739 (9th Cir. 2018)). Zango v. Kaspersky Lab, Inc., 568 F.3d 1169 (9th Cir.  2009), to which both Plaintiffs and Salesforce cite, is  instructive. In Zango, the plaintiff ""propose[d] a gloss on  'interactive computer service' that would construe a  computer service as 'interactive' only if it enables people  to access the Internet or access content found on the  Internet."" Id. at 1175. Based on that construction, the  defendant, which distributed malware software, would  not fall under § 230's definition. Id. at 1172. The Ninth  Circuit, however, ""decline[d] to read the statute so  narrowly,"" explaining that, ""[a]s written, § 230 does not  limit the definition of 'interactive computer service' to  services that provide access to the Internet; rather, its  singular requirement is for 'access by multiple users to a  computer server.'"" Id. at 1175-76 (quoting § 230(f)(2)).  The Court finds this analysis persuasive. After all, if an  interactive computer service is defined as ""including  specifically a service or system that provides access to  the Internet,"" it is not necessarily limited to such  services. 47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(2). And in any event, as  alleged, Salesforce does provide access to its  applications through the Internet. (See TAC ¶ 45 n.20  (citing to ""Sales [**18]  Cloud Pricing"" when describing  the software edition used by Backpage).) 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *634; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **13 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *634; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **13 Page 6 of 15 Still, Plaintiffs insist that because Salesforce was not  involved in managing the content underlying their  claims—the ads posted on Backpage by G.G.'s sex  trafficker—§  230's  protections  cannot  apply  to  Salesforce. According to Plaintiffs' reading, § 230's  references to ""content"" must be understood not as  content generally but rather as the content underlying  the claim against the defendant. Using this logic,  Backpage, as the actual host of the content  [*636]  in  question, would be considered a provider of interactive  computer services, while Salesforce, whose applications  supported Backpage's internal operations, would not.  But the text of § 230 imposes no such requirement—an  interactive computer service must simply permit users to  interact with content, without any reference to what  content. Without a textual basis or supporting case law,  the Court declines to impose unilaterally a requirement  that whether a defendant is an ""interactive computer  service"" under § 230 depends on the nature of the  claims against it. Plaintiffs further assert that, at the very least, it is too  soon to decide the issue of whether Salesforce qualifies  as an interactive [**19]  computer service. Plaintiffs  contend that even if the Court is unable to hold that  Salesforce is not an interactive computer service as a  matter of law, discovery is still necessary to resolve the  question of whether Salesforce in fact is one. But the  allegations of the complaint make clear that Salesforce's  technology allows users (Backpage employees) to  manipulate content in a variety of ways, including by  analyzing  and  organizing  customer  data  and  transmitting messages between Backpage and potential  customers. When questioned during oral argument  about the benefits of allowing limited discovery on this  issue, Plaintiffs suggested that it could provide more  insight into what Salesforce's software was doing. Yet  the Plaintiffs already have provided a thorough overview  of Salesforce's technology in the TAC, suggesting that  they are already well-acquainted with the capabilities of  the software. Similarly, the TAC contains detailed  factual allegations regarding discussions between  Salesforce  and  Backpage  executives,  including  quotations  from  emails  between  Backpage  and  individuals associated with Salesforce. Given the  detailed allegations already contained within the  complaint, as well [**20]  as Plaintiffs inability to specify  how discovery would shift the analysis, the Court finds it  possible to rule on this issue without further inquiry. Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above, the Court  holds that, as a matter of law based on the allegations  of the TAC, Salesforce is an interactive computer  service. B. Salesforce as a Publisher Section 230 does not, however, provide a complete  defense for any type of claim against an interactive  computer service. Craigslist, 519 F.3d at 669-70  (explaining that ""§ 230(c) as a whole cannot be  understood as a general prohibition of civil liability for  web-site operators and other online content hosts,"" and  noting, as an example, that defendants may be liable for  claims like ""contributory infringement if their system is  designed to help people steal music""). But if Salesforce  can be liable only in a capacity as a publisher, then §  230 applies. Id.; see also City of Chi. v. StubHub! Inc.,  624 F.3d 363, 366 (7th Cir. 2010) (finding that a claim  seeking a judgment that a ticket reseller was  responsible for collecting state taxes did not implicate §  230 because the tax in question ""[did] not depend on  who 'publishes' any information or is a 'speaker'"").  Whether a claim treats a defendant as the publisher of  third-party content ""does not depend on the form of  the [**21]  asserted cause of action; rather, it depends  on whether the cause of action necessarily requires that  the defendant be treated as the publisher or speaker of  content provided by another."" Jane Doe No. 1 v.  Backpage.com LLC, 817 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 2016)  (citing cases); see also Cohen v. Facebook, Inc., 252 F.  Supp. 3d 140, 156 (E.D.N.Y. 2017) (explaining that §  230 ""is implicated not only by claims that explicitly point  to third party content but also by claims which, though  artfully pleaded to avoid direct reference,  [*637]   implicitly require recourse to that content to establish  liability or implicate a defendant's role, broadly defined,  in publishing or excluding third party [c]ommunications""). Here, Plaintiffs seek to hold Salesforce liable for harm  caused to G.G. by her trafficking via ads posted on  Backpage. In Salesforce's view, this is a straightforward  example of a claim treating a defendant as a publisher;  after all, Plaintiffs are attempting to hold Salesforce  responsible for the harmful effects of third-party content  posted online. For their part, Plaintiffs argue that  because Salesforce, even if it is an interactive computer  service, did not make any decisions regarding the  editing, monitoring, or publishing of the harmful  advertisements, it is not being treated as a publisher.  Plaintiffs suggest that Salesforce [**22]  should have  monitored Backpage's use of Salesforce's tools and  deleted or restricted access to its software in response  to illegal activity—in other words, that Salesforce acted  as  publisher  regarding  Backpage's  content  on  603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *635; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **18 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *635; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **18 Page 7 of 15 Salesforce's own applications. (See TAC ¶ 47.) And at  least some of Plaintiffs' claims relate to Backpage's use  of Salesforce's CRM software to engage in online  marketing communications with sex traffickers to  expand Backpage's customer base. (See TAC ¶¶ 87(c),  (g), (h), (k).) But those claims would also treat  Salesforce as a publisher, as courts have consistently  found that § 230 bars imposing liability on a provider of  messaging or e-mail services for content and activities  conducted via those services. See Fields, 217 F. Supp.  3d at 1127-29. Plaintiffs' remaining allegations can be summed up  thusly: Backpage, far from acting as a neutral platform  for advertisements, actively sought out sex traffickers.  To do so, Backpage worked with the sex traffickers to  ensure  that  the  advertisements,  including  those  featuring G.G., were ""sanitized"" to hide their illegality.  And Salesforce, even though it was aware that  Backpage's business model was based on sex  trafficking, provided tools and support for those  tools [**23]  to help Backpage expand its customer  base. But while Plaintiffs, perhaps recognizing that the  claims at their core rest upon the publication of an  advertisement,  repeatedly  emphasize  Salesforce's  actions in their briefing, the TAC itself does not suggest  that Salesforce ever took any actions regarding the  harmful advertisements or the sex traffickers. (See TAC  ¶ 40 (""Salesforce provided personalized support for the  technological tools and instruments that made it  possible for Backpage to engage in the internet based  on-line selling of sex, sex trafficking, and compelled  prostitution."") (emphasis added).) Put simply, Plaintiffs  seek to hold Salesforce liable for the fact that Backpage  used Salesforce software to cultivate sex traffickers as  customers and grow the website's reach among sex  traffickers, ultimately resulting in the posting of the  advertisement featuring G.G. This is a quintessential  claim covered by § 230: it seeks to impose liability on an  interactive computer service for third-party content that  was published on an online platform. The Court's finding does not, as Plaintiffs suggest,  abandon the statutory language of § 230 by asking not  whether the claims treat Salesforce [**24]  as the         ""publisher or speaker"" of third-party content but whether  the third-party content is a ""necessary part"" of the facts.  Plaintiffs rely on Doe v.  [*638]  Internet Brands for the  proposition that ""the CDA does not provide a general  immunity against all claims derived from third-party  content."" 824 F.3d 846, 853 (9th Cir. 2016). But Internet  Brands itself makes clear that applying § 230 to  Plaintiffs' claims does not contradict this principle. In  Internet Brands, the defendant was the operator of a  networking website for models. Id. at 848. Somehow,  through an outside source, the defendant became  aware of two men that were using the site to prey on  women. Id. at 849. The plaintiff, one of the women  victimized by those men, sued the website owner for  failing to warn users about the presence of predators on  its site and the risk of being victimized. Id. In finding that  § 230 did not apply to preclude liability, the Ninth Circuit  emphasized that, while the publishing of the plaintiff's  data on the networking website was a but-for cause of  her injuries, in many ways ""publishing activity is a but-for  cause of just about everything"" with which the defendant  website was involved. Id. at 853. Because the plaintiff's  claims were not for any content posted on the  website, [**25]  but rather for a failure to warn in which  the duty breached did not require the defendant to take  any action with regards to third-party content posted on  its site, the claims did not treat the defendant as a  publisher or speaker of such content. Id. at 851. But here, Plaintiffs seek to hold Salesforce liable for the  fact that G.G. was trafficked via advertisements placed  on Backpage by her trafficker. Although Plaintiffs try to  frame their claims in terms of Salesforce's actions  (namely, helping Backpage expand the site on which  G.G.'s  trafficker  would  eventually  place  the  advertisements trafficking G.G.), Plaintiffs do not  contend that they would have a claim against Salesforce  regardless of what was posted to Backpage. See Doe v.  Salesforce.com, No. A159566 at 13-14, 2021 Cal. App.  Unpub. LEXIS 8211 (Cal. Ct. App. Dec. 30, 2021) (not  designated for publication) (holding that plaintiffs,  alleging they ""were injured by online advertising, placed  on Backpage by pimps and traffickers, that caused them  to enter sex trafficking and be sexually exploited,""  brought claims that ""seek to treat Salesforce as the  publisher of ads created by a third party"" and are barred  by § 230). Nor can Plaintiffs point to any distinct duty  that [**26]  Salesforce owed to Plaintiffs untethered from  the third-party content. Compare Lemmon v. Snap, Inc.,  995 F.3d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir. 2021) (explaining that  claims for negligent product-design against a mobile  app developer sought to ""hold [the defendant] liable for  its role in violating its distinct duty to design a  603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *637; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **22 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *637; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **22 Page 8 of 15 reasonably safe product."") In effect, Salesforce could  not satisfy its ""alleged obligation"" to Plaintiffs without  altering either the content generated by Backpage by  monitoring the use of its software and forbidding its use  in certain ways, or by insisting that Backpage only  hosted certain content on its own site. In other words,  Plaintiffs claims are predicated on the notion that  Salesforce should be held responsible for the existence  of third-party content, her advertisements—that is, they  treat Salesforce as a publisher. Plaintiffs protest what they deem an ""overbroad""  interpretation of § 230. But as the Seventh Circuit has  recognized, ""Section 230(c)(1) is general,"" and ""a law's  scope often differs from its genesis."" Craigslist, 519 F.3d  at 671-72 (applying § 230 to bar claims brought against  an online service provider for allegedly violating the Fair  Housing Act by posting discriminatory notices). And  other courts have applied § 230 to bar claims similar to  those here, including claims directly against [**27]   Backpage for sex trafficking on the basis that  Backpage's  decisions  about  various  posting  requirements were done with  [*639]  the express  purpose of facilitating sex trafficking. See Jane Doe  No. 1, 817 F.3d at 20-22 (holding that, although the  plaintiffs tried to argue that § 230 did not apply ""by  claiming Backpage's decisions about what measures to  implement deliberately attempt to make sex trafficking  easier, this is a distinction without a difference"" and  finding that the claims ""necessarily treat[ed] the website  as a publisher or speaker of content provided by third  parties, and, thus, are precluded by section 230(c)(1)""). In fact, it is the very breadth of § 230's coverage that  motivated Congress to pass FOSTA for the express  purpose of preserving claims such as these by  exempting them from the protections of § 230. See  FOSTA, Pub. L. No. 115-164, 132 Stat. 1253, 1253  (2018) (explaining that ""clarification"" of § 230 was  ""warranted to ensure"" that § 230 did not provide  protection to websites that unlawfully promote and  facilitate sex traffickers). That Congress felt the need to  amend § 230 to include express exemptions for certain  sex trafficking claims suggests that such claims would  otherwise be covered by § 230. Put simply, courts have  coalesced around an understanding of § 230 that  ""grant[s] sweeping protection."" Malwarebytes, Inc. v.             Enigma Software Grp. USA, LLC, 141 S. Ct. 13, 15, 208  L. Ed. 2d 197 (2020) (statement [**28]  of Thomas, J.,  respecting the denial of certiorari). It may be, as  Plaintiffs argue, that their claims against Salesforce fall  under this exemption. But, to be exempt, a claim must  first be otherwise covered by the statute. And, for the  reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs' claims do fall under  § 230's coverage. C. FOSTA Amendments In 2018, Congress amended § 230 through FOSTA,  adding three exemptions for sex trafficking claims,  including one exempting ""any claim in a civil action  brought under section 1595 of title 18, if the conduct  underlying the claim constitutes a violation of section  1591 of that title."" 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)(A). Here, the  parties dispute the scope of this exemption—namely,  whether the provision exempts a ""claim in a civil action  brought under"" § 1595 only to the extent that ""the  conduct underlying the claim"" (i.e., the conduct of the  defendant in the civil action) constitutes a violation of §  1591 (i.e., the criminal statute), or, as Plaintiffs propose,  ""the conduct underlying the claim"" refers simply to the  criminal conduct of the venture in which a defendant is  participating and from which they are benefiting. In other  words, must Plaintiffs show that Salesforce's  [*640]   own actions violated § 1591, or is it enough that  someone (here, [**29]  Backpage or G.G.'s trafficker)  committed the § 1591 violation underlying the claim?  Resolving  this  issue  is  a  matter  of  statutory                       603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *638; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **26 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *638; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **26 Page 9 of 15 interpretation, and courts have reached different  conclusions. Compare Doe v. Kik Interactive, Inc., 482  F. Supp. 3d 1242, 1249 (S.D. Fla. 2020) (holding that  ""[t]he plain language of the statute removes immunity  only for conduct that violates 18 U.S.C. § 1591"") with  Doe v. Twitter, Inc., 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, 920-22 (N.D.  Cal. 2021) (holding that FOSTA created an exemption  for any claim brought under § 1595 so long as it  involved a claim predicated on civil sex trafficking  under § 1591, regardless of whether the civil defendant  themselves committed that violation). For the reasons  discussed below, the Court agrees with those which find  that, by the plain language of the statute, § 230(e)(5)(A)  exempts claims brought under § 1595 only in  circumstances in which the defendant's conduct  constitutes a violation of § 1591. The Court first turns to the text of the FOSTA  exemption. Section 230(e)(5)(A) exempts ""any claim in  a civil action brought under section 1595 of Title 18, if  the conduct underlying the claim constitutes a  violation of section 1591 of that title."" (emphasis  added).  Applying  the  ""normal  rule  of  statutory  construction that identical words used in different parts  of the same act are intended to have the same  meaning,"" the Court finds that the ""claim in a civil action""  and the ""claim"" [**30]  which the conduct must underlie  are the same. Commissioner v. Lundy, 516 U.S. 235,  250, 116 S. Ct. 647, 133 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1996) (internal  quotation marks omitted); see also Univ. of Chi. v.  United States, 547 F.3d 773, 782 (7th Cir. 2008)  (explaining that the ""sensible approach"" is to read  identical terms in a statute as having the same  meaning). Indeed, here the words are used not just  within the same act, but within the same sentence.  Thus, the ""most straightforward reading"" of this  provision requires an exemption only ""if the civil  defendant's conduct amounts to a violation of section  1591."" J.B. v. G6 Hospitality, LLC, No. 19-cv-07848- HSG, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213, 2021 WL  4079207, at *6; see also Doe v. Reddit, Inc., No. 8:21- cv-00768, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 235993, 2021 WL  5860904, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 7, 2021). This reading is further confirmed by reading the  exemption in conjunction with the two other exemptions  within § 230(e)(5). ""The plainness or ambiguity of  statutory language is determined"" not just ""by reference  to the language itself,"" but also by reference to ""the  specific context in which that language is used.""  Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 342, 117 S. Ct.  843, 136 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1997). Here, § 230(e)(5)  contains two additional provisions stating that § 230  shall not apply to ""any charge in a criminal prosecution  brought under State law if the conduct underlying the  charge would constitute a violation of"" either § 1591 or  18 U.S.C. § 2421A. 47 U.S.C § 230(e)(5)(B)-(C). ""In the  context of a criminal charge, the underlying conduct  necessarily refers to the conduct of the criminal  defendant""—that is, the named defendant, not someone  else  must  have  committed [**31]   the  conduct  underlying the charge. J.B., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  151213, 2021 WL 4079207, at *6. Although civil claims  and criminal  [*641]  charges have obvious differences,  the Court agrees with the J.B. court that the fact ""that  Congress included nearly identical language in the  same subsection, at the same time, strongly suggests  that it intended to give the 'conduct underlying' phrases  the same meaning."" Id. (citing Powerex Corp. v. Reliant  Energy Servs., Inc., 551 U.S. 224, 232, 127 S. Ct. 2411,  168 L. Ed. 2d 112 (2007) (explaining that the ""maxim""  that ""identical words and phrases within the same  statute should normally be given the same meaning"" is  ""doubly appropriate"" where the phrase in question is  inserted into two provisions ""at the same time"")). Put                                603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *640; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **29 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *640; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **29 Page 10 of 15 simply, even assuming that a statute is ""remedial,"" the  Court must first turn to the text of the statute. See  Walton v. United Consumers Club, Inc., 786 F.2d 303,  310 (7th Cir. 1986) (""Courts should confine their  attention to the purposes Congress sought to achieve  by the words it used.""). And here, the text, both by its  plain terms and statutory structure, is clear that the  FOSTA exemption applies only where the civil  defendant's actions violated § 1591. This conclusion does not, as Plaintiffs contend,  ""eviscerate"" the civil negligence standard in § 1595. To  begin, § 230 only applies in limited circumstances— when the defendant is an interactive computer service  and the claims [**32]  seek to treat the defendant as a  publisher of third-party content. This interpretation of the  exemption has no impact on claims that do not meet  those criteria, such as claims commonly brought by  plaintiffs against hotels who rent rooms to sex  traffickers. Moreover, Plaintiffs' position misunderstands  the interaction between § 230 and the FOSTA  Amendments. Before the FOSTA Amendments, any  claim  against  a  defendant  that  met  §  230's  requirements, including those for sex trafficking under  § 1595, would be completely barred. Under the Court's  reading of the plain language of the statute, the FOSTA  exemptions created a limited exemption to that  otherwise broad protection for certain kinds of (but not  all) § 1595 claims. It is true that the outcome here  results in a situation in which ""a sex trafficking victim  who seeks to impose civil liability on an ICS [interactive  computer service] provider on the basis of beneficiary  liability faces a higher burden than a victim of sex  trafficking who seeks to impose such liability on other  types of defendants."" Twitter, 555 F. Supp. 3d at 920.  But § 230 inherently places higher burdens on plaintiffs  seeking to impose liability on interactive computer  services providers by barring certain types of claims  altogether. [**33]                [*642]  Looking to the legislative history confirms that  the FOSTA exemption was not meant to encompass  fully every possible claim under § 1595. The original  version of the bill that became FOSTA would have  provided that § 230 ""shall not be construed to impair the  enforcement or limit the application of (A) section 1595  of title 18, United States Code."" H.R. 1865, 115th Cong.  § 3(a)(5) (as introduced in the House, Apr. 3, 2017).  Under this language, any violation of § 1595 would be  enough to exempt the claim from § 230—exactly the  interpretation Plaintiffs now propose for the enacted  version. But, as discussed in depth by the J.B. court,  during legislative hearings on the bill, several witnesses  raised concerns that § 1595's ""knew or should have  known"" language was too expansive and risked  encouraging  litigation  against  law-abiding  intermediaries. J.B., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213,  2021 WL 4079207 at *7-11 (providing a thorough  analysis of the various drafts and revisions of the  FOSTA  amendment  to  §  230,  including  contemporaneous  comments  from  stakeholders  expressing apprehension about § 1595's knowledge  standard being imported into § 230 given challenges in  showing a website's knowledge). In response, Congress  added the limiting language requiring that the ""conduct  underlying the claim"" be a violation of § 1591. 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 151213, [WL] at *11. Thus, the final bill  reflected [**34]  a ""compromise by including a narrowed  federal civil sex trafficking carve-out that requires  plaintiffs to show the civil defendant's knowing  assistance, support, or facilitation"" of sex trafficking.  Id.. Accordingly, to state a claim that is exempted from §  230's coverage, Plaintiffs must allege Salesforce  engaged in conduct that would violate § 1591. Plaintiffs  do not dispute that they are unable to do so. Section  1591 creates two types of offenses: a primary liability  offense under § 1591(a)(1) and a secondary liability  offense under § 1591(a)(2). As to primary liability under  § 1591(a)(1), there is no allegation that Salesforce  ""recruit[ed],  entice[d],  harbor[ed],  transport[ed],  provide[d],  obtain[ed],  advertise[d],  maintain[ed],  patronize[d], or solicit[ed]"" any person while knowing (or  in reckless disregard of the fact) that the person ""will be  caused to engage in a commercial sex act"" and is either  under the age of 18 or is subject to force, coercion or  threats. Instead, the complaint makes clear that G.G.'s  trafficker engaged in these trafficking violations. 18  U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1). As to secondary liability, §    603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *641; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **31 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *641; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **31 Page 11 of 15 1591(a)(2) criminalizes ""benefit[ing], financially or by  receiving anything of value, from participation in a  venture which has engaged in a violation of"" §  1591(a)(1). For [**35]  purposes of § 1591(a)(2),  ""participation in a venture"" is defined as ""knowingly  assisting, supporting, or facilitating a violation of  subsection (a)(1)."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(4). Accordingly,  a secondary actor under § 1591(a)(2) must actively and  knowingly assist or facilitate a primary trafficking  violation, which is tied to a specific victim. But Plaintiffs  have not alleged that Salesforce knew of G.G.'s  circumstances or in any way assisted, supported, or  facilitated the primary trafficking violation. Accordingly,  the Court finds (and the parties do not dispute) that  Plaintiffs  [*643]  have not pleaded that Salesforce itself  violated § 1591. Thus, because a claim brought under § 1595 must  allege conduct of the defendant that would violate §  1591, and Plaintiffs have failed to allege that Salesforce  committed any criminal sex trafficking violation, the  FOSTA exemption does not apply. Accordingly, § 230  precludes Plaintiffs' claims against Salesforce. II. Failure to State a Claim Even if their claim were not barred by § 230, Plaintiffs'  claim could not proceed as currently pleaded because  they have failed to state a claim. As noted above, in  addition to the requirement of an underlying violation of  § 1591, there are three elements to a § 1595 claim: the  plaintiff must allege that the defendant [**36]  (1)  knowingly benefited from (2) participating in a venture  that (3) the person knew or should have known violated  § 1591. See M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.,  425 F. Supp. 3d 959, 969 (S.D. Oh. 2019). The Court  addresses each element in turn. A. Knowingly Benefit The Court first considers what it means to ""knowingly  benefit"" from a violation of § 1591. The law as to the  knowledge element for a § 1595 violation is currently  unsettled, with the parties here unsurprising urging the  Court to adopt the standard most in their favor     ""Knowledge"" means simply to have ""[a]n awareness or  understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of mind  in which a person has no substantial doubt about the  existence of a fact."" Knowledge, Black's Law Dictionary  (11th ed. 2019). So, pursuant to § 1595, a defendant  must have an awareness or understanding that it was  receiving some benefit, be it financial or some other  form of value, from participating in the venture.  Salesforce suggests that the Court should read  ""benefited"" in conjunction with the phrase ""from  participation in a venture"" to require that any benefit  derived must be the specific result of that venture. In  other words, any benefit received by Salesforce would  have to, essentially, be a form of ""profits"" from  Backpage's sex trafficking venture. [**37]  The cases  to  which  Salesforce  cites  in  support  of  this  interpretation, however, do not go so far as to require  that the ""benefits"" be ""profits."" Instead, those cases  simply stand for the proposition that there must be some  ""causal  relationship  between  the  [defendant's]  participation in sex trafficking and their purported  benefit."" Geiss v. Weinstein Co. Hldgs. LLC, 383 F.  Supp. 3d 156, 169 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (""The controlling  question, however, is whether [the sex trafficker]  provided any of those benefits to [the defendant]  because of [the defendant's] facilitation of [the sex  trafficking].""). This Court thus understands § 1595 to  require a plaintiff to plead only that the defendant knew  that it was receiving benefits (financial or otherwise)  because of its participation in a venture that violated §  1591. See B.M. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., No.  20-cv-00656-BLF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020  WL 4368214, at *4 (N.D. Cal. July 30, 2020) (finding  that the rental of a room (or a franchisor's receipt of  royalties for that rental) ""constitutes a financial benefit  from a relationship with the trafficker sufficient to meet  this element""). B. Participate in a Venture The Court next considers what it means to ""participate  in a venture."" There is no current consensus among  courts to have  [*644]  considered the issue as to  whether the second element incorporates the definition  of ""participation in a venture"" from the [**38]  criminal  provisions in § 1591. See A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide  Hldgs, Inc., 484 F. Supp. 3d 921, 937 (D. Or. 2020)  (collecting cases). Under § 1591(e)(4), ""the term  'participation in a venture' means knowingly assisting,  supporting, or facilitating a violation of subsection  (a)(1)."" Courts importing § 1591's definition have stated  that the ""participation giving rise to the benefit must be  603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *642; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **34 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *642; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **34 Page 12 of 15 participation  in  a  sex-trafficking  venture,  not  participation in other activities."" Geiss, 383 F. Supp. 3d  at 169 (citing to United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App'x  272, 286 (6th Cir. 2016)). In other words, ""some  participation in the sex trafficking act itself must be  shown."" Noble v. Weinstein, 335 F. Supp. 3d 504, 524  (S.D.N.Y. 2018). But § 1591 states that these definitions  apply ""[i]n this section,"" not throughout the entire  statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e). And, as courts that have  declined to take this approach have explained, reading  ""participate in a venture"" to require ""knowingly assisting,  supporting, or facilitating"" would render other statutory  language in § 1595 nonsensical. See Doe #1 v. Red  Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 724 (11th Cir. 2021). This  is because applying the criminal definition, which  requires participation to be knowing, would essentially  void the ""should have known"" language contained in the  civil remedy. A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 455 F. Supp. 3d  171, 186 (E.D. Pa. 2020); Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at  724 (""In other words, the [defendants'] formulation  requires a plaintiff to prove that the defendant knowingly  facilitated a violation, making the 'should have known'  language superfluous."") This Court interprets ""participation"" as the [**39]   majority of courts do and finds that ""actual 'participation  in the sex trafficking itself' is not required to state a  claim under section 1595."" S.Y. v. Naples Hotel Co.,  476 F. Supp. 3d 1251, 1256 (M.D. Fl. 2020). Thus,  ""liability under § 1595 can attach when an individual  participates in a venture that is not specifically a sex  trafficking venture and participation is not direct  participation in the sex trafficking."" M.A., 425 F. Supp.  3d at 970 (finding that the plaintiff alleged sufficient facts  to show participation in a venture under § 1595 by  ""alleging that [the defendants] rented rooms to people it  knew or should have known where [sic] engaged in sex  trafficking""). Put another way, the venture need only be  one that violated sex trafficking law and the defendant  need not directly participate in that violation. Still, ""the  ordinary understanding of culpable assistance to a  wrongdoer [] requires a desire to promote the wrongful  venture's success."" GTE, 347 F.3d at658. And the term  ""participation"" itself requires more than just passive  facilitation, but some level of active engagement. See  Participation, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019)  (""The act of taking part in something""); Participate,  Oxford  English  Dictionary  Online,  https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/138244?rskey=JNFUD z&result=2&isAdvanced=false#eid (last [**40]  visited  May 5, 2022) (""To take part; to have a part or share with  a person""). Thus, in cases where there is no alleged ""direct  association"" between the beneficiary and the trafficker,  courts have ""required 'a showing of a continuous  business relationship between the trafficker and the  [defendant] such that it would appear that the trafficker  and the [defendant] have established a pattern of  conduct or could be said to have a tacit agreement'"" as  to the venture which the defendant knew, or should  have known, involved sex trafficking. J.B. v. G6  Hospitality, LLC, No. 19-cv-07848-HSG, 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 151213, 2020 WL 4901196, *9 (N.D. Cal. Aug.  20, 2020) (quoting M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 970). For  example, courts have  [*645]  found that such a  business relationship existed between a defendant hotel  and a sex trafficker where the defendants themselves  rented rooms to those they knew, or should have  known, were engaged in sex trafficking. See, e.g.,  H.H. v. G6 Hospitality, LLC, No. 2:19-CV-755, 2019  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *5 (S.D.  Oh. Dec. 6, 2019). But a plaintiff must ""connect the  dots"" between their trafficking and the specific  defendant. In cases involving hotel franchisors, for  instance, claims that branded hotels rented rooms to  people they knew or should have known were engaged  in sex trafficking may be ""sufficient to state a plausible  claim against the specific hotels where [the plaintiff] was  trafficked, [but] they do not make a [**41]  plausible  claim that [the franchisors] directly participated in a  venture that trafficked [the plaintiff]."" B.M., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *5; see also  Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 726-27 (finding that  defendant hotel franchisors who owned, supervised,  and controlled the renting of rooms, as well as ""read  online reviews mentioning prostitution and crime  occurring generally at the hotels, and controlled the  training of managers and employees who were allegedly  involved in facilitating sex trafficking at the hotels,""  merely ""financially benefited"" from the renting of hotel  rooms to sex traffickers, not that they ""participated in an  alleged common undertaking or enterprise with the  [plaintiffs'] sex traffickers or others at the hotel who  violated the statute""). C. Knowledge that the Venture Violated § 1951 Lastly, the Court turns to the third element, which  requires a defendant to have ""known or should have  known"" the venture violated § 1591. Put another way, it  requires a defendant to have actual or constructive  knowledge that the venture violated § 1591. Red Roof  Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Courts interpreting § 1595  regularly describe the ""knew or should have known""  603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *644; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **38 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *644; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **38 Page 13 of 15 language as establishing a negligence standard. See id.  (defining constructive knowledge as ""knowledge which  'one using reasonable care or [**42]  diligence should  have'"" (quoting Constructive Knowledge, Black's Law  Dictionary (11th ed. 2019))); see also S.W. v. Lorain- Elyria Motel, Inc., No. 2:19-CV-1194, 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192, at *5 (S.D. Ohio Mar.  16, 2020) (""[T]he plain text of § 1595(a) makes clear  that the standard under this section is a negligence  standard of constructive knowledge.""). Although it is clear that § 1595 allows for either actual or  constructive knowledge, however, courts have reached  different conclusions on whether a defendant must  ""satisf[y] the knowledge element as to a particular sex  trafficking venture."" S.J. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, 473 F.  Supp. 3d 147, 154 (E.D.N.Y. 2020). In other words, is it  enough that the defendant knew or should have known  that the venture has violated § 1591 by engaging in sex  trafficking generally? Or must the defendant have  known or should have known that the venture is  engaged in a violation of § 1591 as to the specific  plaintiff? For purposes of this case, the Court must  decide whether Plaintiffs can successfully plead a claim  under § 1595 by alleging that Salesforce knew or should  have  known  that  Backpage  was  violating  sex  trafficking laws, or if Plaintiffs must allege that  Salesforce knew or should have known that G.G. in  particular was being trafficked using the site. The Court  concludes it is the latter. Section 1595 requires that [**43]  the venture engage in  an act in violation of § 1591, which requires knowledge  as to a specific victim. See 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1)  (criminalizing knowingly recruiting, enticing, harboring,  transporting,  providing,  obtaining,  advertising,  maintaining, patronizing, or soliciting by any means a  person) (emphasis added); 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2)   [*646]  (criminalizing benefiting from participation in a  venture that has violated § 1591(a)(1) where the  defendant knows that ""means of force, threats of force,  fraud, coercion . . . or any combination of such means  will be used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not attained  the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage in a  commercial sex act"") (emphasis added). And ""[t]he  statutory text speaks in singular terms—'participation in  a venture which that person . . . should have known has  engaged in an act in violation of this chapter.'"" S.J., 473  F. Supp. 3d at 154 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a)  (emphasis in original)). Accordingly, a claim under §  1595 requires that ""the defendant must have either  actual or constructive knowledge that the venture—in  which it voluntarily participated and from which it  knowingly benefited—violated [§ 1591] as to the  plaintiff."" Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 726  (emphasis added). Plaintiffs  suggest  that  this  interpretation  improperly [**44]  imports the knowledge requirements  of § 1591 into § 1595. But Plaintiffs confuse the  knowledge requirement for what it means to ""participate  in a venture"" with the knowledge requirement as to the  nature of the venture itself. Thus, while a plaintiff need  not allege that a defendant ""knowingly assisted"" a  venture engaged in a violation of § 1591 to ""participate""  in that venture, the plaintiff does need to allege that the  defendant knew (or should have known) about the  specific sex trafficking venture—that is, the venture  tied to the underlying § 1591 violation of the plaintiff.  See B.M., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL  4368214, at *5 (dismissing a complaint for being ""devoid  of any facts linking these Defendants . . . to the sex  trafficking of this Plaintiff"" (emphasis added)). A.B.,  which Plaintiffs cite as holding that § 1595 does not  require a defendant to have knowledge of the specific  victim, provides a useful illustration. There, in finding  that the plaintiffs adequately pleaded a § 1595 claim,  the court emphasized that, had the complaint only  contained general allegations as to the problem of sex  trafficking, efforts to combat that issue, and incidents  involving other victims and other hotels, it ""may [have]  agree[d]"" with the defendant that the allegations were  insufficient. [**45]  455 F. Supp. 3d at 193. However,  the A.B. court noted that the plaintiff had alleged facts  that did establish defendant's knowledge of her own  trafficking—among  other  allegations,  that  the  traffickers had used defendant's hotels, multiple men an  evening entered the hotels creating a ""voluminous and  obvious constant stream of male visitors"" to her rooms,  her trafficker ""repeatedly"" paid for rooms at the hotels in  advance and with prepaid cards, and staff at the hotels  observed the plaintiff with visible signs of injury multiple  times. Id at 193-94. This approach is consistent with the majority view of the  courts to have considered such cases. See, e.g., S.Y.,  476 F. Supp. 3d at 1257 (holding that defendant hotels  knew or should have known of the venture that sex  trafficked the plaintiffs the complaint alleged that the  traffickers requested rooms by exit doors, paid in cash,  excessive condoms were present in the rooms, hotel  staff observed the plaintiffs be escorted by traffickers  into the hotels, hotel staff heard plaintiffs' screams, the  sex trafficking ventures operated out of the same hotel  room for days in succession, and multiple men came  603 F.

Apr. 17, 2020) (denying  a motion to dismiss by [**46]  the defendant website  where ""the complaint alleges that [the defendant  website] not only knew that human trafficking was  occurring on  [*647]  its website, but that [the defendant  website] was part of an active conspiracy with plaintiff's  traffickers to traffic plaintiff,"" and denying a similar  motion to dismiss by the defendant hotel where the  complaint alleged that hotel staff contacted the plaintiff  to request that she be more discrete with her activities  and that police had spoken with the hotel regarding the  plaintiff being a minor (emphasis added)); compare  Lundstrom v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., No. 21-cv-00619- PAB-SKC, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 228651, 2021 WL  5579117, at *8-9 (D. Colo. Nov. 30, 2021) (finding that  allegations that a defendant hotel franchisor was ""on  notice about the prevalence of sex trafficking generally  at its hotels and in the hotel industry"" was ""not sufficient  to show that the defendant should have known about  what happened to [the] plaintiff"" and thus could not  sustain § 1595 claim). In short, to bring a claim for liability under § 1595, a  plaintiff must plausibly allege that a defendant (1)  knowingly benefited, either financially or otherwise, from  (2) participation in a venture, although such participation  need not necessarily be direct participation in the sex  trafficking, and that (3) the person knew or should  have [**47]  known violated § 1591 as to the plaintiff. D. Application to Plaintiffs' Claims Against  Salesforce With this understanding of the elements for a beneficiary  claim under § 1595 in mind, the Court now considers  whether Plaintiffs have stated such a claim against  Salesforce  and  concludes  that  they  have  not.  Specifically, Plaintiffs have failed to allege plausibly that  Salesforce knew, or should have known, about G.G.'s  specific trafficking or any of the advertisements  trafficking her on Backpage. Compare Twitter, 555 F.  Supp. 3d at 925 (finding that plaintiffs adequately  pleaded a § 1595 claim where they alleged that the  defendant website was alerted to the existence of  videos involving the plaintiffs and provided evidence that  the plaintiffs were underage in response to a request for  more information). Plaintiffs do not contend that they  have pleaded such knowledge, instead relying on their  argument that § 1595 does not require that Salesforce  have any knowledge or involvement as to G.G's specific  trafficking. But, as has already been discussed, this  Court disagrees with that approach and finds that §  1595 requires a defendant to have participated in a  venture that the defendant knew or should have known  was involved in sex trafficking of the plaintiff, [**48]   not sex trafficking more generally. Thus, because  Plaintiffs have not alleged that Salesforce had actual or  constructive knowledge of G.G.'s trafficking, they have  not adequately pleaded that element of a § 1595 claim. Plaintiffs also have not adequately alleged that  Salesforce ""participated"" in the venture with Backpage  that trafficked G.G. Considering the TAC as a whole,  Plaintiffs allege that Backpage used Salesforce's CRM  software to cultivate and expand a customer base of  sex traffickers, including G.G.'s trafficker. At times, the  TAC appears to suggest that Salesforce itself took  actions to assist Backpage's efforts. (See TAC ¶ 41  (""Salesforce was the driving force that enabled  Backpage to scale its operations and increase the  trafficking conducted on Backpage."").) But the factual  allegations directly underlying these claims make it clear  that  Salesforce  provided  the  technology  (and  corresponding technological support) that Backpage  utilized to grow its own business. (See Id. (""By providing  technology, implementation skills, and ongoing support  that all constitute affirmative acts by Salesforce that  encouraged the wrongdoing in which Backpage.com  was engaged."").) In other words,  [*648]  while [**49]   Salesforce may have provided the tools that Backpage  used to build a business based on sex trafficking,  Salesforce did not take part in the construction of the  business itself. Allegations concerning Salesforce's role in marketing  Backpage to sex traffickers illustrate how the actions  Plaintiffs allege Salesforce took to assist and support  Backpage in its sex trafficking venture are, in actuality,  actions that Backpage took using Salesforce's CRM  software. The TAC describes Salesforce's CRM  technology as providing companies ""access to a  coordinated set of applications tailored to its business  model, including applications that . . . manage all  marketing functions."" (Id. ¶ 31.) Plaintiffs then allege  that Salesforce ""facilitat[ed] and provid[ed] support for  direct marketing campaigns for Backpage to expand  Backpage's sex trafficking venture."" (TAC ¶ 87(c).) But  even in this allegation, Plaintiffs acknowledge that it is  Backpage, not Salesforce, that actually expanded the  operations through marketing activities. (See also Pls.'  Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss at 25, Dkt. No. 66 (""Among  other things, Salesforce facilitated trafficking through  603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *646; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **45 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *646; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **45 Page 15 of 15 Backpage by assisting Backpage in its marketing  efforts [**50]  that allowed Backpage to solicit sex  traffickers and their victims."") The mere fact that  Salesforce's  software  played  a  critical  role  in  Backpage's expansion, indeed, even if such expansion  would not be possible without the capabilities provided  by that software, is not enough to demonstrate  Salesforce's own participation in any venture with  Backpage. See United States v. Papagno, 639 F.3d  1093, 1098, 395 U.S. App. D.C. 82 (D.C. Cir. 2011)  (explaining the difference between ""assistance"" and  ""participation,"" noting that insurers who cover operations  do not participate in that operation, fans who cheer the  home team may help the team win but do not participate  in the game, and engineers who design soldiers'  weapons may support the war effort but do not  participate in the war). Thus, to the extent Plaintiffs'  claims rest on any actions taken by Backpage using  Salesforce's software, they have not adequately alleged  Salesforce ""participated"" in any venture. Plaintiffs contend that they have plausibly alleged that  Salesforce did not just sell Backpage off-the-shelf  software  but  instead  also  offered  Backpage  ""personalized support."" Yet, although the complaint  contains multiple mentions of Salesforce providing  Backpage  with  ""personalized  services  tailored  specifically to the [**51]  needs of its illegal business,""  Plaintiffs provide no examples of these services, or  description, or even suggestion, of how Salesforce  altered its software to better facilitate sex trafficking.  (TAC ¶ 46.) For instance, Plaintiffs emphasize that  Salesforce provided technical support in moving some  of Backpage's operations overseas—ostensibly to help  Backpage avoid U.S. law enforcement. But even  assuming that Backpage's fear of criminal liability  motivated its desire to have a duplicate copy of its  system, the TAC contains no facts indicating that  Salesforce was aware of this motivation, nor do  Plaintiffs explain how, given that the complaint alleges  that G.G. was trafficked on backpage.com (and not any  overseas website), this duplicate copy relates to their  claims. Similarly, Plaintiffs point to the allegation that an in- house Salesforce executive recommended that, based  on Backpage's needs (which Plaintiffs assume to be  related to sex trafficking and prostitution), Backpage  use Salesforce's Enterprise CRM edition. Plaintiffs  emphasize that the Enterprise CRM edition is described  as ""fully customizable,"" suggesting that this means that  Salesforce then took action to tailor the software [**52]   to better meet Backpage's needs (which, Plaintiffs  allege, were solely related to sex trafficking). Yet the   [*649]  mere fact that the Enterprise CRM edition is  customizable (that is, capable of being customized)  does not, without more, support a reasonable inference  that Salesforce actually customized the software to  meet Backpage's needs. In sum, Plaintiffs have failed to  allege facts supporting that Salesforce ""took part in""  Backpage's sex-trafficking venture. Thus, for the reasons stated above, the Court finds that  Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim against Salesforce  for beneficiary liability under § 1595. If this were the only  basis for dismissal, the Court would consider dismissal  without prejudice to allow Plaintiffs one final opportunity  to amend their complaint to state a viable claim. But as  discussed above, the allegations of the TAC establish  that Salesforce is entitled to dismissal based on the  affirmative defense in § 230 of the Communications  Decency Act as well. Accordingly, the dismissal is with  prejudice.",1
"Greene v. State, 2023 Ind. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1393","[*1] Appeal from the Vigo Superior Court The Honorable Matthew A. Sheehan, Judge Trial Court Cause Nos. 84D05-1803-F5-890 84D05- 2112-F5-4228 Memorandum Decision by Judge Kenworthy Judges Bailey and Tavitas concur. Kenworthy, Judge. Case Summary [1] Michael P. Greene appeals his six-year aggregate  sentence, raising one issue for our review: Does his  sentence warrant revision under Indiana Appellate Rule  7(B)?  Concluding  Greene's  sentence  is  not  inappropriate in light of the nature of his offense and his  character, we affirm. Facts and Procedural History [2] In 2007, Greene was convicted of Class C felony  child molesting. Based on this conviction, Greene was  required to register as a sex offender. In 2018, Greene  was convicted of Level 5 felony failure to register as a  sex offender and placed on probation. A couple of years  later, the State petitioned to revoke Greene's probation  and charged Greene in this case with two counts of  failure to register as a sex offender-one as a Level 5  felony and one as a Level 6 felony. The State also  alleged Greene was a habitual offender. In late  February 2023, Greene and the State entered into a  plea agreement. Under the terms of the agreement,  Greene pleaded guilty to Level 5 felony failure [*2]  to  register as a sex offender, 1 admitted he was a habitual  offender, 2 admitted to a probation violation, and agreed  to a six-year cap on his sentence. The trial court  accepted the plea agreement, dismissed Greene's Level  6 felony charge, and terminated his probation as  unsatisfactorily completed. 1 Ind. Code § 11-8-8-17(b) (2020). 2 I.C. § 35-50-2-8(i)(2) (2017). [3] Prior to sentencing, Greene was evaluated by a  licensed clinical social worker. The social worker  reported Greene suffered from childhood trauma  because he ""saw his mother shot and killed when he  was like three (3) years old."" Tr. Vol. 2 at 43. Further,  Greene  was  diagnosed  with  schizophrenia,  ""schizoaffective disorder,"" PTSD, and ADHD. Id. at 44.  Greene also has a history of abusing illegal substances  like  methamphetamine,  marijuana,  mushrooms,  oxycontin, and LSD. Due to his condition, Greene was  treated at the Hamilton Center and Options Behavioral  Health Center on several occasions. Overall, Greene  failed to adhere to recommendations and did not  engage in treatment. [4] The trial court sentenced Greene to an aggregate  sentence of six years executed in the Department of  Correction-three years for Level 5 felony failure to  Page 2 of 3 register as a sex offender with a three-year [*3]  habitual  offender enhancement. When sentencing Greene, the  trial court acknowledged Greene's ""significant mental  health issues"" as a ""significant mitigating factor."" Id. at  58. Yet the trial court determined Greene's criminal  history-including five prior felony convictions for failure  to register as a sex offender-and several probation  violations warranted the imposed sentence. Greene's Sentence Does Not Warrant 7(B) Revision [5] Greene asks us to review and revise his sentence.  The Indiana Constitution authorizes this Court to review  and revise a trial court's sentencing decision as  provided by rule. Ind. Const. art. 7, § 6. Indiana  Appellate Rule 7(B) provides we may revise a sentence  authorized by statute if, ""after due consideration of the trial court's decision, the Court finds that the  sentence is inappropriate in light of the nature of the offense and the character of the  offender."" The principal role of appellate review is to  leaven the outliers, not to achieve a perceived correct  sentence in each case. Conley v. State, 183 N.E.3d  276, 288 (Ind. 2022). Thus, ""we reserve our 7(B)  authority for exceptional cases."" Faith v. State, 131 N.E.3d 158, 160 (Ind. 2019) (per curiam).  [6] ""[S]entencing is principally a discretionary function in  which the trial court's judgment should receive  considerable deference."" Cardwell v. State, 895 N.E.2d  1219, 1222 (Ind. 2008). ""Such [*4]  deference should  prevail unless overcome by compelling evidence  portraying in a positive light the nature of the offense  (such as accompanied by restraint, regard, and lack of  brutality) and the defendant's character (such as  substantial virtuous traits or persistent examples of good  character)."" Stephenson v. State, 29 N.E.3d 111, 122  (Ind. 2015). The question ""is not whether another  sentence is more appropriate; rather, the question is  whether the sentence imposed is inappropriate."" Helsley  v. State, 43 N.E.3d 225, 228 (Ind. 2015) (quoting King v.  State, 894 N.E.2d 265, 268 (Ind. Ct. App. 2008))  (emphasis omitted). Whether we regard a sentence as  inappropriate ""turns on our sense of the culpability of the  defendant, the severity of the crime, the damage done  to others, and myriad other factors that come to light in  a given case."" Cardwell, 895 N.E.2d at 1224. [7] The defendant bears the burden of persuading us a  revised sentence is warranted. Harris v. State, 165  N.E.3d 91, 99 (Ind. 2021). And because our legislature  has selected the advisory sentence as the ""starting  point"" for ""an appropriate sentence for the crime  committed,"" the defendant bears a ""particularly heavy burden"" when the trial court imposes  the advisory sentence. Fernbach v. State, 954 N.E.2d 1080, 1089 (Ind. Ct. App.  2011), trans. denied. [8] Here, the trial court sentenced Greene to three years  for Level 5 felony failure to register as a sex offender,  enhanced by three years for being a habitual  offender. [*5]  See I.C. § 35-50-2-6(b) (2014) (providing  for a sentence of one to six years for a Level 5 felony,  with a three-year advisory sentence); see also I.C. § 35- 50-2-8(i)(2) (2017) (providing for an additional sentence  of two to six years for a habitual offender convicted of a  Level 5 felony). Thus, Greene received the advisory  term for his Level 5 felony offense. And Greene's  habitual offender enhancement was toward the bottom  of the applicable range. Therefore, Greene bears a  ""particularly heavy burden"" to show his sentence  warrants 7(B) revision. See Fernbach, 954 N.E.2d at  1089. [9] Beginning with the nature of Greene's offense, we  note this is Greene's sixth conviction for failing to  register as a sex offender. See Appellant's App. Vol. 2  at 49-52. Thus, Greene has demonstrated a continuous  disregard for his legal obligation to register. As such, the  nature of Greene's offense weighs against revision. 3 3 Greene argues he was homeless at the time of his  conduct underlying this offense, and thus unable to  register a home address. See Appellant's Br. at 13. But  the record reveals otherwise. See Appellant's App. Vol.  2 at 38-39 (indicating the charges underlying this case  were based upon Greene failing to register his change  of address while living on Maple [*6]  Avenue in Terre  Haute, Indiana for a period of about three weeks).  Nonetheless, Indiana Code Section 11-8-8-12 requires  a sex offender who resides in a temporary residence or  who does not have a principal or temporary residence to  register or report with the local law enforcement  authority. [10] As to Greene's character, his criminal history is  significant. See Smoots v. State, 172 N.E.3d 1279, 1290  (Ind. Ct. App. 2021) (explaining a defendant's criminal  history is one relevant factor in analyzing character). In  addition to his previous five felony convictions for failure  to register as a sex offender, Greene has convictions for  Class C child molesting, misdemeanor reckless driving,  Page 3 of 3 and misdemeanor disorderly conduct. And Greene has  violated the terms of his probation on at least six  separate occasions. Although Greene's guilty plea  saved the State the expense of trial, it also benefited  Greene in the form of a dismissal of his Level 6 felony  failure to register charge and a sentence capped at six  years. And to the extent Greene contends his mental  health issues favor revision, the trial court considered  his struggles a ""significant mitigating factor."" Tr. Vol. 2 at  58. But the trial court determined the aggravating factors  outweighed the mitigating factors and warranted [*7]   the imposed sentence. As the trial court explained:  ""Greene's continuous inability to follow the law and to  follow the requirements of probation, give this court no  assurance or faith that Mr. Greene can be successful in  any sentence that would not be executed fully in the  Department of Corrections."" Id. at 58-59. Put simply,  Greene's repeated inability to abide by the laws and  rules placed upon him reflect poorly on his character  and weigh against 7(B) revision. Conclusion [11] Greene's six-year aggregate sentence is not  inappropriate in light of the nature of his offense and his  character. His sentence therefore does not warrant 7(B)  revision. Accordingly, we affirm. [12] Affirmed. Bailey, J., and Tavitas, J., concur.",0
"United States v. Adams, 578 F. Supp. 3d 692","[*692]  MEMORANDUM Defendant John Adams stands charged with sex trafficking of minors in violation of the Trafficking Victims  Protection Act (TVPA), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591 et seq., He moves to dismiss two counts brought under the TVPA  pursuant to a theory that the application of the TVPA to local prostitution is beyond the scope of the statute.             Page 2 of 6  [*693]  Defendant thus moves under Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(B)(v) for failure to state an offense. Although I am  sensitive to Defendant's arguments that federal criminal statutes should be interpreted narrowly and with an eye to  the constitutional structure of federalism, an analysis of both the TVPA's language and its legislative history lead me  to conclude that Congress intended for the TVPA to be applicable to the conduct alleged here. Defendant's motion  will therefore be denied. I. Legal Standard ""An indictment fails to state an offense if the specific facts alleged in it fall beyond the scope of the relevant criminal  statute, as a [**2]  matter of statutory interpretation."" U.S. v. Vitillo, 490 F.3d 314, 321 (3d Cir. 2007), as amended  (Aug. 10, 2007) (cleaned up). II. Discussion At the outset, I note that Defendant does not bring this challenge under the Commerce Clause to suggest that the  TVPA as applied represents an unconstitutional overreach of Congress's powers to regulate interstate commerce.  Instead, Defendant relies upon Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Bond, 572 U.S. 844, 134 S. Ct. 2077,  189 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2014), arguing that the TVPA should not apply to purely in-state conduct as a matter of criminal  statutory interpretation, when viewed through the lens of federalism. In Bond, the Supreme Court held that a federal  statute passed to control the production, distribution, and use of chemical weapons could not be used to prosecute  a local assault using chemical agents to give the victim a rash. Id. at 866. Although under a plain reading of the  statutory language the conduct appeared to meet the elements of the crime, the Supreme Court found that such an  interpretation ""would dramatically intrude upon traditional state criminal jurisdiction, and we avoid reading statutes  to have such reach in the absence of a clear indication that they do."" Id. at 856-57. The dispositive question here  then is whether the TVPA contains a clear indication that Congress meant it to be [**3]  applied to local conduct that  intrudes upon ""areas of traditional state responsibility."" Id. at 858. Given its language, the statute on its face would appear to apply applies to the conduct charged in Counts I and II  of the indictment. Counts I and II set forth allegations with respect to two minor individuals who Defendant allegedly  recruited, enticed, harbored and maintained so as to cause them to engage in commercial sex acts, while knowing  or in reckless disregard of their minor status. 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1) imposes criminal liability upon anyone who  ""knowingly in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of  the United States, recruits. entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains, patronizes, or   [*694]  solicits by any means a person ... knowing, or ... in reckless disregard of the fact ... that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act."" The statute does not make  international trafficking an element of the crime. Instead, it applies to any conduct ""in or affecting interstate or  foreign commerce."" Numerous courts have held that this is a constitutionally valid application [**4]  of the statute  under the Commerce Clause. See, e.g., United States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir. 2007) (""Congress  found that trafficking of persons has an aggregate economic impact on interstate and foreign commerce . . . and we  cannot say that this finding is irrational.""); U.S. v. Walls, 784 F.3d 543, 548-49 (9th Cir. 2015); see also United  States v. Victor Clayton, Cr. No. 18-254, ECF 154, at 1 n.1 (Nov. 9, 2021) (Surrick, J.) (""Every court that has          578 F. Supp. 3d 692, *692; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2532, **1 Page 3 of 6 considered whether the TVPA and specifically whether § 1591's prohibition of interstate (as opposed to  international) trafficking is a valid exercise of Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause, has concluded that  it is.""). Ultimately, Defendant's motion does not challenge application of the plain language of the statute to Defendant's  alleged conduct, or the power of Congress to regulate such conduct, both of which are clearly established. Rather,  under Bond, Defendant argues that regardless of its wording the statute should be construed to exclude purely local  prostitution offenses in light of the states' traditional police power over such offenses. Defendant argues that ""[t]he facts presented by the government in the instant case—which (if true) make out a  wholly-local prostitution offense—do not establish the type of conduct Congress intended to target in enacting [**5]   18 U.S.C. § 1591."" Def. Br. at 2. To support his argument, Defendant draws upon a common sense understanding  of the word ""trafficking"" to emphasize the movement of persons across borders by deceptive or coercive means to  effectively enslave victims to perform sexual acts or uncompensated labor. In particular, based upon the legislative  history of the TVPA, Defendant argues that this movement across borders in the international context was the  principal problem Congress sought to address. The defense cites extensively from the ""Purposes and Findings""  section of the TVPA, which includes, among other things, references to the ""international sex trade,"" 22 U.S.C. §  7101(b)(2), a ""growing transnational crime,"" § 7101(b)(3), the transportation of victims ""from their home  communities to unfamiliar destinations, including foreign countries ... ,"" § 7101(b)(5), ""organized criminal enterprises  worldwide,"" § 7101(b)(8), that ""[t]rafficking in persons is a transnational crime,"" § 7101(b)(24), and numerous  references to the victims of trafficking often being immigrants illegally brought to the country where they are  exploited, §§ 7101(b)(5), (17), (20). Defendant then points to statements in the legislative record by the law's original co-sponsors, Senators Brownback  and Wellstone. Sen. Brownback, for [**6]  instance, defines ""trafficking"" as ""the coercive transportation of persons  into slavery-like conditions, primarily involving forced prostitution."" 146 Cong. Rec. S10,167 (Oct. 11, 2000). Sen.  Wellstone similarly details a number of examples of women and girls from foreign countries brought to the United  States, whether by coercion or deceit, and subjected to a life of prostitution or forced labor, without any  consequences for the perpetrators of the trafficking. Id. at S10,167-68. Finally, Defendant argues that one attempt  to reauthorize the TVPA in 2007, which would have included the express federalization of crimes involving  pandering, pimping, and prostitution failed ""because it represented unwarranted federalization [*695]  of state  crimes,"" citing objections made by various entities opposed to those aspects of the bill. Def. Br. at 4. Defendant's reference to the legislative record around the original bill carries some weight. After reviewing the  record of the original passage of the TVPA myself, I agree that there were myriad references to trafficking across  international borders, but none to domestic or purely local conduct. The House Judiciary's report on the bill,  interestingly, viewed [**7]  its jurisdiction over the bill as limited to the immigration provisions and the criminal  penalty provisions. H.R. Rep. 106-487, pt. II, at 17 (Apr. 13, 2000). The international focus of the law is further  reflected in the original Act's structure, where eight out of thirteen sections were expressly focused on combatting  international trafficking. 114 Stat. 1464, Pub. L. 106-386, §§ 104-111 (Oct. 28, 2000). And were Mr. Adams to have  been accused of a prostitution offense that did not involve coercion or a minor, his citation to Section 221 of H.R.  3887, which was an earlier draft of the eventual reauthorization act of 2008, and included a provision that made it a  federal crime to ""persuade[], induce[], or entice[] any individual to engage in prostitution,"" would be strong evidence  that Congress did not intend to regulate his conduct and instead desired to leave such regulation for the states. But Mr. Adams is accused of trafficking related to a victim under the age of 18 which Congress has clearly indicated  it views as a more severe crime than prostitution generally and which it has found is under-prosecuted by the  states. A fuller view of both the congressional record and the statute itself shows this. Notably, the statute expressly  defines [**8]  ""severe forms of trafficking in persons"" as ""sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act ... in which  the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age."" § 7102(11)(A). In light of this definition,  the TVPA's ""Purposes and Findings"" section includes provisions reflecting Congress's intent to regulate certain  severe forms of sex trafficking that it understood to be inadequately punished by states. Most notably, Congress  found that ""[e]xisting legislation and law enforcement in the United States and other countries are inadequate to  deter trafficking and bring traffickers to justice, failing to reflect the gravity of the offenses involved."" § 7101(b)(14).  578 F. Supp. 3d 692, *694; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2532, **4 Page 4 of 6 Congress further lamented that ""even the most brutal instances of trafficking the sex industry are often punished  under laws that also apply to lesser offenses, so that traffickers typically escape deserved punishment."" §  7101(b)(14). Looking more deeply, the legislative history of the TVPA's reauthorizations and amendments clearly reflects an  understanding by Congress that the law and its penalties should apply against local violations that do not involve  international components. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005, in [**9]  particular,  reflects an intent that the TVPA have domestic application to minor victims who are enticed into the commercial sex  trade. Sen. Leahy, who took over co-sponsorship of the legislation with the passing of Sen. Wellstone, spoke to the  very factual situation at issue here when introducing the reauthorization act in the Senate: I am especially pleased that this reauthorization package has been improved significantly. For the first time, the  bill focuses not only on the important goal of preventing international human trafficking, but also on preventing  the human trafficking that occurs within our own borders. Children here in the United States are at tremendous  risk, especially those who are homeless or runaways, and they are particularly susceptible to being  domestically trafficked for purposes of commercial sexual exploitation.  [*696]  I will not rest until this alarming  trend is stopped. 151 Cong. Rec. S14,417. Sen. Leahy's focus on the risk that domestically based children who are homeless or  runaways may be susceptible to trafficking falls squarely within the facts alleged in this case. Over the course of the next decade and a half, Congress reauthorized or otherwise amended the provisions [**10]   of the TVPA several times. On many occasions, these amendments were made to § 1591 itself or § 1591 was  cross-referenced in related provisions of the code. At no point did Congress manifest an intent to limit the  application of § 1591, which on its face applies to any minor trafficked into commercial sex acts. Perhaps the  clearest indication of Congress's intent to apply the TVPA to domestic minors for local offenses can be found in the  Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, Pub. L. 114-22, 129 Stat. 227 (May 29, 2015). There, Congress  amended § 1591 to add the words ""solicits or patronizes"" to the list of prohibited conduct in order to clarify that both  purveyors and purchasers of sex from minors were liable under the TVPA. § 109(4). In doing so, Congress explicitly  endorsed the Eighth Circuit's decision in United States vs. Jungers, 702 F.3d 1066 (8th Cir. 2013), for its  interpretation of ""obtain"" as applying to purchasers of sex from minors. § 109(3). Jungers involved entirely local  child sex trafficking where state and federal officers conducting a sting operation in South Dakota ""pretended to be  a man offering his girlfriend's underage daughters for sex while his girlfriend was out of town."" Jungers, 702 F.3d at  1067. Although domestic applicability was not at issue in Jungers, Congress's ratification of that opinion reinforces  its implied understanding—without need to further clarify—that [**11]  § 1591 broadly applies to local sex trafficking  of minors. More recently, Congress ordered  [*697]  the Attorney General to issue guidance to all DOJ offices                  578 F. Supp. 3d 692, *695; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2532, **8 Page 5 of 6 ""emphasizing that an individual who knowingly solicits or patronizes a commercial sex act from a person who was a  minor (consistent with [18 U.S.C. § 1591(c)]) ... is guilty of an offense under chapter 77 of title 18, United States  Code, and is a party to a severe form of trafficking in persons, as that term is defined in [the TVPA at 22 U.S.C. §  7102(9)])."" Abolish Human Trafficking Act of 2017, Pub. L. 115-392, 132 Stat 5250. This again reaffirmed  Congress's broad interpretation of the statutory language to apply to all sex trafficking of minors and not just that  involving international transportation. Federal courts that have considered arguments against the application of the TVPA to purely local conduct have  similarly found that Congress provided sufficiently clear indication under the Bond standard that it intended the  TVPA to apply to conduct traditionally regulated by the state. Notably in U.S. v. Walls, the Ninth Circuit held, solely  on the basis of the ""Purpose and Findings"" section of the TVPA, §§ 7101(b)(12) and 7101(b)(14), that Congress  indicated an interest in regulating purely local conduct that fell within the definition of § 1591. 784 F.3d 543, 546-47  (9th Cir. 2015). In U.S. v. Callahan, the Sixth Circuit [**12]  addressed Bond in analyzing § 1589, which prohibits  forced labor under the TVPA. It held that the TVPA's implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment made forced  labor a special matter of federal concern that reduced any need for the court to consider traditional state policing  prerogatives. 801 F.3d 606, 619-20 (6th Cir. 2015); see also U.S. v. McMillian, 777 F.3d 444 (7th Cir. 2015)  (Posner, J.) (summarily dismissing a challenge to § 1591 as applied to purely local conduct under Bond because  ""there is no basis for so limited an interpretation""). I see no reason to reach a different conclusion. Following a wider view of the legislative history, consideration of the language of the TVPA itself, and existing  precedent, I am persuaded that § 1591 was intended by Congress to intrude upon traditional state policing  prerogatives related to prostitution in order to more robustly prosecute crimes of coercion and exploitation of  minors. Congress did so pursuant to its powers under the Commerce Clause and the Thirteenth Amendment in  order to realize the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition on slavery. Counts I and II of government's indictment  therefore charge offenses for which Defendant may be prosecuted. Defendant's motion to strike those counts of the  indictment will be denied. An appropriate order follows. /s/ Gerald Austin McHugh United States District Judge ORDER This 6th [**13]  of January 2022, upon consideration of Defendant John Adams's Motion to Dismiss Counts I and II  of the Indictment, it is hereby ORDERED that Defendant's motion is DENIED. /s/ Gerald Austin McHugh United States District Judge              578 F.

"United States v. Woods, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76072","MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT'S MOTION IN LIMINE TO EXCLUDE  IMPROPER 404(b) EVIDENCE and GRANTING THE GOVERNMENT'S MOTION TO EXCLUDE MR. WOODS'  HEARSAY STATEMENTS THIS MATTER comes before the Court on Defendant's Motion In Limine to Exclude Improper 404(b) Evidence, filed  June 1, 2020 (Doc. 420). Defendant seeks to preclude the Government from making any reference to the murders  of T.S. and D.Y and any item of evidence contained in the Governments Notice of Intent to Introduce Evidence as  Res Gestae or Prior Bad Acts Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), filed April 19, 2019 (Doc. 316). The Court will also  use this Memorandum Opinion and Order to issue a ruling on the Government's motion to exclude evidence that  T.S. caused someone's death (Doc. 450 at 3-4). See Doc. 491 at 11 (deferring ruling on this matter). Background Defendant Matthew Woods is charged with seven counts involving [*2]  the sex trafficking of adults and minors  and one count alleging obstruction. Doc. 380 (Fourth Superseding Indictment). All of his co-defendants, who  allegedly formed a conspiracy with Defendant (the ""Galloway Organization""), have been terminated from this action.  Page 2 of 6   Mr. Woods is the only member of the alleged Galloway Organization who denies criminal liability. The Indictment  alleges that beginning on or before October of 2016 and continuing to May of 2017, the Galloway Organization  recruited adult women to perform commercial sex acts, knowing that force, threats, fraud, or coercion would be  used to cause these women to engage in these acts. The Indictment further alleges that the Galloway Organization  committed sex trafficking of two juveniles, counts that do not require proof of force, fraud, threats, or coercion. The Government alleges that the typical modus operandi for the Galloway Organization was to target and recruit  vulnerable females and subsequently use narcotics or physical violence to cause these women to engage in  commercial sex acts. Doc. 429 at 2. The Government contends that, once recruited, the women were then  exploited and controlled through beatings and the withholding [*3]  of drugs or food. Id. According to the  Government, Mr. Woods' role in the Galloway Organization was to act as an ""enforcer"" for ringleader Cornelius  Galloway. When the women refused to do as they were told, Cornelius Galloway sent them to Matthew Woods for  punishment. This punishment would range from physical beatings to forcible rape. Id. Relevant Law The text of § 1591(a) proscribes two forms of sex trafficking: (1) sex trafficking involving a commercial sex act  induced by means of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion, or a combination thereof; and (2) child sex  trafficking in which the person induced to perform the commercial sex act is under the age of eighteen. 18 U.S.C.  § 1591(a). The mens rea elements for the two forms of sex trafficking are different. Under the first form, a  defendant must act knowingly, or in reckless disregard of the fact, that a commercial sex act was induced by  means of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion, or any combination thereof. Under the second form, a defendant  must act knowingly, or in reckless disregard of the fact, that the person induced to perform the commercial sex act  was not eighteen years old. Id. With respect to this second form, Congress also provided:  [*4] In a prosecution under subsection (a)(1) in which the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe  the person so recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, maintained, patronized, or  solicited, the Government need not prove that the defendant knew, or recklessly disregarded the fact, that the  person had not attained the age of 18 years. Id. § 1591(c); see also United States v. Gemma, 818 F.3d 23, 38 (1st Cir. 2016). The Government seeks to admit the evidence discussed below as res gestae, which has been defined as other acts  that are inextricably intertwined with the charged offense or those acts, the telling of which is necessary to complete  the story of the charged offense. United States v. Sangiovanni, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55103, 2013 WL 1655918, at  *10 (D.N.M. March 20, 2013) (Browning, J.) (citing United States v. Hardy, 228 F.3d 745, 748 (6th Cir. 2000)). Res  gestae can also come in the form of ""proper background evidence,"" which the Sangiovanni Court explained ""has a  causal, temporal or spatial connection with the charged offense."" 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55103, [WL at *11.  ""Typically, such evidence is a prelude to the charged offense, is directly probative of the charged offense, arises  from the same events as the charged offense, forms an integral part of a witness's testimony, or completes the  story of the charged offense."" Id. (quoting Hardy, 228 F.3d at 748). If the noticed evidence [*5]  is not admitted as res gestae, the Government then requests it be admitted as evidence  of prior acts pursuant to Rule 404(b), which provides that ""evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible  to prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the  character."" Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(1). To be admissible, Rule 404(b) evidence must (1) be offered for a proper  purpose, (2) be relevant, (3) have a probative value that is not substantially outweighed by potential for unfair  prejudice, and (4) upon request, be subject to an appropriate limiting instruction. United States v. Smalls, 752 F.3d  1227, 1237 (10th Cir. 2014). Discussion 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76072, *2 Page 3 of 6   I. Defendant's Motion to Exclude A. Limited References to the Murder of T.S. are Admissible as Res Gestae Evidence Defense counsel argues that the murders of D.Y. and T.S. in January of 2017 are not relevant to the case against  Mr. Woods, who was in custody at the time both murders occurred. According to Defendant, this evidence cannot  be admitted as res gestae because it is not inextricably intertwined with Mr. Woods' charged conduct nor is it  necessary to show the full picture of the charged offenses. The Government does not plan on referencing the murder of D.Y. in its case in chief, nor does it expect [*6]  to put  on any evidence that Cornelius Galloway may have been involved in the murder of T.S. Instead, the Government  insists that it will give the jury a limited and sanitized version of T.S.'s murder in order to better explain the case.  The Court agrees with the Government that the proposed limited references to T.S.'s murder are admissible as res  gestae. Evidence of the murder is intertwined with proper evidence to such a degree that telling the jury T.S. was killed is  necessary to complete the picture. It explains why she is not a witness against the Galloway Organization and  many of Mr. Woods' statements to law enforcement were made in the context of discussing T.S.'s murder. In turn,  some of Mr. Woods' statements are relevant to whether T.S. was being trafficked by the Galloway Organization.  Under these circumstances, evidence that T.S. was murdered is inextricably intertwined with proper evidence of the  Galloway Organization's alleged trafficking operations and its admission is necessary for the Government to be  able to give a full picture of the charged offenses. Defendant's objections are overruled. The Court will allow limited references to the murder of T.S. to be introduced [*7]  at trial. To cure any danger of  unfair prejudice, the Court grants Defendant's request for an order requiring the Government (or the Court) to read  a stipulation to the jury stating that Mr. Woods was in jail when the murder occurred and that no allegations have  been made that Mr. Woods was criminally involved in this murder. The Court will not rule on the admissibility of evidence related to the murder of D.Y. The Government has  represented that it does not plan to reference this incident in its case in chief. Should the Government seek to  reference the murder of D.Y. at trial, it must request a bench conference so that the Court may rule on this matter  before the jury hears potentially inadmissible evidence. B. Evidence that Mr. Woods Raped T.S. is Admissible as Intrinsic Evidence of the Galloway Organization's  Trafficking Activities In its Notice, the Government states that every instance of Mr. Woods engaging in force, threats, fraud, and  coercion is clearly relevant and intrinsic to the charges themselves. See 18 U.S.C. 1591(a). Defendant does not  object to noticed evidence of Mr. Woods' multiple rapes of A.R., the victim listed in Count 7. Instead, Defendant  challenges only the Government's eyewitness [*8]  testimony that Mr. Woods publicly raped T.S. at a party in the  fall of 2016. The Motion argues that T.S. was likely working for a different pimp at the time and, consequently, Mr.  Woods was not engaging in this alleged conduct as an ""enforcer"" or trafficker. Defendant, citing United States v.  Pace, 981 F.2d 1123, 1135 (10th Cir. 1992), asserts that evidence of acts that occurred outside the life of the  conspiracy cannot be admitted as res gestae. Finally, Defendant contends that this evidence has a high potential  for unfair prejudice. See Fed. R. Evid. 403. The Government contends that the text messages collected from Cornelius Galloway's cell phone strongly indicate  that T.S. was again being trafficked by the Galloway Organization when this alleged rape occurred. Doc. 429 at 5. The Court finds Defendant's Pace argument unavailing, as the cited to portion of that opinion discusses only the  narrow issue of whether Rule 404(b) applies to evidence generated during the life of the conspiracy. 981 F.2d at  1135. The Tenth Circuit has held that res gestae is ""not subject to Rule 404(b)"" United States v. Irving, 665 F.3d  1184, 1212 (10th Cir. 2011). Indeed, res gestae is not limited to the life of the conspiracy because it can include  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76072, *5 Page 4 of 6   other acts that ""were necessary preliminaries to the crime charged,"" Id., or were ""a prelude to the charged offense.""  Sangiovanni, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55103, 2013 WL 1655918, at *11. Under these [*9]  circumstances, evidence of T.S.'s rape at the hands of Mr. Woods is entirely germane  background information that is directly connected to the factual circumstances of Count 3, which alleges that the  Galloway Organization trafficked T.S. This behavior fits squarely within the Indictment's allegations and constitutes  substantive evidence that Mr. Woods engaged in acts of force, fraud, and coercion. See 18 U.S.C. 1591(a). This  evidence plays largely the same role with regards to Counts 2, 3, 4, and 7, as it tends to prove that Mr. Woods  knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that force, threats, fraud, or coercion would be used to cause the other  charged victims to engage in commercial sex acts. See id. The testimony about Mr. Woods' rape of T.S., and  evidence of Mr. Woods' rapes of A.R., are admissible intrinsic evidence. The Court finds that the high probative value of this eyewitness testimony is not substantially outweighed by the  danger for unfair prejudice. See Fed. R. Evid. 403. The allegations in this case are very unpleasant, therefore the  relevant evidence used to prove the case will also be unpleasant. This does not make it unfair. The possibility that a  jury would erroneously connect this [*10]  incident to T.S.'s murder several months later will be cured by a reading  of the Government's stipulation, as discussed in the section above. Defendant's objections are overruled. C. Evidence that the Galloway Organization Trafficked Women Not Named in the Indictment is Admissible as Res  Gestae The Government alleges that the Galloway Organization trafficked approximately nine to twelve women. Cornelius  Galloway admits to having approximately ten victims. Six of these women are named in the Indictment, leaving  additional women unnamed (the ""uncharged victims""). The Government argues the involvement of the uncharged  victims is intrinsic to the overall scheme and fact pattern of the charged offenses. Doc. 316 at 6. Defendant argues  that this evidence is prejudicial and barred under Fed. R. Evid. 404 and Fed. R. Evid. 403, and that any substantive  act that occurred before October of 2016 cannot be admitted as res gestae. As discussed above, evidence generated prior to the charged period can still be admissible as res gestae. For  example, Cornelius Galloway's text messages pertaining to the commercial sex engaged in by the uncharged  victims, sent in late September, are ""a prelude"" to the charged offense. Many of the charged [*11]  victims  reference the uncharged victims when they tell their accounts. Referring to the uncharged victims is necessary to  answer basic questions regarding how each charged victim met the Galloways, and who was present when they  were being trafficked during the conspiracy. Cornelius Galloway referenced some of the uncharged victims in his  interview with police when explaining his involvement in the alleged sex trafficking ring. The Court agrees with the  Government that references to the uncharged victims are necessary to complete the story of the charged offenses.  This evidence if properly admissible as res gestae. The Court finds the high probative value of this evidence is not substantially outweighed by the danger for unfair  prejudice. Because the Galloway Organization used largely the same methods when trafficking its victims, whether  charged or uncharged, references to the uncharged victims' involvement in this case does not present a danger of  unfair prejudice or misleading the jury. Defendant's objections are overruled.           2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76072, *8 Page 5 of 6   D. Evidence of Cornelius Galloway Beating Juvenile M with an Extension Cord and Beating T.S. with a  Backscratcher is Admissible Intrinsic Evidence [*12] . Defendant asks the Court to exclude only the evidence pertaining to the incident in which Cornelius Galloway  allegedly beat T.S. with a backscratcher, the argument being that since Mr. Galloway is no longer a party to this  case admitting evidence of his alleged beatings would be irrelevant and improper at Mr. Woods' trial. The  Government seeks to admit every instance of Cornelius Galloway's violence against victims as intrinsic evidence.  According to the Government, the evidence that Mr. Galloway was beating adult and minor victims during the  charged period is highly probative as to the sex trafficking charges against Mr. Woods. The Court agrees that the noticed evidence meets the standards set forth in Sangiovanni for ""proper background  evidence"" for Counts 3 and 6, as it is directly probative of those charged offenses, arises from the same events,  and forms an integral part of a witness's testimony. WL 1655918, at *11. The high probative value of this evidence  is not unfairly prejudicial, see Fed. R. Evid. 403, and it is unlikely to provoke an inappropriate emotional response  from the jury. See United States v. Rodriguez, 192 F.3d 946, 951 (10th Cir. 1999) (holding that evidence may be  excluded under Rule 403 if it ""tends to affect adversely the jury's attitude towards [*13]  a defendant wholly apart  from its judgment as to his guilt or innocence of the crimes charged.""). Defendant's objections to the admission of  evidence regarding the evidence described above are overruled. Defendant may still object at trial to instances of  Mr. Galloway's violence towards victims that were not described in the Government's Notice. II. Government's Motion to Exclude Evidence that T.S. Caused Someone's Death In his interview with police, Woods made a statement to the effect that T.S. ""ended up killin' our f***ing friend....""  The statement was made in reference to another statement by Woods that T.S. had been ""slipped a Mickey"" (bad  or tainted narcotics) which caused T.S. to act out. The Government seeks to exclude the statements at trial  because they are hearsay, not relevant, and untrustworthy on their face. T.S. is deceased and so cannot deny this  claim. Defendant opposes the exclusion, claiming that even if the statements turns out to be false, it would show  that Woods overstates the violence he sees and hears about on the streets. The Court originally deferred ruling on  the matter. Doc. 491 at 11. Unless Mr. Woods chooses to testify at trial, these statements are hearsay [*14]  if offered by his defense counsel.  Cf. Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2) (a statement made by an opposing party is not hearsay). The circumstances do not  reveal a hearsay exception, and Defendant's argument that these statements are not being used for their truth is  unavailing. Because they are hearsay without an exception, the Court grants the Government's motion to exclude  these statements. If Defendant chooses to testify at trial or Defense counsel finds a non-hearsay vehicle for this  evidence, then it must request a bench conference so that the Court may rule on this matter before the jury hears  potentially inadmissible evidence.",1
"A.R. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 227436","OPINION & ORDER This matter is before this Court on Defendant Wyndham  Hotels & Resorts, Inc.'s (hereinafter ""Wyndham"") Motion  to Dismiss. (ECF No. 30). For the following reasons,  Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is hereby DENIED. I. BACKGROUND Plaintiff, A.R., was trafficked for sex and held captive by  means of ""violence, threats, [*2]  induced dependence  on illegal substances, and induced dependance for  ""food, transportation, shelter, and clothing"" beginning at  twenty years old from 2009 through 2015. (ECF No. 1 at  ¶¶ 33-34). She alleges that this trafficking took place at  a Super 8 and Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham in  Columbus, Ohio. (Id., ¶ 38). Plaintiff now seeks to hold  Defendant liable under the civil liability beneficiary  theory  of  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act (""TVPRA""), 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a).  (Id., ¶ 116). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Wyndham  knew or should have known A.R. was trafficked on its  properties and had a statutory obligation not to benefit  financially from the venture. (Id., ¶¶ 23, 53-54, 117). As  a result, A.R. argues that she suffered ""substantial  physical and psychological injuries."" (Id., ¶ 119). A.R. argues that Defendant ""hewed to a common policy  of harboring known and suspected human traffickers in  exchange for financial benefit"" and ""actively ignoring  signs of ongoing human trafficking."" (Id., ¶¶ 52-53).  Plaintiff alleges the hotel staff at Wyndham's franchises  should have recognized obvious signs of her trafficking  in their hotels which included: (1) unusually large  numbers of male guests asking for A.R. at the front  desk; (2) constant foot [*3]  traffic to A.R.'s room by  ""johns"" who routinely entered the hotels as nonpaying  guests and left within hours of arrival; (3) at least one of  A.R.'s traffickers regularly requesting that hotel staff  notify him when A.R. attempted to leave the hotels; (4)  excessive requests for towels and linens; (5) unusually  large numbers of used condoms in the garbage bins; (6)  cash payment for rooms; and (7) obvious signs of illegal  drug use. (Id. at ¶¶ 47-49). A.R. further alleges that she  called the front desk of the Super 8 for help when her  trafficker and a ""john"" got into a fight and a hotel  employee arrived to break up the fight. (Id., ¶ 44). A.R.  attempted to flee the hotel during the altercation, but her  trafficker caught her and forcibly returned her to the  hotel without staff interference. (Id.). Finally, A.R.  maintains that Defendant has long been on notice of  repeated incidences of sex trafficking at their hotel  Page 2 of 11 locations but fails to provide examples of sex trafficking  events at the Hawthorn Suites at issue in this action.  (Id., ¶ 75). A.R.'s Complaint initially brought a conspiracy claim  against all Defendants. (Id., ¶ 121). Defendants G6  Hospitality, LLC, the Ohio Hotel and Lodging [*4]   Association (""OHLA), and the American Hotel and  Lodging  Association  (""AHLA"")  were  voluntarily  dismissed from this action between January and June  2022. (ECF Nos. 23, 42, 51). Plaintiff and Defendant  Wyndham stipulated to dismissal of the conspiracy  claim (ECF No. 46) in April 2022, and this Court granted  an order dismissing the claim. (ECF No. 47). Therefore,  the TVPRA claim is the only remaining allegation at  issue with Defendant in this Motion to Dismiss. II. STANDARD OF REVIEW This Court may dismiss a cause of action under Federal  Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for ""failure to state a  claim upon which relief can be granted."" Such a motion  ""is a test of the plaintiff's cause of action as stated in the  complaint, not a challenge to the plaintiff's factual  allegations."" Golden v. City of Columbus, 404 F. 3d 950,  958-59 (6th Cir. 2005). This Court must construe the  complaint in the light most favorable to the non-moving  party. Total Benefits Planning Agency, Inc. v. Anthem  Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 552 F. 3d 430, 434 (6th Cir.  2008). If more than one inference may be drawn from  an allegation, this Court must resolve the conflict in  favor of the plaintiff. Mayer v. Mylod, 988 F. 2d 635, 638  (6th Cir. 1993). This Court cannot dismiss a complaint  for failure to state a claim ""unless it appears beyond  doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in  support of his claim which would entitle him to relief."" Id.  This Court, however, is not required [*5]  to accept as  true mere legal conclusions unsupported by factual  allegations. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.  Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). Although liberal, Rule 12(b)(6) requires more than bare  assertions of legal conclusions. Allard v. Weitzman, 991  F.2d 1236, 1240 (6th Cir. 1993) (citation omitted).  Generally, a complaint must contain a ""short and plain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). A complaint's  factual allegations ""must be enough to raise a right to  relief above the speculative level."" Bell Atl. Corp. v.  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L.  Ed. 2d 929 (2007). It must contain ""enough facts to state  a claim to relief that is plausible on its face."" Id. at 570.  A claim is plausible when it contains ""factual content  that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference  that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.""  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Finally, the Complaint should be  read as a whole, even if a specific alleged fact read in  isolation appears meaningless. Ricchio v. McLean, 853  F. 3d 553, 557 (1st Cir. 2017). III. ANALYSIS A. Direct Civil Liability Under the TVPRA § 1595 This Court has undertaken extensive analysis of the  issue of civil liability of hotel defendants in sex trafficking  cases under the TVPRA in other cases with many  factual similarities to this one. See M.A. v. Wyndham  Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959 (S.D. Ohio  2019); H.H. v. G6 Hospitality, LLC, No. 2:19-cv-755,  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152 (S.D.  Ohio Dec. 6, 2019); Doe S.W. v. Lorain-Elyria Motel,  Inc., No. 2:10-cv-1194, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961,  2020 WL 1244192 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 16, 2020); A.C. v.  Red Roof, Inc., No. 2:19-cv-4965, 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 106012, 2020 WL 3256261 (S.D. Ohio Jun. 16,  2020). Like the Plaintiffs in the other related cases, A.R.  has sued under the TVPRA. The TVPRA has two provisions relevant to this case.  First, the TVPRA [*6]  provides for criminal penalties set  forth in 18 U.S.C. § 1591: (a) Whoever knowingly— (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, . .  . recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides,  obtains,  advertises,  maintains,  patronizes,  or  solicits by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting  the violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in  reckless disregard of the fact, that means of  force,  threats  of  force,  fraud,  coercion  described  in  subsection  (e)(2),  or  any  combination of such means will be used to  cause the person to engage in a commercial  sex act, or that the person has not attained the  age of 18 years and will be caused to engage  in a commercial sex act, shall be punished as  provided in subsection (b). Page 3 of 11 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Secondly, and central to Plaintiff's  claim, is the standard for civil liability under the TVPRA  set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 1595: An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should [*7]  have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). This Court held in M.A. and H.H. that § 1595(a) can be  a standalone claim, and civil defendants need not have  committed the underlying criminal sex trafficking offense  under § 1591. M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 964; H.H., 2019  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152 at *2 (citing  Cong.  Research  Serv.,  R40190,  The  William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-457): Criminal  Law Provisions, at 16 (Jan. 29, 2009) (the amendments  to the TVPRA ""create[ ] civil liability both for those who  face criminal liability for their profiteering and those who  do not."")); Plaintiff A v. Schair, No. 2:11-cv-00145-WCO,  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 197819, 2014 WL 12495639, at  *3 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 9, 2014) (explaining that the 2008  amendments broadened the parties who could be sued  for trafficking violations from only the perpetrator)). This  Court likewise finds that A.R.'s allegation that she is a  victim of trafficking under § 1591 is enough to plead  sufficiently that she is ""a victim of this chapter"" pursuant  to § 1595(a) in order to survive a motion to dismiss.  (ECF No. 1, ¶ 11). This Court analyzes Plaintiff's direct civil liability claim  under the ""beneficiary theory"" of § 1595(a), which  requires: (1) the person or entity must ""knowingly  benefit[], [*8]  financially or by receiving anything of  value""; (2) from participating in a venture; (3) that the  ""person knew or should have known has engaged in an  act in violation of this chapter."" § 1595(a). A plaintiff may  satisfy these elements by showing that ""defendant's  own acts, omissions, and state of mind establish each  element."" J.L. v. Best W. Int'l, Inc., 521 F. Supp. 3d  1048, 1060 (D. Colo. 2021). This Court will assess  these factors in a different order than provided in the  statute to allow for a more logical progression of legal  analysis. 1. Knowing benefit This Court begins with an analysis of whether A.R. has  sufficiently alleged that Defendant ""knowingly benefited""  financially from her sex traffickers' sex trafficking  venture. The first element merely requires that  Defendant knowingly receives a financial benefit, not  that the perpetrator have actual knowledge of the sex  trafficking venture. A.C., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106012,  2020 WL 3256261, at *4. As this Court found in M.A.  and H.H., ""the rental of a room constitutes a financial  benefit from a relationship with the trafficker sufficient to  meet this element of the § 1595(a) standard."" M.A., 425  F. Supp. 3d at 965; H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  211090, 2019 WL 6682152 at *2. See also J.L., 521 F.  Supp. 3d at 1061 (concluding that allegations that a  hotel defendant received a percentage of room revenue  where trafficking occurred, was sufficient to meet the  knowingly benefited element under [*9]  18 U.S.C. §  1595(a)); Gilbert v. U.S. Olympic Comm., 423 F. Supp.  3d 1112, 1137 (D. Colo. 2019) (finding the forced labor  provision of § 1589(b) does not ""require[ ] the party to  benefit from the [forced] labor or services for liability to  attach""). A.R. alleges that Defendant rented rooms to  her traffickers and benefited financially. (ECF No. 1, ¶  118). Therefore, Plaintiff pleads allegations sufficient to  meet this element of the § 1595(a) standard. 2. Knew or should have known the venture was  engaged in trafficking A defendant cannot be liable under 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a)  unless it ""knew or should have known"" that the venture  was engaged in sex trafficking. Defendants need not  have actual knowledge of trafficking crimes for liability to  attach, as the language of § 1595(a) demonstrates that  constructive knowledge is sufficient. M.A., 425 F. Supp.  3d at 970 (citing Jean-Charles v. Perlitz, 937 F. Supp.  2d 276, 288-89 (D. Conn. 2013)). This Court has  previously held that notice of ""the prevalence of sex  trafficking generally at their hotels,"" the failure ""to take  adequate steps to train staff in order to prevent its  occurrence,"" and signs that ""should have alerted staff to  [Plaintiff's]  situation""  are  sufficient  to  meet  the  constructive knowledge requirement. Id. at 968. Defendant Wyndham argues that A.R.'s Complaint only  alleges that Wyndham ""could have known"" not ""knew or  should  have  known""  that  sex  trafficking  was  ongoing [*10]  at the Super 8 and Hawthorn Suites in  Columbus. (ECF No. 30 at 10). It alleges that its  franchisor/franchisee  relationship  with  the  hotels  Page 4 of 11 removes it from liability because its connection to hotel  staff is too attenuated to conclude that Defendant had  constructive knowledge of A.R.'s abuse. (ECF No. 36 at  15). Even if Defendant had more control over hotel staff,  it maintains that constructive knowledge under § 1595  requires something more than a generalized awareness  ""that sex trafficking sometimes occurred on their  franchisees' properties."" (Id. at 15-16 (citing S.J. v.  Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 473 F. Supp. 3d 147, 154  (E.D.N.Y.  2020)).  To  adopt  Plaintiff's  proposed  interpretation of the TVPRA, maintains Defendant,  would result in ""any industry whose goods and services  are sometimes misused by criminal traffickers . . .  deemed to have constructive knowledge of any specific  instance of sex trafficking."" (ECF No. 49 at 8).  Defendant argues that Plaintiff must allege that  Wyndham, as a franchisor, had knowledge of ""a specific  trafficking venture"" to be held liable under the TVPRA.  (Id. at 9). Plaintiff points to this Court's previous opinions to argue  that ""failure to combat a known problem in one's  operations can rise to the level of negligence sufficient  to establish [*11]  constructive knowledge as required  under § 1595 of the TVPRA."" (ECF No. 48 at 8 (citing  M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 968)). Plaintiff asserts that she  pled sufficient facts to allege plausibly that hotel  employees at these locations would have been aware of  many red flags and instances of violence that pointed  toward ongoing sex trafficking at their hotels. (Id. at 9).  Even though Defendant was on notice of ongoing sex  trafficking, Plaintiff maintains, Defendant continued to  rent rooms and profit from trafficking while failing to  prevent its occurrence. (Id. at 10). As set forth in several of this Court's previous decisions,  this Court is guided by two cases that represent  opposite ends of the spectrum of the ""knew or should  have known"" prong of the TVPRA. In Ricchio v.  McLean, the plaintiff's allegations contained fairly strong  evidence that the hotel owner and the trafficker were  working together, and that the hotel owner intended to  profit from the trafficking scheme. The allegations  included a ""high-five"" while discussing ""getting this thing  going again,"" a past business relationship between the  trafficker and hotel owner, and allegations that one of  the hotel owners had gone to the victim's room and ""had  shown indifference to Ricchio's obvious [*12]  physical  deterioration."" Ricchio, 853 F. 3d at 555. Ricchio alleged  that while ""in plain daylight view of the front office of the  motel,"" her trafficker ""kick[ed] her and force[d] her back  toward the rented quarters when she had tried to  escape."" Id. The Court concluded that the defendants  ""acted, at least, in reckless disregard"" of the nature of  the venture for purposes of § 1589 and § 1595. Id. at  557. On the other end of the spectrum is Hillary Lawson v.  Howard Rubin, where plaintiffs sued Blue Icarus, the  owner of a condo that it leased to Howard Rubin who  was procuring women then sexually assaulting and  abusing them at that location. No. 1:17-cv-6404 (BMC),  2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71582, 2018 WL 2012869, at *2  (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 29, 2018). The court found the plaintiff's  allegations of one police visit after a fight ensued and  one ambulance sent to the residence in six years  insufficient to hold Blue Icarus liable under § 1595. The  Court reasoned that even if Blue Icarus would have  done further investigation following the incidents, it  would not have uncovered to any more information  about the alleged trafficking. Lawson, 2018 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 71582, 2018 WL 2012869, at **13-14. A.R.'s allegations do not rise to the level of obviousness  present in Ricchio. First, Plaintiff argues that there were  a number of red flags apparent to hotel staff at both  hotels: (1) cash payments for rooms; (2) excessive  requests [*13]  for new linens and towels; (3) nonpaying  ""johns"" asking for A.R. and regularly going into and out  of her room; and (4) requests by her traffickers of staff  to notify them when A.R. attempted to leave the hotels.  (ECF Nos. 1, ¶¶ 47-49). Regarding the Super 8 in which  A.R. alleges she was trafficked, A.R. argues that she  once had to call hotel staff for help when her trafficker  and a ""john"" who had purchased her for sexual activity  got into a fight. (Id., ¶ 44). After hotel staff arrived at her  room, A.R. fled, but was later apprehended by her  trafficker and forced back to the hotel. (Id.). Plaintiff  makes no specific allegations about hotel staff's  awareness of her trafficking at the Hawthorn Suites. This Court finds A.R.'s allegations against both hotels  insufficient to establish actual knowledge. She alleges  that hotel staff were called to her room to break up a  fight between her trafficker and a ""john,"" but she does  not allege facts to demonstrate that the hotel employee  who arrived was aware of the arrangement between the  parties. As previously stated, she does not allege  specific facts about the Hawthorn Suites at all. This Court finds, however, that Defendant had  constructive knowledge [*14]  of the trafficking occurring  at their hotels because they ""should have known"" about  the nature of the venture under the beneficiary theory's  negligence standard. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). A.R. alleges  that Defendant franchisors was on notice about the  Page 5 of 11 prevalence of sex trafficking at its hotels yet continued  to rent rooms to traffickers and failed to take adequate  steps to train staff in order to prevent its occurrence.  (ECF Nos. 1, ¶¶ 42-49, 52; 48 at 10). She also alleges  facts specific to her own sex trafficking, including a  number of signs she alleges should have alerted staff to  her situation. (ECF No. 1, ¶ 49). As such, Plaintiff  argues that Defendant's failure to act resulted in a  ""common policy of actively ignoring signs of ongoing  human trafficking."" (Id., ¶ 53). Even though Defendant maintains that the individual  hotel employee's actual or constructive knowledge of  trafficking is insufficient to impute knowledge on  Defendant as a franchisor (ECF Nos. 30 at 10-11; 49 at  8), Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to pass muster  under the plausibility standard of a 12(b)(6) motion to  dismiss because she alleges that the franchisor itself  had constructive knowledge of the problem. Several  courts have [*15]  found failure to implement policies  sufficient to combat a known problem in one's  operations can rise to the level of willful blindness or  negligence. See Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth,  524 U.S. 742, 758-59, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed. 2d  633 (1998) (holding where a ""supervisor's sexual  harassment is outside the scope of employment  because the conduct was for personal motives,"" an  employer can still ""be liable . . . where its own  negligence is a cause of the harassment"" because it  ""knew or should have known about the conduct and  failed to stop it""); Brown v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 603 F.  Supp. 2d 73, 81 (D.D.C. Mar. 26, 2009) (finding that  complaint stated sufficient allegations under § 1983,  based on willful blindness, where defendants knew that  a supervisor at a correctional facility raped his  employee, sexual harassment at the facility ""was not an  isolated incident,"" and defendants failed ""to implement  and effectuate the appropriate policies . . . to remedy  and/or prevent the discriminatory conduct, sexual abuse  and sexual harassment and rape""). Here A.R. alleged  that Defendant was on notice about the prevalence of  sex trafficking at its hotels and failed to take steps to  train staff to prevent its occurrence. Therefore, this  Court finds that A.R.'s Complaint sufficiently alleges  negligence under § 1595 for purposes of surviving this  Motion to Dismiss. 3. Participation [*16]  in a venture This Court has held that participation in a venture under  § 1595 does not require actual knowledge of trafficking  crimes but requires ""at least a showing of a continuous  business relationship between the trafficker and the  hotels such that it would appear that the trafficker and  the hotels have established a pattern of conduct or  could be said to have a tacit agreement."" M.A., 425 F.  Supp. 3d at 970 (citing Jean-Charles v. Perlitz, 937 F.  Supp. 2d at 288-89); see also Ricchio, 853 F.3d at 555  (finding sufficient allegations that, among other things,  the trafficker and hotel owner had prior dealings); Doe  S.W., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192,  at *6-7 (finding allegations that defendant hotels  repeatedly rented rooms to individuals they should have  known were traffickers based on the totality of the  circumstances, were sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6)  motion); H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL  6682152, at *4 (same); A.C., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  106012, 2020 WL 3256261, at *6 (same). Further,  participation in a venture under the TVPRA does not  require an ""overt act."" See e.g., J.L., 521 F. Supp. 3d at  1062; E.S. v. Best W. Int'l Inc., 510 F. Supp. 3d 420,  427 (N.D. Tex. 2021); M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 968-69;  S.J., 473 F. Supp. 3d at 153-54; Doe S.W., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192, *6; J.C. v.  Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99252,  2020 WL 3035794, at *1 n. 1 (N.D. Cal. June 5, 2020). This Court must decide whether Plaintiff alleged  sufficient facts to demonstrate Defendant's conduct  constituted ""participation in venture"" under § 1595(a).  A.R. alleges that her traffickers had a sex trafficking  venture. The question is whether the Defendant  participated in a commercial venture related to A.R.'s  trafficking  by:  (1)  ""own[ing],  supervis[ing],  and  operat[ing]"" [*17]  the Super 8 and Hawthorn Suites; (2)  receiving 10% of the hotels' gross revenue; (3)  implementing brand standards; (4) giving hotels access  to Wyndham's brand programs and reservation system;  (5) and promulgating the ""policies, procedures, and  standards governing the hiring, training, retention, and  advancement of on-the-ground employees."" (ECF Nos.  1, ¶¶ 56-67; 48 at 11). First, Defendant Wyndham counters that the hotels are  subject to franchise agreements meaning it ""does not  own, operate, manage, or supervise the facilities,"" nor  was Defendant present at either hotel during the period  Plaintiff alleges her trafficking occurred. (ECF No. 30 at  7). Defendant argues that the Complaint has not  established ""a continuous business relationship, . . .  pattern of conduct, or a tacit agreement between""  Wyndham and A.R.'s traffickers. (Id. at 8). In fact,  Defendant contends, the Complaint does not involve  allegations that Wyndham ""hired anyone involved in sex  trafficking, that it witnessed any sex trafficking, or that it  Page 6 of 11 interfered with any efforts to stop sex trafficking."" (Id.).  Even if Plaintiff had made those allegations, Defendant  maintains that franchise relationships simply provide  intellectual [*18]  property to hotel operators and is not  evidence of ""the association-in-fact"" necessary to  establish the existence of a TVPRA ""venture."" (ECF No.  49 at 6-7 (citing Cisneros v. Petland, Inc., 972 F.3d  1204, 1212 (11th Cir. 2020)). Defendant relies on Eleventh Circuit's recent decision in  Doe #1 v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., in which the Court held  that ""participation in a common venture"" under 18  U.S.C. § 1595's beneficiary theory should be defined,  based on its common definition as ""an undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit."" (ECF No.  30 (citing 21 F. 4th 714, 724 (11th Cir. 2021)). In Doe  #1, Plaintiffs alleged that defendant hotel franchisors  participated in ""sex trafficking ventures."" Id. at 726. The  Complaint included allegations that: (1) defendants  licensed their brand to franchisees who paid royalties to  the defendants and other fees based on a percentage of  their room revenue; (2) defendants received a  percentage of the revenue generated from the rooms in  which trafficking occurred; (3) defendants ""owned,  managed, supervised, operated, oversaw, controlled the  operation of, and/or were inextricably connected to the  renting of rooms"" at these hotels; (4) defendant  franchisors investigated incidents of trafficking at the  individual hotels and controlled training related to  spotting trafficking; [*19]  and (5) read online reviews  mentioning prostitution and crime occurring generally at  the hotels where plaintiffs were trafficked. Id. While the  court acknowledged that these allegations suggested  that the franchisor defendants benefitted financially from  renting rooms to traffickers, they did not rise to the level  of showing that ""the franchisors participated in a  common undertaking involving risk or profit that violated  the TVPRA."" Id. at 726-27. On appeal, Plaintiffs  changed their theory and argued instead that ""the  franchisors participated in commercial ventures to  operate hotels and that those hotel ventures violated the  [TVPRA]."" Id. at 727. Because Plaintiffs did not reserve  this theory for appeal and because they repeatedly  referred to ""sex trafficking ventures"" in their pleadings,  the court declined to address Plaintiffs' new ""commercial  venture"" theory. Id. The Eleventh Circuit's decision is not controlling here.  Doe #1 does not apply to the facts at hand. The court  distinguished the ""sex trafficking ventures"" at issue in  Doe #1 from the plaintiff's ""commercial venture""  argument raised on appeal and chose not to address  the plaintiff's commercial venture theory in that case. Id.  at 727. Here, A.R. alleges [*20]  that Defendant  ""participated in a commercial business venture under §  1595[] by receiving royalties from Plaintiff's traffickers  renting rooms at their branded locations,"" and through  their expansive control of other hotel policies and  operations, not that Defendant participated in the sex  trafficking ventures itself. (ECF Nos. 1, ¶¶56-67; 48 at  13). Defendant Wyndham's argument (ECF No. 58 at 6)  that Plaintiff alleged that Defendant participated in  ""trafficking ventures"" (ECF No. 1, ¶ 95) and ""sex  ventures"" (Id., ¶ 131) is misstated because both  references appear in the Complaint under the context of  Plaintiff's original conspiracy claim, which has since  been dismissed. (ECF No. 47). A claim is plausible when it contains ""factual content  that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference  that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.""  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Despite the parties' differing  allegations about Defendant's operational role in the  local hotels, it is not the role of this Court to resolve  factual disputes at this stage of the litigation. M.L. v.  Craigslist Inc., No. C19-6153 BHS-TLF, 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 166836, 2020 WL 6434845, at *6 (W.D. Wash.  Apr. 17, 2020), report and recommendation adopted,  No. C19-6153 BHS-TLF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166334,  2020 WL 5494903 (W.D. Wash. Sept. 11, 2020).  Construing these allegations in favor of the Plaintiff, as  required  at  this  stage,  this  Court  finds  that  Plaintiff's [*21]  allegations that Defendant substantially  oversaw operations and promulgated policies for  franchisee  hotels  meet  §  1595's  definition  of  ""participation in a venture. Here, Defendant was  involved in a business venture with the franchisee  hotels, and both groups benefitted by renting rooms to  traffickers despite having constructive knowledge of  ongoing trafficking based on the totality of the  circumstances. Because Plaintiff's allegations meet the three-pronged  requirement of 18 U.S.C. § 1595, Plaintiff has  sufficiently stated a claim that Defendant is directly,  civilly liable under the TVPRA. See M.A. 425 F. Supp.  3d at 971-72 (denying motion to dismiss of hotel parent  company  defendants  where  plaintiff  pled  that  defendants controlled employee training, room pricing,  provided online booking platform, and conducted  inspections). B. Joint and Several Liability Plaintiff argues that all Defendants are jointly and  Page 7 of 11 severally liable for her damages under the TVPRA.  (ECF No. 1, ¶ 30). Defendant Wyndham does not  appear to respond to this argument. Therefore, this  Court will consider Defendant to have conceded this  point. C. Vicarious Liability A plaintiff can also satisfy the elements of § 1595's  beneficiary theory by imputing ""to the defendant the  acts, [*22]  omissions, and state of mind of an agent of  the defendant"" through indirect or vicarious liability. J.L.,  521 F. Supp. 3d at 1060. Although Plaintiff argues it is  unnecessary to establish a theory of indirect liability as  she has pled sufficient facts to establish Defendant's  direct liability under the TVPRA, Plaintiff maintains that  she sufficiently alleged that Defendant exerts a  significant amount of control over the franchised  locations under an agency and joint employer theory.  (ECF No. 48 at 13). Specifically, she alleges that  Defendant controls the ""business, operations, training,  management,  supervision,  administration,  and  procedures"" of the local hotels and engages in profit  sharing. (Id. at 14 (citing ECF No. 1, ¶¶ 56-67)). The TVPRA, however, does not address the issue of  indirect or vicarious liability; therefore, federal district  courts who have adjudicated this issue must apply  common law to fill in the gaps. Norfolk Redevelopment  and Hous. Auth. v. Chesapeake and Potomac Tel. Co.  of Va., 464 U.S. 30, 35-36, 104 S. Ct. 304, 78 L. Ed. 2d  29 (1983) (explaining that the traditional rules of  statutory construction advise that statutes are presumed  not to disturb the common law ""unless the language of  the statute [is] clear and explicit for this purpose.""); see  also In re Nicole Gas Prod., Ltd., 581 B.R. 843, 850  (B.A.P. 6th Cir. 2018), aff'd sub nom. Nicole Gas Prod.,  Ltd., 916 F.3d 566 (6th Cir. 2019) (explaining that  statutes are presumed to embrace the [*23]  common  law extant at their enactment). In the past, this Court,  and other district courts, have applied the state common  law of vicarious liability when addressing indirect liability  arguments under the TVPRA. M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at  971 (applying Ohio agency law); see also A.B., 455 F.  Supp. 3d at 194-95 (applying Pennsylvania agency law);  S.J., 473 F. Supp. 3d at 158-59 (applying New York  agency law). Since this Court's ruling in 2019, another  district court chose to apply the federal common law of  vicarious liability in a TVPRA case. A.B., 484 F. Supp.  3d at 939-40 (citing Ninth Circuit cases where the court  applied the federal common law of agency where the  federal statute did not otherwise provide direction). Although it has yet to rule on whether the federal or  state common law of vicarious liability should be applied  under the TVPRA, when analyzing the few cases in  which federal statutes do not provide direction on  vicarious liability arguments, the Sixth Circuit has  applied the federal common law of vicarious liability.  See e.g., Marr v. Rife, 503 F.2d 735 (6th Cir. 1974)  (explaining that in determining the extent of liability of  the owner of a real estate agency for violations of Fair  Housing Act by his agent, court should apply federal law  and should not be restricted by respondeat superior law  or law of vicarious liability of the various states); [*24]   Imhoff Invest., L.L.C. v. Alfoccino, Inc., 792 F. 3d 627,  635 (6th Cir. 2015) (explaining that a seller may be held  vicariously liable in an action alleging violation of the  Telephone Consumer Protection Act (""TCPA"") under  federal common law principles of agency) but cf.  Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. Findlay Indus., Inc., et  al., 902 F.3d 597, 611 (6th Cir. 2018) (deciding to apply  state common law to an ERISA contract dispute  regarding successor liability because a federal court  may take direction from ""the law of the state in which it  sits"" so long as the standard used ""best comports with  the interests served by ERISA's regulatory scheme,"" but  explaining that ""as a general matter, the court must look  to the federal common law and should draw guidance  from state common law only when federal common law  does not provide an established standard""). As set forth more fully below, the defining characteristics  of agency and joint employer status are nearly identical  under federal common law and Ohio common law. In  M.A., a similar, previous sex trafficking case alleging  violations of the TVPRA, this Court applied the Ohio  common law of vicarious liability. M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d.  at 971-72. This decision stemmed from the fact that the  limited references to the federal common law of  vicarious liability drew directly from Ohio common law  and Restatements. Even if the Sixth Circuit were to rule  that federal common law should be applied [*25]  to  vicarious liability arguments under the TVPRA, it would  not change this Court's following analysis because there  is little to no substantive difference between federal and  Ohio common law standards for agency and joint  employer vicarious liability. Therefore, a review of the  present matter under both federal and state common  law results in the same outcome. Because the Sixth  Circuit has not (nor has any other federal circuit) had the  opportunity to address whether the federal common law  or state common law of vicarious liability should be  applied to the TVPRA, for thoroughness, this Court will  analyze the current matter under both legal theories to  determine whether Plaintiff meets the pleading standard  Page 8 of 11 for vicarious liability under the TVPRA. 1. Agency and Vicarious Liability Defendant  Wyndham  argues  that  a  franchisor's  obligations to a franchisee under the Lanham Act, which  ""require[] supervision of trademark licensees"" is meant  to ""ensure the integrity of the registered trademarks, not  create a federal law of agency."" (ECF Nos. 30 at 18-19  (citing Oberlin v. Marlin Am. Corp., 596 F. 2d 1322,  1327-28 (7th Cir. 1979); 49 at 11-12). Defendant  explains that ""[a]lthough franchise agreements typically  impose detailed requirements on the franchisee's  operations [*26]  [], the existence of these contractual  requirements does not mean that franchisors have a  role in managing the day-to-day operations of their  franchisees."" (ECF No. 49 at 12) (quoting Kerl v. Dennis  Rasmussen, Inc., 2004 WI 86, 273 Wis. 2d 106, 682  N.W.2d 328, 338 (Wis. 2004)). Defendant cites several  recent court cases that dismissed agency theories  advanced under the TVPRA against hotel brand  franchisors. (Id. (citing H.G. v. Inter-Continental Hotels  Corp., 489 F. Supp. 3d 697, 708 (E.D. Mich. 2020)  (dismissing TVPRA claim based on agency because the  plaintiff ""failed to plausibly allege"" that the franchisor  defendants  had  ""'day-to-day'  control""  over  and  franchised hotels); S.J. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 473  F. Supp. 3d 147, 156 (E.D.N.Y. 2020) (dismissing the  TVPRA claim based on agency because the plaintiff's  allegations, ""even if proven true, would fail to sufficiently  demonstrate that the franchisor defendants exercised []  complete control over the day-to-day operations of the  franchisee's business"")). To the extent the federal system, and more specifically  the Sixth Circuit, have created a common law of agency  liability, the courts generally turn to widely accepted  definitions of agency in building the federal common law  in this space. In Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, the  Supreme Court defined the central principle of agency  law within the employment context: ""[a] master is  subject to liability for the torts [*27]  of his servants  committed  while  acting  in  the  scope  of  their  employment."" 524 U.S. 742, 755-56, 118 S. Ct. 2257,  141 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1998) (quoting Restatement  (Second) of Agency § 219(1)). The Court explained that  ""[a]n employer may be liable for both negligent and  intentional torts committed by an employee within the  scope of his or her employment,"" but in some  circumstances, agency principles ""impose liability on  employers even where employees commit torts outside  the scope of employment."" Id. at 756, 758. It is a long-standing principle of law in Ohio that ""[a]  principal is chargeable with the knowledge of, or notice  to, his agent that is received by the agent in the due  course of the agent's employment and is related to the  matters within the agent's authority."" Liggett v.  Chesapeake Energy Corp., 591 F. App'x 305, 309 (6th  Cir. 2014) (citing State ex rel. Nicodemus v. Indust.  Comm'n, 5 Ohio St. 3d 58, 5 Ohio B. 115, 448 N.E.2d  1360, 1362 (Ohio 1983)). In determining whether there  is an agency relationship, the question is how much the  agent ""retained control, or the right to control, the mode  and manner of doing the work contracted for."" Beddia v.  Goodin, 957 F.2d 254, 257 (6th Cir. 1992) (quoting  Councell v. Douglas, 163 Ohio St. 292, 126 N.E.2d 597,  599 (Ohio 1955)). Further, the right of control or control  retained over the agent is directed ""toward the  attainment of an objective"" which the principal seeks.  Gen. Acquisition, Inc. v. GenCorp Inc., 766 F. Supp.  1460, 1469 (S.D. Ohio 1990) (citing Hanson v. Kynast,  24 Ohio St. 3d 171, 24 Ohio B. 403, 494 N.E.2d. 1091,  1094 (1986)). It is also well established that ""[t]he  principal's right of control need not extend to every  aspect of the alleged principal and agent's association.""  Id. Agency theories [*28]  are also applicable to the  franchisor/franchisee relationship. Under Ohio law, ""a  franchisor may be vicariously liable for a franchisee's  tortious conduct under a theory of apparent agency.""  Bricker v. R & A Pizza, Inc., 804 F. Supp.2d 615, 623  (S.D. Ohio 2011). To determine whether ""a principal- agent relationship exists, courts consider the same  factors 'as in the absence of a franchisor-franchisee  relationship.'"" Id. (citing Taylor v. Checkrite, Ltd., 627 F.  Supp. 415, 416 (S.D. Ohio 1986)). Plaintiff sufficiently details what aspects of the individual  hotel locations Defendant Wyndham controls. As  previously summarized, Plaintiff alleges an agency  relationship was created between the individual hotels  and franchisor Defendant through Defendant's control of  brand quality standards; use and placement of  franchisor's name; local hotel's reservation systems,  brand loyalty programs, and websites; and employment  policies and procedures. (ECF Nos. 1 ¶¶ 56-67; 48 at  14). The fact that Defendant is in a franchise  relationship with the respective, local hotels does not  bar application of agency theory. This Court, construing  the facts in favor of Plaintiff, finds that these allegations  sufficiently establish that Defendant's control over the  local hotels is directed towards attaining more revenue  and commercial success, which [*29]  is the objective  Defendant Wyndham, as principal, seeks. See Gen  Page 9 of 11 Acquisition, Inc., 766 F. Supp. at 1469. This meets the  definitions of agency liability under both federal and  Ohio common law. Therefore, they are sufficient to meet  the pleading standards of Rule 8. Defendant Wyndham also argues that the Complaint  lacks allegations sufficient to support a claim that their  hotel franchisees violated the TVPRA, such that their  actions can be imputed to Defendant as franchisor.  (ECF No. 49 at 13 (citing C.C. v. H.K. Group of Co.,  Inc., No. 1:21-cv-1345-TCB, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  29213, 2022 WL 467813, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 9, 20221)  (dismissing TVPRA claim against franchisee hotel  operator because Plaintiff did not allege interaction  between  defendants  and  traffickers  sufficient  to  establish a common undertaking)); ECF No. 30 at 20). Notably, Defendant Wyndham is correct that for an  agency theory of vicarious liability to apply to it, the hotel  franchisees themselves must have committed a wrong  to be imputed on Defendant. The three-pronged test  established by 18 U.S.C. § 1595 and used by this Court  to assess Defendant's direct liability is applicable to the  hotel franchisees as well. First, A.R. alleges that the  franchisees rented rooms to traffickers and financially  benefited from their trafficking ventures, therefore  satisfying the first prong. (ECF No. 1, ¶¶ 52, 117-18).  Second, [*30]  Plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to  establish that staff at Wyndham's Super 8 and Hawthorn  Suites had, at a minimum, constructive knowledge of  trafficking, through a series of red flags such as  requests for A.R.'s room by nonpaying guests,  excessive requests for clean room supplies, cash  payments for rooms, and that A.R.'s traffickers asked  hotel staff to notify them when she left the hotel. (ECF  No. 1, ¶¶ 47-49). Therefore, the second prong of the  beneficiary theory is satisfied. Third, Plaintiff has alleged  sufficient facts—that Wyndham's franchisee hotels,  along with Defendant, benefited financially from renting  rooms to traffickers and should have known trafficking  was  going  on  based  on  the  totality  of  the  circumstance—to  meet  §  1595's  definition  of  participation in a venture in a commercial setting that  profited from A.R.'s sex trafficking. (ECF No. 48 at 10- 12). 2. Joint Employer Status Plaintiff alleges that under federal labor regulations,  Defendant is ""considered joint employer[] of the  employees at [its] locations at which Plaintiff was  trafficked."" (ECF No. 1, ¶ 64). Defendant responds that  the joint employer doctrine is an ""employment law  concept that has been invoked in the [*31]  franchise  context to give franchisee employees grounds for suing  franchisors under certain narrow circumstances."" (ECF  No. 30 at 17). It maintains that the ""joint employer""  doctrine, however, is not applicable here because it is  ""not a basis for imputing liability to third parties from a  franchisee to a franchisor."" (Id. (citing Bricker, 804 F.  Supp. 2d at 621-22) (explaining that under the joint  employer doctrine ""an employee . . . may impose liability  for violations of employment law on the constructive  employer, on the theory that this other entity is the  employee's joint employer."")). Regardless, Defendant  argues Plaintiff lacks ""well-pled"" facts to even show  Wyndham is a joint employer of the Super 8 and  Hawthorn Suites staff. (Id. at 18). Most courts have recognized that the employer control  theory and the agency theory are ""essentially the  same."" Satterfield v. Tennessee, 295 F.3d 611, 618 n.6  (6th Cir. 2002); see also Ries v. Ohio State Univ. Med.  Ctr., 2013-Ohio-4545, ¶ 21, 137 Ohio St. 3d 151, 156,  998 N.E.2d 461, 466 (Ohio 2013) (explaining that when  defining the scope of employment in a joint employment  setting, the ""concept generally denotes an agency  relationship""). At the federal level, whether two  employers are a joint employer often turns on how much  control one exercises over the other. See e.g., Int'l  Longshoremen's Ass'n, AFL-CIO, Local Union No. 1937  v. Norfolk Southern Corp., 927 F.2d 900, 902 (6th Cir.  1991) (articulating test for joint employer status under  the NLRA as ""the interrelation [*32]  of operations  between  the  companies,  common  management,  centralized control of labor relations, and common  ownership.""); Sanford v. Main Street Baptist Church  Manor, Inc., 327 F. App'x 587, 594 (6th Cir. 2009)  (adopting the following test for Title VII joint employer  status: ""(1) the extent of the employer's control and  supervision over the worker, including directions on  scheduling and performance of work; (2) the kind of  occupation and nature of skill required, including  whether skills are obtained in the work place; (3)  responsibility for the costs of operation, such as  equipment, supplies, fees, licenses, workplace, and  maintenance of operations; (4) method and form of  payment and benefits; and (5) length of job commitment  and/or expectations.""). The Ohio courts similarly weigh  the following factors when determining whether an entity  has sufficient control over another to be considered a  joint employer: ""(1) interrelations of operation, (2)  common management, (3) centralized control of labor  relations, and (4) common ownership and financial  control."" Wittenbrook v. Elecs. Recycling Servs., Inc.,  Page 10 of 11 2018-Ohio-208, ¶ 28, 104 N.E.3d 876, 882-83 (Ohio Ct.  App. 7th 2018). Plaintiff  alleges  on  information  and  belief,  that  Defendant exercises ""significant control over the  employment decisions of [its] hotel locations,"" which  includes  promulgating  ""policies,  procedures,  and  standards governing [*33]  the hiring, training, retention,  and advancement of on-the-ground employees and  setting their rates of pay."" (ECF No. 1, ¶¶ 61-62).  Relevant here, Plaintiff maintains that Defendant  ""promulgate[s] policies relating to training employees to  recognize and respond to human trafficking, and the  Hotel Defendants determine whether or not such  training shall be mandatory."" (Id., ¶ 65). These  pleadings allege that Defendant had significant control  over hotel franchisee employees because it set the  standards by which the hotel employees are expected to  operate on a daily basis. These allegations meet the  requirements to plead joint employment under both  federal and Ohio state common law because they  demonstrate the Defendant's oversight and control was  intimately interwoven with the procedures governing  daily hotel operations and employment policies.  Therefore, A.R. has pled sufficient facts particular to  Wyndham to meet Rule 8 notice requirements for  purposes of surviving this Motion to Dismiss. D. Group Pleading Defendant argues that the Complaint impermissibly  ""offers general allegations about 'consistent red flags'  and adherence to 'a common policy of harboring known  and suspected human traffickers [*34]  in exchange for  financial benefit' without any attempt to tie any particular  allegations to any particular hotel."" (ECF No. 30 at 7).  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 requires a complaint  contain a ""short and plain statement of the claim  showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed. R.  Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The complaint must ""give the defendant  fair notice of what the... claim is and the grounds upon  which it rests."" Bell Atlantic Corp., 550 U.S. at 545  (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S. Ct.  99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957)). The impermissibility or  permissibility of ""group pleading"" is most common in  cases alleging corporate fraud where it is more difficult  for plaintiffs to meet the requirements set out in Federal  Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)—that is, ""a party must state  with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or  mistake."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Within the fraud context,  other courts have concluded that general pleadings are  permissible even where there are multiple defendants  so long as the ""grouping"" does not resemble a  ""monolith."" See City of Morristown v. AT&T Corp., 206  F. Supp. 3d 1321, 1338-39 (citing Fondren v. Schmidt,  626 F. Supp. 892, 898 (D. Nev. 1986) (recognizing that  in cases involving multiple defendants, a plaintiff should  allege the role of each of them, but also noting that  ""group conduct may be pleaded"" when ""a category of  defendants is allegedly responsible for a continuing  course of conduct"")). Fraud carries a heightened pleading standard under  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) that is not  applicable [*35]  to Plaintiff's allegations because she  does not plead fraud here. Our sister district's analysis  of fraud-related group pleadings, however, is instructive  in this case where the pleading burden is lower. Plaintiff  initially brought the TVPRA claim against corporate  hotel entities and associations claiming they were  responsible for the continuation of A.R.'s trafficking in  hotels they owned or were associated with in Columbus.  (ECF No. 1, ¶ 115-19). A.R. alleges that not only was  Defendant generally aware of ongoing trafficking in their  hotels but also alleges specific facts about signs of her  own trafficking in the Columbus hotels that would have  made Defendant constructively aware of her situation.  (Id., ¶¶ 44-49). Again, Plaintiff's allegations about  incidents of abuse at Wyndham's Super 8 hotel are  specific to that location. (Id., ¶ 44). A.R. does not have  to meet a heightened pleading standard, yet she does  here. This Court is satisfied that Plaintiff sufficiently pled  that all Defendants were responsible ""for a continuing  course of conduct,"" even though Defendant Wyndham is  currently the only defendant remaining. Fondren, 626 F.  Supp. at 898; (ECF Nos. 23, 42, 51). To the extent the  allegations are attributable [*36]  to prior defendants  instead of Wyndham, that conclusion will become  apparent through the discovery process. City of  Morristown, 206 F. Supp. at 1339. Further, Plaintiff does state allegations specific to at  least one of Wyndham's hotels: employees at the Super  8 broke up a fight between A.R.'s trafficker and a ""john""  when she called them for help. (ECF No. 1, ¶ 44).  Paragraph 47 alleges that at least one of ""A.R.'s  traffickers regularly requested that hotel staff notify him  should A.R. attempt to leave the hotels' premises."" (Id.,  ¶ 47). Finally, Plaintiff asserts that Wyndham maintained  ""policies and procedures that they knew or should have  known incentivized their employees to ignore obvious  signs of human trafficking, and even rent rooms to  known or suspected human traffickers, while they  continued to profit from sex trafficking."" (Id., ¶ 54). While  Plaintiff made some of these same allegations against  Page 11 of 11 the other defendants, this is not a situation where  ""[p]laintiff simply incorporated all of his previous  allegations by reference, set forth a list of the  defendants he intended to include in each count, and  then pled a series of legal conclusions."" Ingris v.  Borough of Caldwell, No. 14-855 (ES), 2015 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 74255, 2015 WL 3613499, at *8 (D.N.J. Jun. 9,  2015). Plaintiff named Wyndham in her Complaint and  made allegations specific [*37]  to its failure to prevent  her sex trafficking. Therefore, A.R. has pled sufficient  facts particular to Wyndham to meet Rule 8 notice  requirements for purposes of surviving this Motion to  Dismiss.",1
"United States v. Woods, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858","FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING STATEMENTS OF CO-CONSPIRATORS THIS MATTER comes before the Court on the issue of whether certain statements offered against Matthew Woods  may be admitted during the guilt/innocence phase of his trial. In addition to testimony from a Government witness,  the Court considered the following filings: • The Government's Notice of Intent to Introduce Evidence of Co-Conspirator Statements Pursuant to Fed. R.  Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), filed December 6, 2019 (Doc. 382) • Defendants' Joint Response to Government's Notice of Intent to Introduce Evidence of Co-Conspirator  Statements Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), filed January 17, 2020 (Doc. 398) • The Government's Second Notice of Intent to Introduce Evidence of Co-Conspirator Statements Pursuant to  Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), filed June 10, 2020 (Doc. 427)   Page 2 of 31 • Matthew Woods' Motion [*2]  for a James Hearing and Response to Government's Second Notice of Intent to  Introduce Evidence of Co-Conspirator Statements Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), filed June 30, 2020  (Doc. 436) • The Government's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, filed January 11, 2021 (Doc. 512) • Matthew Woods' Response to Government's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Notices  of Intent to Introduce Putative Co-Conspirator Statements, filed January 25, 2021 (Doc. 514). The Court held a James hearing on April 19, 2021, at which it heard the testimony of the Government's case agent,  Special Agent Scott Pharis of Homeland Security Investigations (""SA Pharis""), as well as further oral arguments  from the parties. Having considered the pleadings, the parties' arguments, and the evidence and testimony  presented at the James hearing, the Court herein makes the following findings and conclusions on the matter. The Defendants: Cornelius Galloway, Danielle Galloway, Marcus Taylor, Matthew Woods (""the Galloway  Organization"") are alleged to have entered into a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a)(1). The object of the conspiracy was, among other things, to recruit, entice, harbor, transport, [*3]  provide,  obtain, and/or maintain numerous females, knowing that some were under the age of 18 and all would be caused to  commit a commercial sex act. To achieve the goals of the conspiracy, the Galloway Organization employed force,  fraud, threats, and coercion, all methods designed to cause the females to commit a commercial sex act. A. Evidence of the Conspiracy and Matthew Woods' Membership Therein Before deciding whether the Government's proffered statements are admissible as non-hearsay co-conspirator  statements pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), the Court must determine by a preponderance of the evidence  that: (1) a conspiracy existed, (2) the declarant and Mr. Woods were both members of the conspiracy, and (3) the  statements were made in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. United States v. Owens, 70 F.3d 1118,  1123-24 (10th Cir. 1995) (citing United States v. Urena, 27 F.3d 1487, 1490 (10th Cir.)) (quoting United States v.  Johnson, 911 F.2d 1394, 1403 (10th Cir.1990)). This section deals with the first two determinations. The Court may consider the co-conspirator statements themselves, as well as independent evidence, in  determining whether the conspiracy existed, but the statement cannot ""by itself establish . . . [either] the existence  of the conspiracy or [the defendant's] participation in it."" Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2); see United States v. Lopez- Gutierrez, 83 F.3d 1235, 1242 (10th Cir. 1996); United States v. Martinez, 825 F.2d 1451, 1453 (10th Cir. 1987)  (the Government must produce some ""independent evidence [*4]  linking the defendant to the conspiracy.""); United  States v. Busch, 758 F.2d 1394, 1397 (10th Cir. 1985) (""The general rule is that the utterances and acts of one  conspirator are admissible against a co-conspirator, even though the latter was not present at the time of the act or  utterances, if there be evidence, independent of the utterances or acts themselves, which shows the existence of a  conspiracy""). Apart from the co-conspirator statements themselves, there exists substantial, independent evidence that the  charged conspiracy existed, and that Matthew Woods was a member of this conspiracy, along with Cornelius  Galloway, Danielle Galloway, and Marcus Taylor. The Government has established this by a preponderance of the  evidence by way of the following: 1. Several Grand Juries have found probable cause that Cornelius Galloway, Danielle Galloway, Marcus Taylor,  and Matthew Woods conspired with each other to commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. See Docs. 2, 54, 103,  303, and 380. 2. Cornelius Galloway and Marcus Taylor have signed plea agreements wherein they state they were engaged in a  conspiracy with each other, Danielle Galloway, and Matthew Woods in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1594(c). Danielle  Galloway signed a plea agreement in which she states she was a part of that same [*5]  conspiracy with Cornelius  Galloway, Marcus Taylor, and Matthew Woods in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *1 Page 3 of 31 3. In October 2016, Danielle Galloway brought M.V. back to the home she shared with her husband, Cornelius  Galloway, where M.V. met with Cornelius Galloway and Matthew Woods. In order to force and coerce M.V. into  participating in commercial sex acts to benefit the Galloway Organization, Matthew Woods beat her at that time.  Shortly after, she was taken to the Howard Johnson Inn in Albuquerque, New Mexico. M.V. refused to participate in  commercial sex acts at the Howard Johnson for approximately one to two weeks. After each time she refused,  Matthew Woods would come to the hotel room and beat her as punishment for failing to participate in commercial  sex acts and to force and coerce her to engage in such acts in the future. 4. During a period in which K.T. was allegedly being trafficked for commercial sex, Matthew Woods hit K.T. in the  head with a full can of liquid in an effort to wake her up. 5. The women recruited by the Galloway Organization would wait, or, in some instances, hide outside on the hotel  room balcony while other women performed commercial sex acts in the hotel room. 6. Cornelius Galloway [*6]  had pictures of several of the victims, both charged and uncharged, saved in his phone.  In many of these pictures, the victims are posing in a manner consistent with being offered for sale for commercial  sex. Several of the pictures appear to contain marketing material from advertisements for commercial sex. 7. A substantial number of photographs of the victims, both charged and uncharged, were found in  dgalloway1023@gmail.com, an email address that the Government has sufficiently established belonged to  Danielle Galloway and Cornelius Galloway. 8. Danielle Galloway booked the hotel rooms where the commercial sex acts were to occur. According to records  subpoenaed from Booking.com, an account associated with Danielle Galloway, she made over thirty separate  bookings in one month at several hotels in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 9. Danielle Galloway would answer the phone and speak with prospective commercial sex customers. 10. Cornelius Galloway collected all the revenue generated from the commercial sex acts. 11. Cornelius Galloway would provide narcotics to the women. 12. The Galloway Organization advertised the women who were within the control of the organization on  Backpage.com. 13. Matthew [*7]  Woods was able to tell law enforcement that, when T.S. was in Albuquerque, New Mexico, rates  for commercial sexual acts performed by T.S. were generally ""80 to 120 [dollars]."" 14. Matthew Woods revealed to law enforcement that he was aware that ""Backpage don't exist no more."" 15. K.T. wrote a Facebook message to an acquaintance in which she explains that she is ""freaking out"" because  ""Staxx"" (an alias of Matthew Woods, sometimes spelled ""Staccs"") pulled a gun out an said for me to get in  Backpage and stop playin' or he's gonna shoot me in the face."" 16. Matthew Woods also told law enforcement something to the effect of ""I love women, and I love getting deals  done."" 17. Marcus Taylor would drive the women to locations where they would participate in commercial sex acts.  Additionally, in an effort to mollify the women, Marcus Taylor would take them shopping and to see their families.    2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *5 Page 4 of 31 18. In his statement to law enforcement, Cornelius Galloway admitted to being a ""pimp,"" and that when the women  did not do what they were told he would send them to ""Staxx"" (Matthew Woods) who would ""tune them up"" (batter  them). 19. A.R. reported to the Albuquerque Police Department (""APD"") that she was raped [*8]  by ""Staxx"" (Matthew  Woods). 20. In his statement to law enforcement, Matthew Woods stated that T.S. was murdered ""because she be fagging  off...means she'll disappear. She was a whore, won't work for anyone."" Woods further told police that T.S. was  working for an individual he would only refer to as ""Chips Ahoy,"" (a reference SA Pharis interprets as meaning  Cornelius ""Chip"" Galloway) and that ""Chips Ahoy"" had other underage females working for him. Woods also stated  during the interview that he is in ""the inner circle,"" and that he ""used to get like 1,200 to pick a girl up and bring her  back."" Later in the interview, Woods acknowledged that ""Chip"" asked Woods to ""beat [T.S.] up."" 21. Matthew Woods told law enforcement that there were approximately three instances in which he ""got paid to  fuck T.S. up."" 22. Matthew Woods also stated to law enforcement something to the effect of ""when T.S. works for everybody she  comes to us."" 23. Matthew Woods admitted to hitting T.S. 24. Matthew Woods told law enforcement something to the effect of ""T.S. usually got a hold of me because I'm  always telling her where she goes."" 25. An individual named T.R. told law enforcement that she witnessed Matthew Woods [*9]  rape T.S. 26. M.V. directly observed and heard others advise that additional women engaged in commercial sex acts on  behalf of the Galloway Organization, to include Juvenile J, K.T, T.S, and ""Renee."" 27. M.V. called 911 to report that Cornelius Galloway was looking for her after he had trafficked her, and she had  run away. 28. After contacting law enforcement, M.V. brought up the name ""Staxx"" (Matthew Woods) in her interview with  APD Sergeant Matthew Vollmer. 29. Juvenile M reported being beaten by Cornelius Galloway and was forced to perform commercial sex acts. 30. K.T., M.V., T.S., Juvenile J, and Juvenile M were all posted on Backpage.com, a website used to advertise  individuals for commercial sex. B. The Co-Conspirator Statements The following statements were made in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. The statements intended  to promote the conspiratorial objectives to traffic women, both minors and adults, for commercial sex. 1. Statement by Danielle Galloway to M.V., ""My friend over here wants to talk to you."" This statement was made in October 2016 by co-conspirator Danielle Galloway to M.V., while at Cornelius and  Danielle Galloway's residence on Third Street in Albuquerque, [*10]  New Mexico. Danielle Galloway had just  driven M.V. from M.V.'s place of employment to the residence. At the residence, Danielle stated to M.V., ""My friend  over here wants to talk to you."" M.V. was then led down a hallway to a room in which Cornelius Galloway and  Matthew Woods were present. Once M.V. was in the room, Matthew Woods began to physically batter her. Both  Woods and Cornelius Galloway were armed with firearms at that time. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *7 Page 5 of 31 Danielle Galloway's statement to M.V. letting her know that her ""friend"" wanted to talk to M.V. was uttered to cause  M.V. to go to the room wherein she was a beaten by Matthew Woods. It furthered the conspiracy because it put  M.V. into the room where the ""recruitment"" continued. Therefore, the statement is admissible in trial against  Matthew Woods as a co-conspirator statement under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 2. Statement by Cornelius ""Chip"" Galloway to M.V. about ""what's going to happen,"" that M.V. is going to  work for Cornelius and do what Cornelius says, and if she doesn't Cornelius and Matthew Woods are going  to beat M.V. until she cooperates. During the encounter discussed above where M.V. was led into the room and beaten by Matthew Woods, co- conspirator Cornelius Galloway told [*11]  M.V. what he expected of her. In sum and substance, he stated the  following to her, ""This is what's going to happen. You are going to work for me (Cornelius), and do what I  say. If you don't, we are going to beat you like this until you cooperate."" Matthew Woods was present when  Cornelius Galloway made this statement to M.V. After this encounter, M.V. remained with the Galloway Organization but refused to perform commercial sex acts on  their behalf for approximately one-and-a-half-weeks. During that time, M.V. was, as Cornelius Galloway threatened,  beaten by Matthew Woods. Eventually, M.V. tired of the beatings and acquiesced to the Galloway Organization's  demand that she prostitute herself for them. This statement by co-conspirator Cornelius Galloway furthers the conspiracy because it explains to M.V. the terms  of how the Galloway Organization would control and use her to further the group's commercial sex trafficking  enterprise. It is substantive evidence of the ""recruitment"" of M.V., and was uttered to force, coerce, and threaten  M.V. to engage in commercial sex acts. Therefore, the statement is admissible in trial against Matthew Woods as a  co-conspirator statement under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 3. Cornelius [*12]  ""Chip"" Galloway's statements to M.V. that if she didn't do the cocaine that was there for  her, that Cornelius would have Matthew Woods come over and force her to do it, ""We'll find a way to force  you, we'll shoot you up. We'll do whatever we have to... I don't want to force you, you know, force it down  into your body to make you happy but..."" These statements were made by co-conspirator Cornelius Galloway to M.V. in October or November of 2016. M.V.  is expected to testify that there were days when she was depressed, and instead of allowing M.V. to take her  prescribed medication, Cornelius Galloway wanted her to ingest cocaine instead. Specifically, Cornelius Galloway  insisted on cocaine use by stating, ""I'm going to have [Matthew Woods] come in here and force you to do it,  you know. We'll find a way to force you... we'll shoot you up. We'll do whatever we have to... I don't want to  force you, you know, force it down into your body to make you happy but..."" This statement furthers the conspiracy because it was made to coerce and persuade M.V. to ingest cocaine  because, in the view of the Galloway Organization, it would elevate her mood. Cornelius Galloway's purpose was to  manipulate and [*13]  direct M.V.'s behavior. The Government presented evidence that in the business of sex  trafficking, a prostitute experiencing the effects of cocaine, which can include a stimulant effect and increased  sociability, will likely bring in more money. The Government has sufficiently established this statement was made for  the ultimate purpose of causing M.V. to engage in commercial sex acts, and therefore it was made to further the  conspiracy. The statement is admissible in trial against Matthew Woods as a co-conspirator statement under Fed.  R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 4. Cornelius Galloway told M.V. that if she ever left, or if she ever said anything to anyone about what was  happening to her, he would hunt her down, find her, and kill her. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *10 Page 6 of 31 When asked by police what would happen if M.V. ever left the Galloways, or tried to leave, M.V. responded,  ""[Cornelius Galloway] said he would hunt me down and he'd find me, and he said he would kill me.... if I  ever said anything to anybody, and that's why I'm scared."" This statement is direct evidence of threats and coercion by a co-conspirator and was said to further the conspiracy  by scaring M.V. into remaining with the Galloway Organization and continuing to engage in the commercial [*14]   sex that brought in money for them. Therefore, the statement is admissible at trial against Matthew Woods as a co- conspirator statement under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 5. Cornelius ""Chip"" Galloway told M.V. to ""get your ass in here... get in here 'cause I'm going to kick your  ass for leaving...You better not be calling the cops."" The Government has already presented evidence to this Court that after M.V. escaped the Galloway Organization,  Cornelius Galloway found her on November 23, 2016, and attempted to bring her back. However, upon being  confronted by Cornelius Galloway, M.V. called 911. The Court has reviewed the recording of her phone call and has  previously determined it to be admissible at trial. (Doc. 491). M.V. reported that Cornelius told M.V., ""get your ass  in here."" M.V. did not comply and called the police. Cornelius told M.V., ""get in here 'cause I'm going to kick  your ass for leaving."" M.V. continued to refuse and brought the phone up within view so that Cornelius could see  it. Cornelius stated, ""you better not be calling the cops."" In light of the prior threats discussed above (if M.V. ever left, Cornelius Galloway would hunt her down and kill her),  these statements were uttered by co-conspirator [*15]  Cornelius Galloway on the day he did in fact hunt M.V.  down. Cornelius' statement threatening M.V. and ordering her to get in the car was made to further the conspiracy  because having M.V. in the confines of a vehicle would, of course, allow him to more easily exert control over her  again. Cornelius Galloway's statement that M.V. better not be calling the cops was made to further the conspiracy  because it was uttered to thwart a report to law enforcement. Cornelius used the statement to prevent M.V. from  telling anyone about what the Galloway Organization had done to her previously and intended to do to her moving  forward. Therefore, the statement is admissible in trial against Matthew Woods as a co-conspirator statement under  Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 6. Text Messages Discussing Finding M.V. a. Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: ""I know where [M.V.] at."" Cornelius Galloway: ""Where is she at and have that job came yet."" Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: ""No"" Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: ""And she downtown"" Cornelius Galloway: ""Where is she at"" (Exhibit 1A, lines 454-458) Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: [sends screen shot of message with J.G. with text stating ""in the car on McKight (sp)  and [C]ommercial"" ] (Exhibit 2) Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: [*16]  ""Look it up and the car is a silver Kia rio."" Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: ""And the driver side dosn't have a side mirror."" Cornelius Galloway: ""I know where it's at I'm headed there right now."" (Exhibit 1A, lines 459-461)   2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *13 Page 7 of 31 These messages were sent on November 23, 2016 at 3:18 am, less than an hour prior to the report referenced  above during which Cornelius Galloway confronted M.V. The text messages from co-conspirator Cornelius  Galloway are admissible because they were made to further the conspiracy in that their purpose was to ferret out  the whereabouts of M.V. As such, the messages are admissible at trial against Matthew Woods as co-conspirator  statements under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). Furthermore, the messages from Juvenile J, who used several  different phone numbers over the course of indicted period, are admissible because they are not offered for the  truth of the matter asserted, but to put Cornelius Galloway's statements in context. See United States v. Cesareo- Ayala, 576 F.3d 1120, 1128-29 (10th Cir. 2009). 7. Cornelius ""Chip"" Galloway told T.S.: ""Bitch I'll kill you, bitch"". ""Sit back before I beat your ass, I'll blow  your shit off your fucking head."" The Government will introduce these statements at trial through its witness Danielle Galloway, whom the  Government claims was [*17]  present when Cornelius Galloway initially made these statements to T.S. Post- arrest, Cornelius Galloway repeated these statements to law enforcement and added that he would never actually  take these actions against T.S. Regardless of his true intentions, co-conspirator Cornelius Galloway made these statements to T.S. to further the  conspiracy. They are threats of violence made to control her behavior. Controlling her behavior is an important  aspect of sex trafficking T.S. Threats and violence are an element of the crimes charged. Therefore, the statement  is admissible at trial against Matthew Woods as a coconspirator statement under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 8. Cornelius ""Chip"" Galloway asked Matthew Woods to beat T.S. up. Defendant Matthew Woods stated to police that ""Chip"" had asked him to ""beat [T.S.] up."" This information came  after discussing the perception that T.S. had been ""fagging off"" and ""won't work for anyone."" Cornelius Galloway  was a co-conspirator, and his request that Matthew Woods beat T.S. was made in the course of the conspiracy and  also furthered it by effecting physical punishment upon T.S. for her behavior that was deemed counterproductive to  the Galloway Organization's objectives, [*18]  i.e. ""fagging off."" The Court heard extensive testimony regarding the  timing and nature of Matthew Woods' statements to police regarding these interactions with Cornelius Galloway.  Consequently, it finds that the Government has sufficiently established Cornelius Galloway made these statements  under the circumstances described above. Therefore, statements by which Cornelius Galloway requests that  Matthew Woods batter T.S. due to her noncompliant behavior and actions are admissible at trial against Matthew  Woods as co-conspirator statements under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 9. Statement by Cornelius Galloway to Danielle Galloway regarding Juvenile M that ""She's good to go."" At some point between December 2016 and February 2017, Cornelius Galloway and Marcus Taylor recruited  Juvenile M. to prostitute for the Galloway Organization. At the end of the conversation/recruitment, it was necessary  for someone to advise Danielle Galloway whether Juvenile M. would be commencing ""work."" Therefore, Cornelius  Galloway advised Danielle Galloway regarding Juvenile M. that ""she's good to go,"" which SA Pharis testified he  interpreted as meaning that Juvenile M was ready to begin engaging in commercial sex work. Upon being  ""good [*19]  to go,"" Danielle could start making her arrangements to advertise Juvenile M. and arrange rooms        2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *16 Page 8 of 31 where the sex acts would occur. The basic purpose of making this statement was for Cornelius to let another  coconspirator, Danielle Galloway, know that they had an additional girl to sell. This communication was made in the  course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. Therefore, the statement is admissible at trial against Matthew  Woods as a co-conspirator statement under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 10. Statement by Marcus Taylor to Cornelius ""Chip"" Galloway communicating to Cornelius Galloway to  stop beating Juvenile M In or near the early part of 2017, Juvenile M was fighting with another unnamed victim who was also being  trafficked by the Galloway Organization. As punishment for fighting with each other, Cornelius Galloway beat the  two of them at Matthew Woods' residence with what was perceived by some to be an electrical cord. Danielle  Galloway and Marcus Taylor were outside the apartment listening to the beating. At some point, it was described to  have gotten so bad that Marcus Taylor had to go inside and tell Cornelius to stop. Marcus Taylor's communication to fellow co-conspirator Cornelius Galloway to stop [*20]  the beating was made in  the course of the conspiracy because it ultimately dealt with financial and business considerations. If Juvenile M.  had been hurt to the point of being unable to ""work,"" it would have adversely affected the Galloway Organization's  business. SA Pharis testified that, from the perspective of sex traffickers, a beaten woman may, to some  prospective buyers, have less appeal than one who was not bruised and battered. Since some customers plausibly  may not wish to engage in commercial sex with a woman who appeared to have been beaten up, the revenue  stream to the Galloway Organization was at risk. Therefore, Marcus Taylor telling Cornelius Galloway to stop the  beating furthered the monetary interests of the conspiracy, and this statement is admissible in trial against Matthew  Woods as a co-conspirator statement under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 11. Cornelius ""Chip"" Galloway's statements to Danielle Galloway that he wished to continue giving  narcotics to an uncharged victim, despite the fact that she was pregnant. One of the uncharged victims became pregnant, a development that spawned a discussion between Cornelius and  Danielle Galloway concerning whether the Galloway Organization should continue [*21]  to provide narcotics to the  pregnant victim. The Government will present evidence that Cornelius Galloway told Danielle Galloway that he  wished to continue to provide narcotics to this woman despite the fact that she was pregnant. The  Government sufficiently established that this statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy because it  allowed the Galloway Organization to continue to use narcotics to control the woman for the purpose of ensuring  that she would continue to engage in commercial sex. At this point, there is no reason to find that Cornelius  Galloway made this statement in an effort to further objectives unrelated to the conspiracy (e.g. profits from sales of  recreational drugs). Therefore, such a statement is made in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy, and  it is admissible at trial against Matthew Woods as a co-conspirator statement under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 12. Danielle Galloway's Facebook post to T.S., ""Dog Pen [T.S.]"" The Government will present evidence at trial that the Organization placed one if its victims, T.S., inside what  witnesses will describe as a dog cage or pen as punishment for failing to abide by the Galloway Organization's  rules. Afterward, co-conspirator [*22]  Danielle Galloway posted the words, ""Dog Pen [T.S.]"" on T.S.'s Facebook  page. This is not an instance of two acquaintances using the social media platform to stay in touch. Rather, this  statement made by co-conspirator Danielle Galloway communicates the consequences of T.S.'s alleged  misbehavior or noncompliance. These words are written to exert control over a victim. Furthermore, the statement  was made to a wide audience that included T.S. and everyone with access to T.S.'s Facebook page, and therefore  is written with plausible knowledge that other victims would read it, and it would act as a warning to them as well.  The statement not only furthers the conspiracy with respect to T.S., but also with respect to any other victims who  might also read it. Therefore, the statement is admissible at trial against Matthew Woods as a co-conspirator  statement under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *19 Page 9 of 31 13. Text messages between Cornelius Galloway and Prospective Buyers of Commercial Sex. The text messages put forth in subsections 13, 14, 15, and 16 are found in Government Exhibit 1A, which  catalogues incoming and outgoing text messages found on Cornelius Galloway's cell phone. Exhibit 1A uses a  color-coded system that identifies [*23]  the author of each message. Cornelius Galloway's text messages are  keyed to a gray background. The text messages in the white background are authored by unknown prospective  buyers of commercial sex (""johns""). The messages from johns are soliciting commercial sex on their face. The vast  majority of them begin as apparent inquiries to online commercial sex advertisements. A number of them also begin  within minutes of a prior text conversation that discusses or references posting an advertisement. Cornelius Galloway's side of the conversations with the johns consists of him pretending to be the female  advertised online (although the unnamed john in conversation 'l' is aware that he is communicating with Mr.  Galloway). Cornelius Galloway informs the johns of where to go, how much to pay, and what kinds of sex acts they  can perform with the women. Occasionally Cornelius Galloway asks about law enforcement affiliation, and screens  for customers he perceives not to be serious. These statements by Cornelius Galloway are direct evidence of him  selling sex by managing the flow of customers and negotiating price. Thus, they were made in the course of and in  furtherance of the conspiracy. The johns' [*24]  statements are admissible for their non-hearsay contextual value, specifically, their ability to  demonstrate that Cornelius Galloway's statements were made during the course of and in furtherance of the  conspiracy. See Cesareo-Ayala, 576 F.3d at 1129 (finding that statements that ""may well support an assertion of  the prosecution"" are not hearsay under Rule 801(c) because they were not admitted for their truth, but rather to  establish that a business relationship existed between the declarants and to put the defendant's statements in  context); see also State v. Jackson, 2018-NMCA-066, ¶ 21, 429 P.3d 674, 682 (finding under state rules of  evidence, identical to the corresponding federal rules, that text messages from prospective customers of  commercial sex ""were not offered for their truth—that the price for services was $150 per hour or that Tiffany was in  a certain location at a certain time. Rather, those statements were offered to provide context and establish that  Defendant and Tiffany were motivated by money to set up commercial sexual transactions""). Moreover, the vast  majority of the johns' text messages are non-assertive statements or questions. See United States v. Lewis, 902  F.2d 1176, 1179 (5th Cir. 1990) (questions asked by an unknown caller, like most questions and inquiries, are not  hearsay because they do not, and were not [*25]  intended to assert anything), see also United States v. Jackson,  88 F.3d 845, 847-48 (10th Cir. 1996) (the question, ""Is this Kenny?"" cannot reasonably be construed to be an  intended assertion, either express or implied). a.

Text messages between Cornelius ""Chip"" Galloway and the victims, named and unnamed. Cornelius Galloway also engages in a number of text messages with women who are ""working"" for him as  prostitutes. Specifically, he engages in conversations with K.T. (color keyed in light pink on Government Exhibit 1A),  M.V. (fuscia), T.S. (lavender), [*31]  and Juvenile J (purple). He also engages with a number of women who are not  named as victims in the indictment, but are identifiable within the context of the messages themselves, and through  reports by victims. These women include Renee (bright green), and Renee 2 (blue). There are also a few other  phone numbers of individuals who are clearly, from the face of the messages, engaged in commercial sex for the  Galloway Organization, but because Cornelius Galloway had no contact information saved, are unidentifiable. It is  likely they are not ""new"" girls but are different numbers for the women already named in this paragraph. The text  messages authored by the victims are admissible for their contextual value. The content of these conversations is generally the same and includes telling the women when they have dates,  where they should go, and ensuring their cooperation. The Government has selected the following to present to the  jury: a. Cornelius Galloway: what's up what you got K.T., 505-231-7824: ok in ready to make $$ K.T., 505-231-7824: Im sick of this shit already but wen I ask u or marcus for help I get ignored. Please chip.  Idc if I dnt get high for week's I promise I wont fuhk up. [*32]  (Exhibit 1A, lines 1-3) This message, sent on September 5, 2016, shows Cornelius Galloway checking in with victim K.T. about whether or  not she will be working for him. K.T.'s messages are admissible because they are not being presented to prove the  truth of the matter asserted. In other words, the Government will not be proving that indeed, K.T. is ""sick of this  shit,"" or that she doesn't care if she gets high for a week, or that she ""wont fuhk up."" The statements are coming in  to show recruitment by Cornelius Galloway, and that there is a connection between Cornelius Galloway and Marcus  Taylor. The statement by Cornelius Galloway is indicative of recruitment of K.T. and is made to further the  conspiracy to sex traffic K.T. b. 505-203-1506: I need the Backpage account info 2021 U.S. Dist.

Wow Cornelius Galloway: Oops wrong person (Id, lines 85-96) These texts were written in late September 2016. The messages themselves, [*34]  as well as SA Pharis'  testimony, establish that co-conspirator Cornelius Galloway was directing the advertisement of women on the  website Backpage.com, as well as posting the advertisements himself. These statements were made in furtherance  of the conspiracy. When T.S. tells him she cannot access the Backpage website, Cornelius responds with an intent  to instruct her to either go to sleep or go ""walking"" to get some money. Despite the fact that this message (line 94)  was sent to an unintended recipient, the statement was made in the course of the conspiracy, and was made to  further the money making endeavors of T.S. by ordering her to go ""walking."" d. T.S., 575-291-3706: Are u coming back to check out in a few Cornelius Galloway: I'm up here right now getting a room again but y'all going to beat your feet today.   2021 U.S. Dist.

Cornelius Galloway: Okay  [*35] (Id, lines 114-115) Conversations 'd' through 'g' contain statements by Cornelius Galloway that are made with an intent to cause and  encourage the victims to engage in commercial sex. These statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy. h.

He is dictating the victim's access to food, showers, and generally exercising control over their actions,  schedules, and movements around town. Conversation 'i' demonstrates that Cornelius Galloway exerts control over  K.T. through narcotics as it shows Cornelius Galloway agreeing to give her ""medicine"" to keep her from getting  ""sicker."" These statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy. l. Unknown victim, 505-589-2767: 50 are around be careful Cornelius Galloway: Okay (Id, lines 143-144) The term ""50"" is believed to be a common slang term [*37]  for police, pronounced 5-O (using the letter O as  opposed to a zero). In the above message l., Cornelius Galloway is stating his acknowledgement that there are  police around, and that he will be careful. This furthers the conspiracy because it is uttered for the purpose of  evading detection by law enforcement. m. K.T. 505-570-6178: Where do I go wen im done K.T. 505-570-6178: Im gettim some calls yo K.T. 505-570-6178: To* Cornelius Galloway: Go to my brother's house K.T. 505-570-6178: Omg I only got $10 off this mfr im leavin Cornelius Galloway: You only got $10 right now you trying to play me cheap bitch K.T. 505-570-6178: No im not chip tf why would I try an play u.. that makes no sence this dude was playin so I  hopped out wit his $10 K.T. 505-570-6178: Im tryin I out here trynna do something .. its rainin an I feel terrible..

Cornelius Galloway: I am going to go get you some medicine now and sleep tonight and be ready by  tomorrow K.T. 505-570-6178: Ok (Id, lines 159-160) o. Cornelius Galloway: I'm a fuck you real bad when I catch you and tell that nigga staccs to answer the  motherfucking phone or I'm going to fuck him up to. (Id, line 161) Conversations 'm' through 'o' highlight an interaction with victim K.T., wherein Cornelius Galloway suspects she is  withholding money from him. At the same time he is dictating where she must go (SA Pharis testified that here  ""brother"" referred to Marcus Taylor) and arranging for her to get back on track by giving her a pep talk and securing  her some medication so that she can feel better and stay up, presumably to continue engaging in commercial sex  acts and making money. However, the statement in 'o' indicates that matters were not mended, and Cornelius is  threatening violence on K.T. for her non-compliance. These [*39]  statements were made in furtherance of the  conspiracy. p. T.S., 575-291-3706: Wya Cornelius Galloway: what's up Cornelius Galloway: You ready to come back yet (Id, lines 162-164) The text messages as a whole track several instances over the charging period where some victims have left and  come back. Conversation 'p' is an example of a communication Cornelius Galloway has with T.S. where he  broaches the prospect of her coming back to work. This statement is indicative of recruitment, or re-recruitment, of  T.S., and furthers the conspiracy by extending an invitation to come back. The invitation was eventually accepted  by T.S., as seen in text messages below. q. Cornelius Galloway: Tell your homeboy the one he really wanted is with me in the you can stay over  there nobody wants your nasty ass anyway but know that you can't walk around the hood. (Id, line 167) Message 'q' is an example of aggressiveness of co-conspirator Cornelius Galloway aimed at one of the victims. It's  disrespectful nature, and prohibition on free movement, is evidence of coercion and threats used in the sex  trafficking scheme. This message was made in furtherance of the conspiracy. r.

He tells them what to  do with their items, brings them personal hygiene supplies, and food. Conversation 't' also shows his decision  making in when his victims do dates and how much they should charge. Conversation 't' also indicates he is  transporting this victim as well. All of this is done in the course of the conspiracy to further the main objectives of the  conspiracy. u.

LEXIS 81858, *42 Page 20 of 31 Conversations 'u' through 'aa' demonstrate how Cornelius Galloway schedules his victims' days. He tells them  when their dates are coming, how long they will last, how much they will pay, and when they are done for the day.  His statements are the catalyst for the commercial sex acts, and are therefore made in the course and in  furtherance of the conspiracy. bb. Cornelius Galloway: You ready to stop bullshittin K.T., 505-306-4754: Yes but I don't wanna walk [*44]  the track an shit in still regular ol me I will comply but I  aint tobi Cornelius Galloway: You don't have to walk the track at all there's no money on the track K.T., 505-306-4754: Ok that's the only reason I tripped an you don't gotta be aggressive wit me it works better I  promise I don't lik how Yall didn't see me as a friend no more K.T., 505-306-4754: cause that's all it is im doin it so we can all eat Cornelius Galloway: when I come to the hood I'm going to pick you up and we're going to talk about it  okay (Id, lines 275-280) Conversation 'bb' shows the re-recruitment of victim K.T., in light of their previous communications (see  conversations 'm', 'n'., and 'o' above). Co-conspirator Cornelius Galloway's question of whether she is ""ready to  stop bullshittin"" is a reference to her previous non-compliance. He then proceeds to sweeten the proposition by  telling her she does not have to walk the track this time. Upon hearing K.T. still has concerns about his  aggressiveness, he states he wants to have a discussion about that aspect of their arrangement. Galloway's  statements are made to cause K.T. to re-initiate her prostitution work, and thus further the conspiracy. cc.

LEXIS 81858, *47 Page 23 of 31 (Id, lines 352-355) ss. T.S., 575-291-3706: we're u at Cornelius Galloway: Home Cornelius Galloway: Did you get any money tonight (Id, lines 356-358) Conversations 'ff' through 'ss' involve relationships between Cornelius Galloway and T.S., and Cornelius Galloway  and K.T. The texts show both women being apologetic about falling out of line. Cornelius Galloway's statements to  them vary between trying to be somewhat comforting to giving them direct and aggressive orders. Cornelius's  statements ultimately cause both women to return and resume commercial sex acts on behalf of the Galloway  Organization, thus furthering the conspiracy. The conversations also show the deterioration of the working  ""relationship"" with T.S.—she leaves again after an apparent falling out, and when she asks to come back, Galloway  tells her she can only come back if she brings another girl (line 355). The statement furthers the conspiracy  because it is made to bring one girl back while obtaining an additional girl to sell. tt. Cornelius Galloway: Play game if you want to All [*50]  I'm gonna do is go over to your dad's house  and show him your Backpage (Id, line 359) The statement in 'tt' is uttered as a direct and unequivocal threat. The above statement is logically construed to  state that if the victim continues to ""play game,"" Cornelius is going to show her dad her Backpage advertisements.  This is a coercive statement uttered for the purpose of controlling the victim's behavior through threatened  consequences. For that reason, it furthers the conspiracy. uu.

Cornelius Galloway: To me. (Id, lines 418-421) Conversations yy. through ccc. involve Juvenile J and Renee 2. Cornelius's statements contain the same themes  as discussed before, namely control and maintenance of victims. The statements further the conspiracy because  Cornelius arranges and inquires about ""dates."" He orders Juvenile J around and offers to help Renee 2 continuing  ""working"" on a difficult day. ddd. Cornelius Galloway: Okay be right there she will Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: I'm scared to go back Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: Come in 10 Cornelius Galloway: Why are you scared to come back Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: I don't wanna get beat Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: ;o Cornelius Galloway: Have I ever beat you Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: Come now to the MC dondls Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: On Paseo n San pedro Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: Hurry Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: No u haven't Cornelius Galloway: She's on her way now Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: K to the McDonalds Cornelius Galloway: Okay I'm fixing to text her now [*54]  and tell her that you at the McDonald's Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: Yeah Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: What car she in?

It also shows an acceptance of the idea that Juvenile J would obtain a john  for T.S. Indeed, he gives out T.S.'s Backpage name for this purpose. These statements were made in furtherance  of the conspiracy. eee.

LEXIS 81858, *54 Page 27 of 31 Text conversations 'fff', 'ggg', and 'hhh' occurred on November 24, 2016, which was Thanksgiving Day, while  conversation 'iii' occurred shortly after midnight the next morning. It appears from the context that Cornelius  Galloway allowed Juvenile J to spend time with her family on Thanksgiving, which is the day after Juvenile J alerted  Cornelius Galloway as to the whereabouts of M.V. after M.V. ran away. Read in context, Galloway's concession  appears to ""reward"" Juvenile J's loyalty. However, when Juvenile J does not ""keep locking in"" with Cornelius, it  becomes a problem for him, and he scolds her and orders her to come back to continue engaging in commercial  sex work. Under the circumstances, these statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy. jjj.

This  particular arrangement was short lived, but ends with aggressive statements towards ""Chocolate"" when she blocks  his number. Conversation 'jjj' demonstrates maintenance of this woman. Conversations 'kkk' and 'lll' are punishment  for her non-compliance. Therefore, these statements were made in the course of and in furtherance of the  conspiracy. mmm.

Cornelius's statements first serve cause her  to come back and work (mmm), and devolve in Cornelius wanting her to know that he is going to come to her and  physically batter her. These statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy. ooo. Juvenile J, 505-203-4528: I'm kinda scared to go Cornelius Galloway: Trust me you have nothing to be afraid of Cornelius Galloway: I just don't want to see you doing that bad you know we do care for you Juvenile J, 505-203-4528: [*59]  Yeah but I've made you loose out on quite a bit of money and last time Jamilla  did that to me because of that reason Cornelius Galloway: Jamilah do what I tell her to do and trust me that's far from her mind Cornelius Galloway: You didn't make us lose out on a lot of money I was doing things the wrong way  buy how I used to get mad and treat you Juvenile J, 505-203-4528: Okay, am I going to be coming back home tonight? Cornelius Galloway: Ok Juvenile J, 505-203-4528: Whaat? Juvenile J, 505-203-4528: Whaat? Cornelius Galloway: You said you was going back home and I said okay (Id, lines 511-5521) In this communication 'ooo', Cornelius Galloway is recruiting Juvenile J to start working for him again. His  statements are made to put her at ease about coming back to the Galloway Organization after an apparent falling  out, and Cornelius is telling her it will not be the way it was before. The communication ends with Cornelius telling  her it is ok to come back home, i.e., back to the Galloway Organization. These statements were made in  furtherance of the conspiracy. ppp. Cornelius Galloway: What's up Juvenile J, 505-203-4528: If your around do you think you can bring me a couple cigs please?

LEXIS 81858, *58 Page 29 of 31 Cornelius Galloway: Dial my brother (Id, lines 528-530) The last three conversations indicate that Juvenile J is working for the Galloway Organization once again. Cornelius  Galloway gives her instructions to get ready and come out. And, as was the common theme, Juvenile J would  request narcotics in the course of her work, and Cornelius granted her requests. These statements were made in  the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. 15. Text messages between Cornelius ""Chip"" Galloway and the other named co-conspirators. There are text messages between Cornelius Galloway and Danielle Galloway (color keyed in orange), Marcus  Taylor (gold/yellow), and Matthew Woods (yellow). Text messages by Matthew Woods are admissible as  statements by a party opponent under Fed. R. Evid 801(d)(2)(A) if presented by the Government. Danielle Galloway  is saved in Cornelius Galloway's phone as [*61]  ""*Wife."" Marcus Taylor is saved as ""bro Lil."" Matthew Woods'  name is not saved, but Matthew Woods identifies himself as ""Staxx"" when communicating with Cornelius Galloway. a. Danielle Galloway, 505-388-3131: Had to change hotels they closed the office at 7 so has to make a  new reservation at a different hotel."" (Exhibit 1A, line 417). At the time of this message, the Galloways were conducting business out of hotel rooms. This statement by  Danielle Galloway was made in furtherance the conspiracy because it informs another co-conspirator of where they  will be continuing their commercial sex activities. b. Danielle Galloway, 505-388-3131: Renee watz the clear. (Id, line 453). This conversation shows that Renee, one of the uncharged trafficking victims, would like some methamphetamine.  Danielle's message is found in the middle of communications to and from Renee about Renee performing  commercial sex acts, therefore Renee's order for methamphetamine is made while she is being engaged in  prostitution at the Galloways behest. Danielle forwarding the order for drugs means that her text message was  made in furtherance of the conspiracy because it helped provide narcotics to a victim to facilitate [*62]  her  performing commercial sex acts. c. Danielle Galloway, 505-388-3131: she didn't answer babe I called you like 4 times I would have me to  do."" (Id. Line 462). This message was sent during the time frame Juvenile J was communicating with Cornelius Galloway regarding  completing commercial sex acts. Danielle's text message was made in furtherance of the conspiracy as it seeks  advice from Cornelius on what to do about not being able to get in touch with one of the girls. d. Cornelius Galloway: where are you at. Matthew Woods, 505-445-1716: 215 Cornelius Galloway: come out to the street right now. (Id, lines 375-377) e. Matt Woods, 317-998-0163: You want some zanies Cornelius Galloway: Ya Matthew Woods, 317-998-0163: Where you at Cornelius: I'm at home  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *60 Page 30 of 31 Matt Woods, 317-998-0163: How much for the ruger Cornelius Galloway: 300 Matt Woods, 317-998-0163: I'm coo Matt Woods, 317-998-0163: Really 300 I didn't do you that bad when I sale you anything lol smh (Id, lines 483-490) Matt Woods, 317-998-0163: I was trying to give you the thang for 175 bro (Id, line 491) While Mr. Woods' statements are statements by a party opponent, Cornelius Galloway's side of conversation 'd'  furthers the conspiracy by arranging a [*63]  face to face meeting with Mr. Woods after determining his  whereabouts. Exhibit 1A shows that this exchange occurred on November 10, 2016 and Booking.com records show  that Danielle Galloway had booked a room for that date at the Howard Johnson at 900 Medical Arts in Albuquerque,  New Mexico. Cornelius Galloway's statements to Mr. Woods here are alternatively admissible because they are not  assertions under Fed. R. Evid. 801. Mr. Galloway asks a question and then follows up with an order. Therefore,  they are non-hearsay and are admissible. As for conversation 'e', SA Pharis testified that ""zanies"" are a slang term for Xanex, which was the drug that the  Galloway Organization provided to Juvenile M. SA Pharis further testified that the terms ""ruger"" and ""thang"" both  refer to a firearm. The Government will present further evidence at trial that both Cornelius Galloway and Matthew  Woods possessed firearms in the course of their sex trafficking activities and used them as tools of force and  coercion. Communications between the two of them referencing selling each other firearms are therefore made in  the course and furtherance of the conspiracy. While Matthew Woods' statement in line 491 is sent some time after  the texts immediately [*64]  above it, it is admissible as a statement by party opponent, and offers context to the  conversation above in in lines 487-490. f. Marcus Taylor: 505-448-9104: ""Can't talk now. What's up?"" Cornelius Galloway: Bro the police is around  the corner on foot. (Id, lines 165-166) Galloway's statement about the police being around the corner is in furtherance of the conspiracy because it is  uttered to prevent a co-conspirator's detection by police, therefore furthering the objectives of the conspiracy. g. Marcus Taylor, 505-448-9105: Soo we stil in the lobby. (Id, line 337) This text message was sent after at least three instances of Cornelius Galloway ordering the women to come down  from their hotel rooms (Id. Lines 333-336). Marcus Taylor is a co-conspirator and this message furthers the  conspiracy by informing Cornelius where ""we"" are. Because each of the statements contained in subsection 15 were made by co-conspirators and were made in the  course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy, they are admissible in trial against Matthew Woods as co- conspirator statements under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 16. Text messages between Cornelius Galloway and unnamed individual at 505-550-5491. a. Unnamed individual, 505-550-5491: Don't [*65]  worry my nigga you will have yo gun and a new one by  tonight don't sweat it Cornelius Galloway: ok (Exhibit 1A, lines 542 to 543) 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *62 Page 31 of 31 Cornelius Galloway's response of ""ok"" to the statement above is an adoption of that statement. The Government's  evidence shows that use or brandishing of firearms was part and parcel of the Galloway Organization's sex  trafficking conspiracy. Here, Cornelius Galloway's statement, which exhibits an intent to obtain firearms, was made  in furtherance of the conspiracy because firearms play a part in the force and coercion of the victims in this case.  The statement by the unnamed party is admissible because it provides the only context for Cornelius Galloway's  statement. Furthermore, the unnamed party's statements are not being offered to prove that in fact Mr. Galloway  would be receiving his gun and a new one by that particular night, but to prove that Mr. Galloway had access to  firearms during that period. C. The Court concludes the statements contained in Part B, in subsections 1 through 16, which are typewritten in  bold and underlined font, are not hearsay, and are admissible against Mr. Woods as co-conspirator statements  under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). All other statements are admissible [*66]  for context, are not being offered for the  truth of the matter asserted, or are not assertive statements that would fall under the rule against hearsay. D. The Court concludes the statements contained in Part B, in subsections 1 through 16, are not testimonial  because they were not made with an expectation to be used in a criminal prosecution. They were uttered in the  course of a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking. Therefore, they are not barred by Crawford v. Washington, 541  U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004). E. The Court's rulings on Defendant's objections to the admission of statements contained in Part B and the  evidence underlying the preliminary determination of Matthew Woods' membership in the conspiracy have been  incorporated into these Findings and Conclusions. IT IS SO ORDERED. /s/ William P. Johnson WILLIAM P. JOHNSON CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *65",1
"Phillips v. Cap. Internal Med. Assocs., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217760","[*1] OPINION This is an action bringing federal and state claims  against a doctor and his employer under Title VII of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, and the  Michigan state equivalent. Plaintiffs, a nurse practitioner  and a doctor, both of whom worked with or for  Defendants, bring suit on counts of assault, battery,  hostile work environment, and intentional infliction of  emotional distress. Before the Court is a motion to set  aside the default (ECF No. 16) entered against the  individual defendant, Joseph Kozlowski. For the reasons  stated below, the Court will grant the motion. I. BACKGROUND Plaintiffs Alexis Phillips and Sarah Denham worked at  Capital Internal Medicine Associates (""CIMA"") between October 2018 and  October 2022. (Compl. ¶¶ 14, 222.) Denham is still  employed as a primary care physician at CIMA, while  Phillips, a nurse practitioner, has since left the practice.  Their allegations stem from their interactions with  another doctor at CIMA, Joseph Kozlowski. Over the  course of four years, Phillips, especially, claims she was  subject to verbal and sometimes physical harassment at  Kozlowski's hands, beginning when she was a student at CIMA under his supervision. Denham, too,  claims  Kozlowski  made  inappropriate  comments  towards her; [*2]  however, her primary allegations  revolve around her efforts to push CIMA leadership to  discipline Dr. Kozlowski. Despite relaying detailed  descriptions of harassment and inappropriate behavior  directed at her and others, Denham says she was  consistently rebuffed or ignored. On April 27, 2023, Phillips and Denham filed a  complaint against CIMA and Kozlowski bringing claims  under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the  Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act (""ELCRA"") - the Michigan  analogue to Title VII. The complaint details six counts  against Dr. Kozlowski: 1) sex discrimination in violation  of Title VII, 2) sex discrimination in violation of the  ELCRA, 3) hostile work environment under Title VII, 4)  hostile work environment under the ELCRA, 5) assault  and battery, and 6) intentional infliction of emotional  distress. (Compl. ¶¶ 225-274.) CIMA filed a timely answer to the complaint (ECF No.  7). Dr. Kozlowski, on the other hand, did not. He was  served by Plaintiffs on June 9, 2023; however, the  summons was botched. Although the caption listed him  as a defendant in the action, it was addressed to CIMA  alone. (Summons, ECF No. 16-3, PageID.181.) Below  the caption, in the section marked ""Proof of Service,""  CIMA was again listed [*3]  as the recipient for the  summons. Likely recognizing the mistake, the process  server - or someone else - crossed out ""Capital Internal  Medicine Associates P.C."" and scrawled ""Joseph  Kozlowski"" above it in pen. Id. Despite the sloppy nature  of the document, court rules dictated that Kozlowski had  Page 2 of 4 until June 30 - twenty-one days from service - to  respond. (Summons.) When no answer came by the  30th, Plaintiffs moved for an entry of default as to  Kozlowski on July 3, 2023. (Appl. for Entry of Default,  ECF No. 12.) The clerk entered the 2 default that same day. (Default, ECF No. 14.) On July  20, 2023, Kozlowski filed a motion to set aside the  default. II. LEGAL STANDARD Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires  that a plaintiff serve a defendant with a summons and a  copy of the complaint. ""Service requirements are more  than mere technicalities, they also implicate due  process."" Savoie v. City of East Lansing, No. 21-2684,  2022 WL 3643339, at *2 (6th Cir. Aug. 24, 2022) (citing  Friedman v. Est. of Presser, 929 F.2d 1151, 1156 (6th  Cir. 1991)). Therefore, courts hold plaintiffs to a high  standard for service of process, requiring ""more than  just actual knowledge of the action by a defendant."" Id.  Without proper service, a court may not exercise  personal jurisdiction over a defendant, and any ruling  made by the court as to that party is void. See Omni  Capital Int'l v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., Ltd., 484 U.S. 97, 104  (1987). When a summons and complaint are [*4]  properly  served on a party, that party must answer or respond  within the time provided by Rule 12 of the Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(1). If the  defendant fails to respond, then the plaintiff may submit  an application for entry of a default with the clerk of  court. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a). A party against whom a  default is entered may move to have the default set  aside under Rule 55(c). The Court ""may set aside an  entry of default for good cause."" Fed R. Civ. P. 55(c). III. ANALYSIS Kozlowski argues that the default entered against him  should be set aside on two bases. First, that the Court  never obtained personal jurisdiction over him because  Plaintiff's service of process was fatally defective under  Rule 4, and any ruling made by the Court against him is  therefore void. Second, that there is good cause for the  Court to set aside the entry of default 3 against him under Rule 55(c). It is not necessary to  address Kozlowski's ""good cause"" argument because  the Court concludes that it lacks personal jurisdiction  over him. A. Plaintiffs' Service of Process was Insufficient and  the Court Lacks Personal Jurisdiction Courts may only exercise personal jurisdiction over a  defendant who has been properly served. See Omni  Capital, 484 U.S. at 104. Rule 4(a)(1) lays out the  necessary contents of a proper summons. One  requirement is it must ""be [*5]  directed to the  defendant."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(a)(1)(B). Kozlowski argues that because his  summons was directed to CIMA in the caption, and only  indirectly named him elsewhere in the document, the  service was constitutionally deficient. Courts are divided on how strictly to hold plaintiffs to the  requirements of Rule 4(a). Compare Birch v. Sprint/Nextel Corp., No. 15-cv-01901,  2016 WL 8652260, at *3 (D. Colo. May 17, 2016)  (holding that naming the wrong defendant in a summons  did not invalidate service of process when the defendant  had actual notice of the suit against him) with Hampton  v. McMillin, No. 3:09-cv-406, 2010 WL 3167885, at *1  (S.D. Miss. July 6, 2010) (holding that process was  insufficient when plaintiff named the wrong party) and  Gartin v. Par Pharm. Cos., Inc., 289 F.App'x 688, 691  n.3 (5th Cir. 2008) (indicating that the sufficiency of  service of process may be challenged where a plaintiff  fails to name the party being served). The Sixth Circuit has never directly addressed this  issue; however, as previously discussed, it has ruled  that compliance with the requirements of Rule 4 is no  mere technicality. In Friedman, the court considered  whether an action should have been dismissed for lack  of personal jurisdiction where the defendant never  returned  an  acknowledgment  of  service  despite  agreement between the parties that the defendants  were aware of the suit and did not suffer prejudice as a  result of the defective process. Friedman, 929 F.2d at  1155. In holding that the district court erred [*6]  by  failing 4 to dismiss the action, the court reasoned that, ""[d]ue to  the integral relationship between service of process and  due process requirements . . . actual knowledge of an  action"" is no cure for ""a technically defective service of  process."" Id. at 1156. The Court in Friedman did not  Page 3 of 4 consider how this principle applied to Rule 4 (a)(1), but  its reasoning aligns with holdings in other circuits in  which the failure to follow each of the requirements of  Rule 4(a)(1)(A)-(G) ""is fatal to the plaintiff's case."" See  Ayres v. Jacobs & Crumplar, P.A., 99 F.2d 565, 569 (3d  Cir. 1996) (dismissing a case when the summons was  not signed and sealed by the clerk as required by Rule  4(a)(1)(F) and (G)). Courts in this Circuit have interpreted Friedman to  impose a strict reading of Rule 4 (a)(1) on plaintiffs. For  example, in In re Bavelis, 453 B.R. 832 (Bankr. S.D.  Ohio 2011), a bankruptcy court in Ohio considered  whether it was appropriate to exercise personal  jurisdiction over defendants who had not been named in  the plaintiff's summons. Relying on Friedman, it  concluded that Sixth Circuit precedent supported the  notion that ""a defendant who is not named in [a] summons has not effectively been served and  service of process on that defendant, as well as the  process itself, is therefore insufficient."" Id. at 862. The  court in Bavelis ultimately held that it lacked personal  jurisdiction over the unnamed defendants [*7]  and  instructed the plaintiff to correct their pleadings and re- serve the defendants. Id. at 865. Here, as in Bavelis, whether or not Defendant Kozlowski  had actual notice of the lawsuit, the summons was  defective. Rule 4(a)(1)(B) requires that a summons be  ""directed to the defendant."" Although Kozlowski is  named as a defendant in the caption of the summons,  the ""TO"" section of the caption only names CIMA. Id.  Kozlowski is further named underneath the caption in  pen over the crossed-out name of his co-defendant.  (Summons,  PageID.181.)  However,  that  section  concerns the process server, not the party to be served,  and it does not clearly state that 5 the summons is ""directed to"" Kozlowski. Although  Kozlowski might have been able to glean who the  defendants were supposed to be from the contents of  the complaint and the context of the summons, Rule  4(a)(1)(B) requires more explicit language. Plaintiffs contend that this case is distinguishable from  Bavelis. They point to Conner-Cooley v. AIG Life  Brokerage, 282 F.R.D. 431 (E.D. Wis. 2012), as a more  appropriatecomparison. In Conner-Cooley, the court  entered a default and default judgment against a  defendant who never responded to the plaintiff's  complaint  which  clearly  identified  the  intended  defendant. In seeking to have the defaults set aside, the  defendant-corporation [*8]  argued that service was  defective because the plaintiff had named ""AIG Life  Brokerage"" in the summons rather than the more  appropriate ""American General Life Companies LLC.""  Id. at 435. The court held for the plaintiffs on the basis  that ""service is proper despite a misnomer"" if the  complaint is ""not susceptible to any reasonable doubt or  confusion about who it was the plaintiff intended to sue."" Id. (citing Tremps v. Ascot Oils, Inc., 561 F.2d 41, 44  (7th Cir. 1977)). Plaintiff's reliance on Conner-Cooley is unavailing. As  indicated above, different circuits treat Rule 4 differently.  Some allow plaintiffs more leeway. See, e.g., United  Food & CommercialWorkers Union, Locals 197, et al. v.  Alpha Beta Co., 736 F.2d 1371, 1382 (9th Cir. 1984)  (""Rule 4 is a flexible rule which is liberally construed to uphold  service as long as defendant receives sufficient notice  of the complaint."") The Seventh is one such circuit. In  Conner-Cooley, the Wisconsin district court followed  Seventh  Circuit  precedent  that  emphasizes  the  importance of actual knowledge of a suit over technical  compliance with Rule 4. See Tremps, 561 F.2d at 44 (""A  defendant who is clearly identified by a summons and  complaint and who has been served with those  documents may not avoid the jurisdiction of the district  court merely because he is incorrectly named in them."").  The holding in Conner-Cooley was based, in large part,  on the 6 premise that the misnaming in that case [*9]  did not  create ""any reasonable doubt or confusion"" about who  the plaintiff intended to sue. Conner-Cooley, 282 F.R.D.  at 435. In contrast, the holding in Friedman suggests that such considerations are not  relevant, and the vast majority of courts in this Circuit  downplay the importance of actual knowledge and  instead emphasize the significance of process. See,  e.g., Bavelis, 453 B.R. at 63; PNC Mortg. v. Rhiel, Nos.  2:10-cv-578, 2:10-cv-579, 2011 WL 1043949, at *5  (S.D. Ohio Mar. 18, 2011); Ohio ex rel. Dewine v.  Superior Fibers, Inc., No. 2:14-cv-1843, 2017 WL  6055159, at *4-5 (S.D. Ohio Dec. 7, 2017); Arthur v.  Litton LoanServicing LP, 249 F. Supp. 2d 924, 927 (E.D.  Tenn. 2002); Engler v. Arnold, No. 4:14-cv-2442, 2015  Page 4 of 4 WL 4213642, at *2 (N.D. Ohio July 10, 2015). Even if the Sixth Circuit followed the body of law that  emphasized actual knowledge, the result may well be  the same. Unlike the defendant in Conner-Cooley,  Kozlowski proffered evidence that he was unsure of the  intended defendant to this suit. See Conner-Cooley, 282  F.R.D. at 435 (""[Defendant] does not, for example  submit an affidavit from [its lawyer] stating that when it  received the summons and complaint it could not  determine which, if any, of its clients plaintiffs intended  to sue.""). Kozlowski submitted such an affidavit stating  that ""my delay in answering the Complaint was . . .  partially due to the confusion over the summons.""  (Kozlowski Aff. ¶ 4, ECF No. 16-2.) Therefore, it would be reasonable to  conclude that the technically defective summons had a  real-world impact on Kozlowski's actual knowledge of  Plaintiffs intent to bring suit against him. Thus, this  summons provided insufficient [*10]  process even  under a laxer standard than Sixth Circuit precedent  demands.",0
"United States v. Bixler, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646","BERNICE BOUIE DONALD, Circuit Judge. Following a seven-day trial, a jury found Defendant Appellant Prince  Bixler guilty of sex trafficking, drug trafficking, witness tampering, and possessing firearms as a felon. On appeal,  2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *1 Page 9 of 18 Bixler raises a plethora of challenges to his sex trafficking and witness tampering convictions, sentencing  enhancements, and order of restitution. For the following reasons, we affirm. I. From 2013 to 2018, Bixler operated a prostitution ring in Lexington, Kentucky. Bixler found and recruited destitute  women with pre-existing drug addictions to prostitute themselves for his financial benefit. He lured them in with  promises of free shelter, [*2]  food, and drugs, and once they became entirely dependent on him, Bixler demanded  they work as prostitutes to pay off their ""accumulated debts."" Bixler manipulated their drug addictions, controlled  their drug supply, and used intimidation and violence to ensure that the women complied. Following a lengthy investigation, Bixler was arrested on March 28, 2018. The government subpoenaed several  women, including Adrienne Ratliff and Amie Payton, to appear before a grand jury. Bixler's history with Ratliff and  Payton was representative of how he treated his other victims: he initially provided them with ""free"" shelter and  drugs, but quickly turned violent and abusive. Bixler incessantly called Ratliff and Payton in the days leading up to  their testimony. He guilted Ratliff for betraying him and hurting him, stating ""Oh, but you told them you'd testify  against me[.] . . . Do you know how bad that fucking hurt me?""; ""You know, I have kids too.""; and ""[Y]ou don't even  have a conscience, do you? . . . [I]t's just so fucked up that you don't even have a conscience man. . . . Because I  keep sitting here thinking about, you know, God damn, does she even have a conscience about the shit that  she [*3]  just done."" Ratliff repeatedly lied to Bixler and said she would not testify for fear that he would ""yell at [her]  and just go off until he got what he wanted out of [her]."" Despite Bixler's pleas, Ratliff testified against him before  the grand jury. In addition, Bixler instructed Payton not to talk to a court-appointed attorney and ""just tell the truth."" Bixler also  called Payton over thirty times the day before her scheduled grand jury appearance. The next morning, Payton  injected heroin before arriving at the courthouse and refused to testify. Payton stated, ""I was afraid to [talk]"" and ""I  didn't want Prince to be mad at me either."" She also stated that she would rather go to jail for six months than testify  against Bixler. The court subsequently appointed her counsel, and she returned the following month to testify  against Bixler before the grand jury. On September 19, 2019, the grand jury charged Bixler with four counts of sex trafficking, two counts of witness  tampering, one count of using facilities in interstate commerce to manage the trafficking scheme, six counts of drug  distribution, and three related firearms offenses. The matter proceeded to a jury trial in September 2020. [*4]  At  trial, the government presented testimony from three sex trafficking victims. The first victim to testify, Kaitlyn Moore, recalled meeting Bixler while homeless and unemployed. Moore had been  living with her boyfriend until he overdosed and went to jail. She then moved into a rehabilitation facility but  subsequently relapsed and absconded from the facility. Moore eventually found herself homeless, without any  personal belongings, and shoplifting to afford her drug habit. Shortly thereafter, Moore met Bixler at a hotel and received free heroin from him. That same night, Bixler suggested  Moore could make money through Backpage.com—a website commonly used for prostitution. Bixler told her how to  set up an account, paid for the user fees, and helped her solicit clients. Bixler also purchased a hotel room for her  dates. Moore testified that, in the beginning, she made ""easily a thousand dollars"" a day and continued receiving  free heroin from Bixler. Eventually, however, Bixler told Moore that she owed a significant debt for her living expenses, the hotel, and the  drugs. Moore testified that she felt obligated to repay the debt by prostituting herself. She stated, ""Over time, I  started to [*5]  feel like it really wasn't, like, so much a choice as where kind of I had to do it for fear. But I didn't     2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *1 Page 10 of 18 want to struggle, and I didn't want to have nothing, and it was no longer an option at one point in time. Like, I  didn't—I had to do it."" She also stated that ""once [she] started to do more dope, [she] would need more dope to not  be sick, and that cost money too."" Moore further testified that Bixler regularly carried guns and was prone to  violence. According to Moore, she once ""got smacked"" for letting one of the other women into her hotel room.  Moore testified that she feared Bixler and felt like she could not leave. The second victim to testify, Savannah Godown, recalled having a romantic relationship with Bixler. For the first few  months, Bixler was ""great"" to Godown. He supplied her with free crack cocaine daily and provided her with several  free apartments. Eventually, however, Bixler turned violent. Godown testified that Bixler hit her ""weekly,"" and that  he once ""beat [her] with an air mattress pump,"" and kicked a door in and chipped her tooth. Shortly thereafter, Bixler moved Godown into a hotel room and she became involved with Backpage.com. Bixler  imposed a strict set of [*6]  rules for Godown; he controlled the information she posted in her ads, the nature of her  clientele, and when she could leave the hotel rooms. If Godown disobeyed the rules, Bixler would ""beat [her] up for  it."" Bixler also deputized Godown to help run the operation. Bixler would instruct Godown to ""work the phone,"" pay  for the other women's hotel rooms, and collect their profits to give to Bixler. If Godown did not comply, Bixler would  again ""put his hands on [her]."" After approximately four years, Godown grew ""tired of being beat on"" and left. The third victim to testify, Savannah Evans, told a similar story to Moore. Like Moore, Evans met Bixler while  homeless and addicted to heroin. Evans testified that Bixler moved her into his house and began fronting her  heroin. Eventually, she began prostituting herself through Backpage.com to repay her debt. Bixler and his girlfriend,  Crystal Rowe, controlled Evans' account; they took photographs of her, posted ads for her services, and paid for  the advertisement fees. Bixler even drove Evans to outcalls, or calls at the client's location instead of at the hotel.  After she finished a date, Evans gave all the money she earned to Bixler, who provided [*7]  her with food, shelter,  and drugs. Evans stayed at Bixler's house full time, leaving only for calls. Evans testified that she feared Bixler and felt like she  could not leave. Bixler controlled not only her Backpage.com account, but also her heroin supply. He initially  provided her heroin on a daily basis, but Evans eventually had to beg Bixler for heroin. Evans testified that the  erratic intake caused withdrawal symptoms. According to Evans, heroin withdraw is ""like the flu. . . . Diarrhea, and  your body hurts, it aches. You feel really anxious and scared and worried about where you're going to get more  from."" Evans stated that those symptoms would subside immediately after using heroin. Evans also testified that  Bixler hit her on three separate occasions when she tried to leave, and that she saw Bixler hit at least four other  women as well. After hearing this and other evidence, the jury found Bixler guilty of sex trafficking, drug trafficking, witness  tampering, and the related offenses. The district court subsequently sentenced him to 432 months' imprisonment  and ordered him to pay $333,270 in restitution to Moore, Godown, and Evans. This appeal followed. II. Bixler first challenges [*8]  the district court's grant of the government's pre-trial motion to preclude evidence of his  alleged victims engaging in prostitution both before and after their involvement with him. HN1[ ] In ""criminal proceeding[s] involving alleged sexual misconduct,"" Federal Rule of Evidence 412 bars any  evidence ""offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual behavior."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(a)(1). However, ""not  all evidence implicating a victim's past sexual activity falls within Rule 412(a)."" United States v. Kettles, 970 F.3d  637, 642 (6th Cir. 2020). Rule 412 does not prohibit ""evidence whose exclusion would violate the defendant's  constitutional rights."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C). Bixler seizes upon this exception and argues that prohibiting  evidence of his alleged victims' past sexual behavior violated his Sixth and Fifth Amendment rights. First, Bixler contends that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment confrontation rights by curtailing relevant  cross-examination testimony from which the jury could have assessed the women's biases or motives to testify.  2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *5 Page 11 of 18 Bixler asserts that the women may have testified against Bixler in exchange for not being prosecuted for prior acts  of prostitution. This argument lacks merit. HN2[ ] The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right ""to be confronted with the witnesses  against him."" U.S. Const. amend. VI; Boggs v. Collins, 226 F.3d 728, 736 (6th Cir. 2000). ""The main and essential  purpose of confrontation is to secure [*9]  for the opponent the opportunity of cross-examination."" Davis v. Alaska,  415 U.S. 308, 315-16, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974). However, the Confrontation Clause requires only  ""an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to  whatever extent, the defense might wish."" Boggs, 226 F.3d at 736. Thus, trial judges retain broad discretion to  impose reasonable limits on cross-examination. Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89 L.  Ed. 2d 674 (1986). When a trial court limits cross-examination pertaining to a witness's motive, bias, or prejudice,  we must decide ""whether the jury was otherwise in possession of sufficient information concerning formative events  to make a discriminating appraisal of a witness' motives and bias."" United States v. Fields, 763 F.3d 443, 464 (6th  Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). The district court here permitted Bixler to elicit evidence of the women's criminal histories and their involvement with  the underlying investigation. For example, Moore testified that she twice avoided arrest on outstanding warrants— once at the time of Bixler's arrest and once a year later with the help of the same investigating detective. Godown  similarly testified that the government reduced a felony robbery charge to a misdemeanor shoplifting charge after  she spoke with the investigating detective on the underlying case. In addition, all of the women [*10]  admitted to  purchasing, possessing, and using illicit drugs. Therefore, the jury possessed sufficient information concerning the  women's motives to testify, which arose from the prospect of potential punishment and not from the nature of their  conduct. Bixler next argues that the district court violated his Fifth Amendment due process rights by precluding evidence  that bore directly on the essential element of force or coercion. Bixler asserts that evidence of prior prostitution  suggested the women participated in commercial sex acts on their own volition, and not at his behest. This  argument is likewise unavailing. HN3[ ] Although ""the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a complete  defense . . . [it] does not require the admission of irrelevant evidence (or other types of evidence whose relevance is  outweighed by other important considerations)."" United States v. Beavers, 756 F.3d 1044, 1052 (7th Cir. 2014)  (internal citations omitted). We agree with the great weight of authority from our sister circuits that prior acts of  prostitution are irrelevant to sex trafficking charges under § 1591(a). See, e.g., United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d  584, 595-96 (7th Cir. 2017); United States v. Gemma, 818 F.3d 23, 34 (1st Cir. 2016); United States v. Lockhart,  844 F.3d 501, 510 (5th Cir. 2016); United States v. Roy, 781 F.3d 416, 420 (8th Cir. 2015); United States v. Rivera,  799 F.3d 180, 186 (2d Cir. 2015); United States v. Valenzuela, 495 F. App'x 817, 819-20 (9th Cir. 2012). HN4[ ] Prior acts of prostitution lead only to improper character inferences and are not relevant to proving sex  trafficking [*11]  charges under 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a). This evidence had no bearing on whether Bixler forced or  coerced them into prostitution on the particular occasions alleged in the indictment. Bixler argues that evidence of  prior prostitution would demonstrate the women's propensity to engage in prostitution, which, in turn, would negate  their testimony that Bixler forced them into a life of prostitution. However, this is exactly the type of evidence  proscribed by Federal Rules of Evidence 412 and 404(b). See United States v. Givhan, 740 F. App'x 458, 464 (6th  Cir. 2018) (citing United States v. Mack, 808 F.3d 1074, 1084 (6th Cir. 2015)) (holding that evidence of prior  prostitution is not admissible to prove consensual prostitution on a different occasion). Furthermore, Bixler cannot show prejudicial error because the parties did, in fact, elicit evidence of prior acts of  prostitution, notwithstanding the district court's order. Bixler testified that he met Moore through Backpage.com,  where he responded to her advertisement for sex. Godown likewise testified that she worked on Backpage.com  before meeting Bixler. In addition, Evans testified that she occasionally posted advertisements for sex independent  of Bixler. 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *8 Page 12 of 18 Accordingly, Bixler cannot demonstrate that the district court committed any error, let alone prejudicial error, in  granting the government's motion in limine. [*12]  III. Second, Bixler challenges the district court's denial of his pre-trial motion to preclude the testimony of addiction  specialist Dr. Kelly Clark. HN5[ ] Federal Rule of Evidence 702 requires expert testimony to be both reliable and helpful for ""the trier of fact  to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue."" Fed. R. Evid. 702(a)-(d). Bixler challenges both  requirements. He argues that Clark could not provide reliable testimony because she never examined the victims in  this case. He also argues that Clark did not testify on matters ""beyond the ken of the average juror,"" and thus  ""invaded the province of the jury"" in determining the ultimate issue at trial—whether Bixler coerced the victims to  engage in commercial sex acts. Appellant Br. 21-22. HN6[ ] We review the district court's admission of expert  testimony for an abuse of discretion. United States v. Amawi, 695 F.3d 457, 478 (6th Cir. 2012). At trial, Clark testified about the physical and psychological impacts of drug dependency, addiction, and withdrawal.  Clark differentiated between physical dependency as the body's adjustment to the presence of drugs, and drug  addiction as a ""chronic brain disease"" that affects the user's impulse control and judgment. Trial R. 216, Page ID#:  2940, 2943. She explained that withdrawal results from the [*13]  body's readjustment to the absence of drugs. She  described withdrawal as ""very, very painful,"" and listed common symptoms as nausea, diarrhea, sweating, shaking,  and drooling. Id. at Page ID#: 2943. She stated that ""people can't function when their bodies"" go through  withdrawal. Id. Clark noted that anyone can become dependent on drugs and experience withdrawal, but only those  addicted to drugs lose control when the drugs are withheld. According to Clark, those struggling with addiction  initially reuse drugs to ""chas[e] feeling good,"" but, as the addiction cycle continues, they reuse drugs to escape the  sickness that comes from withdrawal. Id. at Page ID#: 2950. This kind of testimony does not require review of case-specific facts. See Fed. R. Evid. 702 advisory committee's  note (""[I]t might . . . be important in some cases for an expert to educate the factfinder about general principles,  without ever attempting to apply these principles to the specific facts of the case.""). Instead, Clark's testimony  helped the jury contextualize the women's vulnerabilities and understand the power Bixler held over them—subjects  that likely are beyond an ordinary juror's knowledge or experience. See Patrick Eoghan [*14]  Murray, In Need of a  Fix: Reforming Criminal Law in Light of a Contemporary Understanding of Drug Addiction, 60 UCLA L. Rev. 1006,  1025 (2013) (""For a judge or jury to get inside the mind of a drug addict requires understanding th[e] mysterious  and self-destructive compulsion [to consume drugs] that has no analog for nonaddicts.""). Accordingly, the district  court did not abuse its discretion by allowing Dr. Clark to testify as an expert regarding drug dependency and  addiction. IV. Third, Bixler contends that the government violated his equal protection rights by using a peremptory challenge to  strike the only black member of the venire. HN7[ ] The Equal Protection Clause prohibits a party from using peremptory challenges to exclude members of  the venire on account of their race. See Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986).  In evaluating a Batson challenge, the district court must follow a three-step process. Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765,  768, 115 S. Ct. 1769, 131 L. Ed. 2d 834 (1995). First, the court must determine if the opponent of the peremptory  challenge has made out a prima facie case of racial discrimination (step 1). Second, if the opponent establishes a  prima facie case, the court must then determine if the proponent has presented a race-neutral explanation (step 2).  Third, if the proponent tenders a race-neutral explanation, the court must ultimately decide [*15]  whether the  opponent has proved purposeful discrimination (step 3). Id. Notably, ""the ultimate burden of persuasion . . . rests  with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike."" Id. 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *11 Page 13 of 18 HN8[ ] Step 1. A party's use of a peremptory challenge to strike the only prospective black juror is ""more than  sufficient to establish a prima facie case of intentional discrimination."" United States v. Mahan, 190 F.3d 416, 425  (6th Cir. 1999). Bixler averred, and the government did not dispute, that the stricken juror, Juror 23, was the sole  black juror on the panel. Thus, we must move to step 2. HN9[ ] Step 2. The proponent's explanation ""need not be particularly persuasive, or even plausible, so long as it is  neutral."" United States v. Harris, 192 F.3d 580, 586 (6th Cir. 1999). An explanation is ""neutral"" if it is based on  something other than the race of the juror. Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 360, 111 S. Ct. 1859, 114 L. Ed.  2d 395 (1991). Here, the government argues that the peremptory strike was based on Juror 23's acquaintance with  Bixler, namely, that her family or friends knew Bixler. Finding that the government met its burden, we turn now to  step 3. See United States v. Lawrence, 735 F.3d 385, 444 (6th Cir. 2013) (finding that a juror's familial connection  to the defendant ""is facially reasonable and does not suggest discriminatory intent""). HN10[ ] Step 3. When the proponent presents a neutral explanation, ""the question . . . boils down to whether  [the [*16]  opponent] established by a preponderance of the evidence that the peremptory strikes were intentionally  discriminatory."" United States v. Tucker, 90 F.3d 1135, 1142 (6th Cir. 1996). The district court's decision on the  ultimate question of discriminatory intent is a finding of fact entitled to ""great deference on appeal."" Hernandez, 500  U.S. at 364. We accordingly review for clear error. Tucker, 90 F.3d at 1142. In this case, the district court found no discriminatory intent. The court noted that Juror 23 was the only juror who  ""had heard of Prince Bixler,"" and that she gave conflicting information ""on how she heard."" Juror 23 initially  indicated that, three or four years prior, she heard a family member mention ""Prince Bixler"" in passing. Juror 23  later indicated that she heard his name through a mutual family friend, not a family member, and named the specific  friend on the record. In addition, Juror 23 was the only juror with prior knowledge of Backpage.com. Under these  circumstances, we cannot find that the district court clearly erred in overruling Bixler's Batson challenge. V. Fourth, Bixler argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a continuance based on news coverage  of a local rally against sex trafficking to occur later that same day. HN11[ ] Trial courts retain broad discretion [*17]  on matters of continuances. Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S. 1, 11-12,  103 S. Ct. 1610, 75 L. Ed. 2d 610 (1982). An abuse of discretion occurs only when the court unreasonably and  arbitrarily ""'insist[s] upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay.'"" Id. (quoting Ungar v.  Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575, 589, 84 S. Ct. 841, 11 L. Ed. 2d 921 (1964)). ""There are no mechanical tests for deciding  when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process. The answer must be found in the  circumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request  is denied."" United States v. Wirsing, 719 F.2d 859, 866 (6th Cir. 1983) (citation omitted). We also look to whether  the defendant suffered any prejudice as a result of the denial. Id.; United States v. Martin, 740 F.2d 1352, 1360 (6th  Cir. 1984). Minutes before the start of voir dire, Bixler moved to continue his trial for an unspecified period of time to avoid any  potential prejudice from a local rally against ""either human trafficking or sex trafficking"" scheduled for later that  same day. Trial R. 213, Page ID#: 1904. Bixler worried that prospective jurors ""may have heard reports"" on the  news that morning, and selected jurors could hear about it on the news that night. Id. He argued that the rally  attendees would be protesting the same conduct of which he was accused, and thus, publicity of the rally could  prejudicially pervade the [*18]  courtroom and impact his ability to have a fair trial. The district court denied the  motion, assuring the parties that it would ""carefully voir dire"" the jury pool of any predispositions and warn the  selected jury ""to avoid any news concerning th[e] case, and . . . the subject matter of the case."" During voir dire, the court inquired whether the prospective jurors had any knowledge of the case or any  preconceived opinions as to Bixler's guilt. None of the jurors indicted any knowledge of the case. Instead, all the  jurors expressed their willingness to decide the charges against Bixler solely on the evidence presented at trial and  2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *15 Page 14 of 18 to presume Bixler's innocence unless proven guilty. Defense counsel specifically inquired whether the prospective  jurors had seen any news stories or accounts about commercial sex trafficking. None of the jurors answered  affirmatively, and neither party challenged any juror for cause on that basis. Throughout the trial, the district court  properly admonished the jury to avoid reading, watching, or listening to any coverage of the case, and required any  juror inadvertently exposed to such information to convey that fact to the court. Under these circumstances, [*19]   we cannot find that the unbeknownst sex trafficking rally prejudicially affected the juror pool. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Bixler's motion for a continuance. VI. Fifth, Bixler challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions for sex trafficking and witness  tampering. HN12[ ] Where, as here, a defendant properly preserves his claims of insufficient evidence, we review  those claims de novo. United States v. Mack, 808 F.3d 1074, 1080 (6th Cir. 2015). In evaluating the claims, we  must ask ""whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact  could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt."" Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S.  307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979). We must ""draw all available inferences and resolve all issues of  credibility in favor of the jury's verdict."" United States v. Conatser, 514 F.3d 508, 519 (6th Cir. 2008) (citation  omitted). A. HN13[ ] To support a conviction for sex trafficking under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1), the government must prove that  Bixler (1) recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, or maintained a person; (2) knowing that  force, threats of force, coercion, or any combination of such means would be used; (3) to cause the person to  engage in a commercial sex act. Bixler challenges only the second element, arguing [*20]  that the government  failed to present sufficient evidence of ""force"" or ""coercion."" HN14[ ] ""Coercion"" includes ""threats of serious harm"" and a ""scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person  to believe that failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any person."" 18  U.S.C. § 1591(e)(2)(A)-(B). ""Serious harm"" means any harm, whether physical or nonphysical, including psychological, financial, or reputational harm, that is  sufficiently serious, under all the surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable person of the same  background and in the same circumstances to perform or to continue performing commercial sexual activity in  order to avoid incurring that harm. 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(5). It can include physical and psychological harm incurred from severe drug withdrawal. See  Mack, 808 F.3d at 1081-83. In Mack, the defendant targeted women with pre-existing drug addictions and used those addictions to coerce them  into prostitution. Id. at 1082. The defendant initially supplied ""free"" drugs to the women, which in turn exacerbated  their addictions and resulted in a high, fictitious drug debt. Id. at 1081-82. When he abruptly cut them off and  demanded payment, the women felt compelled to engage in commercial sex acts ""to avoid the physical and  psychological [*21]  harm of heroin and cocaine withdrawal."" Id. at 1082. One woman testified that ""when she did  not prostitute herself, she would get sick from lack of heroin. Without it, she would sweat, vomit, shake, and kick her  legs uncontrollably."" Id. Under these circumstances, this court found sufficient evidence of a ""coercive and, at times,  physically abusive atmosphere in which the victims felt compelled to prostitute themselves."" Id. at 1081. Mack is controlling here. Bixler similarly exploited his victims' drug addictions and withdrawal symptoms by carefully  controlling their access to drugs. Bixler gave the women presumptively free drugs and enticed them into  codependent relationships. Once he gained their complete obedience and loyalty, Bixler demanded the women  engage in prostitution for his financial benefit. Bixler took salacious photos of them, posted advertisements on  Backpage.com, and set the prices for their services. Bixler psychologically manipulated the women by withholding  drugs until after their dates. He also used intimidation and violence to ensure the women met their daily quotas. He  2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *18 Page 15 of 18 then kept all the money earned; using the profits to repay their fictious debts. Viewing this evidence in the light  most [*22]  favorable to the government, a reasonable jury could have found that Bixler forced, threatened, or  coerced the women to engage in prostitution. Bixler also argues that the district court should have found Evans incompetent to testify and stricken her testimony  after she admitted to using heroin on the morning of trial. HN15[ ] However, ""[a] witness under the influence of  drugs is competent to testify unless he or she is so impaired that he or she cannot coherently respond to  questioning."" United States v. Frezzell, 793 F. App'x 133, 136 (3rd Cir. 2019) (quoting 98 C.J.S. Witnesses § 115  (2019)). That was not the case here. The district court determined that Evans ""had recollection, she's had narration,  she seems to understand the oath, she says she doesn't remember when she doesn't remember."" Trial R. 214,  Page ID#: 2460-61. The court accordingly concluded that Evans was competent to testify. Thus, Bixler's argument  goes to the weight and credibility of her testimony—a question ""particularly suited to the jury,"" not this court. Fed. R.  Evid. 601, Advisory Committee Notes; see United States v. Moreno, 899 F.2d 465, 469 (6th Cir. 1990). B. HN16[ ] To support a conviction for witness tampering under 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(1), the government must prove  that Bixler (1) knowingly intimidated, threatened, or corruptly persuaded; (2) with the intent to influence, delay, [*23]   or prevent; (3) the testimony of any person in an official proceeding. Bixler challenges only the first element, arguing  that the government failed to present sufficient proof of intimidation, threats, or corrupt persuasion where he told the  women to ""tell the truth."" HN17[ ] We have consistently upheld convictions for witness tampering in the absence of directly threatening  language. See United States v. Carnes, 309 F.3d 950, 956 (6th Cir. 2002); United States v. Carson, 796 F. App'x  238, 251 (6th Cir. 2019). The key inquiry is whether the evidence could have been interpreted as ""threatening in  nature or intent."" Carnes, 309 F.3d at 956 (internal quotations and citation omitted). This inquiry recognizes that  ""otherwise encouraging language can become a threat . . . when issued by a long-time abuser."" Id. at 957 (internal  quotations omitted). The evidence produced at trial demonstrated that Bixler had a long-standing pattern of threatening and abusing  Ratliff and Payton. In the days leading up to their grand jury appearances, Bixler incessantly called and delivered  messages to deter them from testifying. For example, Bixler confronted Ratliff and guilted her for betraying him.  Bixler also conveyed that, if the roles were reversed, he would ""fight with"" her rather than testify against her. In  particular, Bixler threatened: ""No, when I get the [*24]  fuck in front of you, I'm going to cuss your ass out, I might  even slap your God damn brains out. But at the end of the day - I wouldn't tell the motherfucker nothing."" Gov't Ex.  12G, 01:43-3:26. Ratliff understood these messages as attempts to pressure or intimidate her into lying to protect  him. Bixler similarly confronted Payton, telling her that the government wanted to ""conquer and destroy"" him by ""fucking  [him] with all [his] loved ones [and the people he] takes care of . . . or the people that [he would] do anything for, so  once they turn on [him], [he's] sitting in jail with nothing."" Gov't Ex. 13A, 00:28-01:07. Based on Bixler's tone and  conduct, Payton believed Bixler ""was mad at [her]"" and did not want her to testify before the grand jury. To avoid  angering Bixler, Payton used heroin on her way to the courthouse and refused to talk at the first grand jury. Payton  stated that she would rather go to jail for six months than testify against him. Under these circumstances, the jury could reasonably infer that Bixler attempted to corruptly persuade the women  and prevent them from testifying before the grand jury. This is especially true ""given the long history of [Bixler's]  abusive [*25]  behavior toward [Ratliff and Payton]."" United States v. Iu, 917 F.3d 1026, 1032 (8th Cir. 2019). VII. Finally, Bixler challenges the application of seven sentencing enhancements and the district court's calculation of  restitution. HN18[ ] When evaluating the district court's application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review factual  findings for clear error and mixed questions of law and fact de novo. United States v. Tolbert, 668 F.3d 798, 800  2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *21 Page 16 of 18 (6th Cir. 2012). ""A finding is clearly erroneous where, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court  on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed."" Id. A. We will first address Bixler's argument that the record did not adequately support six different sentencing  enhancements. First, Bixler objects to the district court's application of a four-level enhancement for ""knowingly caus[ing] another  person to engage in a sexual act—by using force against that other person; or by threatening or placing that other  person in fear [of] death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping."" 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a); see U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1(b)(1).  Several women testified at trial that Bixler frequently used violence to ensure they met call quotas. Bixler even  admitted that he ""put [his] hands on women""; in particular, he testified that he hit Godown and ""struck"" [*26]  Evans  for stealing money. Therefore, the district court did not err in applying the use of force enhancement. Second, Bixler objects to the district court's application of U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a). HN19[ ] Under section 3B1.1(a),  the district court must apply a four-level enhancement if the defendant organized or led any criminal activity that  involved five or more participants. A review of the record shows that Bixler headed an extensive criminal enterprise  that spanned several years and involved at least eight participants whom he deputized to recruit women, create  advertisements, arrange hotel rooms, collect profits, and deliver drugs. Therefore, the record amply supported  application of the leadership enhancement. Third, Bixler objects to the district court's application of a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. See  U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1. The district court determined that Bixler's convictions for witness tampering supported an  enhancement for obstructing justice. The court found that Bixler ""specifically talked about trafficking with respect to  Adrianne Ratliff."" These findings were supported by the record. Fourth, Bixler objects to the district court's application of an eight-level enhancement for threatening to cause  physical injury [*27]  to a person. See U.S.S.G. § 2J1.2(b)(1)(B). However, Bixler's argument is belied by a  recorded phone call between himself and Ratliff, in which he threatened to ""slap [her] God damn brains out."" Gov't  Ex. 12G, 01:43-3:26. Fifth, Bixler objects to the district court's drug quantity calculation under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(5). HN20[ ] Section  2D1.1(c)(5) provides that drug trafficking offenses involving at least one kilogram of heroin require a base offense  level of 30. A review of the record shows that Bixler distributed heroin to at least nine people over the course of two  years. For instance, Bixler sold Holly Falls thirty grams of heroin; Jessica Martin ten grams of heroin; and Amy  Bailey sixty grams of heroin. In addition, Bixler supplied Evans with heroin daily for two and a half years, an  approximate total of seven hundred fifty grams, and Caudill with two grams of heroin daily for a couple months.  Accordingly, the record sufficiently supported the district court's drug quantity calculation. Finally, Bixler objects to the district court's application of a two-level enhancement for an offense involving three to  seven firearms. See U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(1)(A). However, Bixler admitted that he owned three firearms recovered  from his residence and garage. Therefore, the district court [*28]  did not err in applying the firearm enhancement. B. Bixler next argues that the district court impermissibly ""double counted"" in applying multiple Sentencing Guidelines  provisions for the same conduct. HN21[ ] Double counting occurs only ""when precisely the same aspect of a defendant's conduct factors into his  sentence in two separate ways."" United States v. Farrow, 198 F.3d 179, 193 (6th Cir. 1999). ""[N]o double counting  occurs if the defendant is punished for distinct aspects of his conduct."" United States v. Battaglia, 624 F.3d 348,    2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *25 Page 17 of 18 351 (6th Cir. 2010). Even where double counting occurs, it is not necessarily impermissible. Farrow, 198 F.3d at  194. For instance, ""we allow double counting where it appears that Congress or the Sentencing Commission  intended to attach multiple penalties to the same conduct."" Id. (citing United States v. Johnson, 22 F.3d 106, 108  (6th Cir. 1994)). Bixler identifies three alleged instances of double counting. First, he asserts that the district court improperly  considered his use of force to determine his base offense level and to apply a four-level enhancement under §  2A3.1(b)(1). HN22[ ] U.S.S.G. § 2G1.1(a) provides the base offense level for sex trafficking convictions. However,  when the offense involves aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse, the cross-reference in U.S.S.G. § 2G1.1(c)(1)  provides that the district court should instead apply U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1. Section 2A3.1(b)(1) provides for a four-level  enhancement if the offense involved the former—aggravated [*29]  sexual abuse under section 2241(a) or (b). Id. at  § 2A3.1(b)(1). Based on the plain language of the Guidelines, the Sentencing Commission intended for the entirety  of § 2A3.1, including any enhancements, to apply following the application of the cross reference. See U.S.S.G. §  1B1.5(a); United States v. Kizer, 517 F. App'x 415, 420 (6th Cir. 2013) (finding that ""the Sentencing Commission  must have intended to punish defendants in this way using both the cross reference and the enhancement."").  Therefore, the district court's application of the use of force enhancement did not constitute impermissible double  counting. Second, Bixler asserts that the district court improperly considered the victims' drug addictions both as an element  of the offense and to increase the offense level under § 3A1.1(b)(1). HN23[ ] Under section 3A1.1(b)(1), the  district court must apply a two-level enhancement ""if the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the  offense was a vulnerable victim."" A ""vulnerable victim"" means one ""who is unusually vulnerable due to age, physical  or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct."" Id. at § 3A1.1 cmt. n.2.  The application notes caution that the vulnerable victim enhancement cannot be applied ""if the factor that makes a  person a vulnerable victim is incorporated in the offense guideline."" [*30]  Id. However, the district court recognized  this at sentencing and imposed the enhancement based on factors other than the women's drug addictions. For  example, the court also considered their criminal histories and economic dependency on Bixler. Therefore, the  district court's application of the vulnerable victim enhancement did not constitute impermissible double counting. Third, Bixler asserts that the district court improperly considered his attempts to influence grand jury testimony both  as an element of the offenses and to increase the offense level under § 3C1.1. However, this argument is expressly  foreclosed by the application notes. HN24[ ] The application notes allow the obstruction of justice enhancement to  apply ""where there is a separate count of conviction for such conduct."" U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 cmt. n.4; see United  States v. Pego, 567 F. App'x 323, 330 (6th Cir. 2014). Therefore, the district court's application of the obstruction of  justice enhancement also did not constitute impermissible double counting. C. Finally, Bixler contends that the district court erred in calculating the amount of restitution owed to Moore, Godown,  and Evans. HN25[ ] The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (""TVPA"") directs district courts to order restitution for  any sex trafficking offense. See 18 U.S.C. § 1593(a). Section 1593(b) requires the defendant to pay the victim ""the  full [*31]  amount of the victim's losses,"" including ""the gross income or value to the defendant of the victim's  services or labor."" Bixler argues that the government did not present sufficiently reliable proof of the women's incomes, and that the  court merely estimated the amount. HN26[ ] However, the amount of restitution need not ""be proven with  exactitude."" In re Sealed Case, 702 F.3d 59, 66, 403 U.S. App. D.C. 194 (D.C. Cir. 2012). Determining the dollar  amount of a victim's losses ""will often be difficult"" and ""such a determination will inevitably involve some degree of  approximation[.]"" Id. (citation omitted). Thus, estimates are permitted as long as there exists some reasonable and  reliable evidence of the victims' losses. United States v. Williams, 5 F.4th 1295, 1305 (11th Cir. 2021).   2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *28 Page 18 of 18 Relying on the women's trial testimony, the district court multiplied their self-reported daily earnings by the  approximate number of days worked. The court found that Moore earned approximately $1,000 per day for four  days, totaling a gross income of $4,000. It also estimated that Godown earned approximately $300 per day for 782  days, totaling a gross income of $234,642. It further determined that Evans earned approximately $160 per day for  591 days, totaling a gross income of $94,628. During its calculations, the court reduced the number of days [*32]   worked to account for sick days and ensure a conservative estimate. We find these estimates sufficiently  reasonable and reliable for purposes of the TVPA. Bixler next asserts that the court should have offset the claimed amount by the value of the items supplied to the  women, including food and lodging. However, this argument disregards the plain language of the TVPA. HN27[ ]  Section 1593(b) provides that trafficking victims shall recover ""the gross income or value [of their services]."" ""Gross  income"" is the ""[t]otal income from all sources before deductions, exemptions, or other tax reductions."" Black's Law  Dictionary 710, 767 (7th ed. 1999) (emphasis added). Therefore, ""the court was not required—or even permitted— to offset the restitution . . . by the amount [Bixler] expended on his victims' living expenses."" Williams, 5 F.4th at  1305. Accordingly, the district court did not err in calculating the amount of restitution owed under the TVPA. VIII. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Bixler's convictions, sentence, and restitution owed.  2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *31",1
People v. L.G.,"[*429]  [**419]   Toko Serita, J. Defendant moves to vacate her plea of guilty to  disorderly conduct (Penal Law § 240.20) under docket  number 2000QN056893 and the judgment of conviction  and sentence rendered on November 14, 2000, and her  plea of guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the  fourth degree (Penal Law § 265.01) under docket  number 2003QN050066 and the judgment of conviction  and sentence rendered on November 7, 2003, pursuant  to Criminal Procedure Law § 440.10 (1) (h) and (i). The Parties' Contentions Defendant asserts that her prior convictions are directly  related to her arrests for prostitution offenses, and that  because she is a victim of human trafficking, those  convictions must be vacated and the cases dismissed.  Defendant  also  argues  that  she  was  denied  effective [****2]  assistance of counsel when she  pleaded guilty in each case. The People do not contest the factual allegations  presented by defendant. Rather, they argue that her  second conviction  [***2] for criminal possession of a  weapon should not be vacated because it is not a  prostitution-related charge, and as a matter of public  policy, CPL 440.10 should not grant greater protection  to human trafficking victims in weapons cases. They  also assert that defendant failed to seek relief under  CPL 440.10 with due diligence [*430]  because she filed  her motion three years after she ceased to fear her  trafficker in 2008, and a year after CPL 440.10 was  amended in 2010 to allow relief for human trafficking  victims (see CPL 440.10 [1] [i]). Procedural History Defendant L.G. was arraigned on November 14, 2000      under docket number 2000QN056893 under an alias  and charged with prostitution (Penal Law § 230.00).  Defendant pleaded guilty on that date to disorderly  conduct (Penal Law § 240.20) and was sentenced to a  conditional discharge. Subsequently, on November 7, 2003 defendant was  arraigned  under  docket  number  2003QN050066,   [***3] again, under an alias and charged with loitering  for the purpose of engaging in a prostitution offense  (Penal Law § 240.37 [3]), criminal possession of a  weapon in the fourth degree (Penal Law § 265.01 [1])  and  disorderly  conduct  (Penal  Law  §  240.20  [5]). [**420]  On November 7, 2003 defendant pleaded  guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth  degree and was sentenced to three years of probation.  Thereafter, on May 5, 2004, defendant was declared  delinquent for violating the conditions of her probation.  On November 28, 2006 defendant was convicted of  violation of probation and sentenced to 10 days'  imprisonment. I. Factual Background The People do not contest defendant's factual  averments. Accordingly, the court accepts as true the  following facts set out in defendant's moving papers: Defendant, ""L.G.,"" was forced into prostitution when she  was only 12 years old. She was born in 1986 in  Brooklyn, New York, and lived with her grandmother  until she was eight years old. While living with her  grandmother, L.G. was sexually abused by an uncle, but  she never received any medical attention even though  the Administration for Children's Services was involved  and  informed  about  the  abuse.  Following  her  grandmother's death, L.G. was placed into foster care  and  [***4] over the next few years, she was bounced  around different foster homes until she was 12 years  old, when something happened that changed her life.  [*431]   There was a strip club across the street from  where she lived with a foster family in Brownsville,  Brooklyn. One day she was approached by a man in  this thirties, ""A."" He took her to a house where six other  underage girls were living. Each of [****3]  these girls  had a bed in a different room, and ""A,"" who was very       41 Misc. 3d 428, *428; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **418; 2013 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3605, ***1; 2013 NY Slip Op 23276, ****1 Page 5 of 11 nice to her at first, told her that if she stayed with him,  she would not have to go back to her foster family. He  kept her there and would not permit her to return to her  foster home. He explained the rules of the ""game"" to  her, and although she didn't understand it at the time,  ""A"" was preparing her to become a prostitute. After several weeks, ""A"" sent her out  [***5] to a ""track""  on Pennsylvania Avenue in Brooklyn, accompanied by  the other girls, who were there to make sure she did not  get snatched by other pimps. Thereafter, he took her to  that track repeatedly so that she could earn money for  him through prostitution. L.G. was scared to leave ""A""  because he severely beat the other girls just for  speaking with other men. He also beat them with  hangers because he thought they were a bad influence  on defendant. Later, at the encouragement of some girls  she met on the track, defendant started working for  another pimp, named ""B,"" in Crown Heights, because  she felt safer with him. Although he was also nice to her  on the first day they were together, the next day he  forced her to go out and make money for him through  commercial sex. ""B"" also intimidated her with physical  violence and was very strict with his girls, whom he  forced to work daily from 7:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. When  [***6] L.G. was about 13 years old, she started  working for ""C."" She was required to give him the money  she made in exchange for her own room. She did  not [**421]  enjoy her life being prostituted: ""It wasn't  like I wanted to be out there, but being in foster care,  going from home to home, I felt like nobody cared about  me. It made me feel so miserable.""  [*432]   After about six months, L.G. met another pimp  called ""D"" who took her to Atlantic City, New Jersey. In  2000, ""D"" sent her by bus to Washington, D.C., and  then to Miami, Florida. In Florida, defendant, who was  14 years old at the time, attempted to leave ""the life"" by               calling her brother's father who lived in Ft. Lauderdale.  He came to get her, and she lived with him and her  brother for about two weeks. A friend bought her a ticket  back to New York, where she resumed foster care  placement. However, the family she was placed with did  not support her. She then met a girl who introduced her to a  manipulative pimp called ""E"" in Coney Island. L.G. was  14 years old at the time and he was about 30. He was  very violent and would severely beat the girls who  worked for him,  [***7] including L.G., who was afraid  that he would kill her if she ever tried to leave him. She  recalled that ""some girls left once they realized he was  so scary, but 'E' would find them and beat them up. If a  girl made a lot of money, he would put fear in her heart  not to leave."" He beat the defendant often, sometimes  violently, for not making enough money or for  threatening to leave, and would use a belt, or an iron, or  any other handy object. Once he beat her so badly  about the face [****4]  that she was unable to leave the  house for two weeks, primarily because ""E"" was afraid  she might attract the attention of the police. He also  forced her, as well as all his other girls, to have sex  regularly with him. During the time she was with him she  worked the tracks in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, New  Jersey, and other states. ""E"" instructed L.G. to use a  false name and age if she was ever arrested. She was  with ""E"" for about 3½ years. Defendant was first arrested in Queens County for  prostitution on November 14, 2000 when she was 14  years old. In accordance with her pimp's instructions,  she provided a false name and birth date to the police to  appear older. Defendant was next arrested on  November  [***8] 2, 2003 for loitering for purposes of  prostitution, disorderly conduct, and criminal possession  of a weapon in the fourth degree for allegedly carrying a  knife. She was 17 years old at the time. L.G. admits that  she carried a small pocketknife ""no bigger than [her]  forefingers,"" which had been given to her by her pimp,  who instructed her to carry it  [*433]  with her for  protection when she was on the street. ""Johns"" had  raped, assaulted and threatened L.G. with weapons  many times while she was forced to work as a  prostitute. Defendant explained that      41 Misc. 3d 428, *431; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **420; 2013 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3605, ***4; 2013 NY Slip Op 23276, ****3 Page 6 of 11 ""[a]t the time of my second arrest, I had heard that  there was a guy out there who pretended to be a  client, but would then rape girls and beat them up. It  felt like every time I turned around, some girl was  missing. Another girl I knew was raped and beaten  up by a trick. She ended up in the hospital. I had  already been raped by clients and was terrified of it  happening again. Every time I went out I was  scared of being raped or killed."" The night she was arrested, L.G. was working in a dark  and very scary area near a bus stop when she was  stopped by a [**422]  police officer, who requested her  identification, inspected her purse and discovered the  pocketknife. L.G. thought that she was being arrested  for prostitution, not for possession of a weapon. In any  event, she pleaded guilty to the weapons charge and  was sentenced to probation for three years, which she  eventually violated. According to her, she only  discovered years later that there was a warrant for her  arrest when she applied for a certificate of disposition so  that she could get a job as a home health aide. Because  she had failed to comply with probation, she was  sentenced to 10 days' incarceration on November 28,  2006. In 2004, L.G. was 18 years old when she was finally  able to leave ""the life."" Her pimp, ""E,"" had been  arrested, which gave her a chance to escape. She  returned to a foster care placement agency, and for the  first time in her life, disclosed what had happened to her  as a child. They placed her with a family on Staten  Island to keep her away from Brooklyn, where she did  not feel safe because she had been informed that her  pimp was looking  [***10] for her. She went back to  school and stayed with her foster family in Staten Island  for a year before she was able to get a subsidized  apartment right before her 21st birthday.  [****5]   [*434]  L.G. had been previously mandated by the  family court to participate in the GEMS program back in  2001 when she was 14 years old. As a result, she  received support and counseling from them. After  leaving prostitution in 2004 she reconnected with GEMS  and became an active member, participating in their  educational initiative program and in various therapy  groups before starting school again. She received a  home health aide degree in February 2007 and was      working in that capacity during most of 2007, until the  New York City Department of Health ran a background  check and informed her that she could no longer work  because of her past convictions. She received her GED  in 2010 and subsequently qualified for a certificate as a  medical assistant. More recently, L.G. was questioned  about her ability to be a fit guardian when she petitioned  for custody of her nephew—because of her convictions. In 2008, defendant received a message from her pimp  in which he stated that he was not coming after her.  However, she still feared him and therefore did not  report him as her trafficker. In her affidavit in support of  her motion, she stated that ""[o]ne of my family members was recently  murdered by her pimp. He beat her to death. Even  though it's been many years since I was trafficked,  hearing about this was so emotionally difficult. It  touches me every day. I remember how fearful I felt  when I left. I was always afraid that 'E' was going to  come and hurt me. It's only recently that I just got  that fear out of my heart."" Defendant is currently a student at Medgar Evers  College, and expects to graduate in 2014 with a  Bachelor's degree in public administration and social  work. She avers that she wants ""to vacate my  convictions so that I can move forward with my life and  career without being held back by my past."" II. Analysis Defendant L.G.'s odyssey as a victim of human  trafficking began when she was only 12 years old; she  was picked up off the streets of New York City and  forced into prostitution for the next several [***12]    [**423]  years by a succession of exploitative men who  already had other underage girls working for them.  Having endured physical and sexual violence at the  hands of her pimps,  [*435]  johns, and family members,  defendant's childhood and adolescence were marked by  rapes, sexual assaults, kidnapping, enslavement, and  threats of death. Before she was 18 years old, L.G. had  been arrested twice for prostitution-related offenses in  Queens, resulting in a conviction for disorderly conduct  when she was 14 years old after the first arrest, and  another for criminal possession of a weapon three years  later, when she was 17 years old. In both instances,  however, she was charged and convicted as an adult in  local criminal court. As noted earlier, the facts are undisputed in this case.  At issue here is whether Criminal Procedure Law §  41 Misc. 3d 428, *433; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **421; 2013 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3605, ***9; 2013 NY Slip Op 23276, ****4 Page 7 of 11 440.10 (1) (i) empowers the court to dismiss non- prostitution convictions which directly resulted from  defendant's victimization as a trafficked person or  whether the statute's scope must be narrowly applied to  vacate only convictions for prostitution-related offenses.  [****6] Amendment of CPL 440.10 Vacatur Statute In 2010, HN1[ ] New York became the first state in the  country to pass a law which allows  [***13] defendants  to vacate their prior convictions which resulted from their  experiences as victims of human trafficking (CPL  440.10 [1] [i]). It did so by amending CPL 440.10 to  create a new form of post-conviction relief which affords  victims of sex trafficking the remedy of vacating their  convictions if they can establish that ""[t]he judgment is a conviction where the arresting  charge was under section 240.37 (loitering for the  purpose of engaging in a prostitution offense . . . )  or 230.00 (prostitution) of the penal law, and the  defendant's participation in the offense was a result  of having been a victim of sex trafficking under  section 230.34 of the penal law [New York's sex  trafficking statute], or trafficking in persons under  the [Federal] Trafficking Victims Protection Act  (United States Code, title 22, chapter 78)"" (id.).  Thus, HN2[ ] in order to obtain the requested relief, the  movant must  [*436]  establish that (1) she was a                                      trafficking victim at the time of her arrest, and (2) her  conduct or ""participation in the offense"" leading to her  arrest resulted from her being trafficked. Although New  York, unlike federal law,  [***15] does not have a  definition of what constitutes a sex trafficking victim, it  necessarily follows that any person who is a victim of  the statutory crime of sex trafficking would meet this  definition. A person [**424]  is guilty of sex trafficking  under Penal Law § 230.34 if he or she ""intentionally  advances or profits from prostitution"" by engaging in any  one of several types of conduct, such as taking or  keeping  an  individual's  passport  or  immigration  documents to induce a victim to become involved in or  to remain in prostitution (Penal Law § 230.34 [3]), or by  using different methods of force or coercion to instill a  fear in the trafficked victim to compel her to engage in  or continue to engage in prostitution (Penal Law §  230.34 [5] [a]-[h]). HN3[ ] On the federal level, the Trafficking Victims  Protection Act specifically mentioned in CPL 440.10 (1)  (i) defines ""severe forms of trafficking in persons"" to  include sex [****7]  trafficking either in which the victim  is induced to engage in a commercial sex act through  force, fraud or coercion, or where the victim induced to  engage in a commercial sex act has not attained the  age of 18 (22 USC § 7102 [9] [A]). Severe forms of  trafficking in persons also include ""the recruitment,   [***16] harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining  of a person for labor or services, through the use of  force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to  involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or  slavery"" (id. at § 7102 [9] [B]).  This court finds that L.G. was clearly a victim of sex  trafficking under both federal and New York state  standards. L.G. has demonstrated that she was clearly  a victim of sex trafficking under the relevant state sex  trafficking statute because of her traffickers' use of  force and fear to compel her participation in prostitution  (Penal Law § 230.34 [5]). Defendant also meets  [*437]   the requirements under the federal TVPA as a victim of  a ""severe"" form of trafficking because she was induced  into commercial sex while under 18 years of age (22  USC § 7102 [9] [A]; People v G.M., 32 Misc 3d 274,  280, 922 NYS2d 761 [Crim Ct, Queens County 2011];  see also People v Doe, 34 Misc 3d 237, 935 NYS2d 481  [Sup Ct, Bronx County 2011]).     41 Misc. 3d 428, *435; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **423; 2013 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3605, ***12; 2013 NY Slip Op 23276, ****5 Page 8 of 11 More to the point, L.G.'s participation in the offences  which led to her two convictions was the direct result of  her actions as a trafficking victim forced into street  prostitution by her pimp/trafficker. The People do not  contest either defendant's status or the circumstances  surrounding both of her arrests; only that her second  conviction should not be subject to vacatur under this  statute. Thus, the only disputed issue in this case is  whether defendant's conviction for a non-prostitution  offense which was the direct result of her having been  forced into sex trafficking may be vacated under CPL  440.10 (1) (i). L.G. argues that while her second  conviction for weapons possession is admittedly not a  prostitution offense, it should nevertheless be dismissed  because it resulted from her forced involvement in  trafficking activity by her pimp when he required her to  engage in street prostitution. To support the connection  between the weapons conviction and defendant's  coerced prostitution activities, defense counsel notes  that L.G. possessed a pocketknife to protect herself  against unpredictable and potentially violent situations  involving ""johns,"" and was told to do so by her trafficker.  For  [***18] the reasons explained below, this court  holds that L.G.'s conviction for possession of a weapon  in the fourth degree falls within the ambit of the vacatur  statute because her participation in that offense was  undeniably connected to the coerced trafficking activity  which led to [**425]  her arrest on prostitution-related  charges and should therefore be vacated. Vacatur Not Limited to the Arresting Charge under CPL  440.10 (1) (i) The New York legislature passed the new vacatur law,  codified at CPL 440.10 (1) (i), based upon a recognition  of the continuing harm done to trafficking victims  who [****8]  are burdened with criminal convictions as a  result of their victimization in  [*438]  the commercial  sex trade. While New York recognized ""the severity of  the crime of sex trafficking"" by passing the sex  trafficking statute in 2007 (Penal Law § 230.34), one  of  the  sponsors  of  this  new  vacatur  statute  acknowledged that ""gaps remain in our ability to provide  justice to the victims"" (Sponsor's Letter in Support, July         20, 2010, Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 10). ""Victims of trafficking into commercial sex are  frequently arrested for prostitution-related offenses  and are then saddled with the criminal record for  life, long after they may be freed from exploitation.  [This] record may prevent them from obtaining  gainful employment and impair their ability to  access or stay in public or private housing, advance  their education, or participate in other important  aspects of life. Trafficked persons should not suffer  ongoing punishment for acts they committed  unwillingly under coercion"" (id.). This new legislation was thus intended to ""give victims  of human trafficking a desperately needed second  chance they deserve"" (Sponsor's Mem in Support, Bill  Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 13; see People v G.M., 32  Misc 3d at 279; People v Doe, 34 Misc 3d at 237 [new  legislation designed to assist minor trafficking victims]). Central to the issue raised by the instant motion is  determining what is meant by the term ""arresting  charge"" in CPL 440.10 (1) (i), and whether eligibility for  relief is confined only to prostitution and loitering  offenses.  [***20] The statutory language of subdivision  (1) (i) specifies that the court may grant vacatur if ""[t]he  judgment is a conviction where the arresting charge was  under"" either of the offenses for loitering for the purpose  of engaging in a prostitution offense (Penal Law §  240.37), or prostitution (Penal Law § 230.00) (CPL  440.10 [1] [i]). Indeed, human trafficking victims are frequently  arrested and charged for a variety of offenses based on  actions which the victims were unwillingly coerced into  committing by their traffickers. Any interpretation of CPL  440.10 (1) (i) that would narrow the definition of  ""arresting charge"" to include only prostitution offenses  as being entitled to post-conviction relief would  [*439]   certainly neither address the coercive forces confronting  trafficking victims nor comport with the ameliorative  legislative purposes of providing ""relief and justice . . . to  sex trafficking victims"" (Governor's Approval Mem, Bill  Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 6). Rather, this new law is  premised upon the profound understanding that  ""[t]rafficked  persons  should  not  suffer  ongoing  punishment for acts they committed unwillingly under  coercion [of a trafficker]"" (Sponsor's Letter in Support,  July 20, 2010,  [***21] Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 10),  in which they are ""presumably not criminally liable for  the offense"" (Peter Preiser, 2010 Supplementary  Practice Commentary, McKinney's Cons Laws of NY,  41 Misc. 3d 428, *437; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **424; 2013 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3605, ***16; 2013 NY Slip Op 23276, ****7 Page 9 of 11 Book 11A, CPL 440.10, 2013 Pocket Part at 99). The insertion of the term ""arresting charge"" in CPL  440.10 (1) (i) was deliberate on the part of the  legislature. As the bill's sponsors [**426]  observed,  ""[t]he bill is keyed to the 'arresting charge' because it is  common for a person arrested on prostitution- related [****9]  charges to plead guilty to some other  lower-level offense such as disorderly conduct; the bill's  remedy should be available to such a person""  (Sponsor's Letter to Governor's Counsel, Aug. 11, 2010,  Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 11). Similarly, the  Governor's approval memorandum recognized that a  defendant could be arrested for prostitution but  convicted of another offense, and seek vacatur of that  conviction under the statute (Governor's Approval Mem,  Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 6). Thus, HN4[ ] the  legislative history of CPL 440.10 (1) (i) shows that the  legislature anticipated that a victim of human trafficking  arrested on prostitution-related charges may ultimately  plead guilty to an alternate count.  [***22] It necessarily  follows that where, as here, one of the arresting charges  was loitering for the purpose of engaging in prostitution,  and the defendant pleaded guilty to a related non- prostitution crime, then that conviction must be regarded  as having resulted from defendant's having been a  victim of sex trafficking. Consequently, that charge  may be vacated under CPL 440.10 (1) (i). In the instant case, L.G.'s second arrest charged her  with a variety of crimes other than simply loitering for the  purpose of engaging in prostitution. Affording her the  remedy of vacatur for those offenses which were also  committed under force and coercion by an underage  victim of sex trafficking is consistent with the  legislature's intent. There is no dispute that she was  clearly a minor victim at the time of her arrest, under the  coercive control of her trafficker, and that she  possessed a pocketknife to protect herself on the  streets where she was  [*440]  forced to work under  dangerous conditions because she had been raped and  kidnapped in the past. Her conviction for criminal  weapons possession was clearly the result of her having  been trafficked and therefore the arrest charge could  be considered a prostitution-related  [***23] offense. Judicial Discretion Limits Vacatur to Trafficking Related  Offenses Another significant feature of this new law is that the  amended statute contemplates the exercise of judicial  discretion because it states that the court ""may"" vacate  the judgment of conviction if certain criteria are met. As  the Governor's approval memorandum notes, this also  includes the discretion to limit the over-inclusive  application of the statute to avoid vacating convictions  for more serious crimes. ""By allowing a court to deny a  motion, even though the defendant committed a crime  as a result of his or her victimization, the bill properly  permits  judicial  consideration  of  the  nature  or  seriousness of the crime"" (Governor's Approval Mem,  Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 6). Thus, HN5[ ] the  statute grants to the court discretion to consider non- prostitution crimes for vacatur, but in exercising that  discretion, the court must ensure that serious crimes are  not vacated merely because the defendant happened to  be  a  victim  of  trafficking.  Additionally,  under  subdivision (6) of CPL 440.10, the statute specifically  contemplates the use of judicial discretion to ""take such  additional action as  [***24] is appropriate in the  circumstances.""  Previously, this court, in People v G.M. (32 Misc 3d 274,  922 NYS2d 761 [2011]), vacated a trafficking victim's  convictions for two violations stemming from drug  charges (disorderly conduct [****10]  [Penal Law §  240.20]), and [**427]  four B misdemeanor convictions,  two for criminal trespass in the third degree (Penal Law  § 140.10), and two for prostitution (Penal Law §  230.00). In that case, the People consented to the  dismissal of all six of the defendant's convictions,  including those that did not involve prostitution charges,  because they agreed that the defendant was clearly a   [*441]  victim of sex trafficking during each of her  arrests. In carefully reviewing the specific facts of this                      41 Misc. 3d 428, *439; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **425; 2013 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3605, ***21; 2013 NY Slip Op 23276, ****8 Page 10 of 11 case, the court finds no difference between defendant's  status as a victim of sex trafficking and that of the  defendant G.M. Accordingly, there is no discernible  distinction between both cases except for the fact that  L.G. pleaded guilty to the crime of fourth-degree criminal   [***25] possession of a weapon, an A misdemeanor. In People v G.M., this court left open the question HN7[ ] whether CPL 440.10 (1) (i) could be applied to non- prostitution offenses where the People have not  consented to vacatur of the resulting conviction(s). It is  now evident  [***26] from the foregoing analysis of the  legislative  history  behind  the  statute,  that  the  legislature's goal in amending the statute was to avoid  punishing the victims of human trafficking by saddling  them with a criminal record. It is also apparent that the  legislature fully expected the statute to provide relief to  trafficking victims who were not only arrested for  prostitution or loitering for the purpose of prostitution,  but were also convicted of other charges. Finally, the  legislature noted that discretion remains with the court  to determine which convictions should be vacated. Additionally, this court rejects the People's argument  that defendant failed to file this motion with due  diligence after she ceased to be a victim of sex  trafficking, as required under CPL 440.10 (1) (i).  According  to  defendant's  uncontested  factual  averments, she escaped her trafficker in 2004, but  feared until 2008 that he would track her down and  harm her. The statutory provision under which  defendant now seeks relief was not enacted until August  2010 and defendant filed her motion in September  2011. Considering the significant amount of effort  required to prepare the instant motion, and the fact that  CPL 440.10 (1) (i)  [***27] had only been in effect for  barely one year when defendant filed her motion, this  court finds that defendant made her motion with  necessary due diligence as required under CPL 440.10  (1) (i) (i).  [****11]   [*442]   Accordingly, in order for the court to exercise its  discretion to consider vacatur of each of defendant's  judgments of conviction, the court must examine the  unique factual circumstances pertaining to each  conviction. Motion to Vacate Judgment under Docket Number  2000QN056893    Defendant was arraigned on November 14, 2000 under  docket number 2000QN056893 and charged with  prostitution [**428]  (Penal Law § 230.00). Defendant  pleaded guilty on that date to disorderly conduct (Penal  Law § 240.20) and was sentenced to a conditional  discharge. This conviction precisely fits the pattern  anticipated under CPL 440.10 (1) (i) for permitting the  judgment to be vacated. Additionally, the court notes that based upon L.G.'s  uncontroverted factual averments, she was only 14  years old at the time of her conviction for disorderly  conduct. BecauseHN8[ ]  disorderly conduct is an  offense for which criminal responsibility is not imposed  on a minor under age 16 (Penal Law § 30.00 [2]), the  conviction on that charge is a nullity and should be  dismissed  [***28] (Penal Law § 30.00 [1]; People v  Lebron, 197 AD2d 416, 602 NYS2d 602 [1st Dept  1993], lv denied 82 NY2d 898, 632 NE2d 475, 610  NYS2d 165 [1993]; People v McFadden, 194 AD2d 566,  598 NYS2d 567 [2d Dept 1993], lv denied 82 NY2d 722,  622 NE2d 321, 602 NYS2d 820 [1993]). Accordingly, the judgment convicting defendant of  disorderly conduct was ordered vacated, and the  accusatory instrument dismissed by this court. Motion to Vacate Judgment under Docket Number  2003QN050066 On November 7, 2003 defendant was arraigned under  docket number 2003QN050066 and charged with  loitering for the purpose of engaging in a prostitution  offense (Penal Law § 240.37 [3]), criminal possession of  a weapon in the fourth degree (Penal Law § 265.01 [1])  and disorderly conduct (Penal Law § 240.20 [5]).  Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a  weapon in the fourth degree and received a sentence of  three years' probation. It is apparent both from  defendant's  factual  averments,  and  the  factual  allegations contained in the complaint filed in the case,  that the knife at issue which gave rise to the weapons  possession  charge,  was  recovered  incident  to  defendant's prostitution-related activity, and that she  was a victim of trafficking at the time of her arrest.  Accordingly, the judgment convicting defendant of  criminal possession of a  [***29]   [*443]  weapon in the  fourth degree was ordered vacated and the accusatory  instrument dismissed by this court. Conclusion Based upon the foregoing, this court vacated the  judgments of conviction entered under docket number  41 Misc. 3d 428, *441; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **427; 2013 N.Y. Misc.

The court further ordered that  the records of defendant's convictions be sealed under  CPL 160.50 (1) and (3) (f).  [****12]   41 Misc. 3d 428, *443; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **428; 2013 N.Y. Misc.

"State v. Nelson, 2023 Iowa App. LEXIS 941","TABOR, Presiding Judge. A jury found Brandon Nelson guilty of second-degree  theft for taking a motor vehicle. Nelson appeals his  conviction, contending that he did not intend to  permanently deprive the owner of the vehicle. Because  the State did not prove that element beyond a  reasonable doubt, we reverse Nelson's theft conviction  and remand for entry of judgment of acquittal. I. Facts and Prior Proceedings After working an overnight hospital shift in August 2021,  P.K. found his 2017 Chevy Sonic missing from the  parking lot. Within fifteen minutes of calling the police,  P.K. located the vehicle using his OnStar service. It was  six blocks from the hospital. The hospital pulled  surveillance footage of the parking lot; that video  showed that [*2]  the vehicle went missing ""sometime  between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m."" The car was covered in dust because P.K. lived on a  gravel road. But in the dust were ""smudge marks and  handprints"" that weren't there when he arrived at work.  Sheldon Police Officer Todd Wood believed that the  Chevy, which had a manual transmission, had been  placed into neutral and pushed to the new location.  Checking inside, P.K. discovered his cash and clothing  were gone. He also noticed a ""wadded up soaking wet""  plaid shirt that did not belong to him. Later that morning, police received calls that ""a white,  tall male subject"" was seen ""wandering about""  barefooted near a downtown restaurant. Officer Wood  spotted a man matching that description in the  convenience store parking lot. The officer observed that  the man, later identified as Nelson, was ""lost or  confused"" and ""not walking in a straight line."" Officer  Wood asked Nelson if he was okay and noticed a price  tag hanging from the shirt Nelson was wearing. After  Page 2 of 3 more questioning, Officer Wood arrested Nelson. At  the jail, O'Brien County Deputy Keven Van Meeteren  interviewed Nelson, who is a registered sex offender.  The deputy asked Nelson about his failure to  update [*3]  his address for the sex offender registry  when he moved to South Dakota. Nelson said he was  homeless there and did not have a residence to list. The State charged Nelson with theft of a motor vehicle,  a class ""D"" felony, in violation of Iowa Code sections  714.1(1) and 714.2(2) (2021). At trial, Nelson testified  that when he returned to Sheldon from South Dakota,  he was ""just trying to blend in"" and ""needed a rest."" He  admitted pushing the Chevy all six blocks from the  hospital parking lot. But he denied any intent to  permanently deprive P.K. of the car. As a homeless  man, Nelson said he was trying to avoid ""harassment""  from police, so he took the car for shelter. The jury found Nelson guilty of second-degree theft,  among other offenses. The court imposed a prison  sentence not to exceed five years. And the court  ordered that sentence to be served consecutively with  an indeterminate five-year term for Nelson's assault  conviction. Nelson appeals only his theft conviction. II. Scope and Standard of Review We review sufficiency of the evidence claims for  correction of errors at law. State v. Nall, 894 N.W.2d  514, 517 (Iowa 2017). We view the evidence in the light  most favorable to the State, but we consider all  evidence, not just the inculpatory facts. State v.  Keopasaeuth, 645 N.W.2d 637, 640 (Iowa 2002). We  uphold a verdict when [*4]  it is supported by substantial                  evidence in the record. State v. Mong, 988 N.W.2d 305,  312 (Iowa 2023). Evidence is substantial if it ""would  have convinced a rational fact finder that the defendant  is guilty of the crime charged beyond a reasonable  doubt."" State v. Constable, 505 N.W.2d 473, 478 (Iowa  1993). ""Evidence is not substantial if it raises only  suspicion, speculation or conjecture."" State v. Speicher,  625 N.W.2d 738, 741 (Iowa 2001). III. Analysis To find Nelson guilty of theft in the second degree, the  jury had to find these elements: 1. On or about the 10th day of August, 2021, [he]  knowingly took possession or control of an  automobile. 2. [He] did so with the specific intent to permanently  deprive [P.K.] of the automobile. 3. At the time of the taking, the automobile  belonged to [P.K.]. Nelson contests only the element of specific intent. The  instructions defined specific intent as ""not only being  aware of doing an act and doing it voluntarily, but in  addition, doing it with a specific purpose in mind."" From  there, the State had to prove that Nelson acted with the  specific purpose to ""permanently deprive"" P.K. of his  car. See State v. Morris, 677 N.W.2d 787, 788 (Iowa  2004) (defining intent to deprive in Iowa Code section  714.1(1) as intent to permanently deprive); State v.  Schminkey, 597 N.W.2d 785, 789 (Iowa 1999) (same). The jury instructions did not define ""permanently  deprive."" But our case law says it requires ""more than a  temporary dispossessing [*5]  of another's property.""  State v. Berger, 438 N.W.2d 29, 31 (Iowa Ct. App.  1989). Rather, to prove theft, the State had to show that  Nelson intended to withhold the property ""for an  extended period of time, or under such circumstances,  that its benefit or value is lost; or, the property is  disposed of in such a manner or under such  circumstances, as to render it unlikely that the owner will  recover the property."" Id. Nelson notes that his taking of the Chevy without the  owner's consent did not give rise to an inference that he  intended to permanently deprive P.K. of the vehicle. See  Morris, 677 N.W.2d at 788; Schminkey, 597 N.W.2d at  791. He compares his case to Morris and Schminkey. In  Schminkey, our supreme court vacated a guilty plea for  vehicle theft because the record did not support a  factual basis for the defendant's intent to permanently  deprive. 597 N.W.2d at 787. Schminkey had been  Page 3 of 3 drinking, took a truck owned by a man he did not know,  drove erratically, crashed the truck, and killed another  driver before colliding with a fence. Id. at 787. The court  found that none of those facts revealed Schminkey's  intent ""to do anything more than temporarily use the  vehicle to go home or to another bar."" Id. at 791. The  supreme court reaffirmed Schminkey in Morris. 677  N.W.2d at 788. The court reversed a theft conviction  where police stopped Morris about five miles from the  owner's residence [*6]  after he possessed the truck for  about  thirty  minutes;  Morris  fled  on  foot.  Id.  (""Abandoning the vehicle and fleeing upon observing  the presence of police was an act that would ordinarily  assure that the truck would be returned to its owner.""). In defense of this verdict, the State points to Nelson's  admission that he pushed the vehicle away from the  hospital parking lot so he could ""rest"" in it away from the  police. The State contends that the jury could  reasonably infer from that evidence that Nelson took  possession with the intent to permanently deprive P.K.  of the vehicle. For that proposition, the State relies on  State v. Rosewall, 239 N.W.2d 171, 173 (Iowa 1976)  (noting ""unexplained possession of recently stolen  property  justifies  an  inference  of  guilt  of  the  possessor""). Trouble is, the charge in Rosewall was  larceny of a motor vehicle under the 1975 criminal code.  See Iowa Code § 321.82 (1975) (imposing punishment  ""if any person steal, take and carry away, irrespective of  value, any motor vehicle""). Rosewall was convicted of  operating without the owner's consent. 239 N.W.2d at  172 (citing Iowa Code § 321.76). Neither statute  required the State to prove an intent to permanently  deprive. Id. As Nelson argues, under Schminkey and  Morris, the jurors could not infer from Larson's act of  taking the car without [*7]  P.K.'s permission that Larson  had the requisite intent. The State also argues that Nelson ""had no car . . . no  money, and was trying to leave Iowa."" Those  circumstances, according to the State, supported a  finding  that  Nelson  had  the  specific  intent  to  permanently deprive P.K. of his vehicle at the time of  the taking. The State reasons that the fact that Nelson         abandoned the vehicle does not negate the intent he  had at the time of the taking. That may be true, but  neither is abandonment ""indicative of the requisite  intent."" Morris, 677 N.W.2d at 788. The State next ventures that P.K. ""lost the value or  benefit of the property because he did not have his car  when he needed it to leave work."" But that clipped  reading of the definition of permanent deprivation  ignores the references to ""an extended period of time""  and disposal of property ""under such circumstances as  to render it unlikely that the owner will recover the  property."" Using a GPS tracking device, P.K. found his  car just six blocks from the hospital. True, the car was  taken from the parking lot between four and six hours  before P.K. noticed it missing. But the record does not  show how long Nelson possessed it. Nelson testified  that he stopped pushing [*8]  when he realized he  ""couldn't get to a comfortable spot where [he] felt like  [he] would be safe."" His testimony, like his acts and the  attending circumstances, fail to show an intent to  permanently deprive. See State v. Fuentes, No. 03- 0426, 2004 WL 1854103, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App. July 28,  2004) (finding Fuentes's testimony that he did not intend  to keep another man's van, combined with the fact that it  was not driven far and was found the same night it was  taken, undermined the State's proof of an intent). But the State emphasizes that the jury was free to reject  Nelson's testimony. See State v. Shanahan, 712  N.W.2d 121, 135 (Iowa 2006). Indeed, the jury had that  freedom. Yet, even without Nelson's testimony, the  evidence did not support the State's theory that he took  the car to leave Iowa. Nelson had no key nor other  means to operate the vehicle. The jury could not  reasonably infer that Nelson planned to push the car out  of state from Sheldon. Even viewing the evidence in the  light most favorable to the State, these facts do not  allow a reasonable factfinder to infer that Nelson had  the specific intent to permanently deprive P.K. of his  vehicle. Under these circumstances, we reverse  Nelson's theft conviction and remand for entry of  judgment of acquittal. REVERSED AND REMANDED.",0
"United States v. Barnes, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175516","DECISION AND ORDER Defendant Andre L. Barnes (""Barnes"") has been indicted in a Superseding Indictment involving federal sex  trafficking offenses. Barnes has gone through several appointed lawyers, who have not been to his liking, and he  is now proceeding pro se. Prior assigned counsel had requested a competency examination and Barnes was eventually transferred to the  Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago, Illinois for that examination. On or about January 6, 2017, the Court  received the report of the competency examination which found that Barnes was competent to proceed to trial. The  parties did not object to that finding and this Court affirmed Magistrate Judge Feldman's Report and  Recommendation concluding that Barnes was competent to stand trial.    Page 2 of 5   Trial on this case [*2]  is currently scheduled for November 5, 2018. The Court has conducted several court  proceedings relating to status and in each instance, Barnes has repeated his request to proceed pro se, and, in  fact, has requested the Court vacate the order appointing attorney Vacca as standby counsel. This Court declined  to do so. This Court referred all pretrial motions to United States Magistrate Judge Jonathan W. Feldman pursuant to 28  U.S.C. § 636. Pending before the Court is Magistrate Judge Feldman's thorough 50-page Report and  Recommendation which recommends that this Court deny the several pro se motions that have been filed by  Barnes. (Dkt. #115). Although untimely, Barnes has filed a pro se document of 147 pages, plus attachments (Dkt.  #132) which he describes as the Defense Objection to Magistrate Judge Feldman's Report and Recommendation. During the course of the proceedings, Barnes was clear and adamant that he wished his attorneys' motions to be  withdrawn and that the Court focus on his pro se motions. In fact, Barnes over the course of the pendency of this  Indictment, has filed six separate pro se motions (Dkt. ##90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 107). Magistrate Judge Feldman has  painstakingly reviewed all the [*3]  motions which are often ambiguous and hardly models of clarity. Nonetheless,  Magistrate Judge Feldman has undertaken the task and ruled on each of the pending motions. I have reviewed the Report and Recommendation, the filings submitted to the Magistrate Judge, as well as  Barnes's Objection (Dkt. #132) to the Report and Recommendation. I agree with the Magistrate Judge's analysis as to both the facts and the law and I find no basis to alter, modify or  reverse the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation. Therefore, I agree with that recommendation and  deny all of Barnes's motions. As to certain matters of trial procedure, the Magistrate Judge did direct that the Government turn over certain  material two weeks prior to trial or at the pretrial conference, whichever is sooner. I will discuss Barnes's spate of motions, seriatim, as did Magistrate Judge Feldman. Document #92 — Motion to Dismiss for Violation of the Speedy Trial Act Barnes contends that his statutory speedy trial rights have been violated by delay. Magistrate Judge Feldman  carefully recounted the calendar of events in this case and noted several matters constituting excludable time. The  principal exclusion was the time necessary [*4]  to complete the competency examination for Barnes. Although that  proceeding took perhaps a bit longer than desired because of confusion in transporting Barnes, the delay was not  excessive and not purposeful. In relying on United States v. Vasquez, 918 F.2d 329, 333 (2d Cir. 1990), the  Magistrate Judge found, and I agree, that the delay on this case in completing the competency examination must  be excluded under the statutory speedy trial timetable. In addition, the Magistrate Judge noted that a co-defendant in this case (who has now pleaded guilty) had filed  motions and, under the statute, that time is also tolled. In addition, the docket sheet contains numerous references  to requests by Barnes's then court-appointed counsel for additional time to review the filings and the voluntary  discovery that had been provided by the Government. All of that time was properly excluded under the speedy trial  calculations. In addition, Magistrate Judge Feldman determined that there was no constitutional Sixth Amendment violation: the  delay was not untimely and there were no extraordinary factors warranting dismissal under the Sixth Amendment. Finally, I agree with Magistrate Judge Feldman's conclusion that Barnes suffered no prejudice from the delay here;  in fact, much of the delay was [*5]  for his benefit as his counsel took steps to review the necessary material, and  for completion of the competency report.  2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175516, *1 Page 3 of 5   Barnes makes several other claims in the motion, and in his Objection to the Report and Recommendation which  he believes support his claim that there has been a Speedy Trial Act violation. I have reviewed them all and none  have merit. Barnes claims that there was delay as the Magistrate Judge failed to issue a scheduling order; that the  competency examination order was punitive and that there was some type of violation because he was transferred  to a facility in another state (Illinois). None of these concerns are factually accurate and none have merit. Barnes also complains as he did vigorously during his appearance in front of Magistrate Judge Feldman that he  was denied a preliminary hearing. It is clear that such a hearing was scheduled but the grand jury returned an  indictment prior to the date of the hearing. The purpose of a preliminary hearing, as noted by the Magistrate Judge,  is to determine whether there is probable cause to continue to hold the defendant. The law is well established in the  Second Circuit and the United States Supreme Court that the return [*6]  of an indictment conclusively establishes  probable cause and therefore there is no basis or purpose for a preliminary hearing. Defendant's rights were not  violated. I have considered the other claims by Barnes in this motion, as well as his objections and find none to be  of merit. Document #91 — Motion to Dismiss: Lack of Jurisdiction Barnes has made this claim concerning lack of jurisdiction both orally before the Magistrate Judge in his motion and  again in his document objecting to the Report and Recommendation. The motion has no merit. Barnes appears to  contend that this Federal Court does not have jurisdiction and the Government may not maintain the action. The jurisdiction of this Court to try the charges in the Superseding Indictment is very clear. Article III of the  Constitution provides that ""[t]he judicial Power shall extend to all Cases in Law and Equity arising ... under the Laws  of the United States,"" U.S. Const. Art. III, § 2. Also, 18 U.S.C. § 3231 grants jurisdiction to the federal courts to try charges involving federal crimes: ""The district  courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of all offenses  against the laws of the United States."" The broad grant of subject-matter jurisdiction [*7]  is valid and enforceable,  and the courts have thus uniformly rejected challenges to it."" Soler v. U.S., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189804, 2015 WL  4879170, at *13 (SDNY Aug. 14, 2015) (citing cases). Barnes is charged here with violating 18 U.S.C. Section 1591(a) and Section 2421(a). These deal with sex  trafficking. Apparently, Barnes contends that this Section is not a valid exercise of Congress' commerce clause  authority or, alternatively, that is the action did not affect interstate commerce. The Magistrate Judge carefully discussed the broad commerce clause powers under the United States Constitution  and set forth overwhelming authority that the criminal statutes at issue are well within the commerce clause power  granted to Congress. It is clear without doubt that the United States had valid authority to prosecute this action. The  United States Government has prosecuted hundreds of cases under this particular statute and others. Barnes's  arguments have no merit. It is true that the acts must have some affect on interstate commerce. The Indictment here is facially valid. The  effect on interstate commerce is one of the elements that the Government will need to establish at the trial. It is not  something to be resolved at this time. The law is clear however, that the affect on interstate commerce need only be  minimal and the Court has careful instructions to [*8]  explain that to the jury at trial. I have considered the other  parts of this motion, as well as Barnes's objection and find none that warrant changing the Magistrate Judge's  decision. Document #94 — Motion to Conduct a Franks Hearing The Magistrate Judge determined, correctly, that there was no basis to conduct a hearing pursuant to authority of  Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1978). 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175516, *5 Page 4 of 5   Barnes has failed to make the necessary substantial preliminary showing that there were any inaccuracies in the  affidavit establishing probable cause to arrest. There was no demonstration of any deliberate falsehood or reckless  disregard for the truth. None of the matters raised had any substantial bearing on the arrest of Barnes and, as noted  by the Magistrate Judge, the fact that the grand jury later returned an Indictment by itself is sufficient probable  cause to bring Barnes before the Court for trial. There is no merit to this request. Document #93 — Motion for Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction Barnes cites numerous cases and legal principles but virtually all have nothing to do with this case. For instance,  Barnes cites cases involving personal jurisdiction, standing and minimal contacts in cases such as Pennoyer v.  Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 24 L. Ed. 565 (1877). These cases, however, have nothing [*9]  to do with criminal prosecutions.  They relate to civil actions and civil procedures and are irrelevant to the case here. Barnes also has made the following argument repeatedly: the Indictment should be dismissed because the crime  did not take place ""within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States."" This argument has  been made by Barnes orally before the Magistrate Judge, before this Court and in his papers. As the Magistrate  Judge patiently noted, 18 U.S.C. Section 1591(a) makes it a crime to traffic in minors in two different ""places"": on  land in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or WITHIN THE SPECIAL MARITIME AND TERRITORIAL  JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES. The statute clearly is written in an either/or formula with is routine in  criminal statutes. The Government does not contend in any way that any of the acts involving Mr. Barnes and the  women he allegedly prostituted were engaged in such activities in the maritime jurisdiction of the United States.  This is not a maritime case: it never was and never has been. Defendant's motion and contention otherwise is  without merit. The Magistrate Judge correctly denied the motion. Document #90 — Defendant's Omnibus Motion  [*10] In this motion, Barnes sets forth a lengthy list of requested items. Magistrate Judge Feldman dealt with each  of them and except for certain matters relating to trial preparation and matters to be determined at the pretrial  conference, the Magistrate Judge denied all motions. For example, defendant requested immediate release from  custody based on violations of the Speedy Trial Act. He also requested leave to inspect the grand jury minutes, but  as the Magistrate Judge pointed out, review of such minutes is rarely permitted without a specific factual allegation  of Government misconduct. There is no such allegation whatsoever here. In addition, Barnes seeks a Bill of Particulars. Magistrate Judge Feldman, after careful review, determined that the  Superseding Indictment provided Barnes with ample information regarding the alleged criminal acts, including the  initials of the victims. A Bill of Particulars is not meant to provide evidentiary material. The Magistrate Judge  determined that considering the specificity of the Superseding Indictment, and the sheer volume of voluntary  discovery that has been provided to Barnes by the Government including, most recently, the name of the young  woman [*11]  that Barnes allegedly prostituted, there is no basis for any Bill of Particulars here. In this motion also, Barnes once again seeks dismissal for lack of jurisdiction but none of the claims advanced by  Barnes have any merit and have all been resolved previously by Magistrate Judge Feldman in his ruling on the prior  motions. Barnes did request a list of any Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) material that the Government intended to utilize  and the Government was directed that such information be turned over two weeks prior to trial or at the pretrial  conference, whichever is earlier. Barnes also requested an order compelling Government witnesses to be interviewed by him. Barnes is now and will  remain in jail pending trial. A defendant has no right to compel a witness to consent to an interview. Barnes's motion  in this regard makes reference to his ""counsel"" being involved but Barnes had repeatedly and recently direct that  this Court vacate the appointment of stand-by counsel and apparently wishes to have no contact with him. 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175516, *8 Page 5 of 5   Barnes also seeks to join in motions by his co-defendant, but that request is denied as moot. That defendant,  Johnson, is no longer in the case, has pleaded guilty and he may testify against Barnes [*12]  at trial. Document #107 — Defendant's Reply to Government's Response Magistrate Judge Feldman notes that this motion is over 80 pages long and ""recites lengthy, rambling arguments  about jurisdiction and procedural violations."" (Dkt. #115, p.44). Once again, as the Magistrate Judge noted, this motion repeats many of the arguments made by Barnes and they  all relate generally to civil matters involving personal jurisdiction, minimum contacts and subject matter jurisdiction.  None of the cases and arguments submitted by Barnes have any bearing on this criminal proceeding. Barnes also questions venue, but the Indictment states and the Magistrate Judge noted that acts here involved sex  trafficking activity that occurred in the Western District of New York. Barnes also makes arguments concerning the  interstate agreement on detainers and once again alleges a speedy trial violation, all of which were decided by  Magistrate Judge Feldman relating to earlier motions filed by the defendant.",1
"Bell v. United States, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 221285","ORDER Movant Johnelle Lewis Bell, now represented by counsel, moves to vacate, set aside, or his correct sentence  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Section 2255 Mot'n, ECF No. 1. In addition to the proceedings in the criminal case,  United States v. Bell, 1:12-cr-00027-JEG (""Crim. Case""), the Court has reviewed Bell's motion, his pro se brief, the  Government's resistance to the § 2255 motion, as well as Bell's reply. The motion is ready for ruling, and for the  following reasons, the Court must deny all of Bell's claims for section 2255 relief, dismiss this case, and deny a  Certificate of Appealability. Page 2 of 6   I. BACKGROUND Bell was charged and convicted of conspiracy [*2]  to commit sex trafficking or to knowingly benefit from sex  trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a)(2) and 1594 (Count 1); two counts of sex trafficking in violation of  18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a)(1), 1591(a)(2), 1591(e)(2), and 1591(b)(1) (Counts 2 and 3); four counts of coercion and  enticement to travel in interstate commerce for prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422(a) and (b) (Counts 4  through 7); conspiracy to engage in interstate transportation for prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 (Count  8); and four counts of interstate transportation for prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2421 (Counts 9 through  12). Crim. Case, Jury Verdict, ECF No. 128. The Court denied Bell's motion for new trial. Id., Order June 19, 2013,  ECF No. 200. The Court of Appeals affirmed. United States v. Bell, 761 F.3d 900 (8th Cir.), cert denied, 135 S. Ct.  503, 190 L. Ed. 2d 378 (2014). This § 2255 motion followed. In his § 2255 motion, Bell argues that his trial counsel provided him constitutionally  ineffective assistance by failing to do the following: (1) interview and present witness T.A.; (2) challenge the search  of room 201 at the Town House Inn and Suites in Omaha, Nebraska; (3) challenge a statement by the prosecutor  during closing argument; (4) request a jury instruction for his theory of defense; (5) challenge the vulnerable victim  enhancement under the sentencing guidelines; and (6) request a jury [*3]  instruction for a lesser included offense.  Section 2255 Mot'n 4-10. II. DISCUSSION All of Bell's claims focus on trial counsel's alleged ineffective assistance. To obtain relief on a claim of ineffective  assistance under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant must show counsel's performance was professionally  unreasonable and that he was prejudiced by it. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 694, 104 S. Ct. 2052,  80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984) (ineffective assistance of counsel standard). Except for certain errors that are presumed  prejudicial that do not apply in Bell's case, to show he was prejudiced Bell must show a reasonable probability that,  but for the deficient performance, the outcome of his criminal proceeding would have been different. Id. at 694. ""A  reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome."" Id. at 694. A movant must  demonstrate both cause and prejudice, and there is no need for a court ""to address both components of the inquiry  if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one."" Id. at 697. A. Closing Argument and Jury Instructions Bell's § 2255 motion referred to a memorandum, but none was attached to the motion. The pro se memorandum  Bell did submit does not address his claims regarding the prosecutor's closing argument, theory of defense, or  lesser included jury instruction. Mov't's [*4]  Br., ECF No. 6. The reply that counsel for Bell submitted also does not  address those three claims for relief. Mov't's Reply, ECF No. 13. Bell's trial counsel submitted an affidavit stating  that the alleged prosecutorial misconduct claim is too vague for him to provide a response; that their theory of  defense was based on insufficiency of the evidence and the marshalling instructions provided an adequate base to  make their arguments; and that the lesser included offenses were charged as separate counts, so counsel's  strategy was to encourage the jury to convict on the lesser offenses rather than the more serious offenses. Burns  Aff. ¶¶ 3, 4, 6, ECF No. 7. Neither Bell's § 2255 motion nor his later filings provide any factual basis for his claims that counsel provided  ineffective assistance regarding the closing argument or jury instructions. When filing a § 2255 motion, a movant  must, among the things, ""state the facts supporting each ground."" Rule 2(b)(2) of the Rules Governing Section 2255  Proceedings for the U.S. District Courts. Bell's conclusory allegations are insufficient to satisfy Rule 2(b)(2). His  claims are also ""insufficient to rebut the strong presumption of counsel's competence."" Estes v. United States, 883  F.2d 645, 647 (8th Cir. 1989) (""[Movant's] section 2255 motion alleged, without elaboration, that his counsel  'rendered a lot of misadvice.'"") (alteration [*5]  added); cf. Saunders v. United States, 236 F.3d 950, 953 (8th Cir.  Page 3 of 6   2001) (movant ""cannot show prejudice from the failure to call his unidentified witnesses . . . Because [movant]  made no showing of what other witnesses were available, how they would have testified, and why such additional  evidence would likely have affected the result, he has failed to prove either that counsel's assistance was ineffective  or prejudice."") (alteration added, citation and quotation marks omitted). Consequently, Bell's claims regarding the  closing argument and jury instructions cannot be a basis for § 2255 relief. The Court will not address them further. B. Witness Testimony Bell claims that his trial counsel should have presented the testimony of T.A. because T.A. could have impeached  the testimony of Sabra Addison (""Addison"") that Bell forced Addison to perform commercial sex acts at Bell's  direction. In this § 2255 action, trial counsel submitted an affidavit that he had not considered contacting T.A. to  testify, that he was unsure if his investigator would have been able to locate and interview T.A., that in hindsight he  would have asked his investigator to attempt to find T.A., and that her testimony would have been helpful at trial if it  was consistent with what T.A. [*6]  said after trial. Burns Aff. ¶ 3. Counsel averred, ""The one aspect of the  government's case with which we had the most difficulty, however, was evidence concerning Sabra Addison.  [T.A.]'s testimony would have given me something to argue with respect to Sabra Addison."" Id. Although not in the same procedural or legal posture, the Court previously addressed T.A.'s proposed testimony in  the context of Bell's request for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence under Federal Rule of Criminal  Procedure 33. Order June 19, 2013, at 36-41. To establish he was prejudiced under the Sixth Amendment, Bell  must show there is reasonable probability that, but for counsel's performance, the outcome of the proceeding would  have been different. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, 694. This standard is not as demanding as the outcome  determinative standard at issue in a claim of newly discovered evidence. Id. at 694. ""The difference, however,  should alter the merit of an ineffectiveness claim only in the rarest case."" Id. at 697. Thus, the Court determines it is  helpful to review its previous examination of T.A.'s testimony in the context of a motion for new trial as the Court  assesses whether Bell can establish that counsel's performance was prejudicial under the Sixth Amendment. According to T.A., Addison willingly participated [*7]  in the prostitution venture without any force or coercion  from Bell. Order June 19, 2013, at 39. In denying Bell's request for a new trial, the Court determined that although  the evidence was material, Bell failed to prove the other four Rule 33 requirements, namely, that the evidence was  newly discovered, that Bell acted diligently in obtaining it, that the evidence was more than merely cumulative or  impeaching, and that the evidence would probably produce an acquittal. Id. at 36-41. The Court of Appeals affirmed  on the grounds that Bell failed to show he was diligent in locating T.A. Bell, 761 F.3d at 911. Its decision did not  address the Court's other grounds for denying the motion for new trial. Id. This Court determined that T.A.'s testimony was ""merely cumulative or impeaching of Addison and [Brittany]  Lawson's testimony regarding whether Defendant forced Addison to perform commercial sex acts at his  discretion."" Order June 19, 2013, at 39 (alteration added). The Court pointed out that T.A. could have impeached  Addison's testimony ""within regard to Addison's intent when she joined the group and whether she went out on calls  in Texarkana."" The Court then contrasted T.A.'s testimony with the evidence regarding events [*8]  when T.A. was  not present: However, because T.A. was not present after the group left Texarkana, T.A. would be unable to refute  Addison's testimony about any threats Defendant made to Addison when the two of them were alone. Addison  testified that those threats by Defendant were the only reason she engaged in commercial sex acts for  Defendant's benefit. Additionally, T.A.'s testimony would not change any of the evidence regarding Defendant's  abuse of [Jennifer] Olewnik, which offers a separate avenue through which the jury could reasonably have  found Defendant guilty of Counts 1 through 7. Nothing in T.A.'s proffered testimony would exculpate  Defendant, as her testimony is limited to countering her sister's testimony on two narrow issues. Id. at 39-40 (alteration added). The Court further explained: Page 4 of 6   Even if the jury were to believe T.A.'s proffered testimony, she was only with Addison and the rest of the group  for a few days, and she was never present when Addison was threatened by Defendant. She was also not  present when Addison was in Des Moines, where Addison testified she engaged in commercial sex acts for  the first time out of fear of the Defendant. Further, Counts 1 through 7 could have been [*9]  satisfied by the  jury finding that Defendant forced or coerced Olewnik to commit commercial sex acts as well as to travel in  interstate commerce for prostitution, making in unnecessary for the jury to determine whether Addison  participated as a prostitute willingly or due to Defendant's threats. Thus, even if Addison's story is disbelieved  in favor of T.A.'s version of the events, the jury still could have reasonably found Defendant guilty of Counts 1  through 7. Defendant has therefore failed to prove that the addition of T.A.'s alleged testimony would have  probably produced an acquittal on Counts 1 through 7. Id. at 40-41. When Bell challenged the sufficiency of the evidence against him on direct appeal, the Court of  Appeals rejected his claim, and it particularly pointed to the evidence from Addison as support for his conviction: Sabra's unrefuted testimony demonstrated that Bell forced her to act as a prostitute for his pecuniary gain. He  threatened to harm her and her two-year-old child. He confiscated her cell phone to isolate her from friends and  family. FBI agents described Sabra as weeping, shaking, and curled into a fetal position after the Omaha raid,  corroborating Sabra's testimony that [*10]  she feared for her and her child's safety should law enforcement  catch Bell. Bell, 761 F.3d at 909. After careful review of the evidence, this Court concludes that if counsel had presented T.A.'s additional testimony  to the jury, there is not a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different. Even if T.A.  could impeach Addison's testimony regarding her reasons for joining Bell's prostitution group, T.A.'s testimony did  not have a significant impact on Addison's testimony about events after T.A. left, or events while Addison was alone  with Bell, or on the corroborating testimony of law enforcement officers who witnessed Addison's behavior. Bell  cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different if T.A. had  testified. Bell's claim regarding T.A.'s testimony does not undermine confidence in the outcome of trial. Strickland,  466 U.S. at 687, 694. Because Bell cannot demonstrate he was prejudiced by counsel's performance regarding  T.A.'s testimony, this Sixth Amendment claim must be dismissed. Id. at 697 (""If it is easier to dispose of an  ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice, which we expect will often be so, that course  should be followed.). C. Motion to Suppress [*11]  Bell claims that his trial counsel should have moved to suppress evidence taken from the room where he was  staying, room 201 at the Town House Inn and Suites Hotel, because officers illegally entered his room. Bell's trial  counsel stated that he did not consider filing a motion to suppress based on the analysis Bell sets out in his pro se  memorandum. Burns Aff. ¶ 2. If counsel had filed such a motion, it would have failed. During an investigation into prostitution rings, Special  Agent Brian Getson (SA Getson) responded to an advertisement for prostitution services on a ""Backpage""  website, and he made an appointment to meet Olewnik at the Town House Inn and Suites Hotel. Order June 19,  2013, at 6. When SA Getson arrived at the hotel, he encountered Bell, who instructed SA Getson to go to room  202. Id. Bell told Getson ""that it was kind of a suite of rooms, that [he] had to open the outside door to knock on the  inside door . . . ."" Crim. Case, Trial Tr. 63, ECF No. 145. SA Getson explained ""[t]he exterior doors look like hotel  doors, but they open into a vestibule where there's two--multiple doors, at least two doors, so kind of like a suite of  rooms inside the exterior of what looks like [*12]  just a hotel room door."" Id. at 64. SA Getson then met the woman  advertised on the website, they arranged the details of the commercial sex act, and SA Getson placed money for  the transaction on the dresser. Id. at 65. SA Getson then signaled other officers, who raided the operation. Id. There  were three females present in rooms 201 and 202, and they were separated for interviews. Id. at 66. Another  officer, Special Agent Arthur Roche (SA Roche), saw Bell leave room 201. Id. at 73. SA Roche announced he was  Page 5 of 6   a law enforcement officer, detained Bell, and frisked him for weapons and contraband. Id. Roche read Bell his rights  under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), and Bell agreed to talk with  agents. Id. Bell told Roche the motel rooms were in his girlfriend's name, referring to Lawson. Id. at 74. SA Getson  did not illegally enter room 202 but instead was invited in as a customer. As soon as officers made the arrest for  illegal activity, Bell was stopped from leaving the suite of rooms and agreed to talk. Any Fourth Amendment claim  would have been meritless. See Steagald v. United States, 451 U.S. 204, 211, 101 S. Ct. 1642, 68 L. Ed. 2d 38  (1981) (warrant is required ""in the absence of consent or exigent circumstances""); Maryland v. Pringle, 540 U.S.  366, 370, 124 S. Ct. 795, 157 L. Ed. 2d 769 (2003) (""A warrantless arrest of an individual in a public place for a  felony, or a misdemeanor committed in the officer's presence, is consistent [*13]  with the Fourth Amendment if the  arrest is supported by probable cause.""). Bell complains the women revealed evidence about the ""Backpage"" internet postings. Movant's Memo. 10-11; Crim.  Case Trial Tr. 135-36, 300. But Bell had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the website passwords that he  shared with third parties, who then provided them to law enforcement officers. See United States v. Miller, 425 U.S.  435, 443, 96 S. Ct. 1619, 48 L. Ed. 2d 71 (1976) (""the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of  information revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to Government authorities, even if the information is  revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose and the confidence placed in the third  party will not be betrayed""). Counsel cannot be ineffective for failing to raise a meritless claim. See Thomas v.  United States, 951 F.2d 902, 905 (8th Cir. 1991) (per curiam) (""Counsel's failure to raise these meritless issues  does not constitute ineffective assistance.""). Bell's claim that counsel should have filed a motion to suppress must  be denied. D. Vulnerable Victim Enhancement Bell claims his trial counsel should have challenged the vulnerable victim enhancement he received under the  sentencing guidelines. To establish ineffective assistance in the context of Bell's sentence, he ""must demonstrate a  reasonable probability [*14]  that his sentence would have been different but for the deficient performance."" Jeffries  v. United States, 721 F.3d 1008, 1014 (8th Cir. 2013) (citing Puckett v. United States, 556 U.S. 129, 142 n.4, 129 S.  Ct. 1423, 173 L. Ed. 2d 266 (2009)). Counsel for Bell did object to the vulnerable victim enhancements. Crim. Case Def.'s Sent. Memo., ECF No. 187;  Crim. Case, Sent. Tr. 4, ECF No. 211. The Court rejected Bell's objection. Crim. Case, Sent. Tr. 6-7, 23.  ""Reasonable trial strategy does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel simply because it is not successful.""  James v. Iowa, 100 F.3d 586, 590 (8th Cir. 1996). Moreover, if counsel had raised the arguments Bell now asserts,  the outcome of the proceeding would not have been different, therefore Bell cannot show he was prejudiced by  counsel's performance. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, 694. Bell's claim regarding the vulnerable victim  enhancement is without merit. III. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY Pursuant to Rule 11(a) of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings in the United States Courts, the Court  must issue or deny a Certificate of Appealability when it enters a final order adverse to the Movant. District Courts  have the authority to issue certificates of appealability under 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c) and Fed. R. App. P. 22(b). A  certificate of appealability may issue only if Movant ""has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional  right."" 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2). A substantial showing is a showing ""that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or,  for that matter, agree that) [*15]  the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues  presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further."" Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336,  123 S. Ct. 1029, 154 L. Ed. 2d 931 (2003) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Movant Bell has not  made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right for any of his claims. Consequently, no Certificate  of Appealability will issue in this case. He may request issuance of a Certificate of Appealability by a judge on the  Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. See Fed. R. App. P. 22(b). Page 6 of 6   IV. SUMMARY The Court has carefully reviewed the motion brought under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, the pleadings and additional  evidence in this section 2255 action, and the record of the prior proceedings in the criminal case. Based on its  review, the Court concludes that Johnelle Lewis Bell has not shown that counsel provided constitutionally ineffective  assistance in any respect, and he has not shown that he is in custody under a judgment that violates the  Constitution or any law of the United States, that the Court lacked jurisdiction to enter the judgment against him,  that the sentence exceeded the maximum authorized by law, or that the judgment and sentence are otherwise  subject to collateral review. See 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a), (b). Accordingly, the Court [*16]  must deny the Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence, brought under 28  U.S.C. § 2255. ECF No. 1. The case is dismissed. A Certificate of Appealability is denied. Bell may request issuance of a Certificate of Appealability by a judge on the  Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. See Fed. R. App. P. 22(b). IT IS SO ORDERED.

"United States v. Bhula, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2826","MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER Page 2 of 4   This matter is before the Court on Defendants' Opposed Motion in Limine, in which Defendants move under Fed. R.  Evid. 412 for unrestricted cross-examination into the alleged victims' prior prostitution histories. See Doc. 135.  The Court, having carefully considered the motion, arguments of the parties, and relevant law, concludes that  Defendants' request to introduce evidence of the alleged victims' prior prostitution activities is denied. DISCUSSION Defendants request a pre-trial ruling that would allow them to elicit testimony that Jane Does 1, 2, and 3 had  voluntarily engaged in prostitution prior to the charging period in the indictment. Defendants argue that exclusion  of this evidence would violate their rights under the Confrontation Clause ""to be confronted with the witnesses  against [them]."" U.S. CONST. amend. VI. The Government responds in opposition that the evidence violates Rule  412 and is immaterial and irrelevant. a. Rule 412 Legal Standard ""Rule 412 establishes the federal 'rape [*3]  shield' provision, whereby in proceedings involving alleged sexual  misconduct, the admission of evidence concerning the victim's past sexual behavior or sexual predisposition is  generally prohibited."" United States v. Powell, 226 F.3d 1181, 1196-97 (10th Cir. 2000). The purpose of Rule 412 is  ""to safeguard the alleged victim against the invasion of privacy, potential embarrassment and sexual stereotyping  that is associated with public disclosure of intimate sexual details and the infusion of sexual innuendo into the  factfinding process."" Fed. R. Evid. 412 advisory committee's note to 1994 amendment. ""The rule pits against each  other two exceedingly important values—the need to safeguard the alleged [sexual assault] victim against the  invasion of privacy, potential embarrassment and sexual stereotyping that is associated with public disclosure of  intimate sexual details, and the need to ensure that criminal defendants receive fair trials."" United States v. A.S.,  939 F.3d 1063, 1071 (10th Cir. 2019) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original). Rule 412 has an exception in criminal cases in which evidence of specific instances of a victim's sexual behavior  may be admitted ""if offered to prove that someone other than the defendant was the source of semen, injury, or  other physical evidence;"" ""if offered by the [*4]  defendant to prove consent"" with respect to the person accused of  the crime; or if the exclusion of the evidence ""would violate the defendant's constitutional rights."" Fed. R. Evid.  412(b). b. Analysis In their motion in limine, Defendants move for ""unrestricted"" cross-examination into Jane Does 1, 2, and 3's prior  acts of prostitutions under Federal Rule of Evidence 412(b). Doc. 135 at 6. The Rule 412 exception relied on by  Defendants allows for the admission of ""evidence whose exclusion would violate the defendant's constitutional  rights,"" Fed. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C), namely Defendants' right under the Sixth Amendment to confront the witnesses  against them, which is a constitutional right contemplated by the Rule's exception. See A.S., 939 F.3d at 1072  (""[e]vidence adduced by cross-examination concerning prior sexual intercourse may be required to be admitted by          2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2826, *2 Page 3 of 4   Confrontation Clause rights where relevant and probative on a central issue of sexual offense charges."") (emphasis  in original). The Defendants have vehemently argued before the Court that the exclusion of such evidence or the restriction of  such cross-examination would eviscerate their primary theory of the case — that the Jane Doe victims were not  victims of sex trafficking but were instead engaged in consensual prostitution. According to Defendants, the  terms ""recruit"" [*5]  and ""entice"" as used in 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a), suggests the alleged victims in this case ""were  asked to do something they had not done before."" Doc. 135 at 7. Defendants argue that cross-examination of the  alleged victims concerning their prior prostitution history will shed light on whether they came to the motel willfully  or were brought there by another trafficker, whether they previously knew Defendants and if they initiated contact  with Defendants, and whether they used and advertised escort services. See id. at 8. The Government objects to the presentation of any evidence of prior prostitution by the alleged victims,  contending that such evidence constitutes ""other sexual behavior"" or ""sexual predisposition"" within the meaning of  Rule 412(a). Doc. 141 at 6 (citing United States v. Valenzuela, 495 F. App'x 817, 819 (9th Cir. 2012) (""We are  willing to assume that Federal Rule of Evidence 412 applies to sex trafficking prosecutions."")). It also argues that  the evidence is irrelevant because it has no bearing on the statutory elements of the crime and that Defendants  ""muddy the waters by inferring"" a causation requirement that does not exist. Id. at 9. While the Court certainly understands the constitutional concerns that arise when the cross-examination of a  government witness in a [*6]  criminal case is inhibited or restricted, the Court concludes that Defendants' request  for cross-examination into the victims' alleged prior prostitution is squarely foreclosed by binding Tenth Circuit  precedent. In United States v. Palms, 21 F.4th 689, 703 (10th Cir. 2021), the Tenth Circuit rejected the same  argument that Defendants make in this case — namely, that evidence of a victim's prior commercial sex work or  prostitution should be allowed because it is relevant to countering the allegation that a defendant engaged in sex  trafficking of the alleged victim, including allegations of ""entic[ing] or recruit[ing]"" a victim. Id. at 703. As the Court  explained, although pursuant to the Confrontation Clause and the Due Process Clause, sexual behavior evidence  must be admitted where relevant, it ""must also be probative of a central issue to be required by the Constitution."" Id.  (emphasis added). The focus on the sex trafficking statute is whether ""means of force, threats of force, fraud,  [and] coercion"" were used to ""cause [a] person to engage in a commercial sex act."" Id. (quoting 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a)) (alteration in original). Thus, concluded the Court, ""[e]vidence that a sex trafficking victim previously  engaged in prostitution is irrelevant to whether that victim was forced or coerced into working as [*7]  a prostitute  at a later date."" Id.  Under the holding in Palms, this Court must conclude that the fact the alleged victims in this case may have  engaged in prostitution before the charged crimes does not suggest Defendants did not later coerce them into  commercial sex. See id. (excluding evidence that the victim had previously engaged in commercial sex acts and  knew about certain aspects of the commercial sex business before she met the defendant, including how to post  an advertisement for commercial sex because ""[e]ven if [the victim] participated in commercial sex work in 2017  and knew how to post ads for commercial sex, that does not tend to prove [the defendant] did not force her to  engage in prostitution during the period charged.""). As determined by the Tenth Circuit, such evidence is not            2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2826, *4 Page 4 of 4   relevant or probative of the issue raised in this case and would run afoul of Federal Rule of Evidence 412.  Defendants therefore may not introduce evidence of prior prostitution by the Jane Doe victims or cross-examine  the Jane Doe victims about any alleged work as prostitutes prior to the time of the alleged crimes in this case  because, as determined by the Tenth Circuit, such evidence is irrelevant to whether the [*8]  Jane Does were  victims of sex trafficking under 18 U.S.C. § 1591. In their motion, Defendants assert that they should at least be able to ""cross-examine the victim witnesses on  prostitution during the charged time period to show that they acted independently of the defendants or were being  trafficked by someone other than the defendants, or in a location apart from the Best Choice Inn."" Doc. 135 at 8.  The Court agrees and notes that its ruling does not preclude the defense from presenting evidence or argument  that the alleged victims in this case were engaged in consensual prostitution as opposed to being victims of sex  trafficking during the time the government alleges the Defendants violated 18 U.S.C. §1591 or conspired to do so. /s/ David Herrera Urias HON.

"People v. Calhoun, 2019 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 4592","INTRODUCTION John Wayne Calhoun recruited 13-year-old D.T. into prostitution, acted as her pimp, treated her violently, and  engaged in sex acts with her. A jury convicted him of human trafficking of a minor, pimping a minor under the age  Page 2 of 26   of 16, pandering a minor under the age of 16, lewd and lascivious acts on a child under the age of 14, unlawful  sexual intercourse, and oral copulation of a child under the age of 14. The jury found true an allegation that Calhoun  unlawfully used force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury in  committing the crime of human trafficking. The trial court sentenced him to 15 years to life in prison [*2]  with a  consecutive term of six years for one count of committing a lewd and lascivious act on a child under the age of 14  and a consecutive term of two years for another count of the same offense. We affirm. As to each of Calhoun's contentions, we conclude: (1) the trial court did not err by excluding evidence of  D.T.'s acts of prostitution occurring after Calhoun was placed in custody; (2) the evidence at the preliminary  hearing imparted notice to Calhoun of the factual basis for counts 6 and 7 sufficient to satisfy due process; (3)  venue in Orange County was proper; (4) the trial court did not err by admitting evidence of certain text messages;  (5) expert testimony on statements made by D.T. during a police interview and on the content of text messages was  admissible and any error was harmless; and (6) the trial court did stay execution of sentence on counts 2, 3, and 5  pursuant to Penal Code section 654. FACTS I. Calhoun Turns 13-Year-Old D.T. into a Prostitute. D.T. was born in October 2002. She was placed in foster homes or group homes beginning in October 2015  because her father physically and emotionally abused her and had a substance abuse problem. In May 2016, she  ran away from a group home in Victorville [*3]  and went with a friend to visit a man named Raymond, who  happened to be Calhoun's cousin. At Raymond's house, D.T. met Calhoun. She spent the night at Raymond's  house, and in the morning Calhoun gave D.T. and her friend a ride to a store. D.T. and Calhoun waited in the car  while her friend went inside the store. Calhoun asked D.T. how old she was. D.T. told him she was 21 years old. After returning to Raymond's house, D.T. and Calhoun talked for several hours. Calhoun said he was 30 years old.  He asked D.T. if she ""had ever made money before."" D.T. did not know what he was talking about and answered  no. Calhoun asked D.T. to go with him to the home of Anntaneisha Louie, whom Calhoun called ""Auntie,"" in San  Bernardino. D.T. agreed. When they arrived at Louie's house, D.T. waited in the car while Calhoun went inside.  Calhoun returned with women's clothing, which he said were for D.T. While at Louie's house Calhoun again asked  D.T. if she ""had ever made money."" When she asked what he meant, he asked her if she ""had ever slept with  people to get money."" She told him no. After spending several nights at Louie's house, Calhoun drove D.T. to Ontario, California, where he picked up two  women [*4]  at an apartment complex. Each woman carried a bag of clothing. Calhoun drove D.T. and the women  to a hotel in Los Angeles. The next morning, Calhoun told D.T. to get up and take a shower. When she got out of  the shower, some of the clothes the women had brought were laid out on the bed. Calhoun selected a dress and  told D.T. to put it on. D.T. did as she was told. Calhoun, along with D.T., took the two women back to Ontario. When  D.T. asked Calhoun who the women were, Calhoun said it was none of her business. Calhoun and D.T. returned to Louie's house, where Calhoun told D.T. he wanted to take photographs of her and  post them on Backpage, an online website for advertising prostitution services. D.T. did not want to do it, but she  was scared of what Calhoun might do if she said no, so she agreed. Calhoun took photographs of D.T. wearing  lingerie and posted the photographs on Backpage. D.T. did not object because she did not want Calhoun to believe  she did not want to do it. Page 3 of 26   About one hour later, Calhoun received a text message in response to the Backpage posting. He drove D.T. to a  house in San Bernardino to meet the customer. On the way, Calhoun gave her a price list for various sex [*5]  acts  and went over some of the rules of the trade. He gave D.T. a condom and told her to always use one. He asked her  to call him ""Daddy"" and told her to immediately delete any text messages they exchanged so the messages would  not be available if police ever looked through her phone. When they arrived, Calhoun parked down the street, said he would wait in the car, and told D.T. to text him when  she went inside. D.T. performed the requested sexual act and was paid $80. She did not want to do it but she did  not want Calhoun to be angry with her. She gave the money to Calhoun. Calhoun drove D.T. back to Louie's house, where D.T. was given some clothes. He then drove her to G Street,  known as a ""track"" or ""blade"" (an area frequented by prostitutes) in San Bernardino. Calhoun told her he was ""going  to put her down on G Street"" where she ""was to make money for him."" He gave D.T. three condoms, ordered her  out of the car, and told her to complete three sex acts and give the money to him. She did as she was told and  turned the money over to Calhoun. Calhoun and D.T. returned to Louie's house. Calhoun left and instructed D.T. to stay there until he returned. D.T.  did not want to be alone and [*6]  texted a friend named Michael. He picked up D.T. and took her to his house.  When D.T. arrived at Louie's house, Calhoun asked her where she went. She did not want to tell him the truth  because he had ordered her not to talk to any other African-American men (he had told her that any African- American man who tried to talk to her was likely another pimp). D.T. told Calhoun that she had gone to visit her  aunt. He accused her of lying and ordered her to go outside. D.T. and Calhoun left and got into his car. He punched  her in the left eye (giving her a black eye), and told her not to lie to him again. They spent the night at Louie's house  and had sexual intercourse with each other for the first time. Calhoun left Louie's house the next morning and again told D.T. to stay there until he got back. D.T. was angry with  Calhoun for leaving without saying where he was going. She sent a text message to her friend Markell Stewart and  asked him to come and get her. While D.T. was with Stewart, Calhoun sent her text messages instructing her to  return to Louie's house. D.T. sent a text message to Calhoun that she was staying with her aunt but she spent the  night with Stewart in Victorville. The next [*7]  day, Stewart dropped D.T. and another woman off along G Street.  D.T. walked G Street looking for customers so that she would have money to give Calhoun. II. D.T. Is Detained and Interviewed by Police Detectives. On May 10, 2016, San Bernardino Police Detective Kimberly Hernandez was driving a marked patrol car  westbound on 9th Street approaching G Street in the City of San Bernardino. She pulled over a vehicle driven by  Stewart because it had tinted windows. Hernandez searched the vehicle and found two cell phones in the center  console. One cell phone was a white HTC brand and the other was a black Vortex brand. Hernandez also found, in  the back seat of the car, women's clothing of the type typically worn by prostitutes in the area. Hernandez  confiscated the two cell phones. Once the traffic stop was concluded, Hernandez continued patrolling the area. While driving southbound on G  Street she saw a woman (K.V.), whom she recognized from an identification card found in Stewart's vehicle.  Hernandez also noticed that K.V. was walking with a very young girl whom Hernandez had not seen before. At trial,  Hernandez identified the young girl as D.T. Hernandez believed that K.V. and D.T. were working [*8]  as prostitutes  and made contact with them. D.T. identified herself by a false name and told Hernandez she was 20 years old. Hernandez observed D.T. had a  ZTE brand cell phone and two condoms sticking out of her back pocket. Hernandez placed D.T. in the back of the  Page 4 of 26   patrol car and took her to the police station. While in the patrol car, D.T. revealed her true name and age and stated  she had run away from a group home. At the police station, Hernandez and a sheriff's deputy interviewed D.T. for over five hours. During the interview,  D.T. identified Calhoun as her pimp and said she had been working for him for several months. She said Calhoun  had driven her to several blades in San Bernardino and Orange County to work as a prostitute for him. She had  been with Calhoun the previous day, but had left him and took his cell phones with her. Stewart had driven D.T. and  K.V. to San Bernardino that day. D.T. said Calhoun had ""laid his hands on her"" many times, recently had ""socked  her in the jaw,"" and was mean to her and did not respect her. Calhoun expected her to earn $500 to $600 in San  Bernardino and $900 in Orange County and if she did not make her ""trap"" (quota), Calhoun would ""whoop her [*9]   ass."" Calhoun would apologize after striking D.T. but he did not change his behavior. D.T. told Hernandez the two cell phones found in Stewart's vehicle belonged to Calhoun. She took the cell phones  from Calhoun because she was upset with him and had left them in Stewart's vehicle. The white HTC cell phone  was used to listen to music. The black Vortex cell phone was used for text messaging and had a contact with the  name ""Daddy"" with Calhoun's photograph. D.T. said she used the black Vortex cell phone to communicate with  Calhoun. Hernandez obtained permission to look through the Vortex cell phone and D.T.'s ZTE cell phone. Hernandez  reviewed the text messages and concluded they were consistent with pimping and prostitution. In the text  messages, D.T. referred to Calhoun as John. The ZTE cell phone had a contact for ""Daddy"" with a photograph of  Calhoun. Hernandez also noticed several text messages sent to Stewart's phone on May 10 and 11, 2016. Some of  the messages were consistent with pimping and prostitution. Hernandez noticed there were 90 calls made  between D.T. and Stewart from May 9 through May 11, 2016. D.T. said that, on the previous day, Calhoun had been repeatedly calling her [*10]  and leaving threatening  voicemail messages. He demanded she return his cell phones, and called her a ""ho,"" a ""slut,"" and a ""bitch."" At the conclusion of the interview, Hernandez released D.T., who was subject to a custody warrant, to Riverside  County Child Protective Services. The next day, Hernandez took photographs of D.T.'s Facebook messages from  May 12, 2016, which were depicted in exhibit 20. From the Facebook messages, it appeared D.T. had contacted  Calhoun and referred to him as Daddy. III. D.T. Returns to Prostitution with Calhoun as Her Pimp. D.T.'s social worker picked up D.T. from the police station. At some point, D.T. asked the social worker to stop the  car. When the car stopped, D.T. got out and ran to a gas station where Calhoun had agreed to pick her up. Calhoun  was angry and slapped D.T. in the face. He drove her to Louie's house and told her never to leave him again. Shortly after returning to Louie's, Calhoun and his cousin Joseph drove D.T. to Figueroa Street in Los Angeles, an  area known for prostitution activity. Calhoun had told D.T. he was going to ""put [her] down on Fig in L.A."" so that  she would ""make money for him."" Calhoun gave D.T. three condoms and told her [*11]  to complete three sex acts  and to text him before each one. D.T. completed oral sex with three customers and gave Calhoun the money she  had earned. Calhoun and D.T. returned to Louie's house where, that night, they engaged in sexual intercourse. D.T. testified she  had sexual intercourse with Calhoun at least four times and oral sex with him twice. She was 13 years old at the  time. Calhoun told D.T. they would travel to San Francisco because it was easier to make money in San Francisco than it  was in San Bernardino or Los Angeles. D.T. did not want to prostitute herself in San Francisco, but she did not  Page 5 of 26   want to say so to Calhoun for fear he would get angry and hit her. The next morning, Calhoun drove D.T. to San  Francisco, where they stayed for three days at his cousin's house. He posted two ads on Backpage and introduced  D.T. to another prostitute named ""Heaven."" Calhoun and D.T. got into an argument while staying with his cousin. Calhoun put his hands around D.T.'s neck and  choked her. She had difficulty breathing, passed out, fell, and scratched her right arm on a couch. When she  regained consciousness, Calhoun was standing over her. He said, ""Look what you made me do"" and ordered  D.T. [*12]  to go to the car and clean up her arm. After the third night, Calhoun drove D.T. back to Louie's house. He left after telling her to stay at the house. While  Calhoun was gone, D.T. sent a text message to a friend, who came to the house and picked her up. When Calhoun  returned and found D.T. gone, he sent her text messages asking her why she had left. The next morning, the friend  drove D.T. back to Louie's house so that D.T. could retrieve some personal items. When D.T. went inside, Calhoun  told her to go to the bathroom, pulled her by the arm, and demanded to know where she had been. D.T. said she  had been at her aunt's house. Calhoun told D.T. to stop lying, backhanded her, and punched her several times in  the face. She fell backwards into the bathtub and, when she tried to get up, Calhoun struck her in the right eye.  D.T.'s nose started bleeding. Calhoun told her to clean up and get out. As D.T. walked outside, she received a telephone call from Calhoun's cousin Joseph. After she ended the call,  Calhoun stepped outside and asked who had called. D.T. responded, ""nobody."" Calhoun snatched the phone from  D.T., looked through it, and discovered text messages between her and Joseph. Calhoun [*13]  threw the phone to  the ground, slapped D.T. in the face, and accused her of lying. She fell and, when she tried to get back up, Calhoun  slapped her again, threw her back down, and choked her. The next day, Calhoun told D.T. he had rented a room in San Bernardino from a friend so they would have a place  to stay. After they moved some boxes into the room, Calhoun left and told D.T. to stay there and unload boxes. That night, Calhoun picked up another woman and told D.T. the three of them were going to Orange County to  make money. D.T. agreed because she was afraid he would hit her again. Calhoun drove to Harbor Boulevard and  Hazard Avenue in Santa Ana, parked on a side street, gave D.T. three condoms, and told her to go out and make  money for him and call him when she was finished. The other woman stayed in the car with Calhoun. D.T. completed one act of vaginal intercourse and another act of oral sex. Calhoun had her charge $120 for the first  and $80 for the second. D.T. gave Calhoun the money. After taking D.T. to get something to eat, Calhoun drove  back to Harbor Boulevard and Hazard Avenue, gave D.T. three more condoms, and ordered her out of the car. As  Calhoun had instructed, D.T. [*14]  walked along Harbor Boulevard and waved at tricks to get their attention. IV. D.T. Is Detained in Santa Ana for Prostitution; Calhoun Is Arrested. On June 2, 2016, at about 3:06 a.m., Santa Ana Police Officer Robert Velasco was patrolling the area of Harbor  Boulevard and Hazard Avenue in Santa Ana. The area is known as the Santa Ana Blade and is well known for  pimping and trafficking of juveniles. Velasco had conducted over 100 pimping and prostitution investigations  during his four and a half years as a police officer. Velasco noticed a very young woman walking along Hazard Avenue just west of Harbor Boulevard. Because she  looked extremely young and the area was known for trafficking juveniles, Velasco pulled up and parked the patrol  car alongside her. He approached the young woman and asked her for her name and date of birth. She gave a  false last name and claimed she was born in October 1997. Velasco later learned the young woman was D.T.  When two records checks did not uncover any information for her name or date of birth, Velasco told D.T. he knew  Page 6 of 26   she was a juvenile and was lying to him. He asked her for proof of her name and birthdate but D.T. had no  identification with her. Velasco [*15]  asked D.T., who appeared nervous and scared, why she was out walking at 3:00 a.m. She said she  was walking home but said she did not know her home address. When Velasco asked her why she did not know  her home address, D.T. said she was going to her cousin's house. D.T. did not know the cousin's name or address. Velasco asked D.T. if he could look through her cell phone, which was a brand ""BLU."" D.T. agreed and gave him  the phone. While Velasco was searching through the cell phone, a text message came through at 3:11 a.m. from a  contact named John saying ""WYA,"" which means ""where are you at?"" Velasco told D.T. he knew she was working as a prostitute. D.T. then admitted she had been working as a  prostitute for a couple of months and was from San Bernardino, but had been to Santa Ana three to four times to  work as a prostitute. She said her friend named John, who had just texted her, had given her a ride from San  Bernardino to Santa Ana. Velasco examined the text message thread between D.T. and John and recognized several messages indicating a  pimp/prostitute relationship. One such message began with the words ""Good morning, daddy,"" which is significant  because it is common for a prostitute [*16]  to call her pimp ""daddy."" Other such messages were ""Get him for 200""  and ""He will if get try and fuck 250."" These messages suggested to Velasco that a pimp was helping D.T. negotiate  prices for services. Velasco saw text messages reading: (1) ""Eating yo pussy extra""; (2) ""Tell him he do T.G.E.  250""; (3) ""You can have a room available""; and (4) ""He gave me 100."" According to Velasco, the first two messages  were the pimp helping to negotiate the price, the third message was the pimp telling the prostitute he would  provide a room to perform the sex act, and the final message was the prostitute informing the pimp she had  completed the sex act and she had the money. Officer Velasco also saw a message thread reading: (1) ""He want me to come to Long Beach he said if he got a  room""; (2) ""He talking big money""; (3) ""Okay""; and (4) ""What's my name to him?"" Velasco concluded the first two  messages were the pimp setting up a date for the prostitute. After reading these messages, Velasco and D.T. went to find John. D.T. told Velasco that John was driving a green  four-door Honda Accord and that he might be in the area of Hazard Avenue and Bewley Street. Velasco placed  D.T. in the back of his patrol [*17]  car and drove to that area. Velasco eventually found the green Honda Accord in  the area of Hazard Avenue and West Street in Santa Ana. Velasco parked directly behind the Honda, got out of his patrol car, and with his partner Officer Phan, made contact  with the two occupants. Calhoun was in the driver's seat. The passenger was released without being interviewed.  Velasco dialed the number listed for ""John"" in D.T.'s phone, and Calhoun's cell phone rang. During a search of  Calhoun's car, $99 was found. Velasco had Calhoun step out of the car and detained him. Calhoun was holding a blue, Samsung Galaxy cell  phone. Calhoun confirmed the phone belonged to him. After detaining Calhoun, Velasco further questioned D.T. She told Velasco she had been working in Santa Ana for  less than an hour. She confirmed that ""John"" was the man seated in the driver's side of the Honda, described him  as a friend, and said he drove her to Orange County from San Bernardino because she had no other way to get  here. She said Calhoun keeps track of and protects her, she gives him gas money, and the $99 the officers found  was her money that she had given to Calhoun to hold. She claimed Calhoun was not her pimp and had [*18]  done  nothing wrong, although he knew she was working in Santa Ana as a prostitute. At the police station, an officer named Gibbons obtained D.T.'s correct age, name, and date of birth. D.T. was  arrested for lying to a peace officer and was sent to juvenile hall. Anaheim Police Investigator Happy Medina  interviewed D.T. at juvenile hall. She told him Calhoun was her pimp. Page 7 of 26   V. Expert Testimony on Human Trafficking and Pimping Medina testified as an expert in pimping, pandering, and human trafficking. He also testified about the rules  governing the pimping and pandering subculture. For instance, if the pimp is African-American, the prostitute is  prohibited from looking at other African-American men for they might also be pimps. The prostitute must do  whatever the customer asks her to do. Some services cost more than others. The pimp dictates everything the  prostitute does. A quota is an amount set by a trafficker or pimp which his prostitutes must earn in a day. A quota can be anywhere  from $250 to $2,000 a day. A prostitute is not permitted to stop working until she has made the quota. The  earnings are called a ""trap."" After the prostitute engages in a couple of sex acts, the pimp takes the [*19]  trap to  prevent her from getting robbed or keeping some for herself. Pimps generally give the prostitutes condoms three at a time so the pimps can control the number of sex acts. After  every three sex acts, the prostitute must go back to the pimp's location, turn over the money, and get more  condoms. The prostitute will send a text message to the pimp when the sex act is starting and tell the pimp how  much the customer will be paying. The pimp waits nearby. If a prostitute comes into contact with police, the pimp  expects her ""100 percent to lie"" about their relationship. The prostitute is permitted to say she gives her pimp  money and he drives her to the track, but, even if arrested, is never to disclose that she has a pimp. Most communications between a prostitute and a pimp are made through text messaging. Medina has spoken to  prostitutes who were told to delete all text messages and believes that practice is common. Pimps post  advertisements for their prostitutes on various websites, such as Backpage and Craigslist. The pimp will use a false  name for the prostitute and, if she is a minor, lie about her age. The pimp will photograph the prostitute for the  advertisement and dictate [*20]  what the prostitute wears and how she poses. The advertisement will ask the  potential customer to send a text message to the pimp, who is posing as the prostitute. All of the arrangements  are made through the pimp. There are several styles of pimping and recruitment of prostitutes. The most common style is called the ""boyfriend  pimp"" in which the pimp pretends to develop a normal boyfriend/girlfriend relationship with a girl, but the pimp's  motive is to turn her into a prostitute. This style is most successful on girls who have not been prostitutes in the  past. A ""finesse pimp"" is similar to a boyfriend pimp but uses charm to nurture young girls. By contrast, a ""guerilla  pimp"" is one who predominately engages in force and violence to control the prostitute. Pimps can use more than  one style; for example, at times, a boyfriend pimp may become violent. A majority of the girls who become prostitutes have no father figure or male role model in their lives and many also  have suffered personal trauma such as physical or sexual abuse. Most of girls who become prostitutes have a  history of being in group homes or foster care, or running away from home. Girls have told Medina they were  recruited [*21]  directly out of foster care, placement facilities, and juvenile hall, where they overall had bad  experiences. Girls who lived in those conditions are ""longing for that attention, some kind of stability in their lives,""  and pimps will tell them ""all the things they have been waiting to hear."" ""Daddy"" is a very common term used by prostitutes to refer to their pimps. It connotes a father figure, protector,  nurturer, and the person who lays down the rules and sets the boundaries. A pimp expects a prostitute to have sex with him ""on demand."" The prostitute is expected to view sex with the  pimp as ""sort of a reward, something that you get to do with daddy."" Medina had spoken with prostitutes who do  not want be in that trade but nevertheless stayed with the same pimp. The girl stays because she has nowhere  else to go and no other way to earn money, and accepts prostitution as her fate. She views the pimp, even if he is  abusive, as the only person who accepts her for who and what she is. Page 8 of 26   Medina also looked at photographs downloaded from Calhoun's Samsung Galaxy cell phone. One photograph  depicted Calhoun in a vehicle holding $100 bills. In more than one photograph, D.T. was in the back seat [*22]  of  the car. These photographs were of a type commonly taken by pimps, panderers, and human traffickers. VI. Expert Testimony on Cell Phone Records Expert testimony was offered on the subject of cell phone records and data. The following is a breakdown of the  various cell phones in this case: HTC: The white cell phone found in the center console of Stewart's vehicle. D.T. told Hernandez this phone  belonged to Calhoun. Vortex: The black cell phone found in the center console of Stewart's vehicle. It belonged to Calhoun but was used  by D.T. Hernandez identified the Cellebrite report for the Vortex cell phone as exhibit 19. Cellebrite is a forensic  download or collection of data from a cell phone. ZTE: The personal cell phone used by D.T. at the time she was detained by Hernandez in May 2016. The Cellebrite  download report is exhibit 34. Stewart's cell phone: The cell phone used by Stewart and apparently confiscated by police in May 2016. BLU: The personal cell phone used by D.T. at the time Calhoun was detained. Exhibit 21 is the Cellebrite download  of text messages from this phone. Exhibit 22 identifies text messages on this cell phone to and from the contact ""my  baby heaven."" Exhibit 23 identifies [*23]  text messages on this phone to and from the number (xxx) xxx-7157. Samsung Galaxy: The cell phone Calhoun was holding when he was detained by Velasco. Exhibit 24 is the  Cellebrite download report for this cell phone. In addition, there were messages and data pertaining to an unrecovered cell phone with the number (xxx) xxx-5542. Bruce Linn is an investigator with the Orange County District Attorney's Office and qualified as an expert in cell  phone technology. Linn is assigned to the ""TRACKRS"" unit, which stands for ""task force review aimed at catching  killers, rapers [sic], and sexual offenders."" He conducted a forensic analysis of a Cellebrite download from the  Samsung Galaxy cell phone recovered from Calhoun. Linn is able to determine from data downloaded from a cell phone where it has been because the internal  components of a cell phone produce GPS coordinates. A photograph taken by a cell phone camera produces  metadata of the latitude and longitude lines identifying the camera's location when the photograph was taken. Linn was provided a Cellebrite download from the Samsung Galaxy cell phone recovered from Calhoun. He  determined that only a portion of the photos had location data. Based [*24]  upon the chronology of the photos from  earliest-dated to most recent, he inputted the latitude/longitude into Cell Hawk, which created the map showing  where the photographs were taken. Linn reviewed all the photographs in the Cellebrite download and noticed  Calhoun appeared in most of the photographs. Linn also noticed videos in the Cellebrite download depicting  Calhoun. At trial, Linn gave a presentation on PowerPoint showing a map, date, time, and latitude and longitude coordinates  of 61 photographs and two videos. The presentation showed that during the relevant time period, Calhoun was in  San Bernardino, Riverside, Modesto, San Jose, San Francisco, Santa Ana, Los Angeles, and Long Beach. Page 9 of 26   During his investigation, Linn downloaded data from D.T.'s BLU cell phone using Cellebrite. He noticed two  separate photographs were take on May 17, 2016 at 11:52 a.m. on both D.T.'s cell phone and Calhoun's cell phone  at the same location near Richmond Point in the San Francisco Bay area. Detective Hernandez, who had detained D.T. in May 2016, testified about text messages retrieved from the two cell  phones found in Stewart's car (the HTC cell phone and the Vortex cell phone), D.T.'s BLU cell phone, [*25]  and  Stewart's own cell phone. Hernandez was familiar with Cellebrite downloads and had Cellebrite downloads  conducted on all of those cell phones. D.T. had told Hernandez that she used the Vortex cell phone to communicate with Calhoun. Hernandez testified the  Vortex cell phone had a contact under the name ""Daddy"" with a corresponding phone number of (xxx) xxx-5542.  Text messages exchanged between D.T. and Calhoun related to pimping and prostitution. For example, in one  message thread, D.T. sent a message advising Calhoun she had a customer. He replied, ""Keep walking."" She then  asked Calhoun how long she had to remain on the blade and if she could take a break and talk to a friend of hers.  Calhoun ordered her immediately to stop talking to the friend. Hernandez was not sure to which cell phone the number (xxx) xxx-5542 was connected. She did not believe that  number was associated with either the HTC phone or the Vortex phone. D.T. saved that number under the contact  ""Daddy."" On May 12, 2016, Calhoun had told D.T. he had a new phone number. Medina testified he was familiar with Cellebrite downloads and reports and had reviewed the cell phone downloads  from the Samsung Galaxy, the BLU, the [*26]  Vortex, the HTC, and the ZTE cell phones. Medina also reviewed  exhibit 35, which is a collection of text messages to or from the ""Daddy"" contact with the number (xxx) xxx-5542.  Medina read one incoming message from the Daddy contact: ""Don't give no fuck. Give me my phones. I need my  white one. I'm not playing."" Medina identified text messages on the Vortex cell phone to or from the contact Daddy with the number (xxx) xxx- 5542. Outgoing messages are addressed to ""Daddy"" or ""John."" The messages relate to pimping and prostitution  activities. One incoming text message read, ""Come get this condom"" and an outgoing message read, ""Daddy, hows  much long I got to be out here and OK."" Medina testified the question about how much longer she had to be out  was consistent with a pimp controlling the prostitutes working on the track and ""okay"" meant the girl would meet the  pimp to get condoms. The next message read, ""We need at least 100,"" and was significant because it told the girl  she had to make at least $100 before she could stop working. Medina identified and reviewed exhibit 33, the Cellebrite report for the ZTE cell phone. Medina testified the BLU cell  phone had outgoing text messages that were [*27]  consistent with pimping, pandering, and human trafficking. In  one message, D.T. texted, ""Baby, I want to make up with you. Imma give you the best . . . sex ever, babe. I'm sorry  for today."" In another, she sent the following text message to the contact listed as John: ""Good morning, Daddy. I  hope you have a great day today. I'm sorry for everything I have been doing wrong. You are the best thing that ever  happened to me. And when I say that I want to spend the rest of my life with you, I mean it Babe. Just know that I  love you so much."" Those messages were consistent with the common practice of a victim apologizing to her pimp  after a fight. Another message thread was between D.T. and her friend Heaven. D.T. sent a message stating, ""Heaven, what  you doing? I'm in Oakland making my money. And it's for Daddy. Pockets."" Heaven responded, ""Be safe tonight.  What part of Oakland you in?"" D.T. replied back that she was on ""International,"" a well-known track in Oakland.  Later, D.T. texted Heaven and told her that she was about to get on the freeway and head back to San Bernardino.  Heaven asked D.T. where ""John"" was. When D.T. sent a message back that he was ""right here,"" Heaven's  response was, [*28]  ""Tell him [to] answer my text. It's important."" Medina testified those communications were  consistent with contacts between two women working for the same pimp. SUMMARY OF VERDICT AND SENTENCES Page 10 of 26   The jury found Calhoun guilty of one count of human trafficking of a minor under the age of 18 (count 1, Pen.  Code, § 236.1, subd. (c)(1)), one count of pimping of a minor under the age of 16 (count 2, § 266h, subd. (b)(2)),  one count of pandering a minor under the age of 16 by procuring (count 3, § 266i, subds. (a)(1) & (b)(2)), two  counts of lewd and lascivious acts on a child under the age of 14 (counts 4 & 6, § 288, subd. (a)), unlawful sexual  intercourse (count 5, § 261.5, subd. (d)), and oral copulation with a child under the age of 14 (count 7, § 288a,  subd. (c)(1)). The jury found true the allegation under section 236.1, subdivision (c)(2), made with respect to count  1, that Calhoun unlawfully used force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful  injury in committing the crime. Following a bench trial, the court found a prior conviction allegation to be true. The court sentenced Calhoun as follows: (1) 15 years to life under count 1 as enhanced by the true finding on the  section 236.1 allegation; (2) six years on count 4, consecutive to count 1; (3) two years on count 6, consecutive to  count 1; (4) two years on count 7, concurrent [*29]  to count 1; (5) six years on count 2, concurrent to count 1; (6)  six years on count 3, concurrent to count 1; (7) three years on count 5, concurrent to count 1. The court stayed  execution of sentence on counts 2, 3, and 5 pursuant to section 654. DISCUSSION I. The Trial Court Did Not Err by Excluding Evidence of D.T.'s Acts of Prostitution Occurring After Calhoun  Was Placed in Custody. Calhoun contends the trial court erred by not permitting him to introduce evidence that D.T. continued to work as a  prostitute after he was placed in custody. The trial court concluded such evidence was inadmissible under  Evidence Code section 1161, subdivision (b) (Evidence Code section 1161(b)) and, if admissible, was subject to  exclusion under Evidence Code section 352. Evidence Code section 1161(b) reads: "" Evidence of sexual history or  history of any commercial sexual act of a victim of human trafficking, as defined in Section 236.1 of the Penal  Code, is inadmissible to attack the credibility or impeach the character of the victim in any civil or criminal  proceeding."" Calhoun argues the evidence of D.T.'s subsequent prostitution activity was relevant and admissible because: (1)  Evidence Code section 1161(b) only excluded evidence of D.T.'s sexual history and history of commercial sexual  acts that occurred before he was placed in custody and (2) he sought to admit evidence of D.T.'s subsequent [*30]   commercial sex acts and prostitution arrests not for credibility or impeachment purposes but to negate an  element of the offense of human trafficking. Calhoun also contends the trial court never made an express finding  that D.T. was a victim of sex trafficking. A. Background Before trial started, the prosecution moved to exclude evidence of D.T.'s prior or subsequent acts of prostitution  for purposes of impeachment. Defense counsel stated he wanted to impeach D.T. with evidence of acts of  prostitution committed after Calhoun was placed in custody. Defense counsel argued prostitution is a crime of  moral turpitude, there was no causal connection between Calhoun and the acts of prostitution committed by D.T.  after Calhoun was in custody, and Evidence Code section 1161(b) did not apply because the People had made no  preliminary showing that D.T. was a victim of human trafficking. The trial court ruled that Evidence Code section  1161(b) barred the defense from introducing evidence of subsequent acts of prostitution for the purpose of  impeaching D.T. or challenging her credibility.  Page 11 of 26   During a break in D.T.'s cross-examination, the trial court returned to the issue of evidence of D.T.'s acts of  prostitution after Calhoun had been placed in custody. The [*31]  court stated: ""There is so far uncontroverted  testimony that [D.T.] had not been a prostitute until the defendant brought her into the business, this is from direct  examination from the prosecution, the testimony that [Calhoun] caused it by having her make money, a term she  stated that she had never heard before. Going into her subsequent sexual history as a prostitute is not relevant to  the case. It is inflammatory. And even if [Evidence Code section] 1161 hypothetically did not exist, this would be a  very simple [Evidence Code section] 352 analysis which also applies here because any probative value is  outweighed by the prejudice. [¶] Now if that becomes an issue, we can talk about that. So far the only evidence that  the witness prostituted herself was because of how the defendant taught her to do that. That's after the fact, after  the defendant was arrested. According to her, he gave her the tools. The subsequent conduct does not become  relevant at that point."" After the prosecutor had completed redirect examination of D.T., defense counsel asked the court to reconsider its  ruling due to her testimony that Calhoun had been her only pimp and was responsible for prostituting her to 20  customers. Defense counsel argued that D.T.'s testimony [*32]  created the misleading impression that she ceased  engaging in prostitution once Calhoun was in custody. The trial court confirmed its ruling that evidence of D.T.'s  subsequent acts of prostitution was inadmissible under Evidence Code section 1161(b). B. The Evidence Was Inadmissible Under Evidence Code Section 1161(b) for Credibility or Impeachment of  Character. Calhoun was charged with and convicted of human trafficking in violation of section 236.1. In November 2012,  the voters of the State of California passed the Californians Against Sexual Exploitation Act (the CASE Act) with the  purpose and intent ""'[t]o combat the crime of human trafficking'"" and ""'[t]o recognize trafficked individuals as  victims and not criminals, and to protect the rights of trafficked victims.'"" (In re M.D. (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 993,  998-999, 181 Cal. Rptr. 3d 761, quoting Prop. 35, § 3, as approved by voters Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) eff. Nov. 7,  2012.) ""The CASE Act made various changes to state law regarding human trafficking, including expanding the  definition of the offense and increasing the punishment for such offenses."" (In re Aarica S. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th  1480, 1486, 168 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136 (Aarica S.).) Evidence Code section 1161 was enacted as part of the CASE Act. (In re M.D., supra, 231 Cal.App.4th at p. 998.)  The full text of Evidence Code section 1161 is: ""(a) Evidence that a victim of human trafficking, as defined in  Section 236.1 of the Penal Code, has engaged in any commercial sexual act as a result of being a victim of human  trafficking [*33]  is inadmissible to prove the victim's criminal liability for the commercial sexual act. [¶] (b)  Evidence of sexual history or history of any commercial sexual act of a victim of human trafficking, as defined in  Section 236.1 of the Penal Code, is inadmissible to attack the credibility or impeach the character of the victim in  any civil or criminal proceeding."" Evidence Code section 1161, subdivision (a) (Evidence Code section 1161(a)) in effect means a victim of human  trafficking cannot be prosecuted for an act of prostitution that is causally connected to the victim's status as  human trafficking victim. (See Aarica S., supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1487-1488.) Evidence Code section  1161(a) is not directly relevant here because D.T. was not prosecuted. As we shall explain, it is relevant to  interpreting Evidence Code section 1161(b).        Page 12 of 26   The issue presented here is whether Evidence Code section 1161(b) applies only to the human trafficking victim's  sexual conduct and acts of prostitution committed before the alleged human trafficker was placed in custody.  Calhoun argues that Evidence Code section 1161(b), by referring to ""sexual history"" and ""history of any  commercial sex act,"" only excludes evidence of D.T.'s conduct prior to his arrest. (Italics added.) The Attorney  General argues that nothing in the text of the CASE Act limits the scope of Evidence Code section 1161(b) to  sexual acts and acts of prostitution committed before the alleged human trafficker was placed in custody. [*34]  In  resolving this question, we work on a blank slate. No reported decision has addressed the scope of Evidence Code  section 1161(b). We review issues of statutory interpretation de novo (Kavanaugh v. West Sonoma County Union High School Dist.  (2003) 29 Cal.4th 911, 916, 129 Cal. Rptr. 2d 811, 62 P.3d 54) including statutes added by the passage of a ballot  initiative (People v. Park (2013) 56 Cal.4th 782, 796, 156 Cal. Rptr. 3d 307, 299 P.3d 1263). The primary purpose is  to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the voters who passed the ballot initiative. (People v. Briceno (2004) 34 Cal.  4th 451, 459, 20 Cal. Rptr. 3d 418, 99 P.3d 1007.) ""'In interpreting a voter initiative . . . we apply the same principles  that govern statutory construction. [Citation.] Thus, ""we turn first to the language of the statute, giving the words  their ordinary meaning."" [Citation.] The statutory language must also be construed in the context of the statute as a  whole and the overall statutory scheme [in light of the electorate's intent]. [Citation.] When the language is  ambiguous, ""we refer to other indicia of the voters' intent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the  official ballot pamphlet.""'"" (Ibid.) The language of Evidence Code section 1161(b) renders inadmissible for impeachment or credibility purposes  ""evidence of sexual history or history of any commercial sexual act of a victim of human trafficking."" (Italics  added.) What does ""history"" mean? History, both formally and colloquially, has several meanings. Formally, [*35]  it can mean a ""narrative of events  connected with a real or imaginary object, person, or career"" or ""a systematic written account comprising a  chronological record"" or the formal ""branch of knowledge . . . of human activities."" (Webster's 3d New Internat. Dict.  (2002) pp. 1073-1074.) History can mean simply a ""tale, story."" (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed.  2004) p. 590, capitalization omitted.) In everyday speech, history can mean events in the past or even reputation. The various definitions of history all refer to events in the past, and Calhoun says history as used in Evidence Code  section 1161(b) has the same meaning. But past of what? Calhoun says before he was taken into custody.  Evidence Code section 1161(b) does not include such a limitation or any temporal limitation except for the word  ""history."" We conclude the more reasonable interpretation is that ""history"" means at any time before the victim  testifies at trial. Evidence Code section 1161(b) says history of ""any commercial sexual act."" (Italics added.) Use of the word ""any""  suggests the inadmissible evidence is not limited to commercial sexual acts committed by the victim while using the  alleged human trafficker as the pimp. Evidence Code section 1161(a) draws a causal connection between the sexual act and the victim's [*36]  status as  human trafficking victim by making inadmissible evidence that the victim ""has engaged in any commercial sexual  act as a result of being a victim of human trafficking."" (Italics added.) Evidence Code section 1161(a) applies ""only  when there is a specific causal connection between the victim's status as a victim of human trafficking and the  particularly commercial sex act at issue."" (Aarica S., supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1487-1488.) No similar  language appears in Evidence Code section 1161(b). ""If the Legislature has included one provision in one part of a  statute but excluded it from another, a court should not imply the omitted provision in that part of the statute that  does not contain it."" (People ex rel. Gwinn v. Kothari (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 759, 770, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 29.) The Legislative Analyst stated that ballot initiative 35 ""makes evidence of sexual conduct by a victim of human  trafficking inadmissible for the purposes of attacking the victim's credibility or character in court."" (Ballot Pamp.,  Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012), analysis of Prop. 35 by the Legislative Analyst, p. 44.) As the Attorney General argues,  the language used by the Legislative Analyst encompasses all of the victim's sexual conduct. Page 13 of 26   One purpose of the CASE Act was to ""'ensure just and effective punishment of people who promote or engage in  the crime of human trafficking.'"" (In re M.D., supra, 231 Cal.App.4th at p. 999.) At trial, [*37]  Medina testified that  victims of human traffickers are typically runaways who often had bad experiences in the juvenile dependency  system. Once introduced to (or forced into) prostitution by the trafficker, the victim remains a prostitute because  she has nowhere else to go and no other way to earn a living. The human trafficker, having forced the victim into a  life of prostitution, should not be permitted to use the victim's sexual history and history of prostitution to discredit  the victim and exonerate himself. Calhoun argues Evidence Code section 1161(b) requires the prosecution to prove the witness was in fact a victim  of human trafficking before the sexual history and commercial sex history evidence can be excluded. Otherwise,  he argues, Evidence Code section 1161(b) ""would create a blanket privilege to all victims of human trafficking  without the prosecution having to prove that the minor was in fact a victim of human trafficking."" Calhoun relies on  In re M.D., supra, 231 Cal.App.4th 993, in which the court interpreted Evidence Code section 1161(a) as placing the  burden of proof on the minor defendant to prove she was a victim of human trafficking when she moved to  exclude the evidence of her commercial sex acts. (Id. at p. 1001.) The court stated, ""nothing in the language of  [Evidence Code] section 1161 suggests an intent to create an evidentiary [*38]  presumption that all minors  charged with committing commercial sex acts are victims of human trafficking."" (Ibid., italics added.) D.T. was not charged with prostitution or any offense in this case. Evidence Code section 1161(b) does not have  the ""as a result of language"" found in Evidence Code section 1161(a). In People v. Brown (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th  320, 341, 221 Cal. Rptr. 3d 854, the court rejected the defendant's argument that by using the word ""victim,""  Evidence Code section 1161(b) violated due process and the confrontation clause because, until a trial, ""'no ""victim""  yet exists.'"" The Court of Appeal concluded the word ""victim"" as used in Evidence Code section 1161(b) is  synonymous with ""'complainant,' 'complaining witness,' or the older term 'prosecutrix.'"" (Ibid.) ""[A]ny rational trial  court would understand the context of the term, and would not presume the defendant was guilty before trial."" (Ibid.) In any case, the trial court did, in effect, make a preliminary finding that D.T. was a victim of human trafficking.  During D.T.'s cross-examination, the court stated, ""there is so far uncontroverted testimony that [D.T.] had not been  a prostitute until the defendant brought her into the business."" The evidence at trial was overwhelming that D.T.  was a victim of human trafficking and that Calhoun was the trafficker. D.T.'s own testimony to that effect was  bolstered by the percipient [*39]  and expert testimony of Hernandez and Medina. There could be no question that  D.T. was a victim of human trafficking for purposes of Evidence Code section 1161(b). It might be, as Calhoun claims, that D.T. was not a human trafficking victim in the subsequent acts of prostitution  in the sense that she had no pimp or her pimp was not Calhoun. He argues that excluding evidence of subsequent  acts of prostitution would make section Evidence Code 1161(b) ""an affirmative defense to prostitution."" Because  D.T. was not on trial for prostitution, we are not considering whether or under what circumstances Evidence Code  section 1161(b) evidence is admissible to challenge the credibility or impeach the character of a defendant. The  important point here is D.T. was not the defendant but a witness testifying as a human trafficking victim against  the man who, as a human trafficker, induced or forced her into prostitution. In that situation, section Evidence  Code 1161(b) prohibited the introduction into evidence, for credibility or impeachment purposes, evidence of ""any""  history of commercial sexual act of the human trafficking victim. C. The Evidence Was Irrelevant to Negate an Element of Human Trafficking; Any Error in Excluding the Evidence  Was Harmless. Calhoun argues evidence of D.T.'s commercial [*40]  sexual acts was admissible to negate an element of the crime  of human trafficking. The evidence, he argues, would negate the inducement, causation, and persuasion  elements of section 236.1: ""[A]ny evidence that the victim, subsequent to [Calhoun]'s arrest, is using other people to  conduct her prostitution business would be relevant to whether the complaining witness is actually a victim of  human trafficking in this case. If the evidence showed that [D.T.] was an independent contractor and not the  property of a pimp, it would have been relevant to demonstrate that she was an independent contractor with  [Calhoun] as well."" Page 14 of 26   Calhoun undoes his own argument when, in his appellant's reply brief, he asserts that evidence of D.T.'s other  commercial sex acts ""would have supported and corroborated her previous statements to law enforcement that  [Calhoun] was not her pimp but a friend."" That is a credibility or impeachment purpose intended to discredit D.T.'s  trial testimony. To the extent Calhoun had a legitimate purpose for introducing evidence of D.T.'s other commercial sexual acts,  exclusion of the evidence was harmless. The evidence that D.T. was a victim of human trafficking and that  Calhoun was the trafficker [*41]  was overwhelming. Evidence that D.T. might have later worked as an  ""independent contractor"" rather than for a pimp does not negate Calhoun's culpability as a sex trafficker who  initially induced or forced her into a life of prostitution. From evidence of subsequent acts of prostitution, it is not  reasonably likely the jury would have drawn the inference that D.T. was an ""independent contractor"" when she was  with Calhoun because such an inference would have been contrary to nearly all the other evidence. We conclude it  was not reasonably probable that a result more favorable to Calhoun would have been reached had he been  permitted to introduce evidence of D.T.'s commercial sex acts for a purpose other than credibility or impeachment.  (People v. Watson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836, 299 P.2d 243 (Watson).) D. The Trial Court Did Not Err by Excluding the Evidence Under Evidence Code Section 352. Evidence of D.T.'s subsequent commercial sex acts was subject to exclusion under Evidence Code section 352.  The trial court found that any probative value of the evidence was outweighed by prejudice. The trial court's section  352 ruling was not an abuse of discretion. (People v. Brooks (2017) 3 Cal.5th 1, 40-41, 219 Cal. Rptr. 3d 331, 396  P.3d 480.) The relevance of evidence of D.T.'s subsequent commercial sexual acts was substantially outweighed  by probability it would focus attention on D.T.'s [*42]  character and conduct and away from the issues of Calhoun's  culpability. Admission of the evidence had the distinct probability of misleading the jury into believing D.T., and not  Calhoun, was on trial. In addition, as the Attorney General argues, admission of evidence of D.T.'s subsequent  commercial sex acts would have led to a mini-trial on all the circumstances surrounding D.T.'s conduct. II. The Evidence at the Preliminary Hearing Imparted Notice to Calhoun of the Factual Basis for Counts 6 and  7 Sufficient to Satisfy Due Process. Calhoun was charged in count 6 with committing a lewd and lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 in  violation of section 288, subdivision (a) and was charged in count 7 with oral copulation of a child under the age of  14 in violation of section 288a, subdivision (c)(1). Calhoun argues he was denied due process notice of the charges  in counts 6 and 7 because he was convicted of them based on evidence not adduced at the preliminary hearing. A. Background The initial felony complaint alleged six counts. Count 1 charged Calhoun with human trafficking of a minor, count  2 charged him with pimping a minor, and count 3 charged him with pandering with a minor under the age of 16.  Counts 4 and 6 charged Calhoun with violating [*43]  of section 288a—committing a lewd and lascivious act on a  child under the age of 14—and count 5 charged him with violating section 261.5, subdivision (b)—engaging in  unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. At the preliminary hearing, D.T. testified she performed oral sex with Calhoun in Santa Ana on June 1, 2016. She  could not recall where in Santa Ana or at what time that happened. At the preliminary hearing, D.T. testified she had  sexual intercourse with Calhoun on June 1, 2016 at the home of his friend Joe. She also testified she had sexual  intercourse with Calhoun at his friend's house in San Bernardino and, on two occasions while they were in San  Francisco, they had sexual intercourse at a cousin's house. D.T. testified that on June 1 and 2, she caught five  dates with customers. Page 15 of 26   Based upon D.T.'s testimony, the prosecution requested the complaint be amended to add two more counts, count  7 and count 8, both alleging that between June 1 and June 2, 2016, Calhoun violated section 288a, subdivision  (c)(1) by participating in an act of oral copulation with D.T. Count 7 was based on the theory D.T. orally copulated  customers and Calhoun aided and abetted those offenses. Count 8 was based on D.T.'s testimony that she orally  copulated Calhoun on June 1 or 2, [*44]  2016. At the preliminary hearing, the prosecutor confirmed that count 6  was also based on the theory Calhoun had aided and abetted customers in committing lewd and lascivious acts  upon Danielle. The trial court granted the request to add counts 7 and 8. The court then found sufficient and probable cause and  held Calhoun to answer counts 1 through 8. Subsequently, the trial court granted Calhoun's motion under section 995 to dismiss newly added count 7. An  amended information removed the previously dismissed count 7 and renumbered count 8 as count 7. Count 6  remained count 6. When the case was tried, count 7 alleged that on or about June 1 and 2, 2016, Calhoun violated section 288a,  subdivision (c)(1) by engaging in oral sex with D.T., a child under 14 years of age and more than 10 years younger  than he was. Count 6 alleged that on or about June 1 and 2, 2016, Calhoun violated section 288, subdivision (a) by  committing a lewd and lascivious act on the body of D.T., a child under 14 years of age. Count 4 alleged the same  offense as count 6 but for the time period from April 20 through June 2, 2016. At trial, D.T. testified she had oral sex with Calhoun twice. D.T. could not recall where, when, or how the acts of oral  sex took place except to say they took place [*45]  somewhere in California. She was certain she orally copulated  Calhoun twice. D.T. testified she had sexual intercourse with Calhoun at least four times, twice on two different  occasions at Louie's house. Later, during cross-examination, D.T. testified she did not know where or when she had  sexual intercourse with Calhoun. D.T. also testified that on the night of June 1 and 2, 2016 she caught only two  dates, rather than five. At trial, the prosecution did not argue, and the court never instructed the jury, that count 6 was based on an aiding  and abetting theory. Instead, the prosecutor argued in closing that count 6 related to one of the occasions when  D.T. had sexual intercourse with Calhoun and count 7 related to an act of oral copulation between her and Calhoun.  The trial court gave a unanimity instruction directed to counts 4, 6, and 7. B. Relevant Law Article I, section 14 of the California Constitution requires that ""[f]elonies shall be prosecuted as provided by law,  either by indictment or, after examination and commitment by a magistrate, by information."" This constitutional  requirement means a person may not be prosecuted ""in the absence of a prior determination of a magistrate or  grand jury that such action is justified."" (Jones v. Superior Court (1971) 4 Cal.3d 660, 666, 94 Cal. Rptr. 289, 483  P.2d 1241.) [*46]  ""Before any accused person can be called upon to defend himself on any charge prosecuted by  information, he is entitled to a preliminary examination upon said charge, and the judgment of the magistrate before  whom such examination is held as to whether the crime for which it is sought to prosecute him has been committed,  and whether there is sufficient cause to believe him guilty thereof. These proceedings are essential to confer  jurisdiction upon the court before whom he is placed on trial."" (People v. Bomar (1925) 73 Cal.App. 372, 378, 238  P. 758.) Once a defendant has been held to answer on the offenses alleged in a complaint, the People must within 15 days  file an information alleging the offenses shown by the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing. (§ 739.) Due  process requires that ""an accused be advised of the charges against him so that he has a reasonable opportunity to  prepare and present his defense and not be taken by surprise by evidence offered at his trial."" (People v. Jones  (1990) 51 Cal.3d 294, 317, 270 Cal. Rptr. 611, 792 P.2d 643.) A defendant therefore cannot be prosecuted for an  offense not shown by the evidence at the preliminary hearing or not arising out of the transaction upon which the  commitment was based. (People v. McCoy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1531, 156 Cal. Rptr. 3d 382; People v.  Graff (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 345, 360, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 827 (Graff).) Phrased somewhat differently, the rule is,  Page 16 of 26   ""[a]n information which [*47]  charges the commission of an offense not named in the commitment order will not be  upheld unless (1) the evidence before the magistrate shows that such offense was committed [citation], and (2) that  the offense 'arose out of the transaction which was the basis for the commitment on a related offense.'"" (Jones v.  Superior Court, supra, 4 Cal.3d at pp. 664-665.) C. There Was No Material Variance Between the Evidence at the Preliminary Hearing and the Evidence at Trial for  Counts 6 and 7. Calhoun argues his conviction under count 7 was based on evidence not elicited at the preliminary hearing. At the  preliminary hearing, D.T. testified that she engaged in oral sex once with Calhoun, in Santa Ana. At trial, D.T.  testified she orally copulated Calhoun twice, but could not remember where or when she did so other than to say it  was in California. The variance between D.T.'s preliminary hearing testimony and trial testimony was not material and does not  warrant dismissal of count 7. ""[U]nder normal circumstances, [a defendant's] opportunity to prepare an effective  defense would not be affected merely because the evidence at trial showed the offenses occurred at a different  time (within the time frame alleged in the original information) or a different [*48]  [place]. . . . [N]either the time  [citation] nor the place at which an offense is committed [citation] is material, and an immaterial variance will be  disregarded."" (People v. Pitts (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 606, 906, 273 Cal. Rptr. 757 (Pitts).) The preliminary hearing placed Calhoun on notice he was being charged with one count of engaging in oral  copulation with D.T. Her trial testimony was that she orally copulated him twice. D.T. never recanted her preliminary  hearing testimony; she merely testified at trial she could not remember where or when the acts occurred. D.T.'s trial  testimony did not foreclose the possibility that at least one of the two acts was the one to which D.T. testified at the  preliminary hearing. Either act of oral copulation to which D.T. testified at trial would have supported a conviction  under count 7, and the trial court gave a unanimity instruction. Defendant does not demonstrate how he was misled  when mounting his defense to count 7. As to count 6, Calhoun argues: ""The oral copulation events that [D.T.] testified to at trial and the evidence  supporting Count Six were never the subject of a preliminary hearing . . . where it could be determined whether  there was probable cause to believe that the offense had occurred."" D.T.'s [*49]  testimony at the preliminary  hearing supported binding over Calhoun under count 6 on a theory he directly committed lewd and lascivious acts  on D.T. At the preliminary hearing, D.T. testified Calhoun had sexual intercourse with her on at least four occasions  between April 20 and June 1, 2016. Any one of those acts would have supported a conviction under section 288,  subdivision (a) inasmuch as sexual intercourse when committed on a 13-year-old girl is a lewd and lascivious act. The preliminary hearing thus placed Calhoun on notice that he must be prepared to defend against no less than  four acts of committing a lewd and lascivious act on a child. Count 4 covered the period from April 20 through June  2, 2016, while count 6 covered the period June 1 and 2 of the same year. Although the prosecutor stated at the  preliminary hearing that count 6 was based on an aiding and abetting theory, the evidence presented, and thus the  transcript of the hearing, established he also could be held liable as a direct perpetrator. ""[I]t is not the complaint but  the totality of the evidence produced at the preliminary hearing which notifies the defendant of the potential charges  he may have to face in the superior court."" (People v. Donnell (1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 227, 233, 135 Cal. Rptr. 217.) Calhoun [*50]  contends the evidence at the preliminary hearing was insufficient to bind him over on counts 6 and 7  because at trial D.T. retracted her preliminary hearing testimony. She did no such thing. At trial, D.T. testified she  and Calhoun had oral sex twice and sexual intercourse at least four times; she simply could not remember by the  time of trial where or when they did so. D.T. did not retract or recant her preliminary hearing testimony. Except for  the number of customers she had on June 1 and 2, 2016, she did not testify she lied at the preliminary hearing. The  only variance in evidence between the preliminary hearing and the trial was at trial D.T. could not recall where or  when the acts of oral copulation or sexual intercourse took place. Instructive is People v. Gil (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 653, 4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 697, in which the defendant was convicted of  five counts of forcible lewd conduct on two girls under the age of 14. At trial, one girl testified to incidents of the  Page 17 of 26   defendant touching her breasts and the defendant putting his penis in her vagina, and the other girl testified to acts  of the defendant touching her breasts, putting his finger in her vagina, and putting his penis in her vagina. (Id. at pp.  655-657.) The defendant testified he had not committed [*51]  any of the offenses. On appeal, the defendant  argued he was denied notice of the charges because the evidence adduced at trial involved offenses not shown at  the preliminary hearing. He claimed the inconsistencies about the dates of offenses and other changes in testimony  at trial made the charges different than those shown at the preliminary hearing. (Id. at p. 657-658.) In rejecting that argument, the Court of Appeal held the information charged the defendant with offenses shown by  the evidence at the preliminary hearing in that the evidence at the preliminary hearing clearly supported five counts  of lewd conduct however committed. (People v. Gil, supra, 3 Cal.App.4th at p. 658.) The court explained:  ""Inconsistencies and contradictions during the course of thorough cross-examination of child witnesses at trial is not  persuasive of appellant's contention that the incidents at trial were completely different from the incidents described  at the preliminary hearing. The inconsistencies went to the weight and credibility of the testimony, not to the  question of notice claimed by appellant."" (Id. at p. 659.) The court found that even if there were inconsistencies, ""it  is unlikely appellant's ability to defend was prejudiced; his defense was not a specific alibi [*52]  but a denial that  molestations occurred at all."" (Ibid.) In this case, as in People v. Gil, the variations and inconsistencies between D.T.'s trial testimony and preliminary  hearing testimony did not make the offenses charged in count 6 and count 7 different from those shown at the  preliminary hearing. Instead, the inconsistencies and variances at most go to the weight and credibility of D.T.'s trial  testimony. We cannot see how Calhoun could have suffered any prejudice because his defense was, like that of the  defendant in People v. Gil, he never committed the offenses. The cases relied upon by Calhoun do not support dismissal of count 6 or 7. Pitts, supra, 223 Cal.App.3d at page  634, involved a 53-count information against one group of defendants, and a 58-count information against another  group of defendants. The two informations alleged numerous charges of sex abuse against many child victims.  (Ibid.) The Court of Appeal dismissed some of the counts because variances between the evidence at the  preliminary hearing and the evidence at trial denied the defendants an opportunity to prepare a meaningful defense.  (Id. at p. 905.) The court noted that variances in the time and place at which specific acts occurred were not  material. (Id. at p. 907.) [*53]  But many counts charged the defendants with conduct for which no evidence was  adduced at the preliminary hearing; in others, the evidence at the preliminary hearing supported a different count;  and in others, evidence was adduced at one defendant's preliminary hearing that was not adduced at the  preliminary hearings for other defendants. (Id. at pp. 908-914.) The Court of Appeal noted that for some counts as  charged in an amended information ""the specific act and/or actors changed from previous amendments, and/or the  specific act involving specific actors was not shown by evidence adduced at a particular preliminary hearing."" (Id. at  p. 907.) Such variances were material and, consequently, the preliminary hearing transcript did not impart notice  sufficient to satisfy due process. (Id. at pp. 907-908.) In this case, in stark contrast to Pitts, the evidence at the preliminary hearing placed Calhoun on notice that, in  addition to human trafficking, pimping, and pandering, he would have to defend charges he orally copulated D.T.  once on June 1 or 2, 2016, engaged in sexual intercourse with her at least four times between April 20 and June 2,  2016, and aided and abetted her in engaging in sex acts with others on June 1 and 2, 2016. The [*54]  information  and amended information charged Calhoun with committing the acts against D.T. adduced by the evidence at the  preliminary hearing. There were no changes in the specifics or actors from previous charging documents or from  the evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing. Unlike Pitts, here, there could be no confusion about the actors,  since Calhoun and D.T. were the only actors, about the time frame, which did not change from April 20 to June 2,  2016, or about the charged sexual acts directly perpetrated against D.T. To the extent there was a variance,  Calhoun has not demonstrated how he might have been misled or suffered prejudice. In People v. Burnett (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 151, 155-156, 83 Cal. Rptr. 2d 629 (Burnett), the defendant was  charged with being a felon in possession of a weapon, which was specifically alleged to be a .38-caliber revolver.  During trial, a new witness described a second, entirely different incident involving a .357-caliber revolver. (Id. at p.  157.) The trial court permitted the prosecutor to amend the information to strike the .357-caliber allegation from the  Page 18 of 26   information. (Id. at p. 164.) The prosecutor argued the jury could convict the defendant based on either incident. (Id.  at p. 169.) The jury convicted the defendant of being a felon in possession. (Id. at p. 156.) [*55]  On appeal, the defendant argued his conviction must be reversed because he was tried for the incident involving  possession of the .357-caliber revolver, an offense not shown by the evidence at the preliminary hearing. (Burnett,  supra, 71 Cal.App.4th at p. 164.) The Court of Appeal concluded the defendant could not have been prosecuted or  convicted for possession of the .357-caliber revolver because that incident was separate, distinct, and not  transactionally related to the incident shown by the evidence at the preliminary hearing. (Id. at p. 178.) The court  reversed the conviction because the defendant's trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing  to object when it became clear the jury was going to be asked to convict based either on the incident that was the  subject of the preliminary hearing or on the second incident described at trial. (Id. at pp. 179-183.) This case does not present the situation in which a new witness, who did not testify at the preliminary hearing,  testifies at trial about an incident separate, distinct and transactionally unrelated to the offense shown by the  evidence at the preliminary hearing. Instead, in this case, the victim, D.T., testified at trial to a greater number of  offenses than the number charged. [*56]  The unanimity instruction ensured the juror's agreement as to the facts  constituting the offense. (Burnett, supra, 71 Cal.App.4th at p. 173.) In Graff, supra, 170 Cal.App.4th at page 349, the Court of Appeal reversed the defendant's convictions on two  counts of violating section 288, subdivision (c)(1) (section 288(c)(1)) because the jury was permitted to convict  based on charges not established at the preliminary hearing. The defendant was initially charged with six counts of  violating section 288(c)(1). At the preliminary hearing, the victim testified to five incidents of lewd conduct committed  by the defendant, two of which involved the defendant watching her masturbate. Because the victim was not certain  whether the masturbation incidents occurred before or after she turned 16 years old, the magistrate dismissed the  two counts that were based on those incidents. (Id. at p. 351 and fn. 7.) After the preliminary hearing, an information  was filed charging the defendant with three counts of violating section 288(c)(1). (Id. at pp. 350-351.) At trial, the victim testified to the same five incidents of lewd conduct and was also allowed to testify concerning the  masturbation incidents ""as indicative of motive or intent"" under Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b). (Graff,  supra, 170 Cal.App.4th at p. 353.) The victim testified she was 15 years old when the first masturbation incident  occurred, but was unsure of her age when the second incident occurred. [*57]  (Id. at p. 354.) In closing argument,  defense counsel stated there were ""[n]o charge[s] concerning the masturbation episodes."" (Id. at p. 357.) In  rebuttal, the prosecutor disagreed and argued the defendant could be convicted of ""any lewd act that he committed  with [the victim] while she was 14 or 15 years old,"" including the masturbation incidents. (Id. at p. 358.) The jury  convicted the defendant of two counts of violating of section 288(c)(1). (Id. at p. 360.) The Court of Appeal, reversing, held ""[the defendant's] due process rights to notice of the charges against him were  violated by the prosecution's decision to go forward with charges not established at the preliminary hearing."" (Graff,  supra, 170 Cal.App.4th at p. 360.) The court concluded the magistrate was correct in ruling the prosecution failed to  present evidence at the preliminary hearing to show the masturbation incidents fell within the timeframe necessary  to establish a section 288(c)(1) violation. (Id. at p. 361.) The prosecution never sought, and the trial court never  granted, an amendment of the information to charge the defendant with violations of section 288(c) based on the  incidents of masturbation. (Id. at p. 362.) Thus, the defendant was wrongly convicted of offenses not established at  the preliminary hearing or charged in the information. The Court of Appeal concluded [*58]  the defendant suffered  prejudice from the prosecution's delay in making its theory known because ""[i]n cross-examining [the victim],  defense counsel had no reason to pin down the dates of the masturbation incidents or to impeach [the victim] with  her earlier testimony that she could not remember when either of the incidents occurred."" (Ibid.) Graff does not help Calhoun. In Graff, the defendant was convicted of violating section 288(c)(1) based on the  masturbation incidents even though the magistrate had dismissed the counts based on those incidents and the  prosecutor had never amended the information. Here, Calhoun was not convicted of any offense based on incidents  that had formed the basis of counts dismissed by the magistrate after the preliminary hearing. In addition, unlike the  Page 19 of 26   defendant in Graff, Calhoun has not demonstrated how any variance between the preliminary hearing testimony  and the information or the trial testimony had any effect on the way in which D.T. was cross-examined. III. Venue in Orange County Was Proper. After the prosecution rested, Calhoun brought an oral motion for judgment of acquittal under section 1118.1 on the  ground that Orange County was an improper venue for counts 4 through 7. He [*59]  contends the trial court erred  by denying the motion. A. Background At the preliminary hearing, D.T. testified that on June 1, 2016 she had oral sex with Calhoun in Santa Ana and had  five customers. That testimony was the basis for establishing venue in Orange County for counts 4 through 7. At  trial, D.T. testified she did not know where Calhoun engaged in oral sex and sexual intercourse with her except to  say it was somewhere in California. In opposition to Calhoun's motion for a judgment of acquittal for improper venue, the prosecutor argued that human  trafficking (count 1) was a continuous offense, and that the acts alleged in counts 4 through 7 were part of human  trafficking. Thus, the prosecutor argued, all of the counts were connected in their commission. In a written brief,  the prosecutor argued Calhoun's motion was untimely and should have been made before the start of trial. If timely,  the motion should be denied because venue in Orange County was proper under section 781 in that the offenses  were committed at least in part in Orange County and because venue was a fact to be established at the  preliminary hearing. At the preliminary hearing, D.T. testified at least one act of sexual intercourse [*60]  and one  act of oral copulation occurred in Orange County. Defense counsel argued in response that the matter was governed by section 784.7, subdivision (a), which governs  sex offenses where some are committed in one county, and some in another, and which allows cross-county filings  only upon written permission of the transferring county and a hearing assuring that the offenses are properly joined. The trial court concluded section 781 was the controlling statute. The court found that D.T. had testified at the  preliminary hearing the sexual acts had been committed in Orange County and her later trial testimony that she did  not know where the acts occurred was not in conflict. D.T.'s uncontradicted preliminary hearing testimony  established venue in Orange County under section 781. The court denied Calhoun's motion. B. Relevant Venue Statutes Section 777, which sets forth the basic rule of venue for criminal cases, states: ""[E]xcept as otherwise provided by  law the jurisdiction of every public offense is in the competent court within the jurisdictional territory of which it is  committed."" Under section 777, ""venue lies in the superior court of the county in which the crime was committed,  and a defendant may be tried there."" (People v. Posey (2004) 32 Cal.4th 193, 199, 8 Cal. Rptr. 3d 551, 82 P.3d 755  (Posey).) Venue is a question of law [*61]  to be decided by the court prior to trial. (Id. at p. 201.) When the criminal conduct is committed in more than one county, section 781 sets forth the basic rule. Section 781  states in relevant part: ""[W]hen a public offense is committed in part in one jurisdictional territory and in part in  another jurisdictional territory, or the acts or effects thereof constituting or requisite to the consummation of the  offense occur in two or more jurisdictional territories, the jurisdiction for the offense is in any competent court within     Page 20 of 26   either jurisdictional territory."" Under section 781, ""'where only a part of a crime has been committed in one county  and the other part or parts have been committed in another, venue lies where only a part of the crime was done.'""  (People v. Thomas (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1276, 1283, 140 Cal. Rptr. 3d 184, 274 P.3d 1170.) Section 784.7 governs venue for multiple violations of certain sex offenses. Subdivision (a) of section 784.7 states:  ""If more than one violation of Section 220, except assault with intent to commit mayhem, 261 [rape], 262 [spousal  rape], 264.1 [rape or genital penetration in concert], 269 [aggravated Sexual assault of a child], 286 [sodomy], 287,  288 [lewd or lascivious conduct with child under 14], 288.5 [continual sexual abuse of child], 288.7 [sexual acts with  a child 10 years or younger], or 289 [forcible sexual penetration] [*62]  or former Section 288a [oral copulation]  occurs in more than one jurisdictional territory, the jurisdiction of any of those offenses, and for any offenses  properly joinable with that offense, is in any jurisdiction where at least one of the offenses occurred, subject to a  hearing, pursuant to Section 954, within the jurisdiction of the proposed trial. At the section 954 hearing, the  prosecution shall present written evidence that all district attorneys in counties with jurisdiction of the offenses agree  to the venue. Charged offenses from jurisdictions where there is not a written agreement from the district attorney  shall be returned to that jurisdiction."" Section 784.7 governs venue only if no other statute authorizes trial in a  particular jurisdiction. (People v. Aleem (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1160, 51 Cal. Rptr. 3d 140.) Venue in Orange County for counts 1, 2, and 3 was proper under sections 781 and section 784.7, subdivision (c).  Section 784.7, subdivision (c) provides, in relevant part: ""If more than one violation of Section 236.1 [human  trafficking of a minor], 266h [pimping of a minor under the of 16], or 266i [pandering of a minor under the age of  16 by procuring] occurs in more than one jurisdictional territory, the jurisdiction of any of those offenses, and for any  offenses properly joinable with that offense, is in any jurisdiction where at least one of the offenses [*63]  occurred,  subject to a hearing pursuant to section 954, within the jurisdiction of the proposed trial."" C. D.T.'s Preliminary Hearing Testimony Established Venue in Orange County for Counts 4 Through 7. At the preliminary hearing, D.T. testified she had sexual intercourse and oral sex with Calhoun in Santa Ana on  June 1, 2016. She also testified she caught two dates that night before getting a bite to eat and caught two or three  dates after eating. At the preliminary hearing, the prosecutor stated count 6 was based on the theory that Calhoun  committed lewd and lascivious acts on D.T. by aiding and abetting those acts of prostitution in Santa Ana. D.T.'s  testimony conferred venue in Orange County over counts 5, 6, and 7 under section 777 and allowed joinder of  count 4. Count 5 (§ 261.5, subd. (d)) was not subject to section 784.7, subdivision (a). An alternate basis for venue  of count 5 was that it was alleged to have been committed as part of the human trafficking offense with acts or  effects in several counties and therefore venue in Orange County was proper under sections 781 and 784.7,  subdivision (c). Calhoun agrees Orange County venue was properly established at the preliminary hearing for counts 4 through 7.  He concedes he had no cause to challenge venue based on the preliminary hearing [*64]  testimony and he did not  challenge venue until after the prosecution rested at trial. He contends, however, that D.T.'s trial testimony  eliminated the factual basis for Orange County venue over counts 4 through 7 because at trial D.T. testified she did  not know where she orally copulated Calhoun except to say it was in California. D.T.'s trial testimony did not divest Orange County of venue for counts 4 through 7. We assume for argument's  sake that trial testimony could divest a court of venue once venue has been confirmed by evidence at the  preliminary hearing. We find it significant, as did the trial court, that D.T. did not testify she lied at the preliminary         Page 21 of 26   hearing about engaging in oral sex with Calhoun in Santa Ana. She testified at trial she did not know where that  happened. Thus, venue was not premised on false testimony. The trial court, in which venue decisions are vested  (Posey, supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 201), reached the same conclusion. As there was no contradiction between D.T.'s  preliminary hearing and trial testimony, and D.T. did not retract her preliminary hearing testimony, D.T.'s preliminary  hearing testimony remained sufficient to support venue under section 777. If, as Calhoun contends, D.T.'s [*65]   trial testimony were controlling on the issue of venue, then no county would have venue over counts 4 through 7. Upholding Orange County venue on counts 4 through 7 comports with the purposes for the criminal venue statutes  identified in People v. Simon, supra, 25 Cal.4th at page 1095. Calhoun does not contend that Orange County venue  caused him inconvenience or impaired his ability to obtain evidence or secure witnesses. To the contrary, he was  subject to trial on counts 1 through 3 in Orange County regardless of venue on the other counts. Defense evidence  and witnesses were the same for all counts. Calhoun was arrested in Orange County while engaging in acts of  human trafficking, pimping, and pandering, for which he was prosecuted. Orange County thus bore a reasonable  relationship to the criminal offenses, and it cannot be said the prosecution chose Orange County because it would  be more hostile to or burdensome for Calhoun. The people of Orange County have a right to judge Calhoun on  crimes committed here. Because we conclude D.T.'s preliminary hearing testimony established venue in Orange County over counts 4  through 7 under sections 777, 781, and 784.7, we need not address the Attorney General's arguments that Calhoun  forfeited a challenge to venue, [*66]  a motion under section 1118.1 was the wrong vehicle for challenging venue, or  that venue for the human trafficking count also established venue over counts 4, 6, and 7. IV. The Trial Court Did Not Err by Admitting Evidence of Text Messages from the Vortex Cell Phone and  Messages Related to Number (xxx) xxx-5542. Calhoun argues the trial court erred by admitting text messages from the Vortex cell phone and text messages to  and from the cell phone associated with the number (xxx) xxx-5542. He argues the prosecution failed to  authenticate the text messages as coming from numbers associated with him. A. Background Exhibit 19, the Cellebrite report for the Vortex cell phone, identified incoming and outgoing text messages from July  5, 2016 through November 5, 2016. Calhoun's trial counsel did not object to admission of exhibit 19. To avert an  ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we shall address Calhoun's argument that the trial court erred in admitting  it. The cell phone associated with the number (xxx) xxx-5542 was never recovered and so there is no Cellebrite report  for it. The Vortex cell phone and the ZTE cell phone (D.T.'s personal cell at the time D.T. was detained by  Hernandez) communicated with [*67]  the (xxx) xxx-5542 cell phone. Exhibit 35 is a collection of text messages to  and from number (xxx) xxx-5542. Calhoun's counsel objected to the admission of any evidence of text messages  from the (xxx) xxx-5542 cell phone to the Vortex cell phone or the ZTE cell phone on the ground the prosecutor  failed to lay a foundation to show the messages from the (xxx) xxx-5542 cell phone were made by Calhoun. B. Relevant Law A writing must be authenticated before it may be admitted into evidence. (Evid. Code, § 1401; People v. Goldsmith  (2014) 59 Cal.4th 258, 266, 172 Cal. Rptr. 3d 637, 326 P.3d 239.) Authentication is defined as ""the introduction of  evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that it is the writing that the proponent of the evidence claims it is"" or ""the  establishment of such facts by any other means provided by law."" (Evid. Code, § 1400.) The proponent of  documentary evidence has the burden of establishing authenticity and meets that burden by producing evidence  sufficient to sustain a finding the document is what it purports to be. (People v. Perez (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 598,  Page 22 of 26   621, 226 Cal. Rptr. 3d 820.) Authenticity may be established by the contents of the writing, or other means,  including circumstantial evidence, and the author's testimony is not required. (People v. Valdez (2011) 201  Cal.App.4th 1429, 1434-1435, 135 Cal. Rptr. 3d 628.) C. The Text Messages Were Properly Authenticated. 1. Vortex Cell Phone The prosecution produced sufficient [*68]  evidence to support a finding that the text messages related in exhibit 19  (the Cellebrite report for the Vortex cell phone) were between D.T. and Calhoun. Hernandez's testimony  established the Vortex cell phone belonged to Calhoun. Hernandez testified that when she stopped Stewart in May  2016 she searched his car and found two cell phones in the center console. D.T. told Hernandez the phones  belonged to Calhoun and the Vortex cell phone was used for text messages. D.T. said she took the cell phones with  her when she left Louie's house while Calhoun was away. The evidence also showed that, although the Vortex cell phone belonged to Calhoun, D.T. used that phone to  communicate with him. D.T. told Hernandez that she used the Vortex cell phone to communicate with Calhoun. In  addition, the contacts and messages reflected in the Cellebrite report establish that D.T. used the Vortex cell phone  to communicate with Calhoun. The Vortex cell phone had a contact for ""Daddy"" with Calhoun's photograph. Exhibit  19 shows the contact for Daddy is associated with the number (xxx) xxx-5542. Exhibit 19 shows two outgoing text messages (#83, #188) sent to (xxx) xxx-5542 that refer to ""John,"" and other  text [*69]  messages refer to pimping and prostitution. Incoming text messages from (xxx) xxx-5542 clearly are  from the pimp (#28: ""Hey wen u out there don't text""; #55: ""Do u have a condom""; #76: ""I got to get you some  condoms, I forgot""). Outgoing text messages to (xxx) xxx-5542 are clearly from the prostitute (#39: ""I got one that  has 40""; #48: ""I have the money""; #102 ""Daddy hows much long I got to be out here""). Calhoun argues the Vortex cell phone probably belonged to D.T. Whether the phone belonged to D.T. or to  Calhoun, the significant point is that the prosecution met its burden of establishing that D.T. used the cell phone to  communicate by text message with Calhoun at the (xxx) xxx-5542 number. 2. Phone No. (xxx) xxx-5542 The prosecution presented sufficient evidence to establish that the unrecovered phone associated with the number  (xxx) xxx-5542 belonged to Calhoun. There are at least two outgoing messages on the Vortex cell phone to the  number (xxx) xxx-5542 that refer to ""John."" Exhibit 35 is an extraction report for messages to or from (xxx) xxx- 5542. The messages listed on exhibit 35 are either to or from ""Daddy"" and most refer to pimping and prostitution.  Several messages (#11, [*70]  #45, and #55) sent to (xxx) xxx-5542 refer to ""John."" One message (#20) sent to  that number was ""Auntie said for u to call her."" Auntie was the nickname Calhoun used for Louie. Exhibit 34 is the Cellebrite report for D.T.'s personal ZTE cell phone. Entry number 146 on exhibit 34 is an incoming  message dated May 11, 2016 from Daddy at number (xxx) xxx-5542. The message reads in part, ""give me my  phones I need my white [one] I'm not playing."" D.T. told Hernandez the two phones found in the center console of  Stewart's car were taken from Calhoun. One phone was white. Hernandez detained D.T. on the night of May 11 or  the early morning of May 12, 2016. V. Expert Testimony on D.T.'s Statements Made During a Police Interview and on the Content of Text  Messages Was Admissible or Harmless Error. Calhoun argues the trial court erred by permitting Hernandez to testify about statements made by D.T. during her  police interview on May 11, 2016 and by permitting Hernandez and Medina to testify about the content of text  messages between D.T. and Calhoun. He argues the challenged testimony constituted case-specific hearsay made  Page 23 of 26   inadmissible by People v. Sanchez (2016) 63 Cal.4th 665, 204 Cal. Rptr. 3d 102, 374 P.3d 320 (Sanchez) and  violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront and cross-examine [*71]  witnesses. The Attorney General argues Calhoun forfeited his confrontation clause claim by not posing objections specifically  on that ground. Calhoun made a general objection to evidence about text messages and made a hearsay objection  to any testimony about statements made by D.T. to Hernandez. ""'[C]ounsel's failure to object to claimed evidentiary  error on the same ground asserted on appeal results in a forfeiture of the issue on appeal.'"" (People v. Redd (2010)  48 Cal.4th 691, 729, 108 Cal. Rptr. 3d 192, 229 P.3d 101.) Calhoun never specifically objected based on Sanchez  or the confrontation clause. But to avert an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we deem counsel's objections  sufficient to preserve those claims. A. Crawford v. Washington and Sanchez The confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution grants a criminal defendant the  right to confront adverse witnesses. (U.S. Const., 6th Amend.) Admission of testimonial hearsay is therefore barred  by the confrontation clause unless the speaker is unavailable to testify and the accused previously had the  opportunity to cross-examine the speaker, or the accused has forfeited the right to do so by his or her own  wrongdoing. (Crawford v. Washington (2004) 541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177.) In Sanchez, the California Supreme Court concluded the holding in Crawford applies to testimonial hearsay  information concerning a defendant's gang affiliation and activity. (Sanchez, supra, 63 Cal.4th at pp. 679-685.) In  Sanchez, the court held (1) [*72]  an expert witness may not relate as true case-specific facts asserted in hearsay  statements unless they are independently proven and (2) if a prosecution expert witness seeks to relate testimonial  hearsay, there is a violation of the federal confrontation unless there is a showing of unavailability, the defendant  had a prior opportunity for cross-examination, or forfeited that right by wrongdoing. (Id. at p. 686.) The California Supreme Court confirmed that an expert may rely on hearsay in forming an opinion but concluded an  expert may not relate case-specific facts asserted in hearsay statements ""unless they are independently proven by  competent evidence or are covered by a hearsay exception."" (Sanchez, supra, 63 Cal.4th at p. 686.) An expert may  ""testify about more generalized information to help jurors understand the significance of those case-specific facts.  An expert is also allowed to give an opinion about what those facts may mean."" (Id. at p. 676.) The court in  Sanchez explained that case-specific facts are those of which the expert has no independent knowledge and relate  ""to the particular events and participants alleged to have been involved in the case being tried."" (Ibid.) The expert  may render an opinion based on case-specific facts [*73]  but may not relate such facts unless they are within the  expert's personal knowledge. (Ibid.) The Sanchez court considered the permissible scope of expert testimony and adopted this rule: ""When any expert  relates to the jury case-specific out-of-court statements, and treats the content of those statements as true and  accurate to support the expert's opinion, the statements are hearsay. It cannot logically be maintained that the  statements are not being admitted for their truth. If the case is one in which a prosecution expert seeks to relate  testimonial hearsay, there is a confrontation clause violation unless (1) there is a showing of unavailability and (2)  the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination, or forfeited that right by wrongdoing."" (Sanchez, supra,  63 Cal.4th at p. 686, fn. omitted.) We assess prejudice resulting from the admission of expert testimony in violation of Sanchez under the standard of  Watson, supra, 46 Cal.2d at page 836. (People v. Flint (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 983, 1003-1004, 231 Cal. Rptr. 3d  910 (Flint); People v. Jeffrey G. (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 501, 510, 221 Cal. Rptr. 3d 88.) The Watson standard  applies ""even where the expert's testimony included multiple statements that were inadmissible under Sanchez.""  (Flint, supra, at p. 1004.) Under the Watson standard, reversal is required only if ""it is reasonably probable that a  result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence [*74]  of the error."" (Watson,  supra, 46 Cal.2d at p. 836.) B. Testimony on D.T.'s Statements Made During the Police Interview Was Admissible Under the Hearsay Exception  for Prior Consistent Statements. Page 24 of 26   When D.T. was detained in May 2016, she was taken to a sheriff's station where she was interviewed by  Hernandez and a sheriff's deputy. At trial, Hernandez testified about statements made by D.T. during the interview.  The Attorney General does not dispute the testimony was offered for the truth of the statements made by D.T. but  argues D.T.'s statements fell within the hearsay exception for prior consistent statements. Evidence Code section 1236 states: ""Evidence of a statement previously made by a witness is not made  inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement is consistent with his testimony at the hearing and is offered in  compliance with Section 791."" Evidence Code section 791, subdivision (b) allows a prior consistent statement if  ""[a]n express or implied charge has been made that his testimony at the hearing is recently fabricated or is  influenced by bias or other improper motive, and the statement was made before the bias, motive for fabrication, or  other improper motive is alleged to have arisen."" Calhoun concedes that express and implied charges of fabrication were made throughout D.T.'s trial [*75]   testimony. ""This broad, implicit charge of fabrication"" allowed the introduction of D.T.'s prior consistent statements.  (People v. Kopatz (2015) 61 Cal.4th 62, 86, 186 Cal. Rptr. 3d 797, 347 P.3d 952.) Calhoun contends D.T.'s  statements made during the interview were inconsistent with her trial testimony and D.T. admitted at trial that some  statements made during the interview were false. We agree with the Attorney General that D.T.'s statements made during the interview, and related by Hernandez in  her testimony, were for the most part consistent with D.T.'s trial testimony. Most significantly, D.T. told Hernandez  and testified at trial that Calhoun was her pimp, he drove her to several blades to work as a prostitute, she had  been working for Calhoun for several months, and he physically abused her. Calhoun does not entirely disagree; instead, he identifies four categories of statements made by D.T. during the  interview which he contends either were inconsistent with her trial testimony or admitted to be false. (1) Calhoun asserts: ""[D.T.] never testified on direct that Mr. Calhoun believed she was 14 years old. [D.T.] never  testified that Mr. Calhoun punched her in the jaw. [D.T.] never testified that Mr. Calhoun required a trap of $500 to  $600 a night and if [*76]  she did not make her trap, Mr. Calhoun would hit her. [D.T.] also never testified that Mr.  Calhoun's cousin Raymond threatened to shoot her up."" This assertion is correct. But, as the Attorney General  points out, there was abundant evidence that on one occasion Calhoun punched D.T. on the left side of her face,  giving her a black eye, and that on another occasion he hit her in the face several times with the back of his hand.  Admission of the other statements was harmless: The evidence established that Calhoun used violence against  D.T., and whether or not Calhoun punched her in the jaw, he did punch her. Raymond's threat to shoot D.T. did not  implicate Calhoun. Whether or not Calhoun believed or knew D.T. was 14 years old is immaterial because mistake  of fact about a minor victim's age is not a defense to human trafficking, pimping a child, or procuring a child. (§  236.1, subd. (e); People v. Branch (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 516, 521-522, 109 Cal. Rptr. 3d 412.) (2) Calhoun asserts D.T., at trial, admitted the following statements made during the police interview were false:  Stewart was her boyfriend, she first had sex with him, he turned her into a prostitute, and she stayed with him  when she had nowhere to go. Stewart was her pimp and told her ""the rules"" for being a prostitute. [*77]  Those  statements were inconsistent with D.T.'s trial testimony and should have been excluded. The error was harmless  given the overwhelming evidence that Calhoun committed the charged offenses. Indeed, the error redounded to his  benefit, because the inconsistency undermined D.T.'s credibility. (3) Calhoun asserts D.T. was not telling the truth when she told Hernandez that Calhoun had taken her ""multiple  times"" to the blade in Orange County. At trial, D.T. testified the first time and only time she went to Orange County  was on the night she was arrested (June 1-2, 2016). Hernandez testified D.T. had said Calhoun drove her to  several blades, including Harbor Boulevard in Orange County, to work as a prostitute. D.T.'s statement to  Hernandez was inconsistent with D.T.'s trial testimony. Error in admitting evidence of the statement was harmless  given the overwhelming evidence that Calhoun committed the charged offenses. Indeed, the error redounded to his  benefit, because the inconsistency undermined D.T.'s credibility. Page 25 of 26   (4) Calhoun asserts D.T. was not telling the truth when she said at the interview she and Calhoun had had sex  several times. He does not provide a citation to the record for [*78]  D.T.'s statement to Hernandez. We decline to  consider the assertion. C. Any Sanchez Error Was Harmless. Calhoun contends the trial court committed Sanchez error and violated his confrontation clause rights by permitting  Hernandez and Medina to testify about the content of text messages between D.T. and Calhoun. Any conceivable  Sanchez error was harmless because the content of the text messages was independently proven through the  Cellebrite reports and extracts from those reports, which were properly authenticated and admitted into evidence as  exhibits 19, 21-26, and 33-35. (Flint, supra, 22 Cal.App.5th at p. 1000.) In addition, as the Attorney General argues, the content of the text messages between Calhoun and D.T. was  admissible under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule, Evidence Code section 1223. Hearsay  statements made by coconspirators are admissible against a party if the offering party presents independent  evidence to establish the prima facie existence of a conspiracy. (People v. Hardy (1992) 2 Cal.4th 86, 139, 5 Cal.  Rptr. 2d 796, 825 P.2d 781.) ""Once independent proof of a conspiracy has been shown, three preliminary facts  must be established: '(1) that the declarant was participating in a conspiracy at the time of the declaration; (2) that  the declaration was in furtherance of the objective of that conspiracy; and (3) [*79]  that at the time of the  declaration the party against whom the evidence is offered was participating or would later participate in the  conspiracy.'"" (Ibid.) Sufficient evidence was presented at trial to establish the prima facie existence of a conspiracy between Calhoun  and D.T. A prostitute can conspire with a pimp; their functions are ""interrelated"" and one aids and abets the other.  (People v. Ambrose (1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 136, 139, 227 Cal. Rptr. 885.) Sufficient evidence at trial was presented  to establish the three preliminary facts necessary to make the coconspirator statements admissible. The challenged  text messages were by D.T. or Calhoun while he was pimping her (while participating in the conspiracy), the  messages all dealt with pimping and prostitution (the object of the conspiracy), and Calhoun (the party against  whom the evidence was offered) was participating in pimping when the text messages were sent or received. D. There Was No Confrontation Clause Violation. There was no confrontation clause violation because the text messages were not testimonial. In determining  whether a hearsay statement is testimonial, ""the question is whether, in light of all the circumstances, viewed  objectively, the 'primary purpose' of the conversation was to 'creat[e] an out-of-court substitute for [*80]  trial  testimony."" (Ohio v. Clark (2015) ___ U.S. ___ [135 S.Ct. 2173, 2180, 192 L. Ed. 2d 306].) ""Testimonial statements  are those made primarily to memorialize facts relating to past criminal activity, which could be used like trial  testimony. Nontestimonial statements are those whose primary purpose is to deal with an ongoing emergency or  some other purpose unrelated to preserving facts for later use at trial."" (Sanchez, supra, 63 Cal.4th at p. 689.) We question whether the text messages are hearsay and thus even subject to exclusion under the confrontation  clause. We do not need to decide that issue because the text messages are not in the least bit testimonial. The  messages were informal, did not involve law enforcement, and did not have the primary purpose of creating a  substitute for trial testimony or memorializing facts relating to past criminal history. VI. The Trial Court Stayed Execution of Sentence on Counts 2, 3, and 5 Pursuant to Section 654. Calhoun argues the trial court erred by imposing concurrent sentences on counts 2, 3, and 5 instead of staying  execution of sentence on those counts under section 654. The trial court stayed execution of sentence on those  counts. At the sentencing, the court stated, ""stayed 654 of the Penal Code,"" as to counts 2, 3, and 5. The court  Page 26 of 26   minutes have the entry ""stayed pursuant to Penal Code section 654"" for the [*81]  sentence on each of those  counts. The abstract of judgment indicates the sentences on counts 2, 3, and 5 as being stayed under section 654. DISPOSITION The judgment is affirmed. FYBEL, J. WE CONCUR: MOORE, ACTING P. J. ARONSON, J.",1

To obtain relief pursuant to § 2255, a defendant must establish  ""a constitutional error, a lack of jurisdiction in the sentencing court, or an error of law or fact that constitutes a  fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice.""

Where the defendant has procedurally defaulted a claim by failing to raise it on direct appeal, the claim may be  raised pursuant to § 2255 only if the petitioner can demonstrate (1) cause for the failure to raise the claim and  prejudice from the alleged error, or (2) actual innocence of the crime. Id. Nearly all of Barnes's present grounds for relief were raised in his direct appeal, and rejected by the Second Circuit.  In his § 2255 motion, for example, Barnes asserts grounds relating to alleged defects in the indictment. The Court  of Appeals rejected those arguments. While Barnes continues to try to find something wrong with the indictment, in  the hope that he might at last strike upon a winning argument, the Second Circuit explicitly found that there was no  error in the indictment. 852 F.App'x at 563. The Court of Appeals likewise rejected Barnes's challenges to this  Court's jurisdiction, and his arguments relating to the Government's alleged subornation of perjury with respect to  his codefendant. Id. at 562-63. To the extent that the Court of Appeals did not explicitly address some of the specifics of Barnes's arguments on  appeal, which he now relies on in his § 2255 motion, that is inconsequential. It is presumed that the [**4]  appellate  court considered every argument raised on appeal, whether the court expressly discussed them or not. See  Spaulding v. United States, No. 3:09cv0358, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143977, 2010 WL 7865082, at *3 (D.Conn.  Dec. 3, 2010) (""it matters not whether an issue raised on appeal was directly addressed"" by the court of appeals);  Griffith v. United States, No. 03 Civ. 7860, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22545, 2005 WL 245071, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 6,  2005) (""[I]t is presumed that the Second Circuit considered each argument and this Court does not now have the  right to permit the Defendant[ ] to relitigate them""). Furthermore, at the end of its decision affirming Barnes's conviction, the Second Circuit stated, ""We have  considered all of Barnes's remaining arguments and find them either to be waived or without merit."" 852 F.App'x at  564. It could not be any clearer, then, that the court rejected Barnes's hodgepodge of challenges to his conviction. In his § 2255 motion, Barnes has come up with one ground that he did not assert in his direct appeal. He now  claims that the magistrate judge assigned to his case lacked jurisdiction to issue his arrest warrant because the  affidavit in support of the warrant was not signed under penalty of perjury.   Page 3 of 3   As stated, however, where a defendant asserts a ground for relief in a § 2255 motion that he did not raise on direct  appeal, the claim is barred unless the defendant can show cause and prejudice, [**5]  or (2) actual innocence.  Barnes has shown neither. There is no reason why he could not have raised this argument on direct appeal. And  while all of his arguments are meritless, if not frivolous, Barnes is apparently wise enough not to assert actual  innocence. There was a mountain of evidence against Barnes, including his own testimony. Barnes's present claims are therefore procedurally barred. But even if they were  [*335]  not so barred, they are  meritless. Both this Court and the Court of Appeals have already considered and rejected his arguments, and there  is no reason now to restate all the reasons why his grounds for relief have no basis in fact or law. I also find that there is no need for an evidentiary hearing in this case. Under § 2255(b), the district court is not  required to hold an evidentiary proceeding when ""the files and records of the case conclusively show that the  prisoner is entitled to no relief."" A hearing is also often unnecessary when the judge who presided over the  underlying proceeding also decides the § 2255 motion. Puglisi v. United States, 586 F.3d 209, 214 (2d Cir. 2009).  In the case at bar, I am well familiar with the facts and the record. Barnes's motion is meritless on its face, and he  has advanced no arguments that call for any further [**6]  development of the record. Finally, the Court notes that in addition to his § 2255 motion, Barnes has filed several other motions for various  relief. These are all moot (such as his motion to quash his arrest warrant), or patently meritless (such as his ""motion  to dismiss"" based on the federal admiralty rules). The Court has reviewed these motions, most of which were filed  prior to the filing of his § 2255 motion, and I find them to be without merit.",1
"United States v. Mahee, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216654","OPINION AND ORDER The Court issues this written opinion and order to further  explain its oral ruling made during Richard Mahee's  sentencing on November 28, 2023, which concluded  that Mahee was not entitled to a ""zero point offender""  downward adjustment under § 4C1.1 of the United  States Sentencing Guidelines. I. Legal Issue Section 4C1.1 of the United States Sentencing  Guidelines (USSG or Guidelines) became effective on  November 1, 2023. It provides in relevant part: (a) ADJUSTMENT.—If the defendant meets all of  the following criteria: . . . . (10) the defendant did not receive an  adjustment under § 3B1.1 (Aggravating Role)  and was not engaged in a continuing criminal  enterprise, as defined in 21 U.S.C. § 848; decrease the offense level determined under  Chapters Two and Three by 2 levels. USSG § 4C1.1 (emphasis added) (the Zero-Point  Offender Adjustment). The parties disagreed on whether  Mahee was entitled to the Zero-Point Offender  Adjustment. [*2]  The Court concluded that he was not. II. Background Mahee and nine others were indicted in December 2021  on various charges related to a scheme to improperly  obtain loans through the federal Paycheck Protection  Program (PPP). On February 8, 2023, Mahee pleaded  guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud as charged in  Count 1 of the indictment. At sentencing, the Court  determined, without any objection from the parties, that  Mahee was subject to a 4-level aggravating role  enhancement under § 3B1.1 of the Guidelines. That  Guideline provides for an increase in the offense level if  the defendant served as an organizer or leader of  criminal activity involving at least five participants (the  Aggravating Role Adjustment).             Page 2 of 4 In its sentencing memorandum and during the  sentencing hearing, the Government objected to the  application of the Zero-Point Offender Adjustment on  the basis that Mahee was ineligible for it given the  Court's application of the Aggravating Role Adjustment.  Specifically, the Government argued that a defendant  could not be eligible for the Zero-Point Offender  Adjustment unless he satisfied both elements in §  4C1.1(a)(10)—meaning a defendant who received  either an Aggravating Role Adjustment or was engaged  in a continuing [*3]  criminal enterprise was disqualified. Mahee advocated for application of the Zero-Point  Offender Adjustment notwithstanding the aggravating  role finding, contending that the word ""and"" in USSG §  4C1.1(a)(10) ""should be taken literally as it reads,"" and  relying on United States v. Garcon, 54 F.4th 1274 (11th  Cir. 2022) (en banc). In short, Mahee's argument was  that because he was only subject to the Aggravating  Role Adjustment and was not engaged in a continuing  criminal enterprise (CCE), he was eligible for the  reduction. III. Discussion The Court begins and ends its analysis with the text of §  4C1.1(a), which is unambiguous. A defendant is only  entitled to the Zero-Point Offender Adjustment in §  4C1.1(a) if he meets every criterion listed in  subsections (1) through (10): ""If the defendant meets all  of the following . . . ."" USSG § 4C1.1(a) (emphasis  added). Those criteria are described in the negative— identifying things that the defendant cannot have done  and that the offense cannot have involved in order for  the downward adjustment to apply: (1) the defendant did not receive any criminal  history points from Chapter Four, Part A; (2)  the  defendant  did  not  receive  an  adjustment under §3A1.4 (Terrorism); (3) the defendant did not use violence or  credible threats of violence in connection with  the offense;     (4) the offense did not [*4]  result in death or  serious bodily injury; (5) the instant offense of conviction is not a  sex offense; (6) the defendant did not personally cause  substantial financial hardship; (7) the defendant did not possess, receive,  purchase, transport, transfer, sell, or otherwise  dispose of a firearm or other dangerous  weapon (or induce another participant to do so)  in connection with the offense; (8) the instant offense of conviction is not  covered  by  §2H1.1  (Offenses  Involving  Individual Rights); (9)  the  defendant  did  not  receive  an  adjustment  under  §3A1.1  (Hate  Crime  Motivation or Vulnerable Victim) or §3A1.5  (Serious Human Rights Offense); and (10) the defendant did not receive an  adjustment under §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role)  and was not engaged in a continuing criminal  enterprise, as defined in 21 U.S.C. § 848; decrease the offense level determined under  Chapters Two and Three by 2 levels. Id. (emphasis added). Reading the full context makes clear that the Zero-Point  Offender Adjustment can only apply when the defendant  has not done any of the things listed. If a defendant (or  the crime) meets just one of the listed factors, the  adjustment is not available. To be eligible, then, Mahee  cannot  have  received  an  Aggravating  Role  Adjustment. [*5]  He cannot have been engaged in a  CCE. The crime of which he was convicted cannot have  been a sex offense. He cannot have used violence in  the commission of the crime. And so on. Since he  conceded he was subject to the Aggravating Role  Adjustment and the Court applied it, Mahee is not  eligible for the Zero-Point Offender Adjustment. Mahee's read of § 4C1.1(a) would treat ""and"" in  subsection (10) to mean ""but."" His argument was that  he is entitled to the downward adjustment because he  did not both (1) receive an Aggravating Role Adjustment  and (2) engage in a CCE. As two appellate courts have  concluded in interpreting a very similar restriction,  however, Mahee's argument would only be correct if the  provision ""were phrased in terms of what the  Page 3 of 4 government would have to prove was true of the  defendant, but . . . the statute is phrased in terms of  what the defendant must show was not true of him.""  United States v. Draheim, 958 F.3d 651, 657 (7th Cir.  2020) (emphasis in original) (quoting United States v.  Bazel, 80 F.3d 1140, 1143 (6th Cir. 1996)). In Bazel, the Sixth Circuit interpreted use of the word  ""and"" in the safety-valve provision of the First Step Act,  18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(4), and corresponding Guideline, §  5C1.2. 80 F.3d 1140. The relevant language in Bazel is  effectively the same as that at issue here. Specifically, §  3553(f) provides: [T]he court shall impose a sentence . . . without  regard [*6]  to any statutory minimum sentence, if  the court finds at sentencing . . . that— . . . (4) the defendant was not an organizer, leader,  manager, or supervisor of others in the offense,  as determined under the sentencing guidelines  and was not engaged in a continuing criminal  enterprise, as defined in section 408 of the  Controlled Substances Act . . . . (Emphasis added.) Similar to the situation here, Bazel had not been found  to have participated in a CCE but did have an  aggravating role. Id. at 1141. Bazel made the same  argument that Mahee did—asserting the safety valve  should be applied because he was not both (1) a leader  in the offense and (2) engaged in a CCE. Id. at 1142.  The appellate court rejected that argument: Section 3553(f) and § 5C1.2 thus require the court  to make a finding both that the defendant was not  an ""organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor"" and  that the defendant was not engaged in a CCE in  order to open the ""safety valve."" Once the district  court determined that Bazel was an ""organizer,  leader, manager, or supervisor,"" it could not make  one of the findings necessary to opening the ""safety  valve."" Id. (emphasis in original). In rejecting the same type of  argument by the defendant in Draheim, the Seventh  Circuit adopted Bazel's reasoning. 958 F.3d 651. Mahee nevertheless contended [*7]  that the Court  should rely on the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in Garcon.    There, the court addressed the meaning of the word  ""and"" in a different subsection of the safety-valve  provision—§ 3553(f)(1). That section provides that the  defendant is eligible for the safety valve if he does not  have ""(A) more than 4 criminal history points . . .; (B) a  prior 3-point offense . . .; and (C) a prior 2-point violent  offense."" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1)(C) (emphasis added).  The Eleventh Circuit held that ""and"" really means  ""and""—i.e., the safety valve can be applied to the  defendant unless he meets (A), (B), and (C). This  makes sense given the structure of the provision. As  Garcon concluded, ""when 'and' is used to connect a list  of requirements, the word ordinarily has a 'conjunctive'  sense, meaning that all the requirements must be met.""  54 F.4th at 1278 (citing United States v. Palomar- Santiago,     U.S.    , 141 S. Ct. 1615, 1620-21, 209 L.  Ed. 2d 703 (2021)). Mahee argued that the Court should apply the same  logic to its interpretation of subsection (10) of the Zero- Point Offender Adjustment. But this ignores the  difference in structure between § 3553(f)(1) and USSG  § 4C1.1(a)(10). Subsections (A), (B), and (C) in §  3553(f)(1) list one set of factors, only the full set of  which will disqualify the defendant from safety-valve  consideration. By contrast, subsection (10) of § 4C1.1  (as does § 3553(f)(4)) identifies two separate role  adjustments the defendant must avoid to be eligible [*8]   for the Zero-Point Offender Adjustment. Section  4C1.1(a)(10) can only be properly read as allowing  application of that adjustment if the defendant ""did not  receive"" an Aggravating Role Adjustment and the  defendant ""was not engaged in"" a CCE. As the Bazel court explained, a defendant cannot  successfully argue that he must meet all of the  requirements in each subsection of § 3553(f)(1) through  (5), but that he need not meet ""the separate  requirements of the two portions of § 3553(f)(4)  separated by the word 'and.'"" 80 F.3d at 1144. Similarly  here, Mahee could not demonstrate entitlement to the  Zero-Point Offender Adjustment by arguing that he met  all of the requirements of subsections (1) through (9) but  only one of two parts contained in § 4C1.1(a)(10) that  are separated by the word ""and.""",0
"United States v. Lofstead, 574 F. Supp. 3d 831","[*835]  ORDER I. SUMMARY Defendant Jeffrey Lofstead was indicted on one count of attempted sex trafficking of children in violation of 18  U.S.C. §§ 1591(a), 1591(b)(2), and 1594(a). (ECF No. 1.) Lofstead now moves to dismiss the indictment, arguing  the underlying investigation violated fundamental notions of fairness and his Fifth Amendment right to due process.  (ECF No. 21.) Lofstead also moves to suppress the results of the search of his cell phone, arguing the search was  performed pursuant to an impermissibly broad warrant. (ECF No. 22.) The Court heard argument on both motions  on October 15, 2021 (""the Hearing""). (ECF No. 41.) As explained further below,  [*836]  the Court will grant the  motion to suppress because the warrant was fatally overbroad and lacked particularity. However, because the  Court finds the government's reverse sting operation violated fundamental fairness, the Court will dismiss the  indictment. II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND A. The Task Force and Operation [**2]  In October 2020, the FBI's Northern Nevada Child Exploitation and Human Trafficking Task Force (""Task Force"")  initiated a reverse-sting operation (""Operation"") targeting individuals seeking to purchase commercial sex from  minors. (ECF No. 21 at 3.) The Operation's stated purpose is to ""directly address the intentional purchase of sex  from minors utilizing common escort websites."" (ECF No. 40-1 at 2.) Per the operational plan, the ""driving legal  authority"" was Nevada statute found at NRS § 201.354(1)-(2), which the operational plan describes as criminalizing  ""solicitation of a child."" (Id.) Although Nevada does not criminalize general consensual sex between parties who  are both over 16, commercial sex is restricted to those over 18. In other words, a 63-year-old man could engage  in sexual activity with a 16-year-old girl without criminal penalty under Nevada law, but would commit a class B  felony if he solicits commercial sex from that same girl or engages in non-commercial sexual activity with anyone  younger than 16. The Operation targeted the latter offense. Task Force agents posted an advertisement on the website www.skipthegames.com, which is known to law  enforcement as a place where [**3]  commercial sex is solicited and arranged. (ECF Nos. 21 at 3, 40-1 at 2.) Per  the operational plan, the advertisements were placed ""prior to the operation"" and detectives had ""established a  client base."" (ECF No. 40-1 at 2.) The Task Force's advertisement stated it was posted by ""Emma,"" a 19-year-old            Page 8 of 24   ""young busty brunette."" (ECF No. 21-1 at 2-4.) Four pictures of a 23-year-old woman depicted ""Emma"" to users.  (ECF No. 21 at 4.) A phone number was available for prospective clients to text, which was operated by an  undercover detective. (ECF Nos. 21-1 at 3, 29 at 3.) In total, the operation resulted in 28 arrests within a four-day period. (ECF Nos. 21 at 8, 29 at 15.) B. Lofstead's Involvement Lofstead responded to the ""Emma"" advertisement on Skip the Games by calling the listed number at 7:24 p.m. on  October 7, 2020. (ECF No. 21-2 at 2.) When ""Emma"" did not pick up, he texted ""Hey."" (Id.) A Task Force agent  responded, and Lofstead then texted and talked on the phone with the agent intermittently for around three and a  half hours. (Id. at 2-4.)  [*837]  After saying hello, Lofstead asked how much ""Emma"" charged and whether she had  ""incall,"" a term commonly used in commercial sex work that means the [**4]  provider has a location to meet with  clients. (ECF No. 29 at 3.) Law enforcement noted that Lofstead appeared to be familiar with commonly used  commercial sex terms, including slang for hourly rates and oral sex. (Id.) When the agent responded that she had a house in South Reno, Lofstead asked ""If your [sic] in a house, aren't  there roomates [sic]."" (ECF No. 21-2 at 2.) The agent responded ""no my parents are out of town rn."" (Id.) Less than  a minute later Lofstead asked the agent ""how old are you really,"" clarifying ""I don't want 15,"" asking for confirmation  that the person he was texting was at least 16. (Id.) The agent said ""Emma"" was 16. (Id.) After receiving that  reassurance, Lofstead asked if she would be interested in smoking marijuana, and if she would join him at his  house ""at the lake"" instead of meeting at her parents' house. (Id.) The agent responded that ""Emma"" would meet  with Lofstead if he would pick her up because she did not have a car. (Id.) Lofstead again attempted to confirm ""Emma""'s age, asking her to send a picture of her ID ""so I know your [sic] at  least 16."" (Id.) The agent responded that she did not have an ID with her date of birth. (Id.) Lofstead also  asked [**5]  for a photo that was different from the ones posted on the website, for a ""kind of verification."" (Id. at 3.)  The agent sent another photo. (Id.) After they had been texting for about an hour, the agent asked, ""So u coming or  what?"" (Id.) Lofstead responded, ""To be honest I'm worried you may not be 16."" (Id.) After the agent again assured  him ""Emma"" was 16, Lofstead responded ""Maybe I'll come you can Get high and we can meet each other."" (Id.)  The agent rejected this offer, texting ""Not to be rude baby, but if ur coming I need the $$ for the time ya know."" (Id.) After this exchange, Lofstead attempted to call the agent, but she did not pick up and said that her ""girlfriend"" had  come over. (Id.) Lofstead asked ""Does she do this too,"" to which the agent responded yes, but said ""she's under  your limit tho."" (Id.) Lofstead then changed the subject back to the agent, asking her how long she had been ""doing  this"" and asking if she was aroused. (Id.) The agent affirmed, and reintroduced the subject of her ""under-limit""  friend. (Id.) The agent and Lofstead then spoke on the phone, and Lofstead responded that he ""can't do that."" (ECF  No. 21 at 5.) When the agent responded that it was only ""a [**6]  year difference,"" Lofstead said that in Nevada  ""that's a big thing."" (Id. at 6.) Having clarified that Lofstead was not interested in paying for sex with ""Emma""'s 15-year-old friend and that  ""Emma"" was 16, Lofstead texted that he was getting ready to leave at 9:46 p.m. (ECF No. 21-2 at 3.) The agent told  him to ""hurry."" (Id.) Less than 15 minutes later, the agent asked ""on ur way still?"" (Id. at 4.) When Lofstead arrived  at the agreed upon location at approximately 10:45 p.m., he was arrested. (Id.; ECF No. 21 at 6.) C. Warrant and Search Upon Lofstead's arrest on October 7, 2020, law enforcement seized his smartphone. (ECF No. 22 at 2.) On  November 3, 2020, FBI Special Agent Paul Cline applied for a search warrant for the phone. (ECF No. 31-1.)  Special Agent Cline stated in the warrant affidavit that there was probable cause to believe the phone contained  evidence of or was used in the commission of: (1) the charged offenses, (2) attempting to transport an individual  Page 9 of 24   under 18 with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, and (3) attempting to  [*838]  travel over state lines  with another person for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct. (Id. at 4.) The attached list of items [**7]  to be searched for and seized within the phone included, but was not limited to: • Item 1: ""Any and all records and materials that may be found within [the phone], in any format and media  (including, but not limited to; images videos, e-mails, chat logs, text messages, instant messages and  electronic messages), pertaining to the Target Offenses."" (Id. at 13.) • Item 2: ""Any and all documents, records, or correspondence, in any format or medium (including but not  limited to, e-mail messages, chat logs and electronic messages, and other digital data files) pertaining to the  Target Offenses."" (Id.) • Item 3: ""Evidence of any online storage, e-mail or other remote computer storage subscription to include  unique software of such subscription, user logs or archived data that show connection to such service, and  user login and passwords for such service."" (Id.) • Item 6: ""Any and all material depicting or concerning the sexual exploitation of children, including but not  limited to any child pornography . . . or any type of sexually explicit conduct involving children."" (Id. at 14.) The warrant affidavit did not include a temporal limitation on materials to be searched. It also authorized the  FBI [**8]  to ""deliver a complete copy of the seized or copied electronic data to the custody and control of attorneys  for the government and their support staff for their independent review."" (Id. at 16.) United States Magistrate Judge William G. Cobb issued the warrant on November 3, 2020 (""the Warrant""). (Id. at  2.) III. MOTION TO SUPPRESS Lofstead argues the results of the search of his smartphone must be suppressed because the warrant relies on  unlawfully intercepted wire communications, is unsupported by probable cause, is overbroad, and lacks sufficient  particularity. (ECF No. 22.) HN1[ ] Because federal law allows any party to a conversation to record that  conversation, see 18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(c), the Court considers only whether the warrant was supported by  probable cause and sufficiently specific. Lofstead claims that evidence seized from his cell phone should be suppressed because the Warrant amounts to a  general warrant, lacking any cognizable limitations and exceeding the government's demonstrated probable cause.  (ECF No. 22.) The government concedes that the Warrant is in some ways overbroad, but counters first that  exclusion is not justified because the good faith exception applies, and in the alternative that [**9]  only evidence  obtained from an overbroad aspect of a warrant should be suppressed. (ECF No. 31.) As explained further below,  the Court agrees that the Warrant is overbroad and lacks the requisite particularity. The Court examines first the  appropriate standards for searches of electronically stored information (""ESI""), then turns to whether there was  probable cause to search for the identified items in the Warrant. Because the Warrant authorized a search for  evidence  [*839]  unsupported by probable cause, the Court considers whether the Warrant was overbroad or  insufficiently particular. Finding the warrant is both, the Court then considers the government's good faith argument  and the appropriate exclusion remedy.     Page 10 of 24   A. Search Warrants for Electronically Stored Information (""ESI"") HN2[ ] The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment, which states ""no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable  cause, . . . and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized,"" presents  unique interpretative difficulties in the context of electronically stored information, or ""ESI."" As the Supreme Court  noted in Riley v. California, ""[m]odern cell phones, as a category, implicate privacy concerns far beyond those  implicated [**10]  by the search of a cigarette pack, a wallet, or a purse."" 573 U.S. 373, 393, 134 S. Ct. 2473, 189 L.  Ed. 2d 430 (2014). But despite the fact that many electronic devices contain our most personal and private  information, courts have expressly acknowledged that ""'[o]ver-seizing' is an accepted reality in electronic searching  because '[t]here is no way to be sure exactly what an electronic file contains without somehow examining its  contents.'"" United States v. Flores, 802 F.3d 1028, 1044-45 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting United States v.  Comprehensive Drug Testing, Inc., 621 F.3d 1162, 1176-77 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc) (""CDT"")). District courts nationwide have begun expressing concerns about over-searching ESI, especially because warrants  often authorize the government to seize large quantities of personal information that it lacks probable cause to  search. HN3[ ] Indeed, the Ninth Circuit has admonished courts ""to exercise 'greater vigilance' in protecting  against the danger that the process of identifying seizable electronic evidence could become a vehicle for the  government to gain access to a larger pool of data that it has no probable cause to collect."" Schesso, 730 F.3d at  1042 (quoting CDT, 621 F.3d at 1177)). Ensuring appropriate limitations within the warrant is therefore crucial to  prevent a search ""from turning into a general dragnet."" Flores, 802 F.3d at 1045 (listing certain recognized  limitations, including the requirement that a warrant ""specify the particular [**11]  crime for which the evidence is  sought,"" rejecting retainment of ""unresponsive data"" under the plain view doctrine, and finding suspect the use of  over-seized data for ""broader investigative purposes"").  [*840]  But how courts in the Ninth Circuit ensure that a warrant to search ESI complies with the Fourth  Amendment is somewhat unclear and remains in flux. HN4[ ] Indeed, the court has clarified that ""the proper  balance between the government's interest in law enforcement and the right of individuals to be free from  unreasonable searches and seizures of electronic data must be determined on a case-by-case basis."" Schesso,  730 F.3d at 1050. Bearing this in mind, the Court considers whether the warrant was supported by probable cause  and sufficiently particular to protect Lofstead's Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure. B. Probable Cause Lofstead argues the Warrant relies on two faulty premises for probable cause that impermissibly expanded the  scope of the search of his phone. First, Lofstead claims the Warrant improperly conflated the sex trafficking  charge with grounds to search for child pornography. (ECF No. 22 at 8.) Second, Lofstead claims that probable  cause for [**12]  a single incident of a crime does not justify an inference that multiple incidents have occurred. (Id.               Page 11 of 24   at 10; ECF No. 34 at 4.) Because the government only had probable cause to search for evidence of the attempted  sex trafficking of ""Emma,"" Lofstead argues that any search predicated on the inference that he serially solicited  sex from minors was impermissibly broad. HN5[ ] ""Probable cause is established if an affidavit presents a 'fair probability' that evidence of criminal activity  will be found in the place to be searched."" Flores, 802 F.3d at 1043 (citing Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103  S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983)). When warrants are supported by probable cause and the search itself  conforms with the terms of the warrant, the court has found suppression is not warranted. See Schesso, 730 F.3d  at 1050-51. Great deference is given to an issuing judge's finding that a warrant is supported by probable cause,  and the finding is reviewed for clear error. See Flores, 802 F.3d at 1043. 1. Child Pornography At the Hearing, the government conceded portions of the Warrant were likely overbroad. In particular, the  government conceded there likely was not probable cause to search Lofstead's phone for evidence of child  pornography. The Court agrees. Not only was there no indication that Lofstead viewed, possessed, or shared child  pornography [**13]  in this or any other investigation, none of the target offenses in the indictment even involved  child pornography. That Lofstead may have attempted to purchase commercial sex from a minor does not  automatically imply that he possessed or attempted to possess child pornography, nor does the excerpted  conversation from Lofstead's text conversation with the agent included in the warrant affidavit support a ""fair  possibility"" that his phone would contain child pornography. Accordingly, Item 6 in Attachment B of the warrant  affidavit is not supported by probable cause. 2. Multiple Offenses In response to Lofstead's contention that the Warrant lacked necessary content and temporal limitations, the  government argued there was probable cause for a broader search because Lofstead's ""clear experience with  purchasing commercial sex and his stated preference for sex workers sixteen and older"" gave law enforcement  ""every reason to investigate whether Lofstead had used the phone to purchase sex from minors in the past."" (ECF  No. 31 at 9.) Lofstead responded that evidence of one instance of criminal conduct does not provide probable  cause of  [*841]  ongoing or serial criminal incidents. (ECF No. 34 at 4-5.) [**14]  The Court agrees with Lofstead. HN6[ ] When considering probable cause, courts ""cannot 'mechanically reason that some implies more.'"" United  States v. King, 985 F.3d 702, 709 (9th Cir. 2021) (quoting United States v. Weber, 923 F.2d 1338, 1344 (9th Cir.  1990)). The Ninth Circuit has long recognized that the government's reasonable belief ""that some incriminating  evidence will be present at a particular place does not necessarily mean there is probable cause to believe that  there will be more of the same."" Weber, 923 F.2d at 1344 (emphasis in original). This principle is illustrated by two  contrasting Ninth Circuit opinions involving charges of felons in possession of firearms, United States v. Nora, 765  F.3d 1049 (9th Cir. 2014) and United States v. King, 985 F.3d 702 (9th Cir. 2021). In Nora, the court found that  although the government had probable cause to search the defendant's home ""for the blue-steel semiautomatic  handgun the officers saw him carrying,"" which was evidence supporting the crime for which they had probable  cause to arrest the defendant, the officers did not articulate any ""reasonable grounds to believe that any additional  firearms would be found in the house."" 765 F.3d at 1058. But in King, the court determined the government had  shown there was probable cause to support a search for other firearms because the defendant had ""received and  concealed a firearm for another person"" and that it was ""fair to think that serving as an illicit [**15]  depository of  another person's firearm"" made the defendant's possession of more firearms ""likely."" 985 F.3d at 709. The King  court distinguished Nora based on the circumstances of the offense. See id. In King, the suspect in a domestic  violence incident clearly felt the defendant would accept and conceal a firearm for another, despite knowing such  possession was unlawful. See id. The court reasoned that this context justified a broader inference about the  likelihood of the defendant having one or more firearms in his possession because other individuals knew him to be  a person who would hide a firearm for them. See id. That context was lacking in Nora, where the officers knew only  Page 12 of 24   that the defendant had been convicted of being a felon in possession on prior occasions and had observed him with  a single handgun. See id. Although this distinction seems difficult to apply, what is clear is that a broader search is not justified ""without more.""  Id. The facts of this case are more similar to those in Nora, in which law enforcement relied solely on their  observation of a single crime to extrapolate that the defendant may have committed multiple similar crimes, than  they are to those in King, where law enforcement relied on the [**16]  behavior of third-parties in relation to the  defendant to gain insight into the defendant's potential patterns of behavior. Moreover, the need for actual evidence  as opposed to solely relying on inferences of continued or serial criminal conduct is even more pertinent in cases  involving a search of ESI. Nora and King both involved searches of physical locations for discrete items which are  not typically or necessarily subjected to over-seizure. HN7[ ] The ""greater vigilance"" demanded in searches of ESI  cautions against permitting inferences that aren't supported by clearer facts. See CDT, 621 F.3d at 1177. The Court  is not persuaded that indications Lofstead may be familiar with the purchase of commercial sex, without more, is  sufficient to give law enforcement probable cause to search for prior instances of attempted sex trafficking of  children. Accordingly, the Court rejects the government's argument that probable cause for the single observed incident  justifies probable cause to search for evidence of multiple instances of similar conduct and concludes that probable  cause existed only  [*842]  to search for evidence of the attempted sex trafficking of ""Emma."" C. Specificity Lofstead further argues that apart from whether the [**17]  Warrant is supported by probable cause, the Warrant  amounts to a general warrant because it lacks clear limitations on the items to be searched for and seized. (ECF  No. 22 at 9-12.) The government argues the Warrant was sufficiently specific under the circumstances. (ECF No.  31 at 11-14.) As explained further below, the Court finds the Warrant is both overbroad and insufficiently particular. HN8[ ] The Fourth Amendment requires that search warrants be specific. ""Specificity has two aspects:  particularity and breadth. Particularity is the requirement that a warrant must clearly state what is sought. Breadth  deals with the requirement that the scope of the warrant be limited by the probable cause on which the warrant is  based."" United States v. Towne, 997 F.2d 537, 544 (9th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  The particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment prohibits the ""exploratory rummaging in a person's  belongings,"" Andresen v. Maryland, 427 U.S. 463, 480, 96 S. Ct. 2737, 49 L. Ed. 2d 627 (1976), a concern initially  associated with general warrants. See Perez Cruz v. Barr, 926 F.3d 1128, 1140 (9th Cir. 2019) (noting that general  warrants ""motivated the framing and adoption of the Fourth Amendment"" (quoting Payton v. New York, 445 U.S.  573, 583, 100 S. Ct. 1371, 63 L. Ed. 2d 639 (1980))). Courts in the Ninth Circuit therefore consider three factors in  determining whether a warrant is impermissibly overbroad: (1) whether probable cause existed to seize all items of a category [**18]  described in the warrant; (2) whether  the warrant set forth objective standards by which executing officers could differentiate items subject to seizure  from those which were not; and (3) whether the government could have described the items more particularly  in light of the information available. United States v. Flores, 802 F.3d 1028, 1044 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting United States v. Lei Shi, 525 F.3d 709, 731- 32 (9th Cir. 2008)). Because Lofstead at times combines the particularity and breadth arguments, the Court will  address them together. Lofstead identifies four discrete issues with the Warrant: (1) the Warrant lacked any objective standards limiting  search of content on the phone; (2) the Warrant lacked any temporal limitation; (3) the Warrant lacked a search  protocol to filter relevant from irrelevant information; and (4) the only information the officers had probable cause to  search for could have been much more clearly and particularly identified. (Id.) The government counters that the  Warrant was reasonably particular under the circumstances and that ex ante search protocols are not required.  (ECF No. 31 at 11-13.) As a preliminary matter, the Court agrees that the Ninth Circuit has rejected inclusion of  Page 13 of 24   protocol as a constitutional requirement. See Schesso, 730 F.3d at 1049 (""By its own terms, the concurring opinion  [in [**19]  CDT] proposes the protocols not as constitutional requirements but as 'guidance,' which, when followed,  'offers the government a safe harbor.'"" (quoting CDT, 621 F.3d at 1178) (Kozinski, C.J., concurring)). The Court  will focus on Lofstead's other arguments. 1. Temporal Limitation First, the Court finds the absence of any temporal limitation does create an  [*843]  overbreadth issue because the  Warrant authorized searches of vast amounts of information for which the government lacked probable cause. The  Ninth Circuit has not definitely resolved whether a complete lack of temporal limitation on searches for ESI are  facially overbroad. See Flores, 802 F.3d at 1045 (""Ultimately we need not decide whether the warrant was  overbroad for lack of temporal limit because even if it was, suppression of the evidence used at trial was not  required.""). However, this Court has previously found a warrant with a temporal limitation that antedated the  relevant crime period by only four days was impermissibly overbroad. See United States v. Roberts, 430 F. Supp.  3d 693, 717 (D. Nev. 2019); see also United States v. Cariani, Case No. 3:17-cr-00062-LRH-CBC, 2019 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 177059, 2019 WL 5085418, at *6 (D. Nev. Oct. 10, 2019) (noting approvingly that a warrant was more  narrowly tailored than that in Flores precisely because it contained a temporal limitation). In Roberts, the Court  found searching the defendant's [**20]  phone prior to the crime was not supported by probable cause because the  stated basis in the affidavit for the search was triggered only after the crime had been committed. See 430 F. Supp.  3d at 717. HN9[ ] Temporal restrictions are not a de facto requirement, but courts that have allowed warrants without  temporal limitations have reasoned the limitation would have served no limiting purpose. Another court in this circuit  reasoned that a warrant which lacked temporal limitation was valid because the subject matter to be searched  roughly aligned temporally with the period of relevant criminal activity for which the government had probable cause  to search. See United States v. Johnson, Case No. 6:14-cr-00482-MC, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26125, 2018 WL  934606, at *2 (D. Or. Feb. 16. 2018) (finding a warrant authorized unbounded searches of social media accounts  met the particularity requirements because the criminal activity preceded the account's creation). Practical concerns  motivated another court, which found that a temporal restriction was not required because the account's creation  itself was relevant to both the prosecution and defense. See United States v. Sam, Case No. CR19-0115-JCC,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79023, 2020 WL 2131285, at *3 (W.D. Wash. May 5, 2020) (finding a temporal limitation on  the warrant would impede collection of pertinent evidence relating to [**21]  who created the account). But there is no justification for an unrestricted search without any temporal limitations here. To the contrary, this  case illustrates how the complete absence of temporal limitations can result in an exceptionally expansive search.  Like in Roberts, the government here had very precise knowledge of the date and times texts and internet searches  could be targeted because Lofstead had communicated directly with undercover law enforcement agents. See 430  F. Supp. at 717. The government therefore knew exactly when the phone was used to commit the target offense  and could tailor—and indeed should have tailored—the search, here even to a single day. As discussed above, the  government lacked probable cause to search for evidence of other incidents of wrongdoing, so there was probable  cause to search for text messages, internet search history, ingoing and outgoing calls, and other data only in a very  limited window of time. But the Warrant did not reflect that limitation, or otherwise guide executing officers in their  search so that data could be targeted and tailored to the demonstrated probable cause. The scope of the Warrant  was therefore impermissibly overbroad. 2. Differentiation Between [**22]  Items Included and Excluded from the Search   Page 14 of 24   The Court further finds that the descriptions of items to be searched for  [*844]  insufficiently particular. Although the  items listed in the Warrant are not exactly vague, they are so numerous and unspecific to create an unrestricted  ""dragnet"" search. See Flores, 802 F.3d at 1045. Indeed, Item 1 authorizes the government to search for ""[a]ny and  all records and materials that may be found within [the phone], in any format and media (including, but not limited  to; images videos, e-mails, chat logs, text messages, instant messages and electronic messages), pertaining to the  Target Offenses."" (ECF No. 31-1 at 13.) It is difficult to image what content on Lofstead's phone would be excluded  from the search—paired with the absence of a temporal restriction, Item 1 can reasonably be read to authorize a  search of all photos, all videos, all text messages, all emails, all voicemails, all in-going and out-going calls, all  internet search histories, and all social media messages, potentially going back for years. Worse, the search is not  even limited to the phone itself: Item 3 authorizes a search for evidence of online or remote data storage and the  passwords to access those areas [**23]  as well. (Id.) While the Court understands that common practice requires  over-seizure of ESI, this Warrant essentially contemplates the right to search everything seized. Merely  enumerating all potential search areas does not satisfy particularity. The Court agrees with Lofstead that, as written,  the Warrant fails to delineate matters to be searched from those protected from the search, authorizing instead  ""exploratory rummaging"" through Lofstead's phone. See Andresen, 427 U.S. at 480. The Warrant therefore lacked  particularity. 3. Reasonableness Under the Circumstances Finally, the Court finds that the Warrant was unreasonably broad under the circumstances, and the government  could have provided a more targeted description of items to be searched for and seized. As explained above, the  government in this case was in an unusually informed position to assess where evidence likely would be located on  the phone, and the information supplying probable cause was cabined to a single evening. Moreover, there was  over a month between Lofstead's arrest and the application to search his phone. The circumstances were not  emergent. There was sufficient time for the government to establish whether a broader search was justified [**24]   and to limit the proposed search to more targeted areas. Still, the government's sole support for the search as  stated in the affidavit were the communications on October 7. The resulting Warrant authorized what amounts to a  general search of Lofstead's phone, largely predicated on hopes of finding evidence there was not probable cause  to collect. D. Exclusion, Good Faith, and Severance Having determined that the Warrant is overbroad and not wholly supported by probable cause, the Court must  consider the appropriate remedy. Lofstead argues that total suppression is required. (ECF No. 22 at 12.) The  government counters that the good faith exception saves the Warrant from any breadth defect (ECF No. 31 at 16),  and, alternatively, that the Court should apply the severance doctrine to preserve the aspects of the Warrant which  are supported by probable cause (id. at 10). As explained below, the Court finds the good faith exception does not  apply. Moreover, the Warrant is insufficiently particular to apply the severance doctrine. The Court therefore  concludes that the total suppression is required. 1. Legal Standard HN10[ ] ""The fact that a Fourth Amendment violation occurred—i.e., that a  [*845]  search or arrest was  unreasonable—does [**25]  not necessarily mean that the exclusionary rule applies."" Herring v. United States, 555  U.S. 135, 141, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496 (2009). Because the exclusionary rule serves ""to safeguard Fourth  Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect,"" United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 348, 94 S. Ct.  613, 38 L. Ed. 2d 561 (1974), it ""applies only where it 'result[s] in appreciable deterrence,'"" Herring, 555 U.S. at 141  (quoting United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 909, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984)). Courts therefore do  not view exclusion as ""a necessary consequence,"" but rather ""focus[] on the efficacy of the rule in deterring Fourth  Amendment violations in the future."" See id. Page 15 of 24   HN11[ ] ""Suppression of evidence seized pursuant to a warrant unsupported by probable cause is not appropriate  if the government relied on the warrant in 'good faith.'"" United States v. Grant, 682 F.3d 827, 836 (9th Cir. 2012)  (quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 923). ""However, suppression 'remains an appropriate remedy' when a warrant is based  on 'an affidavit so lacking in probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.'"" Id.  (quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 923). Courts have identified four general circumstances in which an officers' good faith  reliance is per se unreasonable: (i) where an affiant misleads the issuing magistrate or judge by making a false statement or recklessly  disregarding the truth in making a statement; (ii) where the magistrate or judge wholly abandons her judicial role in approving the warrant, acting only as a  ""rubber stamp"" to the warrant application [**26]  rather than as a neutral and detached official; (iii) where the  warrant is facially deficient in detail as to the place to be searched or the things to be found that the officers  could not reasonably presume it to be valid; or (iv) where the affidavit upon which the warrant is based is so  lacking in indicia of probable cause that no reasonable officer could rely upon it in good faith. United States v. Crews, 502 F.3d 1130, 1136 (9th Cir. 2007) (citing Leon, 468 U.S. at 923-26). When invoking the  good faith exception, ""the government bears the burden of proving that officers relied on the search warrant 'in an  objectively reasonable manner.'"" United States v. SDI Future Health, Inc., 568 F.3d 684, 706 (9th Cir. 2009)  (quoting Crews, 502 F.3d at 1136)). HN12[ ] ""Partial suppression is proper under this circuit's doctrine of severance, which allows a court 'to strike  from a warrant those portions that are invalid and preserve those portions that satisfy the fourth amendment.'""  United States v. Sears, 411 F.3d 1124, 1129 (9th Cir. 2005) (quoting United States v. Gomez-Soto, 723 F.2d 649,  654 (9th Cir. 1984)). ""Total suppression, on the other hand, is appropriate when a warrant is wholly lacking in  particularity."" Id. ""In general, we do not allow severance or partial suppression 'when the valid portion of the warrant  is a relatively insignificant part of an otherwise invalid search.'"" SDI Future Health, Inc., 568 F.3d at 707. However,  even when the valid portion of the warrant is smaller than the invalid portion, severance may be appropriate if  it [**27]  was ""a principal portion"" of the evidence the government sought. Id. 2. Good Faith Because the Warrant authorized a search that far exceeded the government's probable cause, the Court must  determine whether the Warrant was executed in good  [*846]  faith reliance on its validity. Although the Warrant  appears to have been executed according to its terms, the good faith exception does not apply because the  Warrant's scope is per se unreasonable. See Crews, 502 F.3d at 1136. The defect arises not from a lack of  compliance with the Warrant's terms, but from the failure of executing officers to recognize that the Warrant  authorizes a general search of Lofstead's phone. Indeed, the officer who performed the full-file extraction of the  phone, Robert Hight, confirms that he was ""familiar [with] both the investigation and the search warrant."" (ECF No.  31-3 at 2.) Hight compiled two reports, one full file of the contents of the phone, and one that contained material he  had ""tagged"" as potentially relevant to this investigation for investigating agent Paul Cline's review. (Id. at 3.) Cline's  review of the extraction reports, in which he ""looked for activity related to the arrest of Lofstead as well as other  evidence of Lofstead [**28]  attempting to solicit other juveniles for the purposes of commercial sex act,"" complied  with the essentially unlimited scope of the warrant. (ECF No. 31-2 at 2.) Neither Hight's investigation nor Cline's review conflicts with any terms of the Warrant because there is nothing in  the Warrant that would limit their actions. There was no search protocol, no temporal limitation, and no discernable  limits on content. As explained above, particularity is fatally lacking because an executing officer would not be able  to distinguish material that is subject to search from that which is not. Hight states in his declaration that he decided  what evidence in the full extraction was relevant based on his experience with the investigation, not based on any    Page 16 of 24   limitation in the Warrant itself. (ECF No. 31-3 at 2.) HN13[ ] When faced with a warrant that authorizes an  unrestricted search of almost all, if not explicitly all, content on a cell phone, an executing officer behaving in good  faith should know that such a search is objectively unreasonable and would likely violate the defendant's Fourth  Amendment rights. Instead, both Cline and Hight focused on trying to uncover previous incidents where Lofstead  may have solicited minors, [**29]  despite knowing that the only evidence supporting their probable cause to search  was cabined to one three-hour interaction with Lofstead. The search took place more than six years after the Supreme Court addressed the grave privacy concerns raised  by cell phone searches in Riley v. California. See 573 U.S. 373, 393-97, 134 S. Ct. 2473, 189 L. Ed. 2d 430 (2014).  The Court emphasized that cell phones contain ""a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives—from the  mundane to the intimate,"" including everything ranging from financial statements to personal health concerns, data  on the individual's physical location spanning years, their most private interests. See id. at 395. Although it is  apparent that this investigation's purpose was to ferret out predators who take advantage of vulnerable individuals  in our community, the privacy concerns associated with expansive searches of ESI are not unknown to officers, nor  should they be so easily discarded. In an investigation such as this, where Task Force agents go looking for targets  and make quick, efficient arrests, those concerns and the attendant risks should have been even more apparent.  The Court cannot find that an executing officer who was familiar with the investigation could have executed  such [**30]  a broad warrant in objective good faith. 3. Severance Because the good faith exception does not apply, the Court must therefore determine whether the information  supported by probable cause is severable from that which must be suppressed. To date, the government has not  attempted to introduce any evidence obtained from Lofstead's  [*847]  phone that fell outside the scope of time  period for which it had probable cause to search. Neither the indictment nor the government's briefs reference any  incident other than that which occurred on October 7, 2020. The Court therefore concludes that, despite being a  very small portion of the total content searched, the text messages and attendant data from the date of Lofstead's  communication with the Task Force agent are the ""principal portion"" of evidence the government sought to obtain,  and therefore severance may be considered. See SDI Future Health, Inc., 568 F.3d at 707. But Lofstead argues that severance is impossible because of way the Warrant is framed. (ECF No. 34 at 5.)  Because every discrete category of areas to be searched is overbroad, Lofstead argues, the warrant lacks  ""identifiable portions"" that are ""sufficiently specific and particular to support severance."" See United States v.  Spilotro, 800 F.2d 959, 967 (9th Cir. 1986). The Court agrees [**31]  that the portions of the Warrant which are  supported by probable cause are not ""textually severable"" from those which are not. See id. at 968. This is a  byproduct of the Warrant's probable cause defects: the conflation of the target offense with child pornography, and  the expanded search for multiple incidents of the target events beyond just the October 7 incident. The breadth of  the Warrant was justified by the twin assumptions that material would be hidden and could be found anywhere. It is  therefore quite difficult if not impossible to extricate the material for which the government had probable cause to  search from that which it did not, largely due to the government's own framing of the search and proffered  justifications for its expanse. The simple solution—and one the government appears to advocate—would be to impose a post facto temporal  limitation on the warrant suppressing all material prior to the charged incident. But to the Court's knowledge, this  interpretation of the severance doctrine has not been recognized. Moreover, severance to allow for the text  communications on October 7 as the government suggests (ECF No. 31 at 10-11) would require an ex post facto       Page 17 of 24   remedy that serves [**32]  no deterrence purpose given the Warrant's expanse and lack of sufficient particularity.  Indeed, the government's request for severance as an alternate remedy contemplates that it would only be  appropriate if Lofstead could show that ""a category of items to be seized that rendered the warrant overbroad."" (Id.  at 10.) Total suppression in this case would also serve the purposes of the exclusionary rule in a way that severance would  not. As explained in greater detail in the Court's consideration of the motion to dismiss, the government's  investigation itself was a fishing expedition. That untargeted investigation in turn justified an untargeted search of  Lofstead's phone. The circumstances of this case do not indicate the overreach was due to bad actions by a rogue  officer, but rather a failure at each step to use restraint in accordance with the protections of the Fourth Amendment  when attempting to discover and prosecute crimes on a broader basis. Searches of ESI likely to continue, and there  is every indication that people will continue to store vast quantities of incredibly important and  [*848]  personal  data [**33]  on their cell phones. HN14[ ] When law enforcement has information that would enable more targeted  searches, severance should not be used as a post facto remedy to rewrite overbroad warrants. As law enforcement  officers try to develop creative methods to investigate and prosecute insidious crimes, they must do so while  respecting defendants' Fourth Amendment rights. The Court will therefore grant Lofstead's motion to suppress. IV. MOTION TO DISMISS Lofstead also argues that the operation itself violated his Fifth Amendment due process rights, and therefore moves  to dismiss the indictment. (ECF No. 21.) The government responds Lofstead has failed to meet the ""extremely high  standard"" to show dismissal on the grounds of outrageous government conduct is warranted. (ECF No. 29 at 5  (quoting United States v. Black, 733 F.3d 294, 302 (9th Cir. 2013)). Although it is a close call, the Court ultimately  concludes that the circumstances of the investigation warrant dismissal. A. Outrageous or Fundamentally Unfair Government Conduct HN15[ ] When law enforcement officers' actions are ""so outrageous that due process principles would absolutely  bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction,"" courts must dismiss the indictment.  United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 431-32, 93 S. Ct. 1637, 36 L. Ed. 2d 366 (1973). This remedy is ""limited to  extreme cases"" in [**34]  which government conduct ""violates fundamental fairness."" United States v. Stinson, 647  F.3d 1196, 1209 (9th Cir. 2011). ""It is outrageous for government agents to (1) engineer and direct a criminal  enterprise from start to finish; (2) to use excessive physical or mental coercion to convince an individual to commit  a crime; or (3) to generate new crimes merely for the sake of pressing criminal charges."" United States v.  Pincombe, Case No. 2:14-cr-00178-JAD-GWF, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165280, 2015 WL 8480079, at *5 (D. Nev.  Nov. 3, 2015) (citing United States v. Black, 733 F.3d 294, 302 (9th Cir. 2013)); see also United States v. Stenberg,  803 F.2d 422, 429 (9th Cir. 1986) (""Constitutionally unacceptable conduct includes, but is not limited to, situations  where law enforcement agents employed unwarranted physical or mental coercion, where 'government agents  engineer and direct the criminal enterprise from start to finish,' and where the government essentially manufactures  new crimes in order to obtain the defendant's conviction.'"") (internal citations omitted). Because ""[t]here is no bright  line dictating when law enforcement conduct crosses the line between acceptable and outrageous,"" each case  turns ""'on its own particular facts.'"" Black, 733 F.3d at 302 (quoting United States v. Bogart, 783 F.2d 1428, 1438  (9th Cir. 1986), vacated in part on other grounds sub nom. United States v. Wingender, 790 F.2d 802 (9th Cir.  1986)). B. The Black Factors Page 18 of 24   HN16[ ] To help guide this circumstance-specific inquiry, courts in this circuit consider the six factors set forth in  United States v. Black, which include: (1) known [**35]  criminal characteristics of the defendants; (2) individualized suspicion of the defendants; (3) the government's role in creating the crime of conviction; (4) the government's encouragement of the defendants to commit the offense conduct; (5) the nature of the government's participation in the offense conduct; and (6) the nature of the crime being pursued and necessity for the actions taken  [*849]  in light of the nature of the  criminal enterprise at issue. 733 F.3d at 303. The first three factors address the government's conduct when initiating a sting, with factors four  and five addressing the conduct of the government during the operation. See id. at 304, 308. The final factor  concerns the relationship between the type of crime being investigated and whether the techniques used by the  government were necessary. See id. at 309. The parties agree there is no prescribed manner for weighing the  Black factors, but rather the facts of the case and surrounding circumstances must be considered in their totality.  See id. at 304 (noting the factors ""do not constitute a formalistic checklist,"" but rather help courts focus their  analysis). Although this case presents a close call, the Court finds the majority of the Black factors weigh in favor of dismissal.  At the [**36]  time law enforcement initiated its reverse sting operation, Task Force agents lacked any knowledge of  Lofstead's character (including his nonexistent criminal history) and had not formed an individualized suspicion of  either Lofstead or any identifiable group of which he was a part. Moreover, law enforcement manufactured the  entire crime from start to finish: first by creating the fictitious profile, then altering the poster's age, and finally  encouraging Lofstead to continue with an in-person meeting after he showed hesitation. It is undisputed that the  sale of commercial sex with children is a serious, underreported, and difficult to detect offense. But in this case,  especially because Lofstead's liability arises out of an apparent mistake about the legal age for engaging in  commercial sex transactions, the Court finds the government's behavior in orchestrating an untargeted, large- scale reverse-sting offends traditional notions of fair play protected by the Fifth Amendment. The Court explains its reasoning below, addressing first what law enforcement knew about Lofstead prior to  initiating the operation, then considering the government's role in creating the crime and encouraging Lofstead to  commit [**37]  it, and finally weighing the need for such tactics in prosecuting child sex trafficking. 1. Known Criminal Characteristics & Individualized Suspicion HN17[ ] Courts often consider the first two Black factors together, as they are ""closely related."" United States v.  Snagglers, Case No. 2:14-cr-00086-JCM-PAL, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176785, 2015 WL 10436117, at *6 (D. Nev.  Dec. 30, 2015). The first factor asks whether the government knew the defendant had a criminal background or  propensity ""when it initiated its sting operation."" Black, 733 F.3d at 304. The second factor considers whether the  government had reason to connect the suspected individual (or group to which the individual belonged) with the  targeted offense under investigation. See id. Both factors tip sharply in Lofstead's favor. At the time the Task Force agents initiated their reverse sting, Lofstead was entirely unknown to them. The agents  lacked any knowledge of his characteristics, propensities, or history, criminal or otherwise. The operation, by its  nature, was untargeted. The government argues this factor is satisfied because law enforcement agents formed  an individualized suspicion after Lofstead responded to the advertisement. (ECF No. 29 at 7.) The Court disagrees    Page 19 of 24   that later-developed suspicion, when unguided by a previous suspicion [**38]  of any cognizable group, is  sufficiently individualized to satisfy the first two Black factors.  [*850]  HN18[ ] Strictly speaking, law enforcement need not have individualized suspicion of a defendant's  wrongdoing before conducting an undercover investigation. See United States v. Luttrell, 923 F.2d 764 (9th Cir.  1991) (en banc) (vacating a three-judge panel's holding that ""reasoned grounds"" to investigate a particular  individual was constitutionally required without providing any clarifying reasoning). However, whether law  enforcement had reason to suspect ""an individual or an identifiable group before initiating a sting operation is an  important consideration."" Black, 733 F.3d at 304. When a defendant was specifically known to law enforcement  prior to the sting as a potential perpetrator of a particular criminal activity, courts are more likely to find that a sting  operation did not constitute ""outrageous"" conduct. See United States v. Pemberton, 853 F.2d 730 (9th Cir. 1988)  (finding no outrageous conduct where the government arranged for an undercover agent to meet with a target ""who  the government suspected to be a long-time drug dealer involved in a laundering operation""); United States v.  Bonanno, 852 F.2d 434 (9th Cir. 1988) (finding no outrageous conduct where the FBI recruited an informant to  contact the target company after forming a suspicion and opening an investigation for [**39]  mail and wire fraud);  Stenberg, 803 F.2d at 430 (noting the FBI agent met with the target ""only after his investigation indicated they were  already involved in continuing illegal transactions""). But even when law enforcement suspects a group of people, rather than an individual, the government's suspicion  may be sufficiently individualized. See, e.g., United States v. Halgat, Case No. 2:16-cr-00265-GMN-CWH, 2018  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216118, 2018 WL 8807134, at *10 (D. Nev. Dec. 26, 2018) (recognizing it was acceptable for law  enforcement to launch an undercover investigation of a motorcycle organization to determine if it was engaged in  criminal conduct which resulted in arrests over a year later). Indeed, the court in that case reasoned that the  ""salient"" inquiry was whether the government had reason to suspect its targets ""before initiating [its] sting  operation,"" even if the investigation began earlier. Id. In Halgat, the undercover agent observed his targets  purchase and use cocaine ""on a number of occasions"" over the course of a year before initiating the sting. Id.  Concluding that the government had infiltrated a criminal organization that was ""already engaged in or anticipating  a criminal activity"" before setting its sting operation in motion, the court found law enforcement had developed  individualized suspicion of both defendants. Id. (quoting [**40]  United States v. So, 755 F.2d 1350, 1353 (9th Cir.  1985). However, when law enforcement does not suspect even an identifiable group of people, the resulting tactics can be  ""troubling."" Black, 733 F.3d at 302. In Black, law enforcement agents used a confidential informant to ""troll[] for  targets"" in ""a bad part of town."" Id. at 303. The Ninth Circuit found not only that individualized suspicion was lacking,  but also that serious concerns of fairness and the government's abuse of power were in play. See id. Because the  agents had manufactured a cocaine stash house and proposed a robbery with recruited defendants, the Ninth  Circuit reasoned they risked ""creat[ing] a criminal enterprise that would not have come into being but for the  temptation of a big payday, a work of fiction spun out by government agents to persons vulnerable to such a ploy  who would not otherwise have thought of doing such a robbery."" Id. Such conduct serves no deterrent purpose, the  court reasoned, as there is no indication a crime would have been committed without the government's  involvement—the targets had not actively been seeking a robbery and the robbery target existed only through  government creation. See id.  [*851]  The Task Force's actions in this case create just such a risk. The advertisement was completely [**41]   untargeted, directed broadly at men who may be seeking to purchase commercial sex in the Northern Nevada  area. Law enforcement had no reason to suspect that Lofstead, or any individual for that matter, was interested in  engaging in commercial sex with a child. The Task Force agents had no knowledge about Lofstead's character  before he responded to the ad, at which time they could have learned that he had no prior criminal history after  obtaining his cell phone number. Even assuming the government had a reason to suspect this specific website was  Page 20 of 24   prone to use by people who sought commercial sex with children, there is little to distinguish law enforcement's  conduct here from ""trolling for targets"" in a ""bad"" area. See id. Using a reverse sting instead of a traditional sting distinguishes this case from previous permissible operations in  this District. In prior cases, an undercover agent operated a traditional sting by responding to an ad the defendant  had posted that suggested an interest in sex with children. See, e.g., Snagglers, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176785,  2015 WL 10436117 at *6-7 (finding no violation where law enforcement posed as an underage girl responding to an  ad defendant had himself posted stating he was looking for ""young girls""); United [**42]  States v. Pincombe, Case  No. Case No. 2:14-cr-00178-JAD-GWF, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165280, 2015 WL 8480079, at *6 (finding it was  ""reasonable"" for an undercover detective to respond to an ad defendant posted seeking sexual encounters with ""no  limits and NO Taboos""). The court found law enforcement had reason to believe the target may be attempting to  solicit sex from children based on the representations the targeted posters had themselves made. Here, law  enforcement had no reason to suspect that Lofstead was attempting to solicit sex with a child, because they did not  even know who he was until after the operation had begun. Agents were not responding to observed offensive  behavior, as in Snaggers and Pincombe, but rather were working from a presumption that unknown targets were  using Skip the Games for child sex trafficking. That law enforcement could develop an individualized suspicion for the purposes of Lofstead after he texted the  undercover agent is largely unpersuasive. The government argues that when agents ""first encountered"" Lofstead,  he was attempting to commit a crime by soliciting a prostitute outside of a licensed house of prostitution. (ECF  No. 29 at 7.) Lofstead also appeared familiar with the terminology of commercial sex and [**43]  mentioned he had  not seen ""Emma"" post before, suggesting to the agents that he had likely used Skip the Games to solicit  commercial sex before. (Id.) But the first two Black factors are relevant to knowledge the government had ""before  initiating a sting."" See Black, 733 F.3d at 304 (emphasis added). First, the government ""encountered"" him because  they had already initiated the sting. Everything the government learned or suspected about Lofstead happened  after they had set the operation in motion. While the government attempts to distinguish these facts from the  concerns the Ninth Circuit raised in Black, this is precisely the type of conduct that court found so worrying. See id.  at 303. If law enforcement could demonstrate individualized suspicion merely by proposing crimes and waiting for  someone to respond positively, then the  [*852]  government would have individualized suspicion of every person  ultimately charged in a sting operation, and the factor would be meaningless. But even assuming these factors could be satisfied by knowledge law enforcement obtained sometime between  initiating the sting and proposing the targeted offense, the government fails to connect how Lofstead's suspected  prior use of Skip the Games provided reasonable [**44]  suspicion that he was interested in commercial sex with  minors. While Lofstead's familiarity with commercial sex terminology and response to the ad clearly indicate he  uses the website Skip the Games and supports the inference that he has attempted to solicit commercial sex in  violation of Nevada law before, the Court strains to see how Lofstead's initial interactions with the undercover agent  suggested he was trying to solicit sex from minors. There is no discussion of ""Emma""'s age before the undercover  agent begins to drop hints that she is still living with her parents. (ECF No. 21-2 at 2.) When the undercover agent  suggests she is younger than her post indicated, Lofstead immediately shows hesitation and concern with  complying with the law. (Id. at 2-4.) The Court is not persuaded that Lofstead's conversation with the undercover           Page 21 of 24   agent provided reasonable suspicion that he was using Skip the Games to solicit sex from children before the agent  indicated ""Emma"" was under 18. The Court therefore finds the first two Black factors weigh in favor of dismissal. Additionally, the Court notes that the  government's complete lack of individualized suspicion of Lofstead or even any definite group [**45]  suspected of  criminal activity, is analogous to the fact-pattern in Black and justifies a heightened concern when assessing the  remaining factors. 2. Government's Role in Creating the Crime, Encouraging the Defendant, and Participating in Conduct The Court next considers the third, fourth, and fifth Black factors. As a preliminary matter, the Court is persuaded  that the fifth factor—extent of government participation in the conduct—is not particularly useful in cases like these.  The Court agrees with the government's point made at the Hearing that, by its nature, solicitation of commercial  sex is likely to be private, and undercover agents posing as minors would necessarily be involved from start to  finish. See Black, 733 F.3d at 308 (considering duration, nature, and necessity of participation in the offense). But  the Court likewise appreciates Lofstead's argument that without the government's participation, this particular  offense could not exist. Due to the nature of the crime and the requisite extensive involvement of law enforcement  in policing it, the Court considers the fifth factor unhelpful in its overall analysis, and will consider instead the third  and fourth—the government's role in creating the crime and [**46]  encouraging the defendant to commit it. Due to  the relatively truncated nature of the operation, which took place over a matter of days rather than years, the Court  considers  [*853]  these two factors together as they frequently overlap. HN19[ ] Whether the crime, or something very similar to it, would have occurred without government involvement  is of paramount importance to the fundamental fairness inquiry: Criminal sanction is not justified when the state manufactures crimes that would otherwise not occur. Punishing  a defendant who commits a crime under such circumstances is not needed to deter misconduct; absent the  government's involvement, no crime would have been committed . . . Where the police control and  manufacture a victimless crime, it is difficult to see how anyone is actually harmed, and thus punishment  ceases to be a response, but becomes an end in itself . . . Under such circumstances, the criminal justice  system infringes upon personal liberty and violates due process. Bogart, 783 F.2d at 1436. Relevant to the Court's inquiry is ""whether the government approached the defendant  initially or the defendant approached a government agent, and whether the government proposed the criminal  enterprise or merely attached [**47]  itself to one that was already established and ongoing."" Black, 733 F.3d at  305. The parties dispute who approached whom. Lofstead argues the government initiated the encounter by posting the  advertisement and changing the poster's age from 19 to 16. (ECF No. 21 at 8.) The government counters that  Lofstead approached the undercover agent, who merely joined in ongoing criminal activity that Lofstead had  already proposed. (ECF No. 29 at 9.) This articulation of events is dubious at best. As in Black, where the ATF set  up a stash house and recruited defendants to plan a robbery, the proposed encounter with ""Emma"" was ""entirely  [the government's] creation"" and it was the agent ""who set the parameters for how it had to be carried out."" See  Black, 733 F.2d at 305. The profile was designed and posted by the government and the conversation between the  undercover agent and Lofstead proceeded according to a set trajectory established by the operational plan. The  ""Emma"" profile was intended to bait potential purchasers of commercial sex into communicating with law  enforcement, which it successfully did. Moreover, the judges in this District have found in prior cases that posting an  advertisement online soliciting sex, not responding to one, [**48]  initiates an encounter. See Snagglers, 2015 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 176785, 2015 WL 10436117 at *8 (finding that by posting a Craigslist ad, defendant ""was not  responding to a scheme created by the government""); Pincombe, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165280, 2015 WL  8480079 at *7 (finding defendant ""took the first step by soliciting sexual contact"" when he posted an online  advertisement). The Court therefore declines to construe Lofstead's response to the government's advertisement as  ""approaching"" the government. Page 22 of 24   Nor does the Court find that law enforcement attached itself to an ongoing criminal enterprise. While the  government argues law enforcement ""merely investigated the scope of the crime Lofstead had already  demonstrated an interest in committing,"" the charged offense differs in kind and orders of magnitude from that  which Lofstead was apparently attempting to commit initially. (ECF No. 29 at 9.) The government points out that  Lofstead was already attempting to solicit commercial sex outside a licensed prostitution house, which is a  misdemeanor under Nevada law. See NRS § 201.354(4)(a). But that is not the offense charged in the indictment,  nor is it the stated target of the operation. It was law enforcement's decision to change the age of ""Emma"" from 19  to 16, materially altering the type of crime and bringing it within the operation's [**49]  purview.  [*854]  The government's ability to manipulate the situation in this way is of particular concern to courts, as the  Ninth Circuit explained in the context of stash house robberies: In fictional stash house operations like the one at issue here, the government has virtually unfettered ability to  inflate the amount of drugs supposedly in the house and thereby obtain a greater sentence for the defendant.  In fact, not only is the government free to set the amount of drugs in a fictional stash house at an arbitrarily high  level, it can also minimize the obstacles that a defendant must overcome to obtain the drugs. The ease with  which the government can manipulate these factors makes us wary of such operations in general, and inclined  to take a hard look to ensure that the proposed stash-house robbery was within the scope of [the target's]  ambition and means. United States v. Briggs, 623 F.3d 724, 729-30 (9th Cir. 2010). Here, the government's ability and willingness to alter  ""Emma""'s age after Lofstead responded to the text increased the sentence he was exposed to by twenty-fold, at a  minimum. Compare NRS §§ 201.354(4)(a), 193.150 (carrying a maximum of six months in jail for solicitation  outside a licensed house of prostitution) with 18 U.S.C. § 1591(b)(2) (carrying a minimum of ten years in  prison, [**50]  ""or for life,"" for sex trafficking a child over 14 but under 18). Lofstead attempting to solicit sex  outside a licensed house of prostitution is not equivalent with attempting to purchase sex from a child, and the  Court declines to find that his actions created an ""established and ongoing"" enterprise to which the government  ""merely attached itself."" See Black, 733 F.3d at 305. The Court is likewise unpersuaded that the government's overwhelming involvement in creating the offense is of  less concern because Lofstead appeared to be familiar with commercial sex and did not refuse to meet ""Emma""  after they began texting. (ECF No. 29 at 9-10.) In Black, the Ninth Circuit's concern about permitting the  government to create a crime wholesale which baited an untargeted pool of people was ""mitigated"" because the  defendants told the undercover agent they had recently and frequently engaged in similar criminal activity. 733 F.3d  at 307. The court found it particularly persuasive that after the informant set the bait, ""the defendants 'responded  without further inducement by the government.'"" Id. (emphasis in original) (quoting United States v. Bagnariol, 665  F.2d 877, 882 (9th Cir. 1981)). Indeed, the defendants in Black ""eagerly jumped at the opportunity"" the government  presented. Id. at 308. But Lofstead was [**51]  immediately wary once the undercover agent began to hint ""Emma""  was not 19. He repeatedly asked for confirmation of her age, including asking for a photo of ""Emma""'s ID. (ECF No.  21-2 at 3.) After Lofstead had been texting with the agent for about an hour, they asked ""so u coming or what??"" to  which Lofstead responded, ""To be honest I'm worried you may not be 16."" (Id.) After the agent assured Lofstead ""I  am :)"" but he was reluctant and offered to get her high instead. (Id.) The agent responded, ""Not to be rude baby, but  if ur coming I need the $$ for the time ya know."" (Id.) Lofstead waited six minutes, then responded that he did want  to come. (Id.) Although there is no evidence that the government coerced, threatened, or otherwise acted ""inappropriately,"" there  is clearly evidence that the government encouraged Lofstead to continue with the encounter despite his clear  hesitation. Of gravest concern to the Court are situations in which the government in some way coerced or  pressured the defendant into committing the target offense. Black, 733 F.3d at 308. This case certainly does not  involve the most concerning hypothetical  [*855]  government conduct, but neither does it portray a defendant who  is ""eager"" to commit [**52]  the named crime. See id. at 307. The government's argument that Lofstead could have  simply decided not to come at any time, though true, does not mitigate the fact that after he had expressed  reservations, the Task Force agent again pressed him to come, declined his offer hang out with ""Emma"" without  exchanging sex for money, and further attempted to convince him to agree to pay for sex with a fictional 15-year- Page 23 of 24   old girl. Despite that the government's conduct is not the most severe it could have been, it certainly constitutes  encouragement to commit an offense that Lofstead was unaware he could be committing when he responded to the  ""Emma"" advertisement. Taken together, these factors weigh heavily in favor of dismissal. Absent the government's involvement, this crime  would not have taken place. The government manufactured the scenario from start to finish. Despite that nothing  about Lofstead's actions indicated he was actively seeking commercial sex with someone under 18, the  government continued to manipulate the situation to attempt to persuade him to commit a series of increasingly  grave offenses. 3. Nature of the Crime Being Pursued and Necessity for Law Enforcement's Actions The Court agrees [**53]  with the government that the sale of commercial sex with children is a ""largely unreported  crime"" that is of ""grave concern to the community."" (ECF No. 29 at 16.) The Court likewise does not question that  modern child sex trafficking frequently takes place online, including on websites like Skip the Games where a user  can post or respond to advertisements offering commercial sex. (Id. at 15.) Moreover, the Court agrees with the  government that this particular type of crime can be uniquely difficult to police, whether because the victims are  sometimes participants, are by nature very young, or may come from groups that otherwise lack trust in law  enforcement. Sting operations may therefore be required to effectively uncover individuals who are seeking to  purchase sex from children. HN20[ ] But even when investigating serious crimes, the government is obligated to proceed in a manner that  conforms with fundamental fairness. Here, the operational plan lacks any safeguards that would limit agents'  actions when communicating with potential targets or would ensure the focus the operation is policing child sex  trafficking, rather than broadly targeting anyone using a website for adult hookups. In [**54]  fact, although the  directives in the operational plan are quite bare bones, they even state that the detectives have ""established a client  base"" at some time ""prior to the operation""—a fact clearly contradicted by Lofstead's experience. Instead, the entire  encounter between Lofstead and the Task Force agent appears to have taken place in a single evening. While  more extreme tactics may be justified for policing an insidious crime like sex trafficking children, it is not at all  apparent that they are warranted for cracking down on prostitution outside of a licensed house—the only crime  that Lofstead apparently would have been committing by responding to the advertisement and entering the  government's scheme. Given the circumstances of this case, the Court finds that the scenario the government engineered so offended  traditional notions of fairness that prosecution would violate Lofstead's Fifth Amendment due process rights.  Accordingly, the Court will dismiss the indictment.",1
S.Y. v. Choice Hotels,"OPINION AND ORDER This matter comes before the Court on review of  defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc.'s Motion to  Dismiss Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint with  Prejudice (Doc. #19) filed on October 8, 2020, and  defendant R&M Real Estate Company, Inc.'s Motion to  Dismiss  with  Prejudice  Plaintiff's  Complaint  and  Incorporated Memorandum [*2]  of Law (Doc. #21) filed  on October 12, 2020. Plaintiff filed an Opposition (Doc.  #42) and a Memorandum in Opposition (Doc. #43) on  November 5, 2020, to which the defendants each filed a  Reply (Doc. #47; Doc. #48) on November 19, 2020. For  the reasons set forth below, the motions are denied. I. The origins of this case began on October 30, 2019,  when plaintiff and another alleged victim of sex  trafficking filed a case in the Circuit Court of the  Twentieth Judicial Circuit in and for Collier County,  Florida. See S.Y. et al v. Naples Hotel Co. et al, Case  No. 2:20-cv-118 (Doc. #1, p. 3). On December 31, 2019,  the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint which  asserted ten claims against over forty defendants. Id. at  (Doc. #1, pp. 2-4). The case was removed to federal  court in February 2020. Id. at (Doc. #1). On April 15,  2020, the plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint.  Id. at (Doc. #85). On August 5, 2020, the undersigned  denied various motions to dismiss, but determined  severance of the parties was appropriate. S.Y. v. Naples  Hotel Co., 476 F. Supp. 3d 1251, 1258-59 (M.D. Fla.  2020). Following the Court's severance order, plaintiff  and the other alleged victim filed nearly thirty new  Page 2 of 15 actions against various defendants, including this case. The Complaint [*3]  (Doc. #1) in this case was filed on  August 19, 2020, and alleges that plaintiff S.Y., a  resident of Collier County, Florida, was a victim of  continuous sex trafficking at a certain Comfort Inn &  Executives Suites (the Comfort Inn Hotel) in Naples,  Florida between 2013 and February 2016. (Id. ¶¶ 2, 13,  22-24.) The Complaint alleges that during this time  period the Comfort Inn Hotel was owned and operated  by defendant R&M Real Estate Company, Inc. (R&M) as  a franchisee of defendant Choice Hotels International,  Inc. (Choice). (Id. ¶¶ 25-28, 49.) The Complaint alleges the following six claims: (1)  violation  of  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), 18 U.S.C. §  1595; (2) violation of the Florida RICO statute, §  772.104, Florida Statutes; (3) premise liability; (4)  negligent hiring, supervision, and retention; (5) negligent  rescue; and (6) aiding and abetting, harboring,  confining, coercion, and criminal enterprise. (Id. pp. 33- 49.) Counts One through Four are asserted against  each defendant, while Counts Five and Six are asserted  against R&M. (Id.) II. The motions to dismiss raise numerous arguments as to  why the Complaint as whole, and each individual claim,  should be dismissed. The Court will address each of  these [*4]  arguments in turn. A. Shotgun Pleading The Complaint identifies the defendants collectively as  the ""Comfort Inn Defendants."" (Doc. #1, p. 1  introductory paragraph.) Both motions argue that  because the Complaint groups them together, it should  be dismissed as a shotgun pleading. (Doc. #19, pp. 12- 13; Doc. #21, p. 5.) One way in which a complaint may constitute an  impermissible shotgun pleading is if it ""assert[s] multiple  claims against multiple defendants without specifying  which of the defendants are responsible for which acts      or omissions, or which of the defendants the claim is  brought against."" Weiland v. Palm Beach Cty. Sheriff's  Office, 792 F.3d 1313, 1323 (11th Cir. 2015); see also  Barmapov v. Amuial, 986 F.3d 1321, 1324-25 (11th Cir.  2021). Such a pleading fails ""to give the defendants  adequate notice of the claims against them and the  grounds upon which each claim rests,"" Weiland, 792  F.3d at 1323, and violates the requirement that a  plaintiff provide ""a short and plain statement of the  claim,"" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The Complaint does indeed repeatedly refer to the  defendants collectively as the ""Comfort Inn Defendants.""  The failure to specify a particular defendant is not fatal,  however, when ""[t]he complaint can be fairly read to  aver that all defendants are responsible for the alleged  conduct."" Kyle K. v. Chapman, 208 F.3d 940, 944 (11th  Cir. 2000). The Complaint typically (but not always)  alleges that ""each [*5]  and every"" such defendant was  involved in the activity described in the particular  paragraph of the Complaint. A fair reading of the  Complaint is that each of these defendants was involved  in the identified conduct attributed to the ""Comfort Inn  Defendants."" While defendants may disagree that such  allegations are accurate, that dispute is for another day.  The group allegations do not fail to state a claim, Auto.  Alignment & Body Serv., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co., 953 F.3d 707, 732-33 (11th Cir. 2020), and the  Complaint does not constitute a shotgun pleading. B. Failure to State a Claim The motions argue certain claims should be dismissed  due to plaintiff's failure to state a claim upon which relief  may be granted. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2)                       2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *2 Page 3 of 15 requires that a complaint contain a ""short and plain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This obligation  ""requires more than labels and conclusions, and a  formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action  will not do."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,  555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation  omitted). To survive dismissal, the factual allegations  must be ""plausible"" and ""must be enough to raise a right  to relief above the speculative level."" Id. at 555; see also  Edwards v.

Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed.  2d 868 (2009) (citations omitted). In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) [*6]  motion to dismiss, the  Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint  as true and take them in the light most favorable to the  plaintiff, Erickson v.

Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. (1) Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization  Act Both motions challenge the one federal claim, the  alleged violation of the TVPRA set forth in Count One.  The TVPRA provides a civil remedy to victims of certain  types of human trafficking. The civil remedy portion of  the Act provides: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). The phrase ""a violation of this  chapter"" refers to Chapter 77 of Title 18 of the United  States Code. The only violation of Chapter 77 relevant  to this case is contained in 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a), which  provides in relevant part: (a) Whoever knowingly - (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign  commerce . . . recruits, entices, harbors,  transports, provides, [*7]  obtains, advertises,  maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any means  a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything  of value, from participation in a venture which  has engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). To state a section 1595(a) claim in  this case, plaintiff must plausibly allege that she was a  victim of a criminal offense under section 1591(a), and  then must plausibly allege that defendant (1)""knowingly  benefit[ted] financially or by receiving anything of value,""  (2) from participation in a venture, (3) which defendant  ""knew or should have known has engaged in"" sex  trafficking under section 1591(a). S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d  at 1255-56 (citing A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 455 F. Supp.  3d 171, 181 (E.D. Pa. 2020)). (a) Plausible Allegations Re: § 1591 Violation Choice first argues that plaintiff fails to allege an  underlying section 1591 violation by failing ""to set out  any facts describing any criminal [*8]  investigation,  indictment, prosecution, or conviction."" (Doc. #19, p.  15.) The Complaint alleges: 83. From approximately 2013 through February  2016, Plaintiff S.Y. was recruited to, enticed to,  solicited to, held at, harbored as captive at and/or  transported to various hotels in Naples, Florida by  her sex traffickers to engage in commercial sex  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *5 Page 4 of 15 acts at these hotels on a regular, consistent and/or  repeated basis. From approximately 2013 to 2014,  Plaintiff S.Y. was trafficked by an individual only  known to Plaintiff as Rambo, as well as other  traffickers at the Comfort Inn Hotel. Then from  approximately 2015 to February 2016, Plaintiff S.Y.  was trafficked by Gregory Hines (aka Bowlegs),  Keith Lewis, Anthony Barrata and others at the  Comfort Inn Hotel. (Doc. #1, ¶ 83.) There is no requirement that the sex  trafficker have been convicted criminally to support a  civil claim against defendants for knowingly financially  benefitting from the sex trafficking, and Choice  provides no legal support for this argument. Choice also argues that plaintiff has not alleged  coercion giving rise to an underlying violation of section  1591, asserting that plaintiff was free to meet the ""John""  in the lobby, and she could [*9]  walk the hallways  without confinement. (Doc. #19, pp. 16-17.) For purposes of § 1591, ""coercion"" is defined as (1)  ""threats of serious harm to or physical restraint  against any person;"" (2) ""any scheme, plan, or  pattern intended to cause a person to believe that  failure to perform an act would result in serious  harm to or physical restraint against any person""; or  (3) ""the abuse or threatened abuse of law or the  legal process."" Id. § 1591(e)(2). ""Serious harm,"" in  turn, is ""any harm, whether physical or nonphysical,  including psychological, financial, or reputational  harm, that is sufficiently serious, under all the  surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable  person of the same background and in the same  circumstances to perform or to continue performing  commercial sexual activity in order to avoid  incurring that harm."" Id. § 1591(e)(4). United States v. Williams, 714 F. App'x 917, 918 (11th  Cir. 2017). The allegations in the Complaint are more  than conclusory with regard to the threats of serious  harm or physical restraint, and do not only allege sexual  abuse and prostitution. (Doc. #19, pp. 16-17.) Some of  the relevant allegations are as follows: 57. At all material times, each and every Comfort       Inn Defendant, as owners, operators, managers,  supervisors,  controllers  and/or [*10]   entities  otherwise responsible for hotels, including the  Comfort Inn Hotel, knew or should have known that  traffickers were harboring, raping and assaulting  victims at their hotels, including the Comfort Inn  Hotel, and were forcing them to engage in ""in call""  services, wherein buyers (""Johns"") would come to  the hotels solely to purchase sex from these  victims, as well as ""out call"" services, wherein the  buyer would rent a hotel room and the trafficker  would deliver the victim to the buyer's room to  complete the sordid transaction. . . . 68. Each and every Comfort Inn Defendant,  individually and by and through their actual or  apparent agents, servants, franchisees, employees  and/or staff, were aware of and/or should have  been aware of a number of warning signs at their  hotels, including the Comfort Inn Hotel, that  indicated the presence of human trafficking,  including but not limited to: a. persons showing signs of malnourishment,  poor  hygiene,  fatigue,  sleep  deprivation,  untreated illness, injuries, and/or unusual  behavior; b. persons lacking freedom of movement or  being constantly monitored; c.  persons  having  no  control  over  or  possession of money or ID; d. persons dressing inappropriately [*11]  for  their age or having lower quality clothing  compared to others in their party; e. persons requesting room or housekeeping  services (additional towels, new linens, etc.),  but denying hotel staff entry into the room; f. the presence of multiple computers, cell  phones, pagers, credit card swipers, or other  technology in the room; g. persons extending stay with few or no  personal possessions in the room; h. excessive amounts of sex paraphernalia in  rooms (condoms, lubricant, lotion); i. the same person reserving multiple rooms; j. a room being rented hourly, less than a day,  or for an atypical extended stay; k. attempts of persons to sell items to or beg  from patrons or staff; l. cars in the parking lot regularly parked  backward, so the license plates are not visible; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *8 Page 5 of 15 m. loitering and solicitation of male patrons; n. individuals waiting at a table or bar and then  being picked up by a male (trafficker or  customer); o. persons asking staff or patrons for food or  money; and p. persons taking cash or receipts left on  tables. . . . 136. Plaintiff S.Y. was a hotel guest at the Comfort  Inn  Hotel  and  Plaintiff  was  seriously  and  permanently injured as a direct result of each and  every Comfort Inn Defendants' [*12]  acts and  omissions, in that each and every Comfort Inn  Defendant permitted, harbored and facilitated illegal  sex trafficking ventures to take place at the  Comfort Inn Hotel whereby the Plaintiff S.Y. was  routinely and continuously abused, battered, falsely  imprisoned, raped, beaten, starved, forcibly injected  with drugs and enslaved. 137. More specifically, at all material times, in the  quest for profits, the acts and omissions of each  and every Comfort Inn Defendant regarding the  Comfort Inn Hotel caused the Plaintiff to suffer: a. Forced labor; b. Forced confinement without safe means of  escape; c. Assault and fear; d. Sickness, dizziness and headaches; e. Cuts, lacerations, abrasions and other  physical harm; f. Mental anguish, humiliation, exploitation,  degradation and mental distress; g. Suffocation, battery and rape; h. Shock, fright and post-traumatic stress; i. Overdose and drug-induced dangers (the  Plaintiff suffered drug overdoses, drug-induced  actions which caused harm to themselves [sic],  physical deformities and scarfing [sic] from  actions of the ""Johns"" and drug usage); and j. Invasion of privacy and wrongful entry of  ""Johns."" (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 57, 68, 136-137.) The allegations are  not [*13]  ""simply a regurgitation of the statutes' wording  woven together with conclusory statements and a  generous use of 'and/or.'"" Kelsey v. Goldstar Est.  Buyers Corp., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37361, 2014 WL  1155253, at *6 (D. Or. Mar. 21, 2014). The motion will  be denied as plaintiff has stated plausible facts in  support of a section 1591 violation. (b) ""Participation"" in a ""Venture"" The defendants argue that the Complaint lacks well-pled  allegations that it participated in a ""venture,"" as required  by section 1595(a). (Doc. #19, p. 23; Doc. #21, pp. 6-9.)  Drawing on the definition of ""venture"" used in the  criminal portion of the statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(6) ,  R&M asserts that a ""venture"" requires two or more  individuals ""associated in fact."" (Doc. #21, p. 6.)  Borrowing  from  the  federal  RICO  definition  of  ""enterprise,"" the defendants argue that ""associated in  fact"" requires that persons must operate as a  ""continuing unit that functions with a common purpose.""  (Doc. #19, p. 23; Doc. #21, pp. 6-7.) R&M continues that  in the context of a TVPRA claim against a hotel  operator, the Complaint must ""at least"" allege a  ""continuous business relationship between the trafficker  and the hotels such that it would appear that the  trafficker and the hotels have established a pattern of  conduct or could be said to have a tacit agreement."" (Id.  p. 7) (citing M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.,  425 F. Supp. 3d 959, 970 (S.D. Ohio 2019)); see also  Doe v. Rickey Patel, LLC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  195811, 2020 WL 6121939, *5 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 30,  2020) (""In [*14]  order to plead Defendants participated  in a venture, Plaintiff must allege facts from which the  Court could reasonably infer the hotels could be said to  have a tacit agreement with the trafficker."" (marks  omitted)).  R&M  concludes  that  ""a  commercial  transaction,"" such as the rental of a hotel room, ""does  not give rise to a reasonable inference that the  participants in such a transaction shared any common  purpose or otherwise 'associated in fact.'"" (Doc. #21, p.  7.) Similarly, Choice asserts that plaintiff has failed to  allege it associated in fact with the non-party traffickers.  (Doc. #19, p. 23.) Here, the Complaint alleges the defendants participated  in a venture ""by engaging in a pattern of acts and  omissions that were intended to support, facilitate,  harbor, and otherwise further the traffickers' sale and  victimization of the Plaintiff S.Y. for commercial sexual  exploitation by repeatedly renting rooms at Comfort Inn  Hotel to people"" the defendants ""knew or should have  known were engaged in sex trafficking."" (Doc. #1, ¶  160.) The Complaint also alleges why the defendants  should have been on notice of the sex trafficking and  how it failed to prevent it. (Id. ¶¶ 4-16, 54-82,     2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *11 Page 6 of 15 115.) [*15]  The Court finds the allegations in the  Complaint sufficient to allege participation in a venture  under section 1595(a). See Doe, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  195811, 2020 WL 6121939, *5 (""The Court finds it  sufficient  for  Plaintiff  to  plead  that  Defendants  participated in a venture by renting rooms to individuals  that knew or should have known were involved in a sex- trafficking  venture,  including  the  sex-trafficking  victim.""); M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 971 (""This Court finds  Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to show Defendants  'participated in a venture' under § 1595 by alleging that  Defendants rented rooms to people it knew or should  have known where [sic] engaged in sex trafficking.""). Choice and R&M also argue that ""participation"" in a  venture requires an allegation of an overt act in  furtherance of the venture, and that failure to prevent  sex trafficking is insufficient. (Doc. #19, pp. 18-19;  Doc. #21, pp. 7-8.) The Court is not convinced. S.Y.,  476 F. Supp. 3d at 1256 (""In the absence of any  controlling authority, the Court concludes that actual  'participation in the sex trafficking act itself' is not  required to state a claim under section 1595.  Accordingly, plaintiffs' failure to allege such actual  participation is not fatal to its section 1595 claim under  the TVPRA.""). The defendants have not identified any  controlling authority to [*16]  the contrary. (c) Knowingly Benefited From Participating in  Venture The motions next argue that the Complaint insufficiently  alleges the defendants knowingly benefitted from  participating in a venture that committed TVPRA crimes,  with knowledge of the causal relationship. (Doc. #19,  pp. 17-23; Doc. #21, p. 9.) R&M argues that the  allegation that it benefited generally from the operation  of the hotel is insufficient for TVPRA liability. (Doc. #21,  p. 9.) The Complaint alleges the defendants knowingly  benefited from the sex trafficking of plaintiff ""by  receiving payment for the rooms rented for Plaintiff S.Y.  and her traffickers at the Comfort Inn Hotel,"" and by  receiving ""other financial benefits in the form of food and  beverage sales and ATM fees from those persons who  were engaging in sex trafficking."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 158.) As      to Choice as franchisor, the Complaint alleges it  ""received a significant franchise fee and continuous  royalties on the Comfort Inn Hotel's gross revenue,""  while also exercising ""ongoing and systematic control  over operations at the Comfort Inn Hotel."" (Id. ¶¶ 43,  115.) The Court finds such allegations sufficient to  satisfy the ""knowingly benefitted"" element. S.Y., 476 F.  Supp. 3d at 1257; Doe S.W. v. Lorain-Elyria Motel, Inc.,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192, *5  (S.D. Ohio Mar. 16, 2020); H.H. v. G6 Hosp., LLC, 2019  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, *2 (S.D.  Ohio Dec. 6, 2019) [*17] ; M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 965. (d) Knew or Should Have Known that Venture was  Committing Sex Trafficking Crimes Both motions argue the Complaint fails to plausibly  allege the defendants knew or should have known that  the ""venture"" was engaging in sex-trafficking crimes,  i.e., that the defendants knew or should have known  that an adult plaintiff was caused to engage in  commercial sex by force, threats of force, fraud, or  coercion. (Doc. #19, pp. 23-26; Doc. #21, pp. 10-12.)  Choice argues that ""[a]t most,"" the Complaint's  allegations address Choice's constructive knowledge of  prostitution and sex trafficking, but not the sex  trafficking of plaintiff. (Doc. #19, p. 25.) Similarly, R&M  argues the Complaint lacks plausible allegations that it  ""knew or should have known"" of any venture that  trafficked plaintiff. (Doc. #21, p. 12.) The Court disagrees with this argument. First of all,  ""knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind  may be alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b); see Sun  Life Assurance Co. of Can. v. Imperial Premium Fin.,  LLC, 904 F.3d 1197, 1215 (11th Cir. 2018). Pleading  ""generally"" is not without limits, and a complaint must  still comply with ""the less rigid—though still operative— strictures of Rule 8."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 686-87. The  Complaint clearly satisfies this notice pleading standard. Plaintiff has alleged that the following [*18]  was ""routine  conduct taking place at the Comfort Inn Hotel as a result  of the human sex trafficking enterprise"": a. Plaintiff's sex traffickers frequently rented rooms  at the hotel close to each other; b. Plaintiff's sex traffickers paid cash for the rooms  at the Comfort Inn Hotel where the Plaintiff  engaged in commercial sex acts; c. Plaintiff's sex traffickers booked extended stays  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *14 Page 7 of 15 at the Comfort Inn Hotel for themselves and for the  Plaintiff on a routine basis and on a rotating basis  frequently throughout the year; d. Plaintiff and her sex traffickers would have few or  no luggage or personal possessions for these  extended stays; e. Plaintiff was confined in the rooms at the Comfort  Inn Hotel for long periods of time; f. Plaintiff's rooms and her sex traffickers' rooms  consistently displayed ""Do Not Disturb"" signs on the  doors to the room where the Plaintiff was engaged  in commercial sex acts; g. Men (""Johns"") frequently entered and left the  rooms at the Comfort Inn Hotel where the Plaintiff  was engaged in illegal commercial sex acts at all  times of day and night; h. The staff and customers at the Comfort Inn Hotel  that was owned, operated, managed, supervised,  controlled and/or otherwise [*19]  held responsible  by each and every Comfort Inn Defendant saw  and/or reported to the Comfort Inn Hotel's  respective administration that the rooms where the  Plaintiff engaged in commercial sex acts were  messy, and contained sex and drug paraphernalia  and had an unclean smell; i. The rooms at the Comfort Inn Hotel were often  stained with Plaintiff's blood and that of other  trafficking victims after they were beaten or  violently raped; j. Plaintiff's sex traffickers consistently refused  housekeeping  services  and  otherwise  would  prohibit staff from entering their rooms and the  Plaintiff's rooms; k. Plaintiff would frequently request clean towels  and linens; l. Plaintiff dressed in a sexually explicit manner and  would walk the hallways of the Comfort Inn Hotel in  inappropriate attire; m. Plaintiff S.Y. and other trafficking victims were  often seen on the hotel's balconies in inappropriate  attire or without any clothes at all; n. Excessively loud noises would consistently come  from Plaintiff's rooms; o. During nighttime hours, Plaintiff and her ""Johns""  and drug clients would create noise in the public  area of the Comfort Inn Hotel and, upon information  and belief, would be a disturbance to other [*20]   guests using the hotel for their intended purposes;  and p. While at the hotel, the Plaintiff displayed clear  signs of physical abuse, diminished personal  hygiene, submissiveness and inappropriate attire. (Doc. #1, ¶ 98.) Further, the Complaint alleges the  defendants ""knew or should have known about the  nature of the sex trafficking venture at the Comfort Inn  Hotel, including as they related to Plaintiff S.Y."" due to  the following: a. Requests by the traffickers to rent adjoining  rooms; b. Cash payments for the rooms by the sex  traffickers; c. Refusal of housekeeping services by those  persons engaged in sex trafficking; d. Excessive used condoms located in the rooms  used for sex trafficking; e. Excessive requests for towels and linens in the  rooms used for sex trafficking; f. Hotel staff observing Plaintiff S.Y. and her  traffickers in the hotel; g. Plaintiff S.Y. being escorted by traffickers in and  around the hotel; h. Operation of sex trafficking ventures out of the  same hotel room for multiple days or weeks in  succession; i. Multiple men per day coming and going from the  same  rooms  without  luggage  or  personal  possessions; j. Knowledge of police and EMS activity at the  Comfort Inn Hotel and at [*21]  other locations near  the Comfort Inn Hotel that was related to  commercial sex work; and k. Knowledge that Plaintiff S.Y. and other sex  trafficking victims were often seen naked and/or in  inappropriate attire on the hotel's balconies. (Id. ¶ 159.) The  Court  finds  these  allegations  sufficient  to  reasonably infer the defendants knew or should have  known of the sex trafficking venture. S.Y., 476 F.  Supp. 3d at 1257; A.B., 455 F. Supp. 3d at 193-94; Doe  S.W., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192,  *5-6; H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *18 Page 8 of 15 6682152, *3; M.A., 425 F. Supp 3d at 967-68. (e) Vicarious Liability Finally, Choice argues the TVPRA claim should be  dismissed because ""[t]here is no vicarious liability under  the plain meaning of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #19, p. 26.) The  Court disagrees. See S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1257-58  (finding  plaintiff  made  sufficient  allegations  that  franchisor was vicariously liable under section 1595 of  the TVPRA to survive dismissal); see also J.C. v.  Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073,  2020 WL 6318707, *10 (N.D. Ca. Oct. 28, 2020) (finding  plaintiff's vicarious liability claim had ""alleged sufficient  facts to support a plausible claim that [defendants]  received financial benefits from a venture they  vicariously participate in (through their franchisees) that  the franchises should have known was engaged in sex  trafficking""). Choice also argues that even if it could be held  vicariously liable under the TVPRA, plaintiff's allegations  are insufficient to establish an agency relationship  between [*22]  Choice and its franchisee. (Doc. #19, p.  27.) Having reviewed the allegations at issue, the Court  finds them sufficient to create a plausible inference of an  agency relationship. ""It is well-established that a franchise relationship does  not by itself create an agency relationship between the  franchisor and franchisee."" Cain v. Shell Oil Co., 994 F.  Supp. 2d 1251, 1252 (N.D. Fla. 2014). However,  ""[f]ranchisors may well enter into an agency relationship  with a franchisee if, by contract or action or  representation, the franchisor has directly or apparently  participated in some substantial way in directing or  managing acts of the franchisee, beyond the mere fact  of providing contractual franchise support activities.""  Mobil Oil Corp. v. Bransford, 648 So. 2d 119, 120 (Fla.  1995). Here, the Complaint alleges Choice was in an agency  relationship with R&M during the relevant time period.  (Doc. #1, ¶ 115.) The Complaint further asserts that in a  variety of ways Choice exercised control over the  means and methods of how R&M conducted business,  such as by profit sharing, standardized training,  standardized rules of operation, regular inspection, and  price fixing. (Id. ¶ 116.) The Court finds such allegations  sufficient to support a plausible inference of an agency  relationship. See S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1258; A.B.,  455 F. Supp. 3d at 195-97; Doe S.W., 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192, *7; H.H., 2019 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, *6; M.A., 425 F.  Supp. 3d at 972. Because the allegations [*23]  in the Complaint are  sufficient to state a claim under section 1595 of the  TVPRA, the Court denies the motions for dismissal  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). (2) Florida RICO Violation Count Two of the Complaint asserts a claim against  both defendants under Florida's civil RICO statute,  section 772.104, Florida Statutes. (Doc. #1, p. 35.) To  state a claim under the statute, plaintiff must allege  plausible facts showing ""(1) conduct or participation in  an enterprise through (2) a pattern of [criminal] activity.""  Horace-Manasse v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 521 F.  App'x 782, 784 (11th Cir. 2013) (quoting Lugo v. State,  845 So. 2d 74, 97 (Fla. 2003)).                                  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *21 Page 9 of 15 The defendants argue that plaintiff lacks standing  because personal injuries cannot be remedied by RICO.  (Doc. #19, p. 21; Doc. #21, p. 16.) There is some  authority to suggest the Florida RICO statute, unlike the  federal equivalent, does not ""expressly limit recovery"" to  persons who have suffered injury to their business or  property, and that recovery for personal injuries may be  allowed. Berber v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 2018 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 234385, 2018 WL 10436236, at *3 (S.D.  Fla. May 24, 2018) (collecting cases). The motion will be  denied on this basis. Plaintiff's RICO claim is asserted under sections  772.104(1) and (2), which provide civil remedies for  violations of section 772.103, Florida Statutes. (Doc. #1,  ¶ 162.) Section 772.103 contains four subsections of  prohibited activities. § 772.103, Fla. Stat. R&M argues  that because plaintiff fails ""to specify the particular  subsection of Section 772.103 giving rise to a Florida  RICO [*24]  claim,"" the claim is defective. (Doc. #21, pp.  12-13.) Plaintiff fails to address this argument in her  response. This court has previously stated that a RICO claim's  failure to identify which subsection of section 772.103 is  implicated is sufficient to warrant dismissal. Lennon v.  Marriott Ownership Resorts, Inc., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  55004, 2019 WL 1440092, *10 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 31,  2019); Signeo Int'l Ltd. v. Wade, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  203002, 2013 WL 12153590, *6 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 1,  2013). However, the Court finds dismissal unnecessary  in this case because it is apparent which subsection  plaintiff is relying upon. Section 772.103(3) makes it  unlawful for any person associated with any enterprise  to conduct or participate in such enterprise through a  pattern of criminal activity. In the Complaint, plaintiff  alleges the defendants ""conducted or participated in . . .  the affairs of their respective RICO Enterprises through  a pattern of numerous acts of racketeering activity . . . in  violation of Fla. Stat. § 772.103."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 166.)  Because this allegation tracks the language of  subsection three, the Court finds it provides sufficient  notice of the applicable provision. Accordingly, the Court  denies R&M's request for dismissal on this basis. Each of the motions also argue plaintiff has insufficiently  pled the enterprise element of her claim. (Doc. #19, pp.  28-31; Doc. #19, pp. 13-15.) Florida's RICO statute  defines  enterprise  to  include  a  ""group  of  individuals [*25]  associated in fact although not a legal  entity."" § 772.102(3), Fla. Stat. ""[A]n association-in-fact   enterprise is simply a continuing unit that functions with  a common purpose."" Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S.  938, 948, 129 S. Ct. 2237, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1265 (2009).  To sufficiently plead such an enterprise, ""a plaintiff must  allege that a group of persons shares three structural  features: (1) a purpose, (2) relationships among those  associated with the enterprise, and (3) longevity  sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the  enterprise's purpose."" Cisneros v. Petland, Inc., 972  F.3d 1204, 1211 (11th Cir. 2020) (marks and citations  omitted). ""The purpose prong contemplates 'a common purpose  of engaging in a course of conduct' among the  enterprise's alleged participants."" Cisneros, 972 F.3d at  1211 (quoting United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576,  583, 101 S. Ct. 2524, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1981)). ""An  abstract common purpose, such as a generally shared  interest in making money, will not suffice. Rather, where  the participants' ultimate purpose is to make money for  themselves, a RICO plaintiff must plausibly allege that  the participants shared the purpose of enriching  themselves through a particular criminal course of  conduct."" Id. (citations omitted). Here, the Complaint alleges the defendants ""associated  with each other and/or the Plaintiff S.Y.'s sex traffickers  for the common purpose of profiting off an established  sex  trafficking  scheme.""  (Doc.  #1,  ¶  165.)  Plaintiff [*26]   asserts  this  ""association-in-fact""  constitutes an ""enterprise"" under Florida's RICO statute,  and that the defendants conducted or participated in  their enterprises through a pattern of criminal activity,  ""related by their common purpose to profit off an  institutionalized sex trafficking scheme."" (Id. ¶¶ 165- 66.) The Court finds these allegations sufficient to allege  the defendants ""shared the purpose of enriching  themselves through a particular criminal course of  conduct."" Cisneros, 972 F.3d at 1211; see also United  States v. Church, 955 F.2d 688, 697-98 (11th Cir. 1992)  (noting that ""an association's devotion to 'making money  from repeated criminal activity' . . . demonstrates an  enterprise's 'common purpose of engaging in a course  of conduct'"" (citations omitted)); Burgese v. Starwood  Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., 101 F. Supp. 3d 414,  424 (D. N.J. 2015) (on motion to dismiss Florida RICO  claim, court found that ""Plaintiff's Amended Complaint  can be read to allege a 'common purpose' of furthering  an institutionalized prostitution scheme to increase  profits for the participants,"" and that ""[t]hese allegations,  though thin, are sufficient for purposes of this motion""). Next, R&M argues plaintiff has failed to plead the claim  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *23 Page 10 of 15 with the heightened level of specificity required for RICO  claims. (Doc. #21, p. 15.) Plaintiff responds that  because the RICO claim is [*27]  based on non- fraudulent predicate acts, the heightened pleading  requirement is not applicable. (Doc. #42, p. 22.) The  Court agrees with plaintiff. While the Eleventh Circuit has described RICO claims  as ""essentially a certain breed of fraud claims"" that  ""must be pled with an increased level of specificity""  consistent with Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure, Arthur v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA, 569  F. App'x 669, 681 (11th Cir. 2014), such a standard  applies only when the RICO claim is based on fraud or  mistake, see D. Penguin Bros. Ltd. v. City Nat'l Bank,  587 F. App'x 663, 666 (2d Cir. 2014) (""In the RICO  context, a plaintiff must plead predicate acts sounding in  fraud  or  mistake  according  to  the  particularity  requirement of Rule 9(b); for other elements of a RICO  claim—such as non-fraud predicate acts or . . . the  existence of an 'enterprise'—a plaintiff's complaint need  satisfy only the 'short and plain statement' standard of  Rule 8(a).""); Cardenas v. Toyota Motor Corp., 418 F.  Supp. 3d 1090, 1098 (S.D. Fla. 2019) (""[B]ecause  particularity pleading under Rule 9(b) is limited to  circumstances  constituting  fraud,  the  non-fraud  elements of a RICO claim can be alleged under Rule  8(a) standards."" (citations and marks omitted)). As the  predicate acts in plaintiff's RICO claim are not based in  fraud, the Court finds Rule 9 is not applicable. See  Magnifico v. Villanueva, 783 F. Supp. 2d 1217, 1229,  1229 n.9 (S.D. Fla. 2011) (in addressing RICO  allegations, court applied Rule 9(b) to ""fraud-related  predicate acts,"" such as mail, wire, and immigration  document fraud, and Rule 8 to [*28]  ""non-fraud  predicate acts,"" such as human trafficking). Choice next argues the RICO claim fails to plausibly  allege plaintiff's harm was caused by Choice. (Doc.  #19, pp. 31-32.) Under the Florida RICO statute, a  plaintiff must demonstrate that their injuries were  proximately caused by the RICO violations. See Bortell  v. White Mountains Ins. Grp., Ltd., 2 So. 3d 1041, 1047  (Fla. 4th DCA 2009). ""A wrongful act is a proximate  cause if it is a substantive factor in the sequence of  responsible causation."" Green Leaf Nursery v. E.I.  DuPont De Nemours & Co., 341 F.3d 1292, 1307 (11th  Cir. 2003) (marks and citation omitted). Furthermore, a  plaintiff ""must show a 'direct relation between the injury     asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.'"" Id. (quoting  Holmes v. Sec. Inv'r Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268, 112  S. Ct. 1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1992)). ""Indirect harm is  insufficient to sustain a cause of action under the RICO  statutes."" Bortell, 2 So. 3d at 1047; see also O'Malley,  599 So. 2d at 1000 (""[I]ndirect injuries, that is, injuries  sustained not as a direct result of predicate acts . . . will  not allow recovery under Florida RICO.""). Choice argues that plaintiff has not alleged a direct  relation between her injuries and Choice's purported  violation of the RICO statute, and that the conduct  responsible for plaintiff's alleged harm was the actions  of the traffickers and ""Johns."" (Doc. #19, pp. 31-32.)  Plaintiff responds that she has sufficiently pled  proximate cause and losses as a direct result of [*29]   the sex trafficking enterprise by alleging she ""was at  the Comfort Inn as part of the sexual trafficking  scheme and her injuries were caused by and in  furtherance of the sexual trafficking scheme."" (Doc.  #43, p. 34.) Having reviewed the allegations in the  Complaint, the Court agrees with plaintiff. The Complaint alleges each of defendants ""was on  notice of repeated incidences of sex trafficking  occurring on their hotel premises,"" and yet ""failed to  take the necessary actions to prevent sex trafficking  from taking place."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 59.) The Complaint also  alleges numerous ways in which the defendants could  have identified and prevented the sex trafficking from  occurring. (Id. ¶¶ 61-76.) Finally, the Complaint alleges  the ""acts and omissions of the Comfort Inn Defendants  served to support, facilitate, harbor, and otherwise  further the traffickers' sale and victimization"" of plaintiff  ""for commercial sexual exploitation by repeatedly  renting rooms to people they knew or should have  known were engaged in sex trafficking."" (Id. ¶ 129.)  ""[B]y knowingly, or with reckless disregard, repeatedly  allowing sex trafficking to occur on their premises  between 2013 and 2016,"" the defendants' ""acts [*30]   have yielded consistent results and caused economic,  physical, and psychological injuries"" to plaintiff. (Id. ¶¶  168, 171.) The Court finds these allegations sufficient to plead a  ""direct relation between the injury asserted and the  injurious conduct alleged,"" Holmes, 503 U.S. at 268,  and  therefore  the  Complaint  adequately  pleads  proximate cause, see Burgese, 101 F. Supp. 3d at 422  (finding allegations of physical injury and mental  anguish ""cognizable under the Florida RICO Act"" and  sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss); cf. Berber,  2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 234385, 2018 WL 10436236, *5  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *26 Page 11 of 15 (""Because Plaintiffs' asserted injuries arise from a set of  actions entirely distinct form [sic] the alleged predicate  RICO violations, proximate cause is lacking as a matter  of law.""). Accordingly, the Court finds the Complaint's Florida  RICO claim sufficiently plead and therefore will deny the  motions to dismiss the claim. (3) Premise Liability Count Three of the Complaint asserts a claim of  premise liability against each defendant. (Doc. #1, p.  37.) A premise liability claim is a form of negligence  action. ""The elements for negligence are duty, breach,  harm, and proximate cause; the additional elements for  a claim of premises liability include the defendant's  possession or control of the premises and notice  of [*31]  the dangerous condition."" Lisanti v. City of Port  Richey, 787 So. 2d 36, 37 (Fla. 2d DCA 2001). Plaintiff  alleges the defendants owed her a variety of duties, that  they breached these duties, and that as a direct and  proximate result, she suffered bodily injury. (Doc. #1, ¶¶  181-95.) Plaintiff also alleges the defendants had actual  or constructive knowledge of sex trafficking occurring  on the premises, that they knew or should have known  the risk of such criminal conduct taking place would be  unreasonably high without appropriate precautions, and  that they had actual or constructive knowledge of the  dangerous conditions plaintiff was in. (Id. ¶¶ 186-88.) (a) Statute of Limitations The motions argue the premise liability claim should be  dismissed because it is barred by the relevant statute of  limitations. (Doc. #19, p. 33; Doc. #21, p. 17.) Under  Florida law, the statute of limitations for negligence  claims is four years. § 95.11(3)(a), Fla. Stat. A statute of limitations bar is ""an affirmative defense,  and . . . plaintiff[s] [are] not required to negate an  affirmative defense in [their] complaint."" La Grasta v.  First Union Sec., Inc., 358 F.3d 840, 845 (11th Cir.         2004) (citation omitted). ""A dismissal for failure to state  a claim on statute of limitations grounds is appropriate  only if it is apparent from the face of the complaint that  the claim [*32]  is time-barred."" United States ex rel.  Hunt v. Cochise Consultancy, Inc., 887 F.3d 1081, 1085  (11th Cir. 2018) (marks and citation omitted). Plaintiff alleges the sex trafficking occurred at the  Comfort Inn Hotel ""from approximately 2013 and  continuing through approximately February of 2016.""  (Doc. #1, ¶ 13.) Both defendants argue that because  plaintiff did not file her lawsuit until December 2019, her  premise liability claim is at least partially time barred.  (Doc. #19, p. 33; Doc. #21, p. 17.) ""Under Florida law, the statute of limitations begins to  run when the cause of action accrues."" Carnival Corp. v.  Rolls-Royce PLC, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107141, 2009  WL 3861482, *5 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 17, 2009) (citing §  95.031, Fla. Stat.). ""A cause of action accrues when the  last element constituting the cause of action occurs."" §  95.031(1), Fla. Stat. ""Under the continuing tort doctrine,  the cause of action accrues when the tortious conduct  ceases."" Effs v. Sony Pictures Home Entm't, Inc., 197  So. 3d 1243, 1244 (Fla. 3d DCA 2016) (emphasis and  citation omitted). ""A continuing tort is established by  continual tortious acts, not by continual harmful effects  from an original, completed act."" Id. at 1245 (marks,  emphasis, and citation omitted). Here, plaintiff alleges she was a repeat victim of sex  trafficking at the Comfort Inn Hotel between 2013 and  February 2016. The Court finds such allegations  sufficient to invoke the continuing tort doctrine. See Nat'l  Sourcing, Inc. v. Bracciale, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  199436, 2018 WL 6172430, *2 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 26,  2018) (finding allegation that a defendant's actions  ""continued to this day"" inferred [*33]  continuous tortious  conduct, thereby making it plausible for the plaintiffs to  assert the continuing tort doctrine as a basis to toll the  statute of limitations). Accordingly, the Court finds that  plaintiff's premise liability claim did not accrue until  February 2016, and therefore she had until February  2020 to file a complaint asserting premises liability. (1) Choice Plaintiff met this deadline by filing her First Amended  Complaint against Choice on December 31, 2019. S.Y.  et al v. Naples Hotel Co. et al, Case No. 2:20-cv-118  (Doc. #3). While the Court determined severance of the  parties was appropriate in the original action, S.Y., 476  F. Supp. 3d at 1259, and this Complaint was filed in  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *30 Page 12 of 15 August 2020, it appears that the December 2019 date is  applicable for statute of limitations purposes under the  relation-back provisions of Rule 15(c) of the Federal  Rules of Civil Procedure. Relation back is a legal fiction employed to salvage  claims that would otherwise be unjustly barred by a  limitations provision. See McCurdy v. United States,  264 U.S. 484, 487, 44 S.Ct. 345, 346, 68 L.Ed. 801  (1924); Moore v. Baker, 989 F.2d 1129, 1131 (11th  Cir. 1993). Under Rule 15, a claim in an amended  complaint relates back to the filing date of the  original complaint if it ""asserts a claim or defense  that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or  occurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in  the  original  pleading.""  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  15(c)(1)(B). [*34]  When the facts in the original  complaint do not put the defendant ""on notice that  the new claims of negligence might be asserted,""  but the new claims instead ""involve[ ] separate and  distinct conduct,"" such that the plaintiff would have  to prove ""completely different facts"" than required to  recover on the claims in the original complaint, the  new claims do not relate back. Moore, 989 F.2d at  1132. Caron v. NCL (Bahamas), Ltd., 910 F.3d 1359, 1368  (11th Cir. 2018). Accordingly, since it is not apparent  from the face of the Complaint that the claim is time- barred, dismissal based upon the statute of limitations  affirmative defense is not appropriate. For the same reasons, the Court rejects the argument  that plaintiff's negligent hiring, supervision, and retention  claim against Choice is also barred by the four-year  statute of limitations. (Doc. #19, p. 33.) (2) R&M R&M was not named in the December 2019 First  Amended Complaint. Rather, it was first added as a  defendant in April 2020. S.Y. et al v. Naples Hotel Co. et  al, Case No. 2:20-cv-118 (Doc. #85.) Nonetheless, the  Court declines to dismiss based on the statute of  limitations. As noted, plaintiff is not required to negate  an affirmative defense in her complaint. La Grasta, 358  F.3d at 845. It is not apparent from the face of the  Complaint that the [*35]  claim is time-barred because  the Court cannot determine that plaintiff's premise  liability claim does not relate back to the First Amended  Complaint or is not subject to statutory or equitable  tolling. Therefore, the motion to dismiss is denied at  this stage of the proceedings. To the extent R&M seeks dismissal of the other  negligent claims on the same grounds (Doc. #21, p. 17),  the Court's ruling applies to those claims as well. (b) Failure to State a Claim Both defendants argue the premise liability claim is  insufficiently pled. Choice argues the claim fails  because the Complaint does not plausibly allege that  Choice possessed or controlled the Comfort Inn Hotel.  (Doc. #19, pp. 37-38.) The Court disagrees. As noted, a  premise liability claim requires a defendant possess or  control the premises at issue. Lisanti, 787 So. 2d at 37.  Here, the Complaint alleges the defendants were the  ""owners, operators, managers, supervisors, controllers  and innkeepers"" of the Comfort Inn Hotel, and that  Choice exercised control over the means and methods  of how R&M conducted business at the hotel. (Doc.                                2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *33 Page 13 of 15 #1, ¶¶ 28, 116.) While Choice may dispute these  allegations, the Court must accept them as true at  this [*36]  stage of the proceedings and finds them  sufficient to allege Choice had sufficient control of the  Comfort Inn Hotel for premise liability purposes. R&M argues there could be no duty to protect plaintiff  from the criminal conduct of third parties because such  conduct was not foreseeable. (Doc. #21, pp. 17-18.)  The Court disagrees with this argument as well. ""Under Florida law, a business owes invitees a duty to  use due care to maintain its premises in a reasonably  safe condition. This includes the duty to protect  customers from criminal attacks that are reasonably  foreseeable."" Banosmoreno v. Walgreen Co., 299 F.  App'x 912, 913 (11th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). Foreseeability can be shown by two alternative  means. First, a plaintiff may demonstrate that a  proprietor knew or should have known of a  dangerous condition on his premises that was likely  to cause harm to a patron. Second, a plaintiff can  show that a proprietor knew or should have known  of the dangerous propensities of a particular patron. Id. (marks, citations, and footnote omitted). Such  knowledge must only be pled generally. Fed. R. Civ. P.  9(b). The Complaint contains sufficient allegations that sex  trafficking was occurring at the Comfort Inn Hotel and  that the defendants knew or should have [*37]  known  of it. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 54-60, 98-108, 159.) The Complaint  also contains sufficient allegations to support a claim of  an agency relationship between Choice and R&M, and  any factual challenge to such a relationship is  premature. See Cain, 994 F. Supp. 2d at 1253; Mobil Oil  Corp., 648 So. 2d at 120. Accordingly, the Court finds  the allegations in the Complaint are sufficient to satisfy  the notice pleading requirements. (4) Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention Count Four of the Complaint asserts a claim of negligent  hiring,  supervision,  and  retention  against  the  defendants. (Doc. #1, p. 42.) The motions seek  dismissal of the claim based on pleading deficiencies.  Both defendants first argue plaintiff has improperly      lumped multiple claims together. (Doc. #19, pp. 33-34;  Doc. #21, p. 18.) ""A party may set out 2 or more  statements of a claim or defense alternatively or  hypothetically, either in a single count or defense or in  separate ones. If a party makes alternative statements,  the pleading is sufficient if any one of them is sufficient.""  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(2). The Court finds that the claims  are properly set forth in a single count. To state a claim for negligent hiring, plaintiff must allege  facts showing that (1) the employer was required to make an  appropriate [*38]  investigation of the employee and  failed to do so; (2) an appropriate investigation  would have revealed the unsuitability of the  employee for the particular duty to be performed or  for employment in general; and (3) it was  unreasonable for the employer to hire the employee  in light of the information he knew or should have  known. Groover v. Polk Cty. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs, 460 F. Supp.  3d 1242, 1251 (M.D. Fla. 2020) (quoting Malicki v. Doe,  814 So. 2d 347, 362 (Fla. 2002)). ""Different from  negligent hiring, '[n]egligent retention occurs when,  during the course of employment, the employer  becomes aware or should have become aware of  problems with an employee that indicated his unfitness,  and the employer fails to take further action such as  investigating, discharge, or reassignment.'"" Id. (quoting  Degitz v. S. Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 996 F. Supp. 1451,  1461 (M.D. Fla. 1998)). ""Florida law also holds  employers liable for reasonably foreseeable damages  resulting from the negligent training of its employees  and agents."" Clary v. Armor Corr. Health Servs., Inc.,  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15633, 2014 WL 505126, *4  (M.D. Fla. Feb. 7, 2014) (citing Lewis v. City of St.  Petersburg, 260 F.3d 1260, 1265 (11th Cir. 2001)). ""For  an employer to owe a plaintiff a duty, the plaintiff must  be in the zone of risk that was reasonably foreseeable  to the employer."" Id. (citation omitted). Accordingly, to state a claim, the plaintiff must  allege facts that would establish a nexus between  the plaintiff and the tortfeasor's employment from  which a legal duty would flow from the defendant- employer to [*39]  the plaintiff. The plaintiff must  then  establish  that  the  defendant-employer  breached that duty and that the breach caused him  damage. Id. (citations omitted). 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *35 Page 14 of 15 The Complaint alleges each defendant was in control of  the  hiring,  instructing,  training,  supervising,  and  terminating of the hotel employees, and that each  defendant had a duty to make an appropriate  investigation of the employees. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 202-03.)  The Complaint further alleges that the defendants knew  or should have known that hotel employees were  ""allowing criminals to rent rooms for prostitution and  drug dealing,"" ""failing to either identify and/or report the  human sex trafficking and foreseeable harm"" of  plaintiff, and ""failing to refuse continued lodging services  to human sex traffickers."" (Id. ¶¶ 205-07.) The  Complaint concludes that the defendants were negligent  in their hiring, employment, supervision, and termination  decisions regarding the employees, and that the sex  trafficking of plaintiff was a foreseeable and direct  result. (Id. ¶¶ 208-12.) The Court finds these allegations  sufficient to state plausible claims for negligent hiring,  and negligent supervision/retention. Both motions further argue the claim should [*40]  be  dismissed because the Complaint does not identify the  alleged employees at issue. (Doc. #19, pp. 34-35; Doc.  #21, p. 19.) The Complaint alleges ""[e]ach and every""  defendant ""was in control of the hiring"" of hotel  employees, and responsible for ""instructing, training and  supervising,"" yet employees failed ""to refuse continued  lodging services to human sex traffickers"" and failed ""to  either identify and/or report the human sex trafficking.""  (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 202, 206-07.) The Court is required to  accept all factual allegations as true, Erickson, 551 U.S.  at 94, and ""[i]n adjudicating a motion to dismiss, the  district court may not resolve factual disputes,"" Page v.  Postmaster Gen. & Chief Exec. Officer of U.S. Postal  Serv., 493 F. App'x 994, 995 (11th Cir. 2012). The Court  finds that specific employees are not required to be  named. Accordingly, the Court denies the request to  dismiss the negligent hiring, supervision, and retention  claim. (5) Negligent Rescue Count Five of the Complaint asserts a claim of negligent  rescue against R&M. (Doc. #1, p. 45.) The Complaint  alleges R&M, as the owner and operator of the Comfort  Inn Hotel, had a duty to keep the premises safe and  prevent foreseeable criminal activity, as well as a duty  ""to make safe a dangerous condition at the Comfort Inn     Hotel and to rescue their [sic] hotel [*41]  guests,  specifically Plaintiff S.Y., from the peril they [sic]  created."" (Id. ¶¶ 215, 218, 224.) The Complaint alleges  that by various acts and omissions, R&M breached  these duties and that the continuous sex trafficking of  plaintiff was the direct and foreseeable result. (Id. ¶¶  220-22, 226-27, 229.) R&M argues the negligent rescue  claim should be dismissed because it is insufficiently  pled. (Doc. #21, p. 20.) There is no common law duty to rescue a stranger.  Estate of Ferguson v. Mascara, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  157824, 2010 WL 11558195, *2 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 7,  2010) (citing Bradberry v. Pinellas Cty., 789 F.2d 1513,  1516 (11th Cir. 1986)). ""A well-established exception to  this rule, however, provides that an innkeeper is 'under  an ordinary duty of care to [a guest] after he knows or  has reason to know the [guest] is ill or injured.'"" De La  Flor v. Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co., L.L.C, 2013 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 5403, 2013 WL 148401, *3 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 14,  2013) (quoting L.A. Fitness, Int'l, LLC v. Mayer, 980 So.  2d 550, 557 (Fla. 4th DCA 2008)); see also Abramson v.  Ritz Carlton Hotel Co., LLC, 480 F. App'x 158, 161 (3d  Cir. 2012) (""Generally, there is no duty to affirmatively  assist an injured person unless a special relationship,  such as that between an innkeeper and its guests,  exists between the parties."" (citation omitted)). R&M argues that hotels only have a limited duty to  render aid to a guest it knew or should have known was  ill or injured, and that the Complaint contains no  plausible facts to suggest R&M knew plaintiff was in  need of aid. (Doc. #21, p. 20.) However, the Court finds  the Complaint contains sufficient allegations [*42]  to  satisfy this requirement. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 99, 100, 225.) (6) Aiding and Abetting, Harboring, Confining,  Coercion and Criminal Enterprise Finally, Count Six of the Complaint asserts a claim of  aiding and abetting against R&M. (Doc. #1, p. 47.) The  Complaint accuses R&M of ""aiding and abetting  unlawful  activity  including  unlawful  confinement,  imprisonment, assault and battery by [plaintiff's] sex  traffickers and 'Johns.'"" (Id. ¶ 230.) R&M argues that the  claim must be dismissed because it is overly vague,  fails to articulate a cognizable, independent cause of  action, and lacks well-pled factual allegations. (Doc.  #21, p. 21.) The Court disagrees. Florida courts have recognized aiding and abetting the  commission of a tort as a standalone claim. See Gilison  v. Flagler Bank, 303 So. 3d 999, 1002 (Fla. 4th DCA  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *39 Page 15 of 15 2020) (aiding and abetting fraud); MP, LLC v. Sterling  Holding, LLC, 231 So. 3d 517, 527 (Fla. 3d DCA 2017)  (aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty). This Court  has previously listed the following elements that must be  alleged ""to state a claim for aiding and abetting a  common law tort"" under Florida law: ""(1) an underlying  violation on the part of the primary wrongdoer; (2)  knowledge of the underlying violation by the alleged  aider and abetter [sic]; and (3) the rendering of  substantial  assistance  in  committing [*43]   the  wrongdoing by the alleged aider and abettor."" Angell v.  Allergan Sales, LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142768,  2019 WL 3958262, *8 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 22, 2019); see  also Lawrence v. Bank of Am., N.A., 455 F. App'x 904,  906 (11th Cir. 2012) (applying the above elements to  three Florida tort claims). These cases demonstrate  Florida recognizes a common-law claim of aiding and  abetting tortious conduct. The  Court  finds  plaintiff's  allegations  are  not  impermissibly vague and, to the extent they allege  actual knowledge , are sufficient to state a claim.  Therefore, the Court denies R&M's request for  dismissal. C. Anonymity Finally, Choice argues that plaintiff is not entitled to  proceed anonymously as a matter of right, and that  plaintiff must be required to file a formal motion to do so.  (Doc. #19, p. 39.) On February 24, 2021, plaintiff filed a  Motion to Proceed Anonymously and for Entry of a  Protective Order. (Doc. #55.) Therefore, this issue is  moot. Accordingly, it is now ORDERED: 1. Defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc.'s  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Third Amended  Complaint with Prejudice (Doc. #19) is DENIED. 2. Defendant R&M Real Estate Company, Inc.'s  Motion  to  Dismiss  with  Prejudice  Plaintiff's  Complaint and Incorporated Memorandum of Law           (Doc. #21) is DENIED. DONE AND ORDERED at Fort Myers, Florida, this 26th  day of April, 2021. /s/ John E. Steele JOHN E. [*44]  STEELE SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *42",1
Doe v. Twitter,"[*893]  ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING  IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED  COMPLAINT Re: Dkt. No. 48 I. INTRODUCTION Plaintiffs John Doe #1 and John Doe #2 allege that  when they were thirteen years  [*894]  old they were  solicited  and  recruited  for  sex  trafficking  and  manipulated into providing to a third-party sex trafficker  pornographic videos (""the Videos"") of themselves  through the social media platform Snapchat. A few  years later, when Plaintiffs were still in high school, links  to the Videos were posted on Twitter. Plaintiffs allege  that when they learned of the posts, they informed law  enforcement and urgently requested that Twitter remove  them but Twitter initially refused to do so, allowing the  posts to remain on Twitter, where they accrued more  than 167,000 views and 2,223 retweets. According to  Plaintiffs, it wasn't until the mother of one of the boys  contacted an agent of the Department of Homeland  Security, who initiated contact with Twitter and  requested the removal of the material, that Twitter finally  took down the posts, nine days later. Plaintiffs assert state and federal claims against Twitter  based on its alleged involvement in and/or enabling of  sex trafficking and [**3]  the distribution of the child  pornography containing their images. Twitter, however,  contends that even after Congress's enactment of the  Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act and Stop Enabling  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *889; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **157158 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *889; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **157158 Page 6 of 34 Sex Traffickers Act in 2018, the conduct alleged by  Plaintiffs is shielded from liability under Section 230 of  the Communications Decency Act (""CDA""). Thus,  Twitter brings a Motion to Dismiss First Amended  Complaint (""Motion"") seeking dismissal of all of  Plaintiffs' claims on the basis that it is immune from  liability under the CDA. In the Motion, Twitter also  contends Plaintiffs fail to state viable claims as to many  of their claims. A hearing on the Motion was held on  August 6, 2021. For the reasons stated below, the  Motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. II. BACKGROUND A. First Amended Complaint Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (""FAC""), which is the  operative  complaint,  contains  detailed  allegations  describing: 1) Twitter's platform, business model and  content moderation policies and practices (FAC ¶¶ 23- 51); 2) the ways Twitter allegedly permits and even aids  in the distribution of child pornography on its platform  and profits from doing so (FAC ¶¶ 52-84); 3) how  pornographic content featuring John [**4]  Doe #1 and  John Doe #2 was created and eventually ended up on  Twitter's platform (FAC ¶¶ 85-100); and 4) Twitter's  response to requests that the pornographic photos and  videos containing Plaintiffs' images be removed from  Twitter (FAC ¶¶ 101-132). Based on these allegations, Plaintiffs assert the  following claims: 1) violation of the Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act (""TVPRA""), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a)(1)  and 1595(a) based on the allegation that ""Twitter knew,  or was in reckless disregard of the fact, that through  monetization and providing, obtaining, and maintaining  [child sexual abuse material (""CSAM"")] on its platform,  Twitter and Twitter users received something of value  for the video depicting sex acts of John Doe #1 and  John Doe #2 as minors."" FAC ¶¶ 133-143 (Claim One); 2) violation of the TVPRA, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a)(2) and  1595(a), based on the allegation that Twitter ""knowingly  benefited, or should have known that it was benefiting,  from assisting, supporting, or facilitating a violation of  1591(a)(1)."" FAC ¶¶ 144-155 (Claim Two);    [*895]  3) violation of the duty to report child sexual  abuse material under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2258A and 2258B.  FAC ¶¶ 156-163 (Claim Three); 4) civil remedies for personal injuries related to sex  trafficking and receipt and distribution of [**5]  child  pornography under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2252A, and  2255, based on the allegations that Twitter was ""notified  of the CSAM material depicting John Doe #1 and John  Doe #2 as minors on its platform and still knowingly  received,  maintained,  and  distributed  this  child  pornography after such notice[,]"" causing Plaintiffs to  suffer ""serious harm and personal injury, including,  without limitation, physical, psychological, financial, and  reputational harm."" FAC ¶¶ 164-176 (Claim Four); 5) California products liability based on the allegedly  defective design of the Twitter platform, which is  ""designed so that search terms and hashtags utilized for  trading CSAM return suggestions for other search terms  and hashtags related to CSAM"" and through use of  ""algorithm(s), API, and other proprietary technology""  allows ""child predators and sex traffickers to distribute  CSAM on a massive scale"" while also making it difficult  for users to report CSAM and not allowing for immediate  blocking of CSAM material once reported pending  review. FAC ¶¶ 177-190 (Claim Five); 6) negligence based on allegations that Twitter had a  duty to protect Plaintiffs, had actual knowledge that  CSAM containing their images was being disseminated  on its [**6]  platform and failed to promptly remove it  once notified. FAC ¶¶ 191-197 (Claim Six); 7) gross negligence based on the same theory as  Plaintiffs' negligence claim. FAC ¶¶ 198-203 (Claim  Seven); 8) negligence per se based on the allegation that  Twitter's conduct violated numerous laws, including 18  U.S.C. §§ 1591 and 1595 (benefiting from a sex  trafficking venture), 18 U.S.C. § 2258A (failing to report  known child sexual abuse material), 18 U.S.C. §  2252(a) (knowingly distributing child pornography), Cal.  Civ. Code § 1708.85 (intentionally distributing non-  consensually shared pornography), and Cal. Penal  Code § 311.1 (possessing child pornography). FAC ¶¶  204-26 (Claim Eight); 9) negligent infliction of emotional distress. FAC ¶¶ 207- 212 (Claim Nine); 10) distribution of private sexually explicit materials, in  violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 1708.85, based on the  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *894; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **3 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *894; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **3 Page 7 of 34 allegation that ""[b]y refusing to remove or block the  photographic images and video depicting him after  Plaintiff John Doe #1 notified Twitter that both he and  John Doe #2 were minors, Twitter intentionally  distributed on its online platform photographic images  and video of the Plaintiffs."" FAC ¶¶ 213-218 (Claim  Ten); 11) intrusion into private affairs, based on the allegation  that  ""Twitter  intentionally  intruded  into  Plaintiffs'  reasonable expectation of [**7]  privacy by continuing to  distribute the photographic images and video depicting  them after John Doe #1 notified Twitter that Plaintiffs  were minors and the material had been posted on its  platform without their consent."" FAC ¶¶ 219- 223 (Claim  Eleven); 12) invasion of privacy under the California Constitution,  Article 1, Section 1. FAC ¶¶ 224-228 (Claim Twelve);  and 13) violation of California Business and Professions  Code § 17200 (""UCL"") based on allegations that ""Twitter  utilized and exploited Plaintiffs for its own benefit and  profit"" and ""Plaintiffs, to their detriment, reasonably  relied upon Twitter's willful and deceitful conduct and  assurances that it effectively moderates and otherwise  controls  [*896]  third-party user content on its  platforms."" FAC ¶¶ 229-234 (Claim Thirteen). Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages,  injunctive relief, restitution, disgorgement of profits and  unjust enrichment and attorneys' fees and costs. B. Statutory Background 1. The CDA The  CDA  was  enacted  as  part  of  the  Telecommunications Act of 1996. It contains a ""Good  Samaritan""  provision  that  immunizes  interactive  computer service (""ICS"") providers from liability for  restricting access to certain types of materials or giving  users the technical means to restrict access to such  materials, providing [**8]  as follows: (c) Protection for ""Good Samaritan"" blocking  and screening of offensive material (1) Treatment of publisher or speaker No provider or user of an interactive computer  service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker  of any information provided by another information  content provider. (2) Civil liability No provider or user of an interactive computer  service shall be held liable on account of— (A) any action voluntarily taken in good faith to  restrict access to or availability of material that the  provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd,  lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or  otherwise objectionable, whether or not such  material is constitutionally protected; or (B) any action taken to enable or make available to  information  content  providers  or  others  the  technical means to restrict access to material  described in paragraph (1). 47 U.S.C. § 230(c). ""This grant of immunity dates back to the early days of  the internet when concerns first arose about children  being able to access online pornography."" Enigma  Software Grp. USA, LLC v. Malwarebytes, Inc., 946  F.3d 1040, 1046 (9th Cir. 2019), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct.  13, 208 L. Ed. 2d 197 (2020). At that time, ""[p]arents  could not program their computers to block online  pornography, and this was at least partially due to a  combination of trial court decisions in New [**9]  York  that had deterred the creation of online-filtration efforts.""  Id. Under the New York cases, ""if a provider remained  passive and uninvolved in filtering third-party material  from its network, the provider could not be held liable for  any offensive content it carried from third parties."" Id.  (citing Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe, Inc., 776 F. Supp.  135, 139-43 (S.D.N.Y. 1991)). On the other hand, ""once  a service provider undertook to filter offensive content  from its network, it assumed responsibility for any  offensive content it failed to filter, even if it lacked  knowledge of the content."" Id. (citing Stratton Oakmont,  Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co., 1995 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS  229, 1995 WL 323710, *5 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. May 24,  1995)). ""The Stratton Oakmont decision, along with the  increasing public concern about pornography on the  internet, served as catalysts"" for the enactment of the  CDA. Id. HN1[ ] The Ninth Circuit has interpreted CDA § 230  broadly: so long as an interactive computer service  provider is not also an ""information content provider,""  that is, someone who is ""responsible, in whole or in part,  for the creation or development of"" the offending  content, it is immune from liability arising from content  created by third parties. Fair Hous. Council of San  Fernando Valley v. Roommates.Com,  [*897]  LLC, 521  F.3d 1157, 1162 (9th Cir. 2008) (citing 47 U.S.C. §§  230(c), (f)). Thus, a defendant is entitled to immunity  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *895; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **6 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *895; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **6 Page 8 of 34 under the CDA if: 1) it is a ""provider or user of an  interactive computer service,"" 2) the information  for [**10]  which the plaintiff seeks to hold the defendant  liable was ""information provided by another information  content provider,"" and 3) the complaint seeks to hold the  defendant liable as the ""publisher or speaker"" of that  information. Klayman v. Zuckerberg, 753 F.3d 1354,  1357, 410 U.S. App. D.C. 187 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (citing 47  U.S.C. § 230(c)(1)); see also Pennie v. Twitter, Inc., 281  F. Supp. 3d 874, 890 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (finding that  under Section 230 Twitter was immune from claims  based on theory that third-party content Twitter allowed  to be posted on its platform led to plaintiff's injury  because the claim sought to hold Twitter liable as a  publisher). As expressly stated in Section 230, the policies  underlying the enactment of that section (1) United States District Court Northern District of  California are: (2) to promote the continued development of the  Internet and other interactive computer services  and other interactive media; (3) to preserve the vibrant and competitive free  market that presently exists for the Internet and  other interactive computer services, unfettered by  Federal or State regulation; (4) to encourage the development of technologies  which maximize user control over what information  is received by individuals, families, and schools  who use the Internet and other interactive computer  services; (5) to remove disincentives for the development  and utilization [**11]  of blocking and filtering  technologies that empower parents to restrict their  children's access to objectionable or inappropriate  online material; and (6) to ensure vigorous enforcement of Federal  criminal laws to deter and punish trafficking in  obscenity, stalking, and harassment by means of  computer. 47 U.S.C. § 230(b). Section 230 expressly states that it has ""[n]o effect on  criminal law[,]"" providing that ""[n]othing in this section  shall be construed to impair the enforcement of section  223 or 231 of this title, chapter 71 (relating to obscenity)     or 110 (relating to sexual exploitation of children) of Title  18, or any other Federal criminal statute."" 47 U.S.C. §  230(e)(1). HN2[ ] It expressly preempts all state laws  that are inconsistent with Section 230's grant of  immunity. 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(3) (""No cause of action  may be brought and no liability may be imposed under  any State or local law that is inconsistent with this  section.""). 2. The TVPRA In 2000, Congress enacted the TVPRA, which  criminalized sex trafficking. When it enacted the  TVPRA, ""Congress declared that the purposes of the  [TVPRA] are to 'combat trafficking in persons, a  contemporary manifestation of slavery whose victims  are predominantly women and children, to ensure just  and effective punishment of traffickers, and to [**12]   protect their victims.'"" Ditullio v. Boehm, 662 F.3d 1091,  1094 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Pub.L. No. 106-386, §  102, 114 Stat. 1488 (2000) (codified as amended at 18  U.S.C. § 1589 et seq.)). In 2003, the law was expanded  to provide a private right of civil action for victims of sex  trafficking, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1595. Id. ""The  version of § 1595 enacted in 2003 limited the civil  remedy to victims of three specific  [*898]  trafficking  acts (including sex trafficking of minors), and did not  expressly permit recovery against individuals who  benefit from participation in a trafficking venture."" Id. n.  1 (citing Pub.L. 108-193, § 4(a)(4)(A), 117 Stat. 2878  (2003)). ""In the [TVPRA's] 2008 reauthorization,  Congress deleted those limitations."" Id. (citing Pub.L.  110-457, Title II, § 221(2), 122 Stat. 5067 (2008)). In its current form, the TVPRA makes it a crime to  engage in direct sex trafficking or to benefit financially  from sex trafficking, providing as follows: (a) Whoever knowingly— (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or  within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction  of the United States, recruits, entices, harbors,  transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains,  patronizes, or solicits by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting the  violation [**13]  of paragraph (1) is advertising, in  reckless disregard of the fact, that means of force,  threats of force, fraud, coercion described in  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *897; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **9 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *897; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **9 Page 9 of 34 subsection (e)(2), or any combination of such  means will be used to cause the person to engage  in a commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Section 1591(e) further provides  that ""[in] this section . . . [t]he term 'participation in a  venture' means knowingly assisting, supporting, or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(e)(4). The civil liability provision in its current form provides  that ""[a]n individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the perpetrator  (or whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by  receiving anything of value from participation in a  venture which that person knew or should have known  has engaged in an act in violation of this chapter) in an  appropriate district court of the United States and may  recover damages and reasonable attorneys fees."" 18  U.S.C. § 1595(a). 3. FOSTA In 2018, the CDA was amended by the Allow States and  Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017,  Pub. L. No. 115-164, 132 Stat. 1253 (2018) (""FOSTA""),  which inserted a new provision in CDA § 230  specifically [**14]  addressing the application of that  section in the context of sex trafficking law. See 47  U.S.C. § 230(e)(5). "" 'Congress passed [FOSTA] to  narrow Section 230's scope and provide prosecutors  with new tools to combat the sex trafficking of both  minors and adults.'"" J.B. v. G6 Hosp., LLC, No. 19-CV- 07848-HSG, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213, 2020 WL  4901196, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 20, 2020) (quoting  Woodhull Freedom Found. v. United States, 948 F.3d  363, 368, 445 U.S. App. D.C. 111 (D.C. Cir. 2020)); see  also 164 Cong. Rec. S1849-08, 164 Cong. Rec. S1849- 08, S1849 (reflecting that FOSTA was enacted in  response to an increase in sex trafficking resulting  from ""the presence of [sex trafficking] organizations  online that are using the ruthless efficiency of the  internet to sell women and children""). The legislative  history reflects that one of the websites of particular  concern to Congress was a sex trafficking website  called ""Backpage,"" which knowingly trafficked in young  women and children. See 164 Cong. Rec. S1849-08,  164 Cong. Rec. S1849-08, S1854 (""Why is this law so  important? If I am looking at this through a prosecutor's  lens, now all of  [*899]  the prosecutors in the country  can go after anyone who knowingly facilitates sex  trafficking online. I am not saying when it is by  accident, and I am not saying when it has slipped  through and they don't know it; I am talking about to  knowingly facilitate, which is what [B]ackpage was  doing."") (Senator [**15]  McCaskill). FOSTA's amendment of the CDA consisted of adding  Section 230(e)(5): (5) No effect on sex trafficking law Nothing in this section (other than subsection  (c)(2)(A)) shall be construed to impair or limit— (A) any claim in a civil action brought under section  1595 of Title 18, if the conduct underlying the claim  constitutes a violation of section 1591 of that title; (B) any charge in a criminal prosecution brought  under State law if the conduct underlying the  charge would constitute a violation of section 1591  of Title 18; or (C) any charge in a criminal prosecution brought  under State law if the conduct underlying the  charge would constitute a violation of section  2421A of Title 18, and promotion or facilitation of  prostitution is illegal in the jurisdiction where the  defendant's promotion or facilitation of prostitution  was targeted. 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5). "" 'HN3[ ] FOSTA narrowed the  scope of immunity for interactive computer service  providers, by providing that Section 230 has ""[n]o effect  on sex trafficking law,"" and shall not ""be construed to  impair or limit"" civil claims brought under TVPRA  Section 1595 or criminal charges brought under state  law if the underlying conduct would constitute a violation  of TVPRA Sections 1591 or 2421A.'"" J. B. v. G6 Hosp.,  LLC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213, 2020 WL 4901196,  at *4 (quoting Woodhull Freedom Found. v. United  States, 948 F.3d at 368) (quoting 132 Stat. at 1254). C. Contentions of the Parties 1. Motion Twitter argues in the Motion that it is [**16]  immune  under CDA § 230 as to all of Plaintiffs' claims. Motion at  2. According to Twitter, the amendment of Section 230  under FOSTA, permitting sex trafficking victims to  pursue civil claims under 18 U.S.C. § 1595 against an  interactive computer service provider where the provider  violates 18 U.S.C. § 1591, created only a narrow  exception to the immunity afforded under Section 230  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *898; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **13 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *898; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **13 Page 10 of 34 that was ""carefully targeted to remove civil immunity for  the few criminal websites that, unlike Twitter here, were  deliberately and knowingly assisting and profiting from  reprehensible crimes."" Id. Twitter contends, ""FOSTA's  language, its legislative history, and the pre-existing  case law on Section 1591 all point to the same  conclusion: civil claims can only proceed against sex  traffickers and those who knowingly benefit from their  affirmative participation in a sex trafficking venture."" Id. Twitter argues that here, Plaintiffs have failed to allege  facts showing that the exception to immunity created  under FOSTA applies because the FAC: 1) ""lacks any  facts showing that Twitter affirmatively participated in  any kind of venture with the Perpetrators, let alone a  sex trafficking venture""; 2) ""does not allege, as  required to establish a violation of Section 1591, any  facts establishing that Twitter [**17]  knew that Plaintiffs  were victims of sex trafficking or that the Videos were  evidence of this crime""; and 3) does not ""allege any  connection between the Perpetrators and Twitter or that  Twitter received any benefits because of the Videos."" Id.  Twitter further asserts that CDA § 230 protects it from  liability because ""Twitter did remove the Videos and  suspend the  [*900]  accounts that had posted them""  and it cannot be held liable under ""any applicable law""  simply because it did not take the videos down  immediately. Id. Twitter represents that it ""vigorously combats [child  sexual  exploitation  material  (""CSE"")]  through  a  combination of methods, including review of user  reports and the use of proprietary technology to  proactively identify and remove such material"" but that  ""given the sheer volume of Tweets posted every day on  Twitter's platform (hundreds of millions of Tweets posted  by over 190 million daily users), it is simply not possible  for Twitter - or the individuals who enforce its Rules and  policies - to find and remove all offending content  immediately or accurately in all cases."" Id. at 1. Twitter  points to its zero-tolerance policy for child sexual  exploitation materials, which is set forth [**18]  in its  Rules - to which users must agree when they create a  Twitter account. Id. at 6. According to Twitter, it also  ""utilizes multiple tools, including reports by the public . . .  , moderators who review reports of abuse and CSE  content, innovative technology and algorithms that  proactively  identify  abusive  content,  and  online  education and information sharing to combat online  abuse.""

According to Twitter, in  enacting FOSTA, Congress did not intend ""for online  platforms like Twitter that proactively act against such  activity to be sued for their inadvertent failure to remove  content."" Id. at 2. The purpose of CDA § 230, according to Twitter, was ""to  ensure  that  interactive  computer  service  ('ICS')  providers would never have to choose 'between taking  responsibility for all messages and deleting no  messages at all,' which presents such providers a 'grim'  and illusory choice."" Id. at 3 (quoting Fair Hous. Council  of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.Com, LLC, 521  F.3d 1157, 1162-63 (9th Cir. 2008)). To achieve that  purpose,  it  asserts,  ""§  230  creates  broad  immunity [**19]  for claims against ICS providers based  on content created by users: 'No provider . . . of an  interactive computer service shall be treated as the  publisher or speaker of any information provided by  another information content provider.'"" Id. (quoting 47  U.S.C. § 230(c)(1)). Twitter contends this provision  ""bars all causes of action that seek to hold ICS  providers like Twitter liable for not removing content  created by a third-party."" Id. (citing Igbonwa v.  Facebook, Inc., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173769, 2018  WL 4907632, at *5-7 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 9, 2018), aff'd, 786  F. App'x 104 (9th Cir. 2019)). Twitter asserts that FOSTA created only a narrow  exception to the immunity afforded under CDA § 230,  permitting a victim of sex trafficking to bring a civil  action under § 1595, but only "" 'if the conduct underlying  the claim constitutes a violation of [S]ection 1591,' the  criminal statute prohibiting sex trafficking.""

Fla. 2020) (""FOSTA  permits civil liability for websites only if the conduct  underlying the claim constitutes a violation of section  1591."")). This limitation is important, it contends,  because ""Section 1591 has more stringent mens rea  and required elements to meet than Section 1595."" Id.  Thus, Twitter argues, the FOSTA exception only applies  to ""openly malicious actors"" and does not otherwise  change the scope of immunity under CDA § 230. Id. at 5  (citing Kik, 482 F.Supp.3d at 1249-51); see also id. at 3.  According to Twitter, this [**20]  is apparent from the  legislative history. Id. (citing 164 Cong. Rec., at S1860- 62 (statement of Senator Durbin (""[FOSTA] is a narrowly  crafted bill that would ensure that Section 230 . . .   [*901]  does not provide legal immunity to websites like  Backpage that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking"")); id.  (statement of Senator Schumer (""Key to my support is  my understanding that this legislation would not allow  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *899; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **16 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *899; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **16 Page 11 of 34 nuisance lawsuits against technology companies."")). Here, Twitter asserts, it meets all the requirements for  establishing immunity under CDA § 230, namely, that  (1) it is an ICS provider; (2) Plaintiffs' claims treat Twitter  as the publisher or speaker of the content in question;  and (3) someone other than Twitter provided or created  the content at issue. Id. at 8-11. Twitter argues further  that the FAC does not allege facts that would establish  that any exemption to CDA § 230 applies, including the  FOSTA exception that allows for the imposition of  liability where the ICS itself violates Section 1591, either  as a ""primary violator"" or a ""secondary participant"" that  'knowingly . . . benefits, financially or by receiving  anything of value, from participation in a venture' with a  primary violator."" Id. (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)). Id.  at 11-12.  [**21] With respect to Plaintiffs' claim that Twitter was a  primary participant in sex trafficking under Section  1591(a)(1), Twitter contends Plaintiffs' allegations fall  short because ""[t]o plead a primary violation, a plaintiff  must allege that the defendant 'provide[d], obtain[ed],  [and] maintain[ed] . . . a person"" knowing that he or she  ""will be . . . cause[d]"" to engage in a commercial sex  act."" Id. at 12 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1))  (emphasis added by Twitter). Twitter contends ""Plaintiffs  allege only that 'Twitter knowingly provided, obtained,  and maintained the Videos,' not Plaintiffs"" and therefore  they fail to allege a primary violation. Id. (quoting FAC ¶  141) (emphasis added by Twitter). Twitter also argues  that as to Plaintiffs' claims under both Section  1591(a)(1) and Section 1591(a)(2), those claims fall  short for the additional reason that Section 1591  ""requires a defendant to know that the victim 'will in the  future [be] cause[d] . . . to engage in prostitution.'"" Id. at  12 n. 10 (citing United States v. Todd, 627 F.3d 329,  334 (9th Cir. 2010)). According to Twitter, ""Plaintiffs  cannot plead that Twitter had such knowledge as the  FAC alleges that Plaintiffs had cut off contact with the  Perpetrators before the Videos were posted on Twitter's  platform."" Id. (citing FAC ¶¶ 94-96). Twitter contends Plaintiffs also fail to allege that it was a  secondary participant under Section 1591(a)(2). Id. at  12-19. According to Twitter, to establish that it is a  secondary participant, Plaintiffs must ""plead that Twitter  'knowingly . . . benefit[ed] . . . from participation in a  venture which has engaged in [sex trafficking] in  violation of [Section 1591(a)(1)].'"" Id. (quoting 18 U.S.C.  § 1591(a)(2)). It further asserts that Section 1591 was  amended by FOSTA to define ""[p]articipation in a  venture"" as ""knowingly assisting, supporting, or  facilitating"" a primary violation. Id. at 12 (quoting 18  U.S.C. § 1591(e)(4)) (emphasis added by Twitter)).  Twitter argues that neither of the grounds upon which  Plaintiffs rely to establish that Twitter was a secondary  participant - ""(i) Twitter's initial failure to find a violation  of its policies after reviewing the Video, or (ii) Twitter's  nine-day delay in removing the Videos"" - establishes it  was a secondary participant for three reasons. Id. ""First, Plaintiffs do not allege the existence of any type  of venture between Twitter and any party that has a  common purpose, much less facts [**22]  suggesting  'that [Twitter] actually participated in a sex-trafficking  venture' that had the common purpose of trafficking  Plaintiffs."" Id. at 12 (quoting United States v. Afyare, 632  F. App'x 272, 283-86 (6th Cir. 2016) (emphasis in  original); and citing B.M. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts,  Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214,   [*902]  at *3 (N.D. Cal. July 30, 2020) (purportedly  analyzing the elements of a Section 1591 violation and  following Afyare)); see also id. at 13-15 (arguing that  Plaintiffs have not alleged any ""venture"" or any ""active  participation"" in a venture). ""Second, there are no facts indicating Twitter received a  benefit 'because of' the alleged sex trafficking venture,  let alone that Twitter knowingly received it."" Id. at 12  (citing Geiss v. Weinstein Co. Holdings LLC, 383 F.  Supp. 3d 156, 169 (S.D.N.Y. 2019)); see also id. at 15- 17 (arguing that Plaintiffs have not alleged ""a causal  relationship between affirmative conduct furthering the  sex-trafficking venture and receipt of a benefit, with  actual . . . knowledge of that causal relationship"") (citing  Geiss, 383 F.Supp.3d at 169; Kolbek v. Twenty First  Century Holiness Tabernacle Church, Inc., 2013 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 180463, 2013 WL 6816174, at *16 (W.D.  Ark. Dec. 24, 2013)). In particular, Twitter asserts that  the FAC contains no factual allegations that it monetized  or benefited from the Videos, instead containing only  conclusory allegations that it did so, which are  insufficient. Id. at 16 (citing Jabagat v. Lombardi, 2015  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178762, 2015 WL 11004900, at *4  (S.D. Miss. Jan. 30, 2015)). Twitter further contends the  FAC does not plausibly allege that it knowingly  generated revenue ""because of"" its alleged failure to  remove the Videos. [**23]  Id. at 16 (citing Geiss, 383  F.Supp.3d at 169-170). ""Third, the FAC does not contain any allegation that  Twitter had actual knowledge that Plaintiffs were victims  of sex trafficking or that it knew the Videos contained  evidence of this."" Id. at 12 (citing FAC ¶¶ 152-54; Noble  v. Weinstein, 335 F.Supp.3d 504, 523-24 (S.D.N.Y.  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *901; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **20 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *901; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **20 Page 12 of 34 2018)); see also id. at 17-19. According to Twitter,  Plaintiffs ""must show that Twitter knew specifically that  Plaintiffs had been sex trafficked, and deliberately  assisted the sex trafficking."" Id. at 17 (citing Kik, 482  F.Supp.3d  at  1251).  They  do  not  satisfy  this  requirement, Twitter asserts, because ""[t]he FAC . . .  contains no facts plausibly alleging that Twitter had  actual knowledge of Plaintiffs' prior interactions with the  Perpetrators"" or that it knew the perpetrators were sex  traffickers or that the videos related to commercial sex.  Id. at 18-19 (citing Noble, 335 F.Supp.3d at 524;  Lawson v. Rubin, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71582, 2018  WL 2012869, at *12-14 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 29, 2018); A.B. v.

Twitter argues that even if it is not immune under CDA §  230, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under Section 1595.  Id. at 19-21. First, it argues that Plaintiffs fail to allege  that Twitter is a perpetrator and therefore cannot  establish liability on the basis of primary liability. Id. at  19. To the extent that Plaintiffs assert their claim under  Section 1595 on a ""beneficiary"" theory the claim also  fails, Twitter asserts, because [**24]  Plaintiffs have not  alleged that Twitter participated in a venture with the  perpetrators or that Twitter should have known of  Plaintiffs' alleged sex trafficking. Id. at 19-21. Twitter further asserts that even if Plaintiffs' Section  1595 claim is not subject to immunity under CDA § 230,  their remaining claims are nonetheless barred because  FOSTA removes immunity only for claims asserted  under Section 1595. Id. at 21-22 (citing Kik, 482  F.Supp.3d at 1249; M. L. v. Craigslist Inc., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 166836, 2020 WL 6434845, at *9-10 (W.D.  Wash. Apr. 17, 2020); Doe v. Bates, 2006 U.S. Dist.

LEXIS  218207, 2020 WL 6822891, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 20,  2020)). Twitter argues further that Plaintiffs fail to state viable  claims under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2258A & 2258B, California  products liability law, as to any of their negligence  claims, under Cal. Civ. Code § 1708.85, or under Cal.  Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200. Id. at 22-25. Twitter  contends there is no private right of action as to18  U.S.C. §§ 2258A & 2258B. Id. at 22 (citing Abcarian v.  Levine, 972 F.3d 1019, 1025-26 (9th Cir. 2020)). It  challenges the California product liability claim on the  grounds that Plaintiffs ""do not allege physical injury or  property damage resulting from their use of a defective  product"" or even identify any product that is defective.  Id. at 22 (citing Hernandez v. Avis Budget Grp., Inc.,  2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 206835, 2017 WL 6406838, at *5  (E.D. Cal. Dec. 15, 2017); Griff v. Woejeckloski, 2017  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 222114, 2017 WL 8185857, at *3 (C.D.  Cal. March 20, 2017)). Twitter further asserts that to the  extent Plaintiffs base that claim on defective platform  design, it fails because product liability law is ""geared to  the tangible world."" Id. at 23 (citing Winter v. G.P.  Putnam's Sons, 938 F.2d 1033, 1034-35 (9th Cir. 1991);  Intellect Art Multimedia Inc. v.

Rptr. 756 (1989); Wilson v. Midway Games,  Inc., 198 F.Supp.2d 167, 172-73 (D. Conn. 2002)). With respect to Plaintiffs' negligence [**25]  claims  (Claims Six through Nine), Twitter challenges the  negligence per se and negligent infliction of emotional  distress claims (Claims Eight and Nine) on the basis  that they are not independent causes of action. Id. at 23  (citing J.B. v. G6 Hospitality LLC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  151213, 2020 WL 4901196, at *11; Sinclair for Tucker v.  Twitter, Inc., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 234164, 2019 WL  10252752, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 20, 2019)). As to the  two remaining negligence claims (Claims Six and  Seven), Twitter argues that they fail because Plaintiffs  have not alleged that Twitter owed them any duty. Id.  (citing Worldwide Media, Inc. v. Twitter, Inc., 2018 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 182700, 2018 WL 5304852, at *8-9 (N.D.  Cal. Oct. 24, 2018)). According to Twitter, Plaintiffs'  allegations that ""Twitter had a duty to protect"" them  because it knew of the Videos and failed to take them  down (FAC ¶¶ 112, 128, 194-95) are insufficient  because a defendant can only be liable for negligence  based on failure to act where there is a special  relationship between the parties and Plaintiffs have not  alleged such a relationship. Id. at 24. 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *902; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **23 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *902; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **23 Page 13 of 34 Twitter contends Plaintiffs' claim under California Civil  Code section 1708.85, which creates a private right of  action against a person ""who intentionally distributes""  private sexually explicit materials ""without consent"" fails  to state a claim because ""the FAC alleges no facts from  which the Court could infer that Twitter 'intentionally  distribute[d]' the Videos; rather, it makes a conclusory  allegation that '[b]y refusing to [**26]  remove or block  [the Videos], Twitter intentionally distributed' them"" Id.  (citing FAC ¶ 214). It argues further that ""liability is  precluded if the 'material was previously distributed by  another person,' Cal. Civ. Code § 1708.85(c)(6), and  here, the Videos were distributed first on a different  platform—Snapchat—by  two  individuals  (whom  Plaintiffs do not allege were the individual(s) who  trafficked them) months before  [*904]  Twitter ever  became aware of the Videos—@StraightBross and  @fitmalesblog."" Id. (citing FAC ¶¶ 87-89, 99, 100.) Finally, Twitter argues that Plaintiffs' UCL claim is  insufficiently pled because Plaintiffs have not alleged  any economic injury and therefore, they do not have  standing to assert the claim. Id. at 24 (citing Huynh v.  Quora, Inc., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 235733, 2019 WL  11502875, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 19, 2019)). Twitter  further contends Plaintiffs have not alleged an unfair  business practice because: 1) they have not pled any  statutory violation and therefore have not alleged an  unlawful act by Twitter; and 2) ""To the extent Plaintiffs'  claim is premised on an alleged misrepresentation (¶  230), it fails to meet Rule 9(b) because Plaintiffs do not  allege with particularity a misrepresentation by Twitter.""  Id. (citing Letizia v. Facebook Inc., 267 F. Supp. 3d  1235, 1244 (N.D. Cal. 2017)). Twitter also argues that  the claim fails because Plaintiffs have not alleged  actual [**27]  reliance, having failed to allege that they  ""ever used Twitter, saw or read its policies, or that  seeing those policies resulted in an economic injury."" Id. 2. Opposition In their Opposition, Plaintiffs reject Twitter's challenges  under CDA § 230, arguing that the claims in this case  are based on just the sort of knowing conduct that  Congress intended to exempt from Section 230 when it  enacted FOSTA. Opposition at 1. In particular, they  assert that Twitter knew that the Videos were being  widely distributed on its platform and that they contained  child pornography created as a result of sex trafficking  and deliberately allowed the posts to remain on Twitter.  Id. First, Plaintiffs argue that they have sufficiently alleged  their claims under the TVPRA, which FOSTA exempts  from CDA § 230, both on the basis of direct sex  trafficking under Section 1591(a)(1) and as a  beneficiary of sex trafficking under Section 1591(a)(2).  Id. at 3. With respect to direct sex trafficking, Plaintiffs  point to the language of Section 1591(a)(1), providing  for liability for a perpetrator who ""knowingly . . . recruits,  entices,  harbors,  transports,  provides,  obtains,  advertises, maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any  means a person,"" while ""knowing, or . . . in reckless  disregard of the fact [**28]  . . . that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act[.]"" Id. (quoting 18  U.S.C. § 1591(a)) (emphasis added). According to  Plaintiffs, ""the phrase 'by any means' is not defined and  contains no exception for electronic or virtual actions.""  Id. Further, they assert, while the statute does not define  the words ""provide[],"" ""obtain[ ],"" or ""maintain[ ],"" their  ordinary meaning as evidenced by dictionary definitions  - upon which the Ninth Circuit has relied to define other  undefined terms of the TVPRA -support the conclusion  that Plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient as to the first part  of Section 1591(a)(1) (establishing liability as to a  defendant that ""knowingly . . . recruits, entices, harbors,  transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains,  patronizes, or solicits by any means a person""). Id. at 3- 4. In particular, Plaintiffs contend they have satisfied this  requirement by alleging that ""Twitter made them  available, as depicted in a CSAM compilation video, to  users on Twitter, having gained or attained Plaintiffs by  the same electronic means, and having kept them in the  same existing state, all despite Plaintiffs' own reports  and objections."" Id. at 4 (citing [**29]  United States v.  Love, 743 F. App'x 138, 139 (9th Cir. 2018) (using  Webster's dictionary to define ""force"" in § 1591(a)(1)  charge against sex trafficker)). Plaintiffs further assert that child pornography can be  the basis for a TVPRA claim under Section 1591(a)(1),  including in cases where the perpetrator procures  pornographic material without having direct  [*905]   contact with the child or paying money for the material.  Id.at 4-5 (citing United States v. Flanders, 752 F.3d  1317, 1330 (11th Cir. 2014); United States v. Tollefson,  367 F. Supp. 3d 865, 878-880 (E.D. Wis. 2019)). Plaintiffs argues further that their allegations are  sufficient as to the second phrase of Section 1591(a)(1),  requiring that the conduct that is the basis for the claim  must have been ""knowing, or . . . in reckless disregard  of the fact . . . that the person has not attained the age  of 18 years and will be caused to engage in a  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *903; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **25 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *903; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **25 Page 14 of 34 commercial sex act[.]"" Id. at 5-6. According to Plaintiffs,  a ""commercial sex act"" is defined under the TVPRA as ""  'any sex act, on account of which anything of value is  given to or received by any person[.]'"" Id. at 6 (quoting  18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(3)). Here, they contend, they have  alleged ""actual knowledge"" in that they ""alleged that  they reported child sexual abuse material featuring them  to Twitter, depicting them engaged in sexual acts due to  extortion and blackmail (that is, in exchange for  'something of value')."" Id. (citing FAC ¶¶ 112, 114, 123).  They [**30]  also point to their allegation that ""John Doe  1 provided proof of his age to Twitter, that numerous  users commented on their belief that videos featured  minors and that one disseminating account had already  been reported to Twitter for CSAM."" Id. (citing FAC ¶¶  101-102, 114, 121-122). Plaintiffs argue that ""[t]aken  together, these allegations are more than sufficient to  indicate that Twitter knew, or at least was in reckless  disregard of, Plaintiffs' status as minors when engaging  in the commercial sex acts at issue."" Id. at 5-6. Plaintiffs also argue that they state a claim on the basis  of beneficiary liability under Section 1595(a) and Section  1591(a)(2), addressing the requirements of both  provisions; according to Plaintiffs, Sections 1591(a)(2)  and 1595(a) ""have similar provisions for those who  benefit  financially,  and  distinct  requirements  for  participation in a venture and the requisite level of  knowledge."" Id. at 6. With respect to whether Plaintiffs have alleged that  Twitter knowingly ""benefited financially or by receiving  anything of value,"" Plaintiffs contend they have satisfied  this requirement by alleging that Twitter both monetizes  the CSAM on its platform and gains more viewers from  CSAM, which makes the platform more popular  and [**31]  attracts advertisers. Id. at 6-7. In support of  this argument, it points to B.M. v. Wyndham, 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *4 (N.D. Cal.  July 30, 2020). Id. According to Plaintiffs, in that case  the Court rejected the defendant's argument that a  plaintiff asserting a claim under Sections 1591(a)(2) and  1595(a) was required to show that the financial benefit  ""must [have] derive[d] directly from, and [been]  knowingly received in exchange for, participation in a  sex trafficking venture."" Id. at 7 (quoting B.M., 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *4  (internal citations omitted) (alterations added)). Instead,  Plaintiffs assert, the court in B.M. found ""that § 1595  claims could not be subjected to the same knowledge  standard as § 1591 without undermining the 'should  have known' language, and the Court concluded that it  was sufficient to allege that the hotels knowingly  received revenue from room rentals."" Id. (citing B.M.,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at  *4) (internal citations omitted). Plaintiffs reject Twitter's argument that ""any benefit [it]  receives must have a causal relationship to the sex  trafficking[,]"" arguing that the cases upon which it relies  - Geiss v. Weinstein Co. Holdings LLC, 383 F.Supp. 3d  156, 169 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) and Kolbek v. Twenty First  Century Holiness Tabernacle Church, Inc., 2013 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 180463, 2013 WL 6816174, at *16 (W.D.  Ark. Dec. 24, 2013) - are not on point. Id. at 8 (citing  Motion at 13, 15). Even if Twitter is correct,  [*906]   Plaintiffs contend, they have demonstrated such a  connection through the allegations in the FAC. Id. at 8- 10. Plaintiffs argue that many [**32]  of Twitter's  assertions as to their allegations are contradicted by the  FAC and provide a list of examples comparing specific  claims about the allegations made by Twitter with the  actual allegations in the FAC. Id. Next, Plaintiffs address whether they have adequately  alleged that Twitter participated in what it knew or  should have known was a sex trafficking venture. Id. at  10-16. According to Plaintiffs, Sections 1591(a)(2) and  1595  contain  distinct  requirements.  Id.  at  10.  ""Participation in a venture"" for the purposes of Section  1591(a)(2) means ""knowingly assisting, supporting, or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)."" Id. (quoting  18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(4)). Plaintiffs contend they have  alleged a violation of subsection (a)(1) for the reasons  discussed above and therefore have satisfied that  aspect of the definition of ""participation in a venture""  under Section 1591(a)(2). Id. at 11. Further, they reject  Twitter's arguments that it did not participate in a  venture that it knew was sex trafficking, which they  characterize are as follows: ""(1) Twitter did not have a  common purpose with the initial sex traffickers, (2)  Twitter was at most a passive beneficiary of sex  trafficking profits, and (3) Twitter does not know what  sex trafficking is."" Id. As to the ""common purpose"" argument, Plaintiffs [**33]   contend Twitter relies on cases interpreting the  Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act  (""RICO"") in support of such a requirement, but that  these cases have no bearing on Plaintiffs' TVPRA  claims. Id. (citing Motion at 13 (citing United States v.  Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S. Ct. 2524, 69 L. Ed. 2d  246 (1981); Washington v. Deleon, 2019 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 236640, 2019 WL 11691424 (N.D. Cal.

LEXIS 157158, **29 Page 15 of 34 Plaintiffs argue that Twitter's passive beneficiary  argument also fails because it's reliance on Afyare, 632  F. App'x at 286, is misplaced. Id. at 11-12. According to  Plaintiffs, in Afyare the court offered an analogy ""that a  defendant who joins a soccer team whose members  include sex traffickers who sponsor the team financially,  does not violate § 1591(a)(2) unless that defendant  commits 'some overt act' that 'furthers the sex  trafficking aspect of the venture.'"" Id. at 11 (quoting  Motion at 14). Plaintiffs argue that Twitter's reliance on  that analogy to argue that there must be ""some overt act  that furthers the sex trafficking aspect of the venture""  should be rejected because ""[t]he decision's logic  doesn't apply where the beneficiary defendant is  engaging in illegal acts."" Id. at 12. In particular, they  assert, while playing soccer is a lawful venture, ""CSAM  possession and distribution are not."" Id. (citing 18  U.S.C. § 2252A). Thus, Plaintiffs assert, they have  alleged that Twitter engaged in overt acts that further  the sex trafficking venture [**34]  ""[b]y knowingly  hosting, possessing, and distributing the CSAM of  Plaintiffs, as Plaintiffs have alleged."" Id. Next, Plaintiffs reject Twitter's claims that it ""did not  know of the alleged sex trafficking"" (Motion at 17), that  ""there is no allegation that any of these submissions  informed Twitter that Plaintiffs were victims of sex  trafficking"" (Motion at 18), that ""none of the reports or  emails sent to Twitter about the videos indicated that  Plaintiffs had been sex trafficked or that they involved  commercial sex acts"" (Motion at 21), and that Plaintiffs  did not allege ""that the videos would have, on their face,  indicated to Twitter (or a reasonable viewer) that  Plaintiffs had been trafficked and the videos involved  commercial sex"" (Motion at 18). Id. at 12. Plaintiffs  argue that these claims are ""misleading and meritless""  in light of the allegations in the FAC. Id. at 12-13 (citing  FAC ¶¶ 52-53, 57,  [*907]  101-102, 112, 114, 121-123,  196). Likewise, they argue that Twitter's suggestion that  their claims are merely about ""delay,"" implying that it  acted in good faither in eventually taking action to  remove the Videos rather than doing so in response to  an intervening event (a request from the [**35]  federal  government that it take action) after refusing to take  action, is misleading. Id. at 12 n. 26. According to  Plaintiffs, ""unless the charge is advertising, § 1591(a),  nowhere does the TVPRA require that the defendant  actually knew that someone was a sex trafficking  victim to be liable. Reckless disregard or constructive  knowledge suffice for civil liability."" Id. (citing 18 U.S.C.  §§ 1591(a), 1595(a)). Thus, they contend, their  allegations are sufficient to establish knowledge of their  sex trafficking. Id. Plaintiffs also point to Section 1595, which they contend  under B.M. requires that they ""allege that Twitter (1)  'knowingly benefit[ted] financially or by receiving  anything of value'; (2) from participation in a venture; (3)  that they 'knew or should have known [had] engaged in'  sex trafficking.'"" Id. at 14 (quoting B.M., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *4). They  contend, ""[t]he B.M. court determined, as most courts  have, that the plaintiff 'is not required to allege an overt  act in furtherance of or actual knowledge of a sex  trafficking venture in order to sufficiently plead her  section 1595 civil liability claim[.]'"" Id. (quoting B.M.,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *4  and citing S.Y. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. &  Laxmi of Naples, LLC, No. 2:20-CV-619-JES-MRM,  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, 2021 WL 1814651, at *4- 5 (M.D. Fla. May 6, 2021); E.S. v. Best W. Int'l, Inc., 510  F. Supp. 3d 420, 2021 WL 37457, at *3-4 (N.D. Tex.  2021); M.A. v.

Plaintiffs note  that Afyare, upon which Twitter relies to [**36]  assert  that an overt act is required, was a criminal action, in  contrast to B.M., and argue that under B.M. Plaintiffs are  not required to plead a § 1595 claim under a § 1591  standard. Id. (citing B.M., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *3; J.C. v. Choice Hotels  Int'l, Inc., No. 20-CV-00155-WHO, 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Oct.  28, 2020)). Plaintiffs also argue that Twitter's reliance on  M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp.  3d 959, 966 (S.D. Ohio 2019) is misplaced because is  mischaracterizes the facts and holding of that case. Id.  at 14-15. According to Plaintiffs, they have ""sufficiently  alleged that Twitter had constructive and actual  knowledge of Plaintiffs' sex trafficking, which it could  see for itself; the main crime happened in plain sight.""  Id. at 16. Plaintiffs  strenuously  disagree  with  Twitter's  characterization of the legislative history of FOSTA and  its argument that Congress intended to create only a  narrow exception for bad actors like Backpage. Id. at  16-19. Plaintiffs argue that in any event, they have  alleged conduct that is sufficient to fall within the  exception, and the question of ""how Twitter's actions  compare to Backpage is a factual question that cannot  be resolved at this stage of the litigation."" Id. Plaintiffs also argue that even apart from FOSTA, CDA  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *906; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **33 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *906; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **33 Page 16 of 34 § 230 was ""never intended to immunize conduct that  entails both criminal and civil liability."" Id. (citing Fair  Hous.  Council  of  San  Fernando  Valley  v.  Roommates.Com, LLC, 521 F.3d 1157, 1164 (9th Cir.  2008) (""The Communications Decency [**37]  Act was  not meant to create a lawless no-man's-land on the  Internet."")). In particular, they argue that the plain  language of Section 230(c) requires that an interactive  service provider ""take action in good faith to restrict  access to material, which is the opposite of  [*908]  what  Twitter did in the instant case."" Id. at 20 (emphasis in  original). Plaintiffs concede that ""[s]ome Ninth Circuit  decisions have interpreted the liability shield in CDA 230  to cover not just the removal of objectionable content,  but the decision whether to remove the content."" Id.  (citing Barnes v. Yahoo!, Inc., 570 F.3d 1096, 1102 (9th  Cir. 2009), as amended (Sept. 28, 2009) (citing Fair  Housing  Council  of  San  Fernando  Valley  v.  Roommates.com, LLC, 521 F.3d 1157, 1170-71 (9th  Cir. 2008)). According to Plaintiffs, ""[t]his interpretation  is not consistent with the plain language of § 230(c)(2),  which only limits liability for 'any action . . . to restrict  access' to harmful content[,]"" but these cases do not  apply here because ""they do not hold that CDA 230  immunizes a knowing decision to possess and distribute  CSAM and Twitter has pointed to no controlling  authority for such a proposition."" Id. at 21. Further, Plaintiffs assert, the stated purpose for CDA §  230 is inconsistent with Twitter's argument that it  creates ""immunity for all third-party content, even  contraband - specifically, child pornography[.]"" Id. The  title of Section 230 - ""Protection [**38]  for private  blocking and screening of offensive material"" - supports  this conclusion, Plaintiffs assert. Id. Likewise, the  policies stated in Section 230 indicate that it was  enacted ""to remove disincentives for the development  and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies that  empower parents to restrict their children's access to  objectionable or inappropriate online material,"" and ""to  ensure vigorous enforcement of Federal criminal laws to  deter and punish trafficking in obscenity, stalking, and  harassment by means of computer."" Id. (quoting 47  U.S.C.A. § 230(b)(4)-(5)). Twitter's position would  undermine these policies rather than advance them,  Plaintiffs assert. Id. Plaintiffs also argue that CDA § 230 does not apply to  their claim under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A and 2255 that  Twitter knowingly possessed and distributed child  pornography (Claim Four) because ""CSAM material is  not lawful 'information provided by another information  content provider'"" but rather is illegal contraband,  stemming from the sexual abuse of a child, and wholly  outside any protection or immunity under the law, to  include CDA 230.'"" Id. at 22. Plaintiffs' further assert that  ""CDA 230 was enacted to incentivize internet service  providers (""ISP's"") to protect children, not [**39]   immunize them for intentionally or recklessly harming  them."" Id. Plaintiffs argue that the Court should decline to follow  the case cited by Twitter, Doe v. Bates, 2006 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 93348, 2006 WL 3813758 (E.D. Tex., Dec. 27,  2006), which is a ""non-binding, first of its kind, federal  decision extending CDA immunity to a civil suit alleging  receipt and possession of child pornography."" Id. at 23.  According to Plaintiffs, neither of the cases upon which  the Texas district court relied, Zeran v. Am. Online, Inc.,  129 F.3d 327 (4th Cir. 1997) and Noah v. AOL Time  Warner, Inc., 261 F. Supp. 2d 532, 537 (E.D. Va. 2003),  aff'd, No. 03-1770, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 5495, 2004  WL 602711 (4th Cir. Mar. 24, 2004), involved child  pornography. Id. They also contend the reasoning of the  Texas case is wrong to the extent it treats child  pornography in the same way courts have treated  defamatory statements instead of treating it as  contraband. Id. at 23-24. According to Plaintiffs, given that Congress made clear  that the protection of children was paramount when  Section 230 was enacted, as is evidenced by the  policies stated in subsection (b) and the exemption for ""  'chapter . . . 110 of title 18 (relating to sexual exploitation  of children),' which includes §§ 2252A and 2255[,]"" ""[i]t  is untenable . . . to assert that CDA 230 immunizes  platforms from knowingly possessing and distributing  child sexual exploitation  [*909]  material."" Id. at 24.  Moreover, Plaintiffs assert, Twitter does not dispute that  they have adequately alleged the elements [**40]  of  claim under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A. Id. at 25. Plaintiffs also challenge Twitter's argument that their  claims under 18 U.S.C. § 2258A(a)(1) and (a)(2) fail  because those provisions do not create a civil cause of  action. Id. (citing Motion at 22). According to Plaintiffs,  ""Congress intended to make deliberate and reckless  violations of 2258A privately enforceable"" and that is  what they allege here. Id. (citing 18 U.S.C. § 2258B(b)).  Plaintiffs argue further that ""the standards of misconduct  in paragraph (b) of 2258(B) establish the duty of care  that Twitter owes Plaintiffs"" for the purposes of their  negligence claims and thus establish liability under both  federal and state law. Id. at 25-26. Next, Plaintiffs argue that CDA § 230 does not give rise  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *907; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **36 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *907; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **36 Page 17 of 34 to immunity as to their state law products liability claim  based on negligent design. Id. According to Plaintiffs,  this is because their claim ""does not attempt to treat  Twitter as the 'publisher or speaker' of information."" Id.  at 26. Instead, ""it seeks to hold Twitter accountable for  failing in its 'duty to exercise due care in supplying  products that do not present an unreasonable risk of  injury or harm to the public.'"" Id. (quoting Lemmon v.  Snap, Inc., 995 F.3d 1085, 2021 WL 1743576, at *4 (9th  Cir. 2021)). Plaintiffs contend that the distinction drawn  by the Ninth Circuit in Lemmon, in which the court  ""rejected [**41]  a social media platform's attempt to  argue that CDA 230 applied because the platform  allowed its users to transmit user-generated content to  one another. . . .[,]'"" also applies here, supporting the  conclusion that Section 230 does not apply to this claim.  Id. at 26-27. To the extent Twitter argues that Plaintiffs  have not clearly identified what aspect of its platform is  the ""product,"" Plaintiffs contend this is just semantics. Id.  at 27. They also reject Twitter's argument that product  liability law applies only to the ""tangible"" world, arguing  that the Ninth Circuit's holding in Lemmon shows that  Twitter is incorrect. Id. Finally, Plaintiffs argue that their state law claims are  adequately alleged and should be allowed to proceed.  As to the negligence claims, they assert that it is  apparent from the FAC that these claims are based on  different theories and California's Civil Jury Instructions  treat them as separate causes of action. Id. at 28. To  the extent negligence per se operates as a presumption  to establish a duty of care rather than a separate claim,  Plaintiffs argue, ""that simply means that Plaintiffs'  allegations of Twitter's multiple violations of its statutory  duties should be read [**42]  in tandem with its  negligence claims."" Id. (citing Tinoco v. San Diego Gas  & Elec. Co., No. 17-CV 2433-BAS-JLB, 2018 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 163523, 2018 WL 4562479, at *2 (S.D. Cal.  Sept. 21, 2018)). Plaintiffs also argue that they state a  claim for violation of California's UCL based on  ""unlawful"" conduct because ""Twitter's criminal, aiding  and abetting conduct is actionable under § 17200."" Id. at  29 (citing Chetal v. Am. Home Mortg., No. C 09-02727  CRB, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77806, 2009 WL 2612312,  at *4 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 24, 2009); Plascencia v. Lending  1st Mortg., 583 F. Supp. 2d 1090, 1098 (N.D. Cal.  2008)). Twitter's argument that Plaintiffs do not have  standing on this claim because they cannot seek ""the  full spectrum of damages"" also falls short, Plaintiffs  contend, as ""the availability of a certain remedy is not  relevant to a determination of standing to assert the  claim."" Id. (citing Finelite, Inc. v. Ledalite Architectural  Prods., No. C-10-1276 MMC, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  88041, 2010 WL 3385027, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 26,  2010)). 3. Reply In its Reply, Twitter reiterates its arguments that it  cannot be held liable as either a perpetrator of sex  trafficking under  [*910]  Section 1591(a)(1) or a  criminal beneficiary of sex trafficking under Section  1591(a)(2). Reply at 1-10. As to Plaintiffs' direct sex  trafficking claim under Section 1591(a)(1), Twitter  rejects Plaintiffs' interpretation of the provision, again  pointing to the words ""a person"" in the provision to  argue that the prohibited conduct applies to an  individual. Id. at 2. Twitter argues that Plaintiffs' ""novel""  interpretation of the provision as also encompassing a  video depicting a person is not supported by any  authority. Id. Twitter points to other uses of the  word [**43]  ""person"" in Section 1591 to support its  argument that this word cannot be read to mean a  depiction of a person under Section 1591(a)(1). Id. at 3  (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2) (""person has not attained  the age of 18""); 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(2) (""coercion"" is  ""threats of serious harm to or physical restraint against  any person"")). Twitter argues further that the cases cited by Plaintiffs in  support of their reading of Section 1591(a)(1), United  States v. Flanders, 752 F.3d 1317, 1330 (11th Cir.  2014) and United States v. Tollefson, 367 F. Supp. 3d  865, 878-80 (E.D. Wis. 2019), are not on point because  in those cases, the court ""determined that each  defendant violated Section 1591(a)(1) because they  procured a person for commercial sex using electronic  means, i.e., they used the internet to communicate with  the victims and to pay them to engage in recorded sex  acts, similar to what the Perpetrators did here."" Id. at 3  (citing Flanders, 752 F.3d at 1330; Tollefson, 367 F.  Supp. 3d at 878-80). According to Twitter, Flanders and  Tollefson ""revolved around whether Section 1591  covered situations in which the defendant was not  physically present during the alleged sex trafficking,  not whether the challenged conduct could apply to an  object (such as a video) instead of a person."" Id. Twitter also repeats its argument that Plaintiffs, by their  own admission, cannot satisfy the requirement under  Section 1591(a) that a defendant must have known that  a victim ""will in the future [be] cause[d]"" to engage in a  commercial  sex [**44]   act  given  that  Plaintiffs'  allegations establish that ""the venture was over at the  time Twitter allegedly refused to remove the Videos  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *909; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **40 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *909; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **40 Page 18 of 34 from its platform, . . . making it impossible for Twitter to  know that its alleged failure to act would likely cause  Plaintiffs to engage in commercial sex acts in the  future."" Id. Twitter also rejects Plaintiffs' arguments as to their claim  that Twitter is liable as a beneficiary of sex trafficking  under Section 1591(a)(2). Id. at 3-10. It again argues  that it did not participate in any ""venture"" for the  purposes of this subsection because it was not  ""associated in fact"" with the perpetrators. Id. at 4. Twitter  acknowledges that this term is not defined under  Section 1591 but argues it is reasonable to look to the  RICO cases cited in the Motion to understand its  meaning. Id. Twitter reiterates its argument that these  cases support the conclusion that to be engaged in a  ""venture"" under Section 1591 the participants must have  a common purpose, which Plaintiffs fail to allege. Id.  Twitter notes that ""[t]his construction of 'venture' is  implicit to the Afyare court's holding that Section  1591(a)(2) requires proof of a sex trafficking venture  and that '[t]wo or more people who engage in sex  trafficking  together  are [**45]   a  sex-trafficking  venture.'"" Id. n. 4 (quoting United States v. Afyare, 632  F. App'x 272, 279-86 (6th Cir. 2016)). Moreover, Twitter contends, under Section 1591 the  common purpose that is alleged must involve the  particular sex trafficking venture involving the plaintiff.  Id. at 4-5 (citing S.J. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, 473 F. Supp.  3d 147, 154 (E.D.N.Y. 2020);  [*911]  Doe v. Kik, 482 F.  Supp. 3d 1242, 1251 (S.D. Fla. 2020); J.B. v. G6  Hospitality, LLC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213, 2020  WL 4901196, at *10 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 20, 2020)).  Plaintiffs fail to meet this requirement as well, Twitter  argues. Id. at 5. Twitter argues further that ""[f]inding a  venture between Twitter and the Perpetrators based on  a standard platform-user relationship also makes no  sense considering Twitter's userbase, which numbers in  the hundreds of millions."" Id. at 6 (citing FAC ¶ 23; J.B.,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213, 2020 WL 4901196, at  *10 (""Craigslist cannot be deemed to have participated  in all ventures arising out of each post on its site."")). Twitter also asserts that Plaintiffs' claim under Section  1592(a)(2) fails because the FAC does not allege any  ""active participation"" by Twitter, arguing again that  Plaintiffs must allege overt acts by Twitter in furtherance  of the venture. Id. According to Twitter, Plaintiffs do not  dispute that this is a requirement but instead argue,  without authority, that its denial of the requests to  remove the Videos was an affirmative act that satisfies  this requirement. Id. (citing Opposition at 12). Twitter  contends this argument ""conflicts with the FAC  itself, [**46]  which is clear that Plaintiffs were allegedly  harmed by the failure to immediately remove the  Videos."" Id. (citing FAC ¶¶ 124- 25). In any event, they  assert, Plaintiffs' argument fails because ""Twitter's  failing to act is not 'affirmative conduct'"" and ""the nine- day removal time frame is not tantamount to an  affirmative act on Twitter's part."" Id. (citing Motion at 14- 15 (quoting Geiss v. Weinstein Co. Holdings LLC, 383  F. Supp. 3d 156, 169 (S.D.N.Y. 2019)); Bradley  Bergeron v. Monex Deposit Co., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  210652, 2020 WL 6468457, at *6-7 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 18,  2020); Gressett v. Contra Costa Cty., 2013 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 70667, 2013 WL 2156278, at *17 (N.D. Cal. May  17, 2013)). Even if Twitter's inaction were deemed an  overt act, it argues, it would still be insufficient because  it did not further the sex trafficking venture. Id. at 6 n. 6  (citing Kik, 482 F. Supp. 3d at 1251). Twitter reiterates its argument that Plaintiffs' claim under  Section 1591(a)(2) also fails because the FAC does not  plead that Twitter knowingly benefited from its  participation in Plaintiffs' alleged sex trafficking. Id. at  7-8. Twitter rejects Plaintiffs' attempt to distinguish  Geiss and Kolbek, cited in the Motion, arguing that ""the  specific procedural posture and facts of those cases are  irrelevant to the legal holding about what the statute  requires."" Id. at 7. More importantly, Twitter argues, ""the Opposition never  explains how Twitter could have received a benefit from  Plaintiffs' alleged sex trafficking when none of the  broad allegations [**47]  regarding how Twitter makes  money are connected to what happened to them."" Id.  Twitter contends the ""FAC does not allege that there  were  any  advertisements,  or  promoted  Tweets  associated with the Videos, nor does it allege that  Twitter obtained (let alone licensed) any data related to  the Videos."" Id. Moreover, it argues, the allegations that  Twitter "" 'continued to distribute the CSAM that it had  monetized after' John Doe #1 and his mother reported  it"" are not supported by any specific facts and therefore  do not raise a plausible inference that Twitter received a  benefit from the Videos. Id. at 7-8 (citing Opposition at  8-10 (citing FAC ¶¶ 52-54)). Twitter argues further that the Opposition also ""does not  provide any other facts that would establish the 'causal  relationship' between receipt of a benefit and Twitter's  'actual knowledge of that causal relationship.'"" Id. at 8.  Twitter rejects Plaintiffs' argument that it has satisfied  this requirement by alleging that Twitter's conduct was  motivated by the fact that ""CSE content is 'highly  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *910; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **44 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *910; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **44 Page 19 of 34 sought-after' on Twitter and Twitter 'makes significant  revenue   [*912]   from  the  presence,  searches,  connections, and interactions of such illegal and  dangerous [**48]  material.'"" Id. at 8 (quoting Opposition  at 9 (citing ¶¶ 37, 71, 84))). According to Twitter, ""these  allegations are not only incorrect, they are conclusory  and unsupported."" Id. And to the extent that Plaintiffs  point to allegations citing statements about how it  monetizes its platform, these allegations are insufficient,  Twitter asserts, because they do not establish that  Twitter monetizes all public posts and interactions. Id. n.  8 (citing Opposition at 8-9; FAC ¶ 33). Next, Twitter rejects Plaintiffs' argument that they have  satisfied the ""actual knowledge"" requirement of Section  1591(a)(2) by alleging facts showing ""reckless disregard  or constructive knowledge."" Id. at 9. Twitter argues that  this standard is incorrect and that ""[c]ourts have  repeatedly held that Section 1591(a)(2) requires a  defendant to have actual knowledge of the sex  trafficking venture involving the plaintiff to constitute a  criminal violation suffices for a Section 1591(a)(2)  violation."" Id. at 9 (citing Kik, 482 F. Supp. 3d at 1251).  Twitter contends Plaintiffs also fail to establish in the  Opposition that it had actual knowledge as the  allegations they point to do not ""demonstrate that Twitter  understood that Plaintiffs were the victims of sex  trafficking and the acts depicted in the [**49]  Videos  were commercial sex acts."" Id. (citing Opposition at 5,  12-14). Twitter concedes that Plaintiffs allege ""that John Doe #1  emailed saying Plaintiffs 'were baited, harassed, and  threatened to take these videos,'"" but contends ""that is  simply  insufficient  to  establish  Twitter's  actual  knowledge of the alleged sex trafficking"" because  ""[f]rom John Doe #1's email Twitter cannot tell whether  Plaintiffs were harassed and baited by friends or an  adult, for example, and Twitter cannot tell whether the  harassment caused them to engage in the sex acts, film  them, or share the Videos with others."" Id. at 9-10 (citing  Opposition at 13 (citing FAC ¶ 123)). Twitter reiterates its arguments that Congress intended  only to create a narrow exception to Section 230 when it  enacted FOSTA. Id. at 10-12. That exception, it  contends, was to allow for the imposition of liability on  ""websites that 'have done nothing to prevent the  trafficking of children.'"" Id. at 12 (quoting Opposition at  17-18 (emphasis in Opposition)). Twitter argues that  ""even according to Plaintiffs' own allegations, Twitter  plainly is not one of those websites."" Id. (citing FAC ¶¶  42-43, 55-58, 60, 64-65, 128-29). Twitter also rejects Plaintiffs' [**50]  argument that CDA  § 230 only provides immunity where an ICS removes  offensive content, arguing that it is well settled in the  Ninth Circuit that Section 230 applies whenever a claim  is based on an ICS's decision to publish or remove third- party content. Id. at 12-13 (citing Fair Hous. Council of  San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.Com, LLC, 521  F.3d 1157, 1170-71 (9th Cir. 2008); Barnes v. Yahoo!,  Inc., 570 F.3d 1096, 1103 (9th Cir. 2009); Jones v. Dirty  World Ent. Recordings LLC, 755 F.3d 398, 406-07 (6th  Cir. 2014)). This immunity applies even when an ICS  has received notice of the offensive content, Twitter  contends. Id. at 14 (citing Zeran v. Am. Online, Inc., 129  F.3d 327, 333 (4th Cir. 1997); Doe v. Bates, 2006 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 93348, 2006 WL 3813758, at *18 (E.D. Tex.  Dec. 27, 2006); Igbonwa v. Facebook, Inc., 2018 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 173769, 2018 WL 4907632, at *1, *5-7  (N.D. Cal. Oct. 9, 2018), aff'd, 786 F. App'x 104 (9th Cir.  2019)). Twitter argues that even if Plaintiffs' claim under Section  1595 is not barred under CDA § 230, it fails to state a  claim because Plaintiffs have not alleged all the required  elements, namely, ""that Twitter participated in a venture  with the Perpetrator  [*913]  or should have known  about Plaintiffs' alleged sex trafficking."" Id. at 14-16.  According to Twitter, Plaintiffs' argument that the FAC is  not required to allege a ""conspiracy"" between Twitter  and the sex traffickers is a ""red herring."" Id. at 15 (citing  Opposition at 14-15). Rather, Twitter contends, its  argument is that ""pleading a 'venture' under Section  1595 required Plaintiffs to allege facts demonstrating 'a  continuous [] relationship between the trafficker and the  [defendant] such that it would appear that the trafficker  and the [defendant] have established a pattern of  conduct [**51]  or could be said to have a tacit  agreement.'"" Id. (quoting J.B., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  151213, 2020 WL 4901196, at *9 (citing M.A., 425 F.  Supp. 3d at 970)). Here, Twitter asserts, the FAC does  not allege facts establishing such a continuous  relationship. Id. Twitter argues further that ""the FAC alleges no facts  showing that Twitter 'should have known' that the  Videos involved sex trafficking conduct - i.e., the  exploitation of children for commercial sex purposes,""  despite the arguments in the Opposition to the contrary.  Id. at 15-16 (citing Motion at 20-21; Reply at 9-10;  Opposition  at  15).  According  to  Twitter,  ""[t]he  Opposition's reliance on Twitter's alleged 'general  knowledge' of CSE content on its platform also fails  because such knowledge does not demonstrate Twitter  should have known of what specifically happened to  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *911; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **47 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *911; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **47 Page 20 of 34 Plaintiffs."" Id. at 16 (citing A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc., 484 F. Supp. 3d 921, 937-38 (D. Oregon  2020)). Twitter reiterates it position that all of Plaintiffs'  remaining claims are barred under CDA § 230. Id. at 16- 18. Twitter contends Plaintiffs ""do not disagree save for  their products liability claim."" Id. As to Twitter's arguments that Plaintiffs have failed to  state viable state law claims, Twitter notes that Plaintiffs  did not address its arguments related to California Civil  Code section 1708.85 and contends this claim should  therefore be dismissed. Id. [**52]  at 19. Twitter argues as to the products liability claim that  Plaintiffs' reliance on Lemmon v. Snap to argue that  CDA § 230 does not immunize Twitter from their  products liability claim is misplaced because in that  case, the plaintiffs' claims were based on the use of a  ""speed filter"" and did not, as here, treat the defendant  as a publisher of information. Id. at 19-20 (citing 995  F.3d at 1087-88). Twitter argues that Plaintiffs' Opposition fails to establish  that they have viable negligence claims because if does  not address Twitter's argument that it owed Plaintiffs no  duty. Id. at 20 (citing Motion at 23-24; GN Resound A/S  v. Callpod, Inc., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40402, 2013 WL  1190651, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 21, 2013)). Nor have  Plaintiffs ""established that Twitter violated any law or  statute that would give rise to a presumption of  negligence,"" Twitter contends, ""and Plaintiffs' own  authority agrees that negligence per se is not an  independent claim."" Id. Finally, Twitter argues that the Opposition fails to  establish that Plaintiffs have standing on their UCL  claim. Id. at 20-21. First, to the extent that the  Opposition ""seemingly argues that Plaintiffs have  standing to bring a UCL claim because they suffered  economic injury as a result of the 'monetization and  dissemination of Plaintiffs' images and likenesses'  by [**53]  Twitter[,]"" Twitter rejects that argument. Id.  (citing Opposition at 29-30 (citing Fraley v. Facebook,  Inc., 830 F. Supp. 2d 785, 811 (N.D. Cal. 2011))).  According to Twitter, Fraley does not support Plaintiffs'  position because in that case, the ""plaintiffs alleged that  Facebook 'fail[ed] to compensate them for their valuable  endorsement of third-party products and services' when  it took their image and name to create 'Sponsored  Stories.'"" Id. (quoting 830 F. Supp. 2d at  [*914]  790).  Twitter contrasts the allegations in the FAC, which  ""alleges that advertisements or promoted Tweets are  'displayed intermixed between tweets'"" but does not  allege ""that Plaintiffs' image or name was used to  endorse any product or used in any advertisement."" Id.  at 20-21. Twitter also rejects Plaintiffs' reliance on its alleged  ""criminal, aiding and abetting conduct"" in support of  UCL standing, arguing that this theory (which was  raised for the first time in the Opposition) fails because  ""[a]iding and abetting requires not only knowledge [of  the complained of act], but 'substantial assistance o[r]  encouragement' of another's tort."" Id. at 21 (citing  Opposition at 29; quoting Chetal v. Am. Home Mortg.,  2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77806, 2009 WL 2612312, at *4  (N.D. Cal. Aug. 24, 2009)). Plaintiffs have not alleged  such facts, Twitter asserts. Id. For these reasons, Twitter asks the Court to dismiss all  of Plaintiffs' claims [**54]  with prejudice. Id.). 4. Amicus Brief In addition to the briefing supplied by the parties, a  group of anti-trafficking organizations have submitted  an amicus brief addressing Congress's intent in  enacting  FOSTA.  These  organizations  contend  Congress intended to afford greater protection to victims  of online sex trafficking by abrogating the broad  immunity afforded under CDA § 230 and urge the Court  to reject Twitter's assertion that it is immune from  Plaintiffs' claims in this case. III. ANALYSIS A. Legal Standards Under Rule 12(b)(6) HN4[ ] A complaint may be dismissed under Rule  12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for  failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.  ""The purpose of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)  is to test the legal sufficiency of the complaint."" N. Star  Int'l v. Ariz. Corp. Comm'n, 720 F.2d 578, 581 (9th Cir.  1983). Generally, a plaintiff's burden at the pleading  stage is relatively light. Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of  Civil Procedure states that a ""pleading which sets forth a  claim for relief . . . shall contain . . . a short and plain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). HN5[ ] In ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule  12(b)(6), the court analyzes the complaint and takes ""all  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *913; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **51 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *913; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **51 Page 21 of 34 allegations of material fact as true and construe[s] them  in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.""  Parks Sch. of Bus. v. Symington, 51 F.3d 1480, 1484  (9th Cir. 1995). Dismissal may be based on a lack  of [**55]  a cognizable legal theory or on the absence of  facts that would support a valid theory. Balistreri v.  Pacifica Police Dep't, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1990).  A complaint must ""contain either direct or inferential  allegations  respecting  all  the  material  elements  necessary to sustain recovery under some viable legal  theory."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 562,  127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citing Car  Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101, 1106  (7th Cir. 1984)). ""A pleading that offers 'labels and  conclusions' or 'a formulaic recitation of the elements of  a cause of action will not do.'"" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556  U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868  (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). ""[C]ourts  'are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion  couched as a factual allegation.'"" Twombly, 550 U.S. at  555 (quoting Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286, 106  S. Ct. 2932, 92 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1986)). ""Nor does a  complaint suffice if it tenders 'naked assertion[s]' devoid  of 'further factual enhancement.'"" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678  (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557) (alteration in  original). Rather, the claim must be "" 'plausible on its  face,'"" meaning that the plaintiff must plead sufficient  factual  [*915]  allegations to ""allow [] the court to draw  the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for  the misconduct alleged."" Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S.  at 570). B. The TVPRA Claims (Claims One and Two) Plaintiffs assert two claims against Twitter under the  TVPRA - a claim for direct sex trafficking and a claim  for beneficiary liability. For the reasons set forth below,  the Court finds that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for  direct sex trafficking [**56]  and therefore does not  reach the question of whether that claim is barred under  CDA § 230. On the other hand, the Court finds that  Plaintiffs state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA and that Section 230 does not apply to that  claim. 1. Direct Sex Trafficking Both sides rely on the plain language of Section  1591(a)(1) in support of their arguments relating to the  sufficiency of Plaintiffs' allegations that Twitter engaged  in direct sex trafficking in violation of the TVPRA.  Twitter argues that the series of verbs in the provision  relate to a ""person"" and that here, Twitter's alleged  conduct relates not to a person but to the Videos.  Plaintiffs, on the other hand, points to the words ""by any  means"" in Section 1591(a)(1) in support of their reading  of the provision. The Court finds Twitter's argument  more persuasive. Section 1591(a)(1) contains a series of verbs, all of  which relate to a ""person."" One of the verbs - the word  ""advertises"" - might plausibly be read to fit the  allegations in the FAC as a video posted on Twitter  could, at least as a matter of grammar, advertise a  ""person""  but  Plaintiffs  don't  claim  that  Twitter  ""advertised"" them. The verbs on which Plaintiffs rely  (""provides"", ""obtains"" and ""maintains""), on the other  hand, do not lend [**57]  themselves to the reading  Plaintiffs suggest and Plaintiffs have pointed to no  authority that supports their interpretation of Section  1591(a)(1). Plaintiffs' reliance on United States v. Tollefson, 367 F.  Supp. 3d 865, 878-80 (E.D. Wis. 2019) to support their  reading of Section 1591(a)(1) is misplaced. In that case,  the defendant was criminally charged under Section  1591(a)(1) on the basis that he had ""solicited"" a child  using an online chat, which he used to communicate  with the victim and to persuade her to create and send  him pornographic content using her phone. 367 F.  Supp. 3d at 867-68. HN6[ ] Section 1591(a)(1)  expressly allows for criminal liability where a defendant  ""solicits by any means a person"" and the conduct at  issue in that case falls comfortably within that language.  Plaintiffs here do not, however, allege any solicitation by  Twitter. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs do not  state a claim for direct sex trafficking under Section  1591(a)(1) and does not reach the question of Section  230 immunity as to that claim. 2. Beneficiary Liability The more difficult issue is whether Plaintiffs have stated  a claim under Section 1591(a)(2) and, if they have,  whether Twitter is immune from liability under Section  230 on that claim. To decide these questions, the Court  must grapple with three primary issues. First, how  stringent is the mens rea requirement as to Twitter's  knowledge of whether Plaintiffs [**58]  were victims of  sex trafficking. Second, what must be alleged to show  that Twitter participated in a ""venture."" Finally, what  must be alleged to show that Twitter received a benefit  from the sex trafficking venture and that the benefit  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *914; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **54 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *914; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **54 Page 22 of 34 motivated its conduct. As to all three questions, Twitter  urges the Court to adopt the stringent requirements for  establishing a criminal violation under Section 1591(a).  The Court concludes, however, that Twitter's arguments   [*916]  are at odds with the plain language of FOSTA  and the case law addressing the requirements for  establishing civil liability under Section 1595. Although the post-FOSTA case law addressing the  requirements of Section 1595 and 1591(a)(2) as they  relate to third-party content and ICS providers is scant,  a series of cases in which victims of sex trafficking  have sought to impose civil liability against hotel chains  shed light on the pleading requirements for such claims  in other contexts. In those cases, courts have  addressed the significance of the fact that the ""language  of § 1591 differs from the language of § 1595"" in that  ""the former does not have a constructive knowledge  element manifested by 'should have known' language.""  M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp.  3d 959, 969 (S.D. Ohio 2019). In M.A., and in a number  of cases that have adopted the reasoning [**59]  of that  case, the court ""rejected the application of the criminal  definition to civil claims under the TVPRA."" A.B. v. Hilton  Worldwide Holdings Inc., 484 F. Supp. 3d 921, 937 (D.  Or. 2020) (citing M.A. 425 F. Supp. 3d at 969 (S.D. Ohio  2019); A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 455 F.Supp.3d 171,  186-88 (E.D. Pa. 2020); B.M. v. Wyndham Hotels &  Resorts, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL  4368214 at *3 (N.D. Cal. July 30, 2020)). In M.A., the plaintiff was a victim of sex trafficking that  occurred at hotels owned by the defendant and she  sued under Sections 1595 and 1591(a)(2). Her claims  were based on the theory that the hotel chain benefited  from the rental of the rooms where she was trafficked  and knew or should have known that trafficking was  occurring there based on various signs of sex  trafficking that should have been obvious to hotel staff.  425 F. Supp. 3d at 962. The court found that the plaintiff  adequately alleged that the hotel chain benefited from  the sex trafficking based on the rental of its rooms. Id.  at 965. It further found that she alleged sufficient facts to  show that it ""knew or should have known"" that the  venture was engaged in sex trafficking, applying the  looser knowledge requirement of Section 1595 rather  than the knowledge requirement that applies to criminal  claims under Section 1591(a)(2). Id. at 968. It cited both  to allegations that there were obvious signs of sex  trafficking that hotel staff should have recognized and  that the hotel chain was ""on notice about the prevalence  of sex trafficking generally at their hotels and failed to  take adequate [**60]  steps to train staff in order to  prevent its occurrence."" Id. at 969. Next, the M.A. court addressed what the plaintiff was  required to allege to meet the ""participation in a venture""  requirement of Section 1595. Like Twitter here, the  defendant in M.A. ""rel[ied] extensively on United States  v. Afyare, 632 F. App'x 272 (6th Cir. 2016), which  addresses the meaning of 'participation in a venture'  under § 1591."" Id. at 968. As the M.A. court explained,  ""[i]n Afyare, a panel of the Sixth Circuit affirmed the  district court's finding that § 1591(a)(2) 'require[s] that a  defendant actually participate and commit some 'overt  act' that furthers the sex trafficking aspect of the  venture.'"" Id. (quoting Afyare, 632 F. App'x at 286).  Thus, under Section 1591, ""the venture had to be a sex- trafficking venture and the 'participation' had to be an  'overt act' that furthers the sex trafficking aspect of the  venture.'"" Id. (quoting Afyare, 632 F. App'x at 286).  Further, Afyare held that under Section 1591 a  defendant had to be "" 'associated for the purpose of  furthering the sex trafficking.'"" Id. The court in M.A.  found, however, that this criminal standard did not apply  to the plaintiff's civil claim under Section 1595,  concluding that a defendant ""need not have actual  knowledge of the sex trafficking in order to have  participated in the sex trafficking venture  [*917]  for  civil liability under the [**61]  TVPRA, otherwise the  'should have known' language in § 1595(a) would be  meaningless."" Id. at 971. It further found that the alleged  acts and omissions of the hotel chain in that case were  sufficient to allege ""participation in a venture"" under  Section 1595. Id. The M.A. court's interpretation of Section 1595 and the  meaning of ""participation in a venture"" under that  section was based on the following statutory analysis: Some Defendants have relied on the definition of  ""participation in a venture"" supplied in § 1591(e)(4).  HN7[ ] Generally, ""there is a natural presumption  that identical words used in different parts of the  same act are intended to have the same meaning.""  Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, 286  U.S. 427, 433, 52 S.Ct. 607, 76 L.Ed. 1204 (1932).  But this presumption does not apply where ""there is  such variation in the connection in which the words  are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion  that they were employed in different parts of the act  with different intent."" Id. Here, § 1591(e) purports to  only apply to ""this section,"" i.e., § 1591. See, e.g.,  Gilbert v. United States Olympic Committee, No.  18-cv-00981-CMA-MEH, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  35921, 2019 WL 1058194, at *9, *10 (D. Colo. Mar.  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *915; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **58 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *915; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **58 Page 23 of 34 6, 2019) (noting that ""there are persuasive reasons  to conclude ... that the term 'venture' is defined  differently in § 1591(a)(2) than it is in § 1589(b)""  and ""neither §§ 1589 nor 1595 define 'venture'""). In addition to the language in § 1591(e) limiting the  definitions [**62]  to that section, applying the  definition of ""participation in a venture"" provided for  in § 1591(e) to the requirements under § 1595  would void the ""known or should have known""  language of § 1595. Such a construction would  violat[e] the "" HN8[ ] 'cardinal principle of statutory  construction' that 'a statute ought, upon the whole,  to be construed so that, if it can be prevented, no  clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous,  void, or insignificant.'"" TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534  U.S. 19, 31, 122 S.Ct. 441, 151 L.Ed.2d 339 (2001)  (quoting Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 174, 121  S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001)). HN9[ ]  Section 1591(e)(4) provides the following definition  of ""participation in a venture"": ""knowingly assisting,  supporting, or facilitating a violation of subsection  (a)(1)."" The term ""participation in a venture"" in §  1591 thus imports a state of mind requirement—the  participation must be ""knowing."" Although §  1591(a)(2) also criminalizes some action taken with  less than actual knowledge, that is, ""reckless  disregard, such ""reckless disregard"" provision  applies only to the requirement ""that means of  force, threats of force, fraud, coercion described in  subsection (e)(2), or any combination of such  means will be used to cause the person to engage  in a commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act."" § 1591 (a). It  does not lessen the scienter requirement [**63]  of  actual knowledge as to participation or the venture's  true ends. 425 F. Supp. 3d 959, 969-70. The court therefore  concluded that "" 'participation' under § 1595 does not  require actual knowledge of participation in the sex  trafficking itself."" Id. at 970. The court in M.A. went on to find that ""[i]n the absence  of a direct association, ""the plaintiff could adequately  allege participation under Section 1595 only by alleging  facts showing ""a continuous business relationship  between the trafficker and the hotels such that it would  appear that the trafficker and the hotels have  established a pattern of conduct or could be said to  have a tacit agreement."" Id. The court found that the  plaintiff met this requirement by alleging that the  defendant rented rooms  [*918]  to people it knew or  should have known were engaged in sex trafficking. Id. District courts, including in this district, have found the  statutory analysis in M.A. supporting its interpretation of  Section 1595 to be persuasive. In B.M. v. Wyndham  Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Judge Freeman stated, ""The  Court agrees with the statutory construction analysis in  M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp.  3d 959, 969 (S.D.

'"" No. 20 CV- 00656-BLF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL  4368214, at *3 (N.D. Cal. July 30, 2020) (quoting J.C. v.  Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99252,  2020 WL 3035794, at *1, n. 1 (quoting M.A. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d at  969)). Thus, in B.M., the court concluded that the  plaintiff was ""not required to allege an overt act in  furtherance of or actual knowledge of a sex trafficking  venture in order to sufficiently plead her section 1595  civil liability claim"" based on beneficiary liability under  Section 1591(a)(2) against parent companies that  owned hotels where the plaintiff was the victim of sex  trafficking. Id. The undersigned also finds the reasoning and analysis  of M.A. to be persuasive and therefore concludes that  HN10[ ] as a general matter, where a plaintiff seeks to                555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *917; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **61 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *917; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **61 Page 24 of 34 impose civil liability under Section 1595 based on a  violation of Section 1591(a)(2), not only does the  ""known or should have known"" language of Section  1595 apply (rather than the actual knowledge standard  of Section 1591(a)) but such a claim also does not  require that a plaintiff [**65]  demonstrate an overt act  that furthered the sex trafficking aspect of the venture  in order to satisfy the ""participation in a venture""  requirement. The hotel line of cases, however, does not answer the  question of whether the same standards apply where a  civil claim is asserted under Section 1591(a)(2) against  an ICS provider and thus (arguably) falls within the  ambit of Section 230 immunity. This issue was recently  addressed in Doe v. Kik Interactive, Inc., 482 F. Supp.  3d 1242, 1244 (S.D. Fla. 2020), on which Twitter relies.  In that case, the defendant was a web-based interactive  service called Kik that offered a messaging service that  was marketed to teens and young adults. The plaintiff  alleged that numerous adult male users of Kik ""solicited  her and convinced her to take and send them sexually  graphic pictures of herself using Kik""; that these adult  males sent her sexually explicit photographs via Kik"";  that ""her father found  [*919]  the photographs on her  cellphone and computer tablet and reported the  incidents to the police""; that there had been ""multiple  instances where adult users of Kik ha[d] used the  service to contact and solicit sexual activity with minors,  with some of those contacts resulting in death of the  minors""; and that the defendants knew ""that sexual  predators use[d] [**66]  its service to prey on minors but  have failed to provide any warnings or enact policies to  protect minors from such abuses."" Kik, 482 F. Supp. 3d  at 1244. The plaintiff sued Kik's owner, seeking to  impose beneficiary liability under Section 1595 based on  alleged violations of Section 1591(a)(2) and the  defendant brought a motion to dismiss asserting that it  was immune under CDA § 230 and that the plaintiff  failed to state a claim under Section 1595(a). Id. at  1244-1245. In addressing what the plaintiff was required to allege to  fall under the FOSTA exemption to CDA § 230, the  court in Kik acknowledged that in the context of sex  trafficking at hotels, courts have found that plaintiffs  need not satisfy the definitions that apply to criminal  prosecutions under Section 1591(a) to establish civil  liability under Section 1595(a) but concluded that under  FOSTA, a plaintiff who asserts such a claim against an  interactive computer service is required to satisfy those  more demanding requirements. Id. at 1248-51. The court in Kik reasoned as follows: Significantly, because the hotel defendants were  not interactive computer service providers, neither  FOSTA nor CDA immunity were considered. The  present case presents a different scenario, because  Congress - in balancing the needs of protecting  children  and  encouraging  ""robust  Internet  communication"" [**67]   -  enacted  a  statute  protecting interactive computer service providers  from liability for their users' content and conduct. If  it were not for FOSTA, Defendants in this case  would be completely immune from liability under the  CDA. 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(5); MySpace, 528 F.3d  413. To resolve Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, this  Court must consider the extent to which FOSTA  has affected the immunity provided by the CDA.  Again, FOSTA states that ""[n]othing in this section  (other than subsection (c)(2)(A)) shall be construed  to impair or limit ... any claim in a civil action under  section 1595 of Title 18, if the conduct underlying  the claim constitutes a violation of section 1591 of  that title."" 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)(A) (emphasis  added). Plaintiff argues that as a result of FOSTA,  ""the exacting standard of 'actual knowledge' and  'overt act' employed in a criminal prosecution under  § 1591 is replaced by [a] 'constructive knowledge'  standard when a civil recovery is sought under the  TVPA."" (DE [29], p. 21). But this argument would  have the Court disregard the plain language and  structure of FOSTA. HN11[ ] ""A statute should be  interpreted so that no words shall be discarded as  meaningless, redundant, or mere surplusage.""  United States v. DBB, Inc., 180 F.3d 1277, 1285  (11th Cir. 1999) (quotation omitted). Defendants argue that the Congressional history of  FOSTA shows that Congress [**68]  only intended  to create a narrow exception to the CDA for ""openly  malicious actors such as Backpage where it was  plausible for a plaintiff to allege actual knowledge  and overt participation."" (DE [33], p. 5) and that a  finding of actual knowledge and overt participation  in a venture of sexual trafficking is required to  defeat CDA immunity. This is consistent with the  language of FOSTA. HN12[ ] By its terms, FOSTA  did not abrogate CDA immunity for all claims arising  from sex trafficking; FOSTA permits civil liability  for websites only  [*920]  ""if the conduct underlying  the claim constitutes a violation of section 1591.""  And section 1591 requires knowing and active  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *918; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **64 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *918; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **64 Page 25 of 34 participation in sex trafficking by the defendants.  Afyare, 632 Fed. Appx. at 286; see also Geiss v.  Weinstein Co. Holdings, LLC, 383 F. Supp. 3d 156,  169 (S.D. N.Y. 2019) (""aiders and abettors of sex  trafficking are liable under the TVPA only if they  knowingly 'benefit[ ], financially or by receiving  anything of value from participating in a venture  which has engaged in' sex trafficking"") (quoting 18  U.S.C. § 1591(a)); Noble v. Weinstein, 335 F.  Supp. 3d 504, 524 (S.D. N.Y. 2018) (""Plaintiff must  allege specific conduct that furthered the sex  trafficking venture. Such conduct must have been  undertaken with the knowledge, or in reckless  disregard of the fact, that it was furthering the  alleged sex trafficking venture. In other words,  some participation [**69]  in the sex trafficking act  itself must be shown.""). Id. at 1250-51 (emphasis in original). The court went on  to conclude that the plaintiff in that case had not pled a  violation under Section 1591(a)(2) under the definitions  and requirements that apply to criminal claims and  therefore, that her claim did not fall within FOSTA's  exemption to Section 230 immunity. Id. at 1251. The undersigned respectfully disagrees with the Kik  court's analysis. HN13[ ] In construing a statute, the  Court starts with the language of the statute. Bailey v.  United States, 516 U.S. 137, 145, 116 S. Ct. 501, 133 L.  Ed. 2d 472 (1995) (""We start, as we must, with the  language of the statute.""). The Supreme Court has  instructed, however, that context also matters and  therefore, courts should ""consider not only the bare  meaning of the word but also its placement and purpose  in the statutory scheme."" Id. Further, where a statute is  ""remedial,"" it ""should be liberally construed."" Peyton v.  Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 65, 88 S. Ct. 1549, 20 L. Ed. 2d 426  (1968). There is no question that FOSTA is a remedial  statute in that it carves out exceptions to CDA § 230  immunity, thereby affording remedies to victims of sex  trafficking that otherwise would not have been  available. Moreover, the broader statutory framework  suggests that the Kik court's reading of FOSTA  improperly adopted the most restrictive possible reading  of that provision when there is [**70]  an equally (or  more) plausible reading of the plain language of  FOSTA. HN14[ ] FOSTA consists of two clauses, with the first  clause (""[n]othing in this section . . . shall be construed  to impair or limit . . . any claim in a civil action under  section 1595 of Title 18"") modified by the second clause  (""if the conduct underlying the claim constitutes a  violation of section 1591 of that title""). 47 U.S.C. §  230(e)(5)(A). The Kik court concluded that the second  clause, on its face, not only limits civil claims that fall  outside of CDA § 230 immunity to claims asserted under  Section 1591 but that it also allows for liability on only a  subset of the civil claims that may be brought under  Sections 1595 and 1591, namely, those that can meet  the more stringent burden that applies to criminal  prosecutions under Section 1591. The implication of this  reading is that a sex trafficking victim who seeks to  impose civil liability on an ICS provider on the basis of  beneficiary liability faces a higher burden than a victim  of sex trafficking who seeks to impose such liability on  other types of defendants. Had Congress intended such  a limitation on Section 1595 liability as applied to  interactive computer services, it could have clearly  stated as much, but it did not do so. Furthermore, the more natural reading of the [**71]   second phrase of Section 230(e)(5)(A) is simply that it  creates an exemption to Section 230 immunity for civil  sex trafficking claims under Section 1591 and not as to  other sections of Title  [*921]  18 that can give rise to  civil liability under Section 1595. In particular, Section  1595 is found in Chapter 77 of Title 18, entitled  ""Peonage, Slavery, and Trafficking in Persons,"" and  creates civil liability for ""[a]n individual who is a victim of  a violation of this chapter."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a)  (emphasis added). As the title of the chapter suggests, it  prohibits a host of conduct including ""hold[ing] or  return[ing] any person to a condition of peonage"" (§  1581), ""[e]nticement into slavery"" (§ 1583), and  ""benefit[ing], financially or . . . receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in the providing or obtaining of [forced] labor""  (§ 1589). This more straightforward reading does not  limit FOSTA's exemption to a narrow subset of civil sex  trafficking claims but rather, makes available to victims  of sex trafficking the same civil remedies against an  ICS provider under Section 1591(a)(2) as are available  in cases involving other types of defendants. The Court  finds that this reading is consistent with the broad  language used in the first clause of FOSTA as well as  the remedial purpose [**72]  of FOSTA.         555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *920; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **68 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *920; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **68 Page 26 of 34 Nor does the undersigned find persuasive the Kik  court's finding that the legislative history supports its  interpretation of FOSTA. The two isolated statements  cited by the Kik court provide little guidance as to the  very  specific  question  of  statutory  interpretation  presented here. Further, the parties and amici have  pointed to numerous statements in the legislative  history,  often  seeming  to  support  conflicting  conclusions, highlighting the risks of relying on  statements made prior to passage of a bill to interpret  the statute that was actually enacted. Here, the Court  concludes that this issue is better resolved on the basis  of the language of FOSTA as it  [*922]  fits with the  broader statutory framework of the TVPRA. For these reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs'  Section 1595 claim against Twitter based on alleged  violation of Section 1591(a)(2) is not subject to the more  stringent requirements that apply to criminal violations of                                     that provision. Having reached that conclusion, the  Court now must address whether Plaintiffs have  adequately alleged: 1) that Twitter knowingly [**73]   participated in a venture; 2) that it received a benefit  from its participation; and 3) it knew or should have  known that Plaintiffs were victims of sex trafficking. a. Participation in a Venture HN15[ ] A ""venture"" is defined as ""any group of two or  more individuals associated in fact."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(e)(6). As discussed above, Plaintiffs are not  required to allege an ""overt act"" of participation in the  sex trafficking itself. Nor does "" 'participation' under §  1595 . . . require actual knowledge of participation in the  sex trafficking itself."" M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 970.  Nonetheless, to the extent that Plaintiffs allege that  Twitter has participated in a sex trafficking venture ""by  allowing Twitter to become a safe haven and a refuge  for, 'minor attracted people,' human traffickers, and  discussion  of  'child  sexual  exploitation  as  a  phenomenon,' to include trade and dissemination of  sexual abuse material[,]"" FAC ¶ 9, they must ""allege at  least a showing of a continuous business relationship  between the trafficker and [Twitter] such that it would  appear that the trafficker and [Twitter] have established  a pattern of conduct or could be said to have a tacit  agreement."" Id. Thus, for example, in M.A., this element  was sufficiently alleged because [**74]  the plaintiff  alleged ""that Defendants rented rooms to people it knew  or  should  have  known  were  engaged  in  sex  trafficking."" Id. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs' allegations are  sufficient to meet this requirement. In addition to the  general allegations that Twitter enables sex trafficking  on its platform, see, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 58-59 (alleging Twitter  makes it hard for users to report CSAM and has  received a lower rating than other platforms for its  reporting structure); 61 (""Twitter permits large amounts  of  human  trafficking  and  commercial  sexual  exploitation material on its platform, despite having both  the ability to monitor it, and actual and/or constructive  knowledge of its posting on the platform""); ¶¶ 64-69          555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *921; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **72 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *921; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **72 Page 27 of 34 (alleging that the number of reports by Twitter to the  National Center on Missing and Exploited Children  (""NCMEC"") of apparent child sexual abuse material on  its platform is low compared to what other platforms  report); ¶¶ 74-79 (alleging that Twitter hashtags help  users find CSAM and that it rarely removes hashtags it  knows are associated with CSAM); ¶¶ 80-84 (alleging  that Twitter's search suggestion feature makes it easier  for users to find CSAM), Plaintiffs also [**75]  include  specific allegations that support an inference that Twitter  participated in a ""venture"" involving these Plaintiffs. In particular, the FAC alleges that Twitter was  specifically alerted that the Videos contained sexual  images of children obtained without their consent on  several occasions but either failed or refused to take  action. First, John Doe # 1 and his mother both  allegedly reported the CSAM  [*923]  through Twitter's  content reporting interface. FAC ¶¶ 110, 112. Further,  when Twitter responded to John Doe #1's complaint by  asking for further information, John Doe #1 sent Twitter  a copy of his driver's license (reflecting that he was a  minor) and stated in his responses that the Videos had  been taken three years before ""from harassment and  being threatened"" and that a police report had been  filed. FAC ¶ 114. John Doe #1's mother allegedly made  two  more  complaints,  including  one  specifically  complaining about the user account @StraightBross,  which was one of the accounts that provided links to the  videos."" FAC ¶ 115. Subsequently, after receiving only  form responses, John Doe #1's mother emailed Twitter  to inquire about the status of the complaints. FAC ¶ 119. Two days later, Twitter [**76]  allegedly sent John Doe  #1 a response stating, ""We've reviewed the content, and  didn't find a violation of our policies, so no action will be  taken at this time."" Id. ¶ 120. John Doe #1 allegedly  responded as follows: What do you mean you don't see a problem? We  both are minors right now and were minors at the  time these videos were taken. We both were 13  years of age. We were baited, harassed, and  threatened to take these videos that are now being  posted without our permission. We did not  authorize these videos AT ALL and they need to be  taken down. We have a case number with the [Law  Enforcement Agency] for these videos and this  incident. Please remove this video ASAP and any  videos linked to this one. There is a problem with  these videos and they are going against my legal  rights and they are again at (sic) the law to be on  the internet. (capitalized emphasis in original). FAC ¶ 123. The Videos allegedly remained on Twitter  another seven days. FAC ¶ 124. Notably, Plaintiffs also  allege that the user account @StraightBross, one of the  accounts that allegedly posted the Videos, had been the  subject of a citizen complaint in December 2019 alerting  Twitter that this account carried links [**77]  to  ""OBVIOUS CHILD PORN"" but no action was taken on  that complaint. FAC ¶ 101. The Court finds that these allegations are sufficient to  allege an ongoing pattern of conduct amounting to a  tacit agreement with the perpetrators in this case to  allow them to post videos and photographs it knew or  should have known were related to sex trafficking  without blocking their accounts or the Videos. Therefore,  Plaintiffs have adequately alleged participation in a  venture under Section 1595 in support of their  beneficiary liability claim against Twitter. b. Receipt of a Benefit HN16[ ] ""To state a claim under a section 1595(a)  beneficiary theory,"" Plaintiffs ""must allege facts from  which the Court can reasonably infer that"" Twitter  ""knowingly benefit[ted] financially or by receiving  anything of value[.]"" B.M., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  135494, [WL] at *4. In B.M., the court rejected the  defendant's argument that the "" 'benefit' must derive  directly from, and be knowingly received in exchange  for, participating in a sex-trafficking venture[,]"" finding  that this approach improperly ""reads a requirement   [*924]   for  'actual  knowledge'  of  criminal  sex  trafficking into the civil statute, [and] read[s] out the  'should have known' language."" Id. Instead, the court  found that ""[t]he 'knowingly [**78]  benefit' element of  section 1595 'merely requires that Defendant knowingly  receive a financial benefit'"" from its relationship with the  sex trafficker. Id. (citing H.H. v. G6 Hosp., LLC, No.  2:19-CV-755, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL  6682152, at *2 (S.D. Ohio Dec. 6, 2019). The  undersigned agrees that this is the correct standard and              555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *922; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **74 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *922; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **74 Page 28 of 34 finds that Plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient as to this  requirement. First, contrary to Twitter's repeated assertions, the FAC  contains  detailed  allegations  about  how  Twitter  monetizes  content,  including  CSAM,  through  advertising, sale of access to its API, and data  collection. FAC ¶¶ 25, 30-41, 50-54. It further alleges  that searching for hashtags that are known to relate to  CSAM brings up promoted links and advertisements,  offering a screenshot of advertising that appeared in  connection with one such hashtag. FAC ¶ 76. Plaintiffs  also specifically allege that the Videos of Plaintiffs were  ""monetized by Twitter and it receive financial benefit  from [their] distribution on its platform."" FAC ¶ 196.  While Twitter dismisses this allegation as conclusory, it  is supported by allegation that the Videos were ""viewed  at least 167,000 times and retweeted 2,220 times for  additional views,"" FAC ¶195, and that ""[t]he videos  remained live approximately another seven days,  resulting [**79]  in substantially more views and  retweets."" FAC ¶ 125. Read together, these allegations  support a plausible inference that the Videos of Plaintiffs  generated advertising and attracted users, both of which  benefited Twitter. The Court is not persuaded that either Geiss or Kolbek,  cited by Twitter, requires a contrary result. In Geiss, the  court concluded that officers who worked at the  company of film producer Harvey Weinstein could not  be held liable on the basis of beneficiary liability under  Section 1591(a)(2) simply because they received a  benefit from working for the company where that benefit  was unrelated to any conduct that facilitated the alleged  sex trafficking by Weinstein. 383 F. Supp. 3d 156, 169  (S.D.N.Y. 2019). The court reasoned that ""there must be  a causal relationship between affirmative conduct  furthering the sex-trafficking venture and receipt of a  benefit, with actual or, in the civil context, constructive  knowledge of that causal relationship."" Id. Here,  Plaintiffs allege that the benefit - increased advertising  revenue and users - was the result of allowing the  Videos to remain on Twitter, allowing for tens of  thousands of views and retweets of the Videos.  Therefore, Geiss is not on point. Twitter's reliance on Kolbek v. Twenty First Century  Holiness Tabernacle Church, Inc., No. 10-CV-4124,  2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 180463, 2013 WL 6816174, at  *16 (W.D. Ark. Dec. 24, 2013) is also [**80]  misplaced.  In that case, the plaintiffs had been forced as children to  become ""spiritual wives"" of a church leader and brought  claims against various defendants, including the church,  for sex trafficking in violation of Section 1595, alleging  that they had benefited from the sex trafficking under  Section 1591(a)(2). The court concluded that there was  no evidence that the defendants were compensated for  the sexual abuse and therefore, that plaintiffs failed to  establish that they were the victims of ""commercial sex  trafficking"" based on the definition of the term  ""commercial sex act"" in Section 1591(e)(3). 2013 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 180463, 2013 WL 6816174, at *16 (citing 18  U.S.C. § 1591(e)(3) (defining ""commercial sex act"" as  ""any sex act, on account of which anything of value is  given to or received by any person."")). Like the court in  Geiss, the court in Kolbek found that to establish sex  trafficking, there ""needs to be a causal relationship  between the sex act and an  [*925]  exchange of an  item of value."" Id. Yet the only alleged financial benefit  any of the defendants received was payment of the  victim's living expenses by the perpetrator when they  were on out-of-state trips. Id. The court concluded that  these payments were not causally related to the sexual  abuse and therefore did not establish commercial  sex [**81]  trafficking. Id. In contrast to the facts of  Kolbek, the benefit Twitter is alleged to have received  here was the result of the proliferation of retweets and  large number of account users who viewed the Videos,  as discussed above. Moreover, Twitter conceded at oral  argument that the tweeting and retweeting of child  pornography is a ""commercial sex act"" under the  TVPRA. Therefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' have  adequately alleged receipt of a benefit for the purposes  of their claim for beneficiary liability. c. Knew or Should Have Known the Venture Was  Engaged in Trafficking While Twitter need not have actual knowledge of the  sex trafficking in order to have participated in the sex  trafficking venture for the purposes of Section 1595,  Plaintiffs must allege at least that Twitter knew or should  have known that Plaintiffs were the victims of sex  trafficking at the hands of users who posted the  content on Twitter. See B.M., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *5. Twitter contends it  had no way of knowing that the Videos might have been  evidence of commercial sex trafficking, but this  argument is hard to square with Plaintiffs' allegations  that they alerted Twitter that the Videos were created  under threat when Plaintiffs were children [**82]  and  provided evidence of John Doe #1's age in response to  Twitter's request for further information. Plaintiffs also  allege that other Twitter users used the word ""twinks"" to  describe the children in the Videos, which was ""another  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *924; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **78 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *924; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **78 Page 29 of 34 indication that Plaintiffs were minors, and that this fact  was evident from their appearance in the Videos. FAC ¶  37. According to FAC, that term is used to describe  ""young boys or men"" with ""certain boyish characteristics  such as 'little to no body or facial hair; a slim to average  build; and a youthful appearance.'"" Id. (quoting  Wikipedia).  Therefore,  the  Court  concludes  this  requirement is sufficiently alleged. *** In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have stated a claim  for civil liability under the TVPRA on the basis of  beneficiary liability and that the claim falls within the  exemption to Section 230 immunity created by FOSTA. C. Whether the FOSTA Exemption is Limited to  Claims Asserted under Sections 1591 and 1595 Before addressing Plaintiffs' remaining claims, the Court  addresses Twitter's argument that when Congress  enacted FOSTA, it intended to exempt from Section 230  immunity only claims asserted under Sections 1591 and  1595. This was the conclusion of the court in Kik, which  found that the ""plain language [**83]  of [FOSTA]  removes immunity only for conduct that violates 18  U.S.C. § 1591."" 482 F. Supp. 3d at 1249. Similarly, the  court in M. L. v. Craigslist Inc., held that because  ""FOSTA contains no language about whether it amends  the CDA to preclude immunity for state law civil actions""  it exempts Section 1595 claims but not state law claims.  No. C19-6153 BHS-TLF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166836,  2020 WL 6434845, at *9 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 17, 2020),  report and recommendation adopted, No. C19-6153  BHS-TLF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166334, 2020 WL  5494903 (W.D. Wash. Sept. 11, 2020). In J. B. v. G6  Hosp., LLC, Judge Gilliam reached the same conclusion  based on the plain language of FOSTA and further  addressed the legislative history, concluding that even if  it were appropriate  [*926]  to look beyond the words of  the statute to discern Congress's intent, ""it is not clear  that  Congress  was  concerned  specifically  with  permitting civil claims under state law."" No. 19-CV- 07848-HSG, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213, 2020 WL  4901196, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 20, 2020). The Court  agrees that based on the plain language of FOSTA, it  exempts only claims under Sections 1595 and 1591.  Therefore, to the extent that Plaintiffs' remaining claims  fall within the ambit of Section 230 immunity, FOSTA  does not exempt Twitter from immunity as to those  claims. D. Claim Three (18 U.S.C. §§ 2258A and 2258B) HN17[ ] Section 2258A establishes a duty on the part  of electronic communication service providers to report  to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children  (""NCMEC"") ""facts or circumstances from which there is  an apparent violation of section 2251 [**84] , 2251A,  2252, 2252A, 2252B, or 2260 that involves child  pornography."" 18 U.S.C. § 2258A; see also 18 U.S.C. §  2258E (defining ""provider"", ""NCMEC""). Section 2252A,  in turn, makes it a criminal offense to, inter alia,  knowingly mail or transport, receive, distribute or  reproduce child pornography. (As discussed above,  Claim Four is based, in part, on Twitter's alleged  violation of that provision.) HN18[ ] Section 2258B  bars the imposition of liability on a provider in  connection with its performance of the duty established  under Section 2258A except where the provider ""(1)  engaged in intentional misconduct; or (2) acted, or failed  to act-- (A) with actual malice; (B) with reckless  disregard to a substantial risk of causing physical injury  without legal justification; or (C) for a purpose unrelated  to the performance of any responsibility or function  under [Section 2258B], sections 2258A, 2258C, 2702,  or 2703."" 18 U.S.C. § 2258B. HN19[ ] Although Section 2258A establishes a duty to  report under criminal law, that section does not purport  to establish a private right of action. Rather, it provides  that ""knowing and willful failure"" to make a report will  result in the imposition of fines on the provider of up to  $300,000. See 18 U.S.C. 2258A(e). Section 2258B  creates a safe harbor that prohibits the imposition of  criminal or civil liability based on failure to report unless  the failure was the result of intentional or reckless  conduct. Based on their plain language, neither of these  provisions reflects a clear intent on the part of Congress  to establish a private right of action to enforce the  reporting requirement found in Section 2258A. See  Abcarian v. Levine, 972 F.3d 1019, 1025 (9th Cir. 2020  (""a cause of action may now be recognized under a  statute only where the language Congress used  displays an intent to create not just a private right but  also a private remedy."" ) (internal quotation and citation  omitted). Nor have Plaintiffs pointed to any authority  suggesting that there is private right of action under  Section 2258A. For this reason, the Court concludes  that Plaintiffs' claim under this section fails to state a  claim and does not reach the question of immunity  under CDA § 230. 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *925; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **82 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *925; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **82 Page 30 of 34 E. Claim Four (Personal Injuries Related [**85]  To  Sex Trafficking And Receipt And Distribution Of  Child Pornography Under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2252A, and  2255) Section 2255 creates a civil remedy for violations of  certain sections of the  [*927]  criminal code, including  Sections 2252A, providing as follows: (a) In general. Any person who, while a minor, was  a victim of a violation of section 1589, 1590, 1591,  2241(c), 2242, 2243, 2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A,  2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423 of this title and who  suffers personal injury as a result of such violation,  regardless of whether the injury occurred while  such person was a minor, may sue in any  appropriate United States District Court and shall  recover the actual damages such person sustains  or liquidated damages in the amount of $150,000,  and the cost of the action, including reasonable  attorney's fees and other litigation costs reasonably  incurred. The court may also award punitive  damages and such other preliminary and equitable  relief as the court determines to be appropriate. 18 U.S.C. § 2255(a). Twitter does not argue that  Plaintiffs have failed to allege a violation of Section  2252A but contend this claim is barred by CDA § 230  immunity. The Court agrees. While there is not a great deal of authority on this  question, at least two courts have concluded that under  Section 230, ICSs are immune from civil liability under  2252A and 2255. See Doe v. Bates, No. 5:05-CV-91- DF- [**86] CMC, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93348, 2006  WL 3813758, at *4 (E.D. Tex. Dec. 27, 2006); M.A. ex  rel. P.K. v. Vill. Voice Media Holdings, LLC, 809 F.  Supp. 2d 1041, 1051 (E.D. Mo. 2011). The Bates court  relied on the reasoning in Zeran v. Am. Online, Inc., 129  F.3d 327, 329 (4th Cir. 1997), explaining: The Zeran court . . . noted the Congressional  purpose of removing disincentives to self-regulation  by internet service providers. If internet service  providers such as Yahoo! could be liable for  reviewing materials but ultimately deciding to allow  them, they would likely chose not to regulate at all.  Further, even simply responding to notices of       potentially obscene materials would not be feasible  because the sheer number of postings on  interactive computer services would create an  impossible burden in the Internet context. To the  extent an internet service provider actually makes  choices about its content, without immunity they  would be faced with ceaseless choices of  suppressing controversial speech or sustaining  prohibitive liability. While the facts of a child  pornography case such as this one may be highly  offensive, Congress has decided that the parties to  be punished and deterred are not the internet  service providers but rather are those who created  and posted the illegal material[.] 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93348, 2006 WL 3813758, at *4  (internal quotations and citations omitted). Thus, in  Bates, the court concluded that while the exemption in  Section  230(e)(1)  does  not  prohibit  the  government [**87]  from prosecuting an ICS provider  under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A (which is found in chapter 110  of Title 18, the section of Title 18 that is expressly  carved out from Section 230 under subsection (e)(1)),  the exemption does not extend to civil claims asserted  under that section. 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93348, [WL]  at *4-5; see also M.A, 809 F. Supp. 2d at 1055 (holding  that plaintiff's claim seeking to impose civil liability on  internet service based on alleged violation of 18 U.S.C.  § 2252A was barred by Section 230 immunity). In Zeran, the plaintiff sued AOL based on its alleged  delay in taking down offensive posts by an unknown  third party that included the plaintiff's telephone number  and were resulting in the plaintiff being harassed and  receiving death threats. 129 F.3d at 329. The plaintiff  alleged that he repeatedly called AOL requesting that  the posts be removed and was told that they would be,  but that AOL failed to take them  [*928]  down for many  days. Id. AOL asserted that it was immune from the  plaintiff's claims under Section 230 and the court  agreed, rejecting the plaintiff's argument that the fact  that AOL knew about the offending posts deprived AOL  of immunity. Id. at 332-33. The court reasoned: [O]nce a computer service provider receives notice  of a potentially defamatory posting, it is thrust into  the role of a traditional publisher. The computer  service provider [**88]  must decide whether to  publish, edit, or withdraw the posting. In this  respect, Zeran seeks to impose liability on AOL for  assuming the role for which § 230 specifically  proscribes liability—the publisher role. 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *926; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **84 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *926; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **84 Page 31 of 34 Id. Plaintiffs argue that Bates was wrongly decided  because Zeran involved defamatory speech rather than  child pornography. According to Plaintiffs, unlike  defamatory speech, child pornography ""is at once  contraband, beyond the covering of First Amendment  speech protection, evidence of criminal child abuse, and  an ongoing sexual crime against a child"" and therefore,  requiring ICS providers to remove pornography does not  require them to exercise ""traditional editorial functions.""  Opposition at 23. While this argument has some force, it  does not square with Ninth Circuit authority, which has  found that ""[t]o avoid chilling speech, Congress 'made a  policy choice . . . not to deter harmful online speech  through the separate route of imposing tort liability on  companies that serve as intermediaries for other parties'  potentially injurious messages.'"" Gonzalez v. Google  LLC, 2 F.4th 871, 886 (9th Cir. 2021) (citing Carafano v.  Metrosplash.com, Inc., 339 F.3d 1119, 1123 (9th Cir.  2003) (quoting Zeran,129 F.3d at 330)). In Carafano, for  example,  the  third-party  content  was  not  only  defamatory but also included the creation of a fake  profile that resulted [**89]  in threats to the plaintiff and  her son. 339 F.3d at 1122. The Ninth Circuit recognized  that the plaintiff had been the victim of a ""cruel and  sadistic identity theft"" but concluded, ""despite the  serious and utterly deplorable consequences that  occurred in this case, . . . that Congress intended that  service providers such as Matchmaker be afforded  immunity from suit."" Id. at 1121, 1125.                       The undersigned therefore finds the reasoning and  holding of Bates and M.A. ex rel. P.K. v. Vill. Voice  Media Holdings on this question to be in line with Ninth  Circuit authority and concludes that immunity under  Section 230 is not defeated by the fact that the third- party content at issue is illegal child pornography.  Therefore, the Court concludes that this claim fails  under Section 230.  [*929]  F. Plaintiffs' State Law Claims 1. Claim Five (California Products Liability) Plaintiffs' products liability claim is based on the theory  that Twitter's platform is unreasonably dangerous and  therefore defective because it is designed so as to make  it easy for child predators and sex traffickers to quickly  disseminate CSAM on a wide scale while making it  difficult to report or block the dissemination of such  material. Plaintiffs attempt to avoid Section 230 on the  ground that [**90]  the claim is not based on Twitter's  conduct as a publisher of information but instead, on a  defective product, citing Lemmon v. Snap, Inc., 995  F.3d 1085, 1090 (9th Cir. 2021) in support of their  position. That case is distinguishable from the facts  here, however. In Lemmon v. Snap, the plaintiffs were parents of two  boys who were killed in a high speed car accident where  it was alleged that a speed-filter offered by the  defendant's smartphone application, Snapchat, played a  role in the accident. 995 F.3d at 1087-90. The speed  filter allowed Snapchat users to superimpose a filter  over photos or videos captured through Snapchat  recording their real-life speed, and it was alleged that  the speed filter incentivized young drivers to drive at  high speeds because it was suspected by Snapchat  users that logging a speed of over 100 MPH in a user  video would result in ""rewards"" from Snapchat. Id. at  1088-89. It was further alleged that the defendant was  aware of the danger of the speed filter because there  had been a ""series of news articles about this  phenomenon; an online petition that 'called on Snapchat  to address its role in encouraging dangerous speeding';  at least three accidents linked to Snapchat users' pursuit  of high-speed snaps; and at least one other lawsuit  against [**91]  Snap based on these practices."" Id. at  1089-90.  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *928; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **88 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *928; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **88 Page 32 of 34 The plaintiffs in Lemmon brought a products liability  claim based on negligent design against Snap, the  company that owns Snapchat, and Snap asserted that it  was entitled to immunity under Section 230. Id. at 1090.  The district court agreed but the Ninth Circuit reversed,  finding that the plaintiffs' claims did not treat the  defendant as a publisher or speaker. Id. at 1091. The  court reasoned as follows: It is . . . apparent that the Parents' amended  complaint does not seek to hold Snap liable for its  conduct as a publisher or speaker. Their negligent  design  lawsuit  treats  Snap  as  a  products  manufacturer, accusing it of negligently designing a  product (Snapchat) with a defect (the interplay  between Snapchat's reward system and the Speed  Filter). Thus, the duty that Snap allegedly violated  ""springs from"" its distinct capacity as a product  designer. Barnes, 570 F.3d at 1107. This is further  evidenced by the fact that Snap could have  satisfied  its  ""alleged  obligation""—to  take  reasonable measures to design a product more  useful than it was foreseeably dangerous— without altering the content that Snapchat's  users generate. Internet Brands, 824 F.3d at 851.  Snap's alleged duty in this case thus ""has nothing  to do with"" its editing, monitoring, [**92]  or  removing of the content that its users generate  through Snapchat. Id. at 852. . . . That Snap allows  its users to transmit user-generated content to one  another does not detract from the fact that the  Parents seek to hold Snap liable for its role in  violating its distinct duty to design a reasonably  safe product. . . . Though publishing content is ""a  but-for cause of just about everything"" Snap is  involved in, that does not mean that the Parents'  claim, specifically, seeks to hold Snap  [*930]   responsible in its capacity as a ""publisher or  speaker."" Id. at 1092 (emphasis added). Here, as in Lemmon, Plaintiffs' products liability claim is  based on the allegation that the design of the Twitter  platform is unreasonably dangerous. The facts here  differ, however, from those in Lemmon because the  nature of the alleged design flaw in this case - and the  harm that is alleged to flow from that flaw - is directly  related to the posting of third-party content on Twitter. In  particular, Plaintiffs allege that Twitter's design, which is  aimed at ""enabling its users to disseminate information  very quickly to large numbers of people"" through such  features as hashtags and algorithms, also enables ""sex  traffickers to distribute [**93]  CSAM on a massive  scale."" FAC ¶¶ 179-181. Conversely, they allege,  Twitter is not ""designed to enable its users to easily  report CSAM, nor is it designed so that CSAM is  immediately blocked pending review when reported."" Id.  ¶ 182. Nor does Twitter ""consistently deploy IP blocking,  or other measures, to prevent users suspended by  Twitter for disseminating CSAM from opening new  accounts under different names[,]"" Plaintiffs allege.  These flaws, in essence, seek to impose liability on  Twitter based on how well Twitter has designed its  platform to prevent the posting of third-party content  containing child pornography and to remove that content  after it is posted. In other words, to meet the obligation  Plaintiffs seek to impose on Twitter on this claim, Twitter  would have to alter the content posted by its users, in  contrast to the design defect alleged in Lemmon.  Therefore, the Court concludes that Lemmon is not on  point and that Plaintiffs' products liability claim fails on  the basis that Twitter is entitled to immunity as to that  claim under Section 230 immunity. 2. Claims Six through Nine (Negligence Claims) Twitter challenges all of Plaintiffs' negligence claims on  the grounds that it is immune [**94]  from liability on  those claims under Section 230. It further asserts that  the negligence per se and negligent infliction of  emotional distress claims (Claims Eight and Nine) are  not independent causes of action and that the remaining  negligence claims (Claims Six and Seven) fail because  Twitter does not owe Plaintiffs any duty. The Court finds  that these claims fall within the scope of Section 230  and therefore does not reach Twitter's remaining  arguments. The essence of these claims is that Twitter breached a  duty to Plaintiffs - and violated various criminal statutes - by failing to remove the Videos after being notified of  them and instead allowing them to be broadly  disseminated on Twitter. These claims seek to treat  Twitter as a publisher of information, which is prohibited  under Section 230. See In re Facebook, Inc., 625  S.W.3d 80, 2021 WL 2603687, at *9 (Tex. 2021) (finding  that negligence claims against Facebook based on its  failure to protect plaintiffs from sex traffickers who used  its platform were barred under Section 230). Therefore,  the Court finds that Plaintiffs' negligence claims fail  under Section 230.   555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *929; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **91 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *929; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **91 Page 33 of 34 3. Claim Ten (Distribution of Private, Sexually  Explicit Material Under Cal. Civ. Code section  1708.85) California Civil Code section 1708.85(a) provides: A private cause of action lies against a person who  intentionally  distributes  by  any  means  a  photograph, film, [**95]  videotape, recording, or  any other reproduction  [*931]  of another, without  the other's consent, if (1) the person knew that the  other person had a reasonable expectation that the  material would remain private, (2) the distributed  material exposes an intimate body part of the other  person, or shows the other person engaging in an  act of intercourse, oral copulation, sodomy, or other  act of sexual penetration, and (3) the other person  suffers general or special damages as described in  Section 48a. Cal. Civ. Code section 1708.85(a). Section 1708.85  exempts from liability, however, a ""person distributing  material under subdivision (a)"" where ""[t]he distributed  material was previously distributed by another person.""  Cal. Civ. Code section 1708.85(c)(6). Based on the  plain language of these provisions, the Court concludes  Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim. Liability under section 1708.85(a) requires that Twitter  intentionally distributed the Videos. Even assuming that  Twitter's conduct amounted to intentional distribution  once it was put on notice of the Videos, the allegations  in the FAC make clear that at that point these Videos  had already been posted by ""another person,"" namely,  the owners of the user handles @StraightBross and  @fitmalesblog. See FAC ¶¶ 89, 91, 99. Plaintiffs have  not cited any contrary authority [**96]  or even  addressed Twitter's argument in their Opposition.  Therefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs fail to state  a claim under section 1708.85(a). Further, to the extent  that this claim seeks to hold Twitter liable for failing to  remove third-party content from its platform, the Court  concludes that the claim is barred under CDA § 230  because it treats Twitter as a publisher. 4. Claim Eleven (Intrusion Into Private Affairs) HN20[ ] The tort of intrusion into private affairs has two  elements:  ""(1)  intrusion  into  a  private  place,  conversation or matter, (2) in a manner highly offensive  to a reasonable person."" Shulman v. Group W  Productions, Inc., 18 Cal. 4th 200, 231, 74 Cal. Rptr. 2d  843, 955 P.2d 469 (1998), as modified on denial of reh'g  (July 29, 1998). Twitter does not argue in the Motion  that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for intrusion into private  affairs and therefore, the Court assumes that Plaintiffs  adequately allege such a claim. Nonetheless, the basis  for this claim is Twitter's ""role as a 'republisher' of  material posted by a third party,"" and therefore, the  claim is barred by CDA § 230. Caraccioli v. Facebook,  Inc., 700 F. App'x 588, 590 (9th Cir. 2017) (holding that  claim against Facebook for intrusion into private affairs  based on Facebook's refusal to remove private photos  and videos of the plaintiff from Facebook was barred  under Section 230). 5. Claim Twelve (Invasion of Privacy [**97]  Under  California Constitution) HN21[ ] To establish an invasion of privacy claim  under the California Constitution, a plaintiff must  demonstrate three elements: ""(1) a legally protected  privacy interest; (2) a reasonable expectation of privacy  in the circumstances; and (3) conduct by defendant  constituting a serious invasion of privacy."" Hill v. Nat'l  Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 7 Cal.4th 1, 39-40, 26 Cal.  Rptr. 2d 834, 865 P.2d 633 (1994). Again, Twitter has  not argued that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim as to this  claim and the Court assumes that their claim is  sufficiently alleged, but like the claim for intrusion into  private affairs, this claim is based on Twitter's role as a  ""republisher"" of third-party content and therefore is  barred under CDA § 230. 6. Claim Thirteen (UCL Claim) Twitter asserts that Plaintiffs do not have standing to  assert their UCL  [*932]  claim and that they fail to state  a claim because they have not alleged any statutory  violation or, to the extent the claim is based on alleged  misrepresentations by Twitter, any reliance on those  misrepresentations. It also contends the claim is barred  by CDA § 230. The Court assumes without deciding that  Plaintiffs have adequately alleged standing. It also finds  that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged an ""unlawful""  practice under the UCL for the same reasons [**98]  it  finds that Plaintiffs have stated a claim for beneficiary  liability under Section 1595 and 1591(a)(2). The  gravamen of the UCL claim, however, is that Twitter  engaged in an unlawful and unfair practice by failing to  ensure that the Videos were blocked from Twitter or at  least, removed promptly. As such, this claim seeks to  impose liability on Twitter as a publisher of third-party  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *930; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **94 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *930; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **94 Page 34 of 34 content and is therefore barred by Section 230.",1
"People v. Nettles, 2016 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 5607","I. INTRODUCTION Defendant Daniel Jamin Nettles, Sr. appeals after a jury found him guilty of pimping a minor over the age of 16  (Pen. Code, § 266h, subd. (b)(1)), procuring a minor over the age of 16 for prostitution (§ 266i, subd. (b)(1)),  pimping an adult (§ 266h, subd. (a)), and human trafficking a person under the age of 18 (§ 236.1, subd. (c)).  Eden Doe was the alleged victim in the three counts involving a minor, while Mia Doe was the alleged victim in the  count of pimping an adult. Defendant was sentenced to an eight-year prison term for human trafficking, with a consecutive one-year four- month prison term for pimping an adult. The terms for the other two offenses were stayed pursuant to section 654.  Page 2 of 13   On appeal, defendant contends the trial court erred by instructing the jury on human trafficking pursuant to a  version of CALCRIM No. 1243 that incorporated post-offense amendments to section 236.1. Defendant also  contends that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that Mia Doe was an accomplice whose testimony  required corroboration, and that the instructional errors cumulatively prejudiced [*2]  him. For reasons that we will  explain, we will affirm the judgment. II. BACKGROUND A. Testimony of Eden Doe Eden Doe was 16 years old in March of 2010. She was about five feet three inches tall and weighed about 125  pounds. Eden had heard her friend Cherish mention defendant's name before and knew that he lived in the same  apartment complex as her friend. Cherish had mentioned that defendant was a pimp. One night, Eden snuck out of her house and stayed out all night with a friend. On her way home the next morning,  Eden met defendant at a light rail station. Defendant appeared to be about six feet tall and appeared to weigh about  190 pounds. Eden asked defendant for a cigarette and then conversed with him. Defendant invited Eden to come  over to his apartment, indicating he would give Eden some marijuana. Eden went home instead, but after her  mother yelled at her, she returned to the light rail station, where she again saw defendant. Defendant suggested  they go smoke marijuana at his apartment with his girlfriend. Eden agreed and accompanied defendant to his  apartment. Defendant's girlfriend, [*3]  Mia, was at the apartment, along with two small children. Eden, Mia, and defendant  smoked marijuana in the living room. When their conversation turned to prostitution, defendant told Eden ""that  was what [she was] going to do."" Mia agreed, saying, ""[Y]eah."" Defendant had been ""really nice"" at first, but at this  point he became more serious and made her feel scared. At some point, defendant told Eden that he knew what  school she attended and that he would send Mia to Eden's school to beat her up. Eden had never performed any acts of prostitution before. Defendant said that Mia would teach Eden ""how to do  it."" Eden was ""really scared"" and thought she was going to die. At defendant's direction, Eden followed Mia into a  bedroom. Mia gave Eden clothes to wear, including shorts that exposed part of her buttocks. Defendant received a call on his cell phone. He handed the phone to Mia, who had a conversation with the person  on the other end of the line. Afterwards, defendant and Mia told Eden they were going to a Jack in the Box. Feeling  ""forced"" to go, Eden accompanied Mia to the Jack in the Box, where they met three men. Two of the men were  Latin and one was African American. Mia seemed to know the [*4]  men. Eden and Mia got into a car with the three  men. They drove to a liquor store, where the men purchased alcohol, and then to a hotel. Eden and Mia went into a  hotel room with one of the Latin men. Eden was given beer to drink, and she smoked more marijuana. At some point, Mia was talking on the phone, and Eden could hear defendant's voice on the other end of the line.  Mia told Eden to talk to defendant and to say that ""everything was okay."" When Eden got on the phone, defendant  asked about the race of the three men. Mia instructed Eden to say that the men ""weren't black,"" and Eden  complied. After the phone call, Mia instructed Eden to go into the bathroom, where the Latin man was taking a shower after  having had sex with Mia. When the Latin man got out of the shower, he told Eden to take off her clothes, and she  complied. The Latin man put his penis in Eden's vagina. Mia then knocked on the door. She told Eden, ""Let's go,""  and they left the hotel room. Mia was on the phone with defendant again, and she was counting money. Eden  spoke to defendant, who was asking ""if everything was okay.""  Page 3 of 13   Eden could hear defendant, Mia, and the three men engaging in negotiations. Afterward, Eden went [*5]  back into  the hotel room, where she watched Mia perform oral sex on one of the men. Eden and Mia then left the hotel again,  and Eden saw Mia counting money again. They took a taxi cab back to defendant's apartment. At the apartment, Eden got onto a mattress with defendant and Mia. Eden removed her clothing after defendant told  her to because she was ""scared for [her] life."" Defendant had oral sex with both Eden and Mia. Defendant then  instructed Eden and Mia to give each other oral sex. However, they did not do so. At some point, Mia got up out of bed. Defendant then got on top of Eden and began having sex with her. Defendant  also put his penis into Eden's mouth. Defendant, who did not use a condom, told Eden that she was ""going to be his  next baby momma."" Eden spent the night in defendant's apartment. When she woke up in the morning, Eden smoked more marijuana,  which defendant gave to her. Defendant asked her questions about what had happened at the hotel. Eden told  defendant that the three men were African American and Latin. She also told defendant that she had sex with one  of the Latin men. Defendant became angry and began yelling. He was upset that one of the men was African  American, [*6]  and he told Mia that Eden should have just watched and learned. Defendant was ""scary"" when he  was yelling, and he hit Mia in the face. Defendant then grabbed Mia by the hair and threw her to the ground. This  scared Eden, who thought ""he could do that to [her]."" Defendant told Eden to get ready to leave and said they were going to ""The Blades."" Mia again gave Eden  ""revealing"" clothes to wear. Eden, Mia, defendant, and the two children took a train from the light rail station to a  BART station. During the train ride, defendant repeatedly instructed Eden not to look up and not to look at any other  guys. Eden complied because she was scared. At the Concord BART station, defendant's mother and stepfather picked up the group. Defendant and his parents  spoke about ""mak[ing] some money."" They went to a park, where Eden smoked more marijuana with Mia and  defendant. Defendant's parents then drove to a parking lot, where they dropped Eden and Mia off. Defendant told  Eden and Mia to ""see if there were any tricks."" Eden and Mia walked around, talking to men who drove up in cars.  The men asked questions such as ""how much money are you going to charge"" and ""do you do drugs."" Neither  Eden or Mia got into a [*7]  car with any of the men. Defendant later returned to the parking lot. Defendant was mad at Eden because he had instructed her not to look  at other guys. Defendant said he was going to ""take it out on Mia,"" who should have told Eden the rule. Eden and Mia continued to walk around, but they never found any customers. Mia eventually brought Eden to a  house where defendant was present along with another woman and a child. Defendant told the other woman that  Eden was his ""new girl,"" and Mia and the other woman discussed teaching Eden ""how to be a ho."" After about an hour, defendant's mother drove the group back to defendant's parents' house. On the drive,  defendant and his stepfather argued about how to teach Eden ""to be a ho."" Defendant's stepfather said he was  going to call someone to teach her, but defendant said that ""he had it under control."" Defendant's stepfather also  said that he wanted Eden, which scared her. Defendant's parents were mad that Eden and Mia had not found  anyone to give them money for sex. At the house, defendant's parents talked about ""chains and whips.""  Defendant's mother eventually drove defendant, Eden, Mia, and the children back to San Jose. Back at defendant's apartment, [*8]  defendant instructed Eden and Mia to get naked and get into the bed.  Defendant had sex with Eden and may also have had sex with Mia. The next morning, Eden got up and went to the bathroom. Eden waited until she thought it was safe and then left  the apartment. Eden went to school, but she got into trouble at school for failing to attend detention. Her father  picked her up from school and later brought her to a hospital. B. Testimony of Mia Doe Page 4 of 13   Mia Doe was found unavailable after she failed to appear at trial, and thus her preliminary hearing testimony was  read to the jury. At the preliminary hearing, she testified pursuant to an agreement that the prosecution would not  use any of her testimony against her. Defendant was Mia's boyfriend in 2010. Before meeting defendant, Mia had engaged in sex with men for money.  After defendant moved in with her and her children, Mia would sometimes have sex for money if they did not have  enough money for food, which often happened at the end of the month. Defendant had no job during the time he  and Mia lived together. Mia would sometimes give defendant money. When Eden first came over to the apartment, Mia commented that she looked ""really young,"" but Eden [*9]  replied,  ""I'm grown enough."" According to Mia, Eden came over looking for defendant. When Mia went into the bedroom to  get dressed, Eden followed her and asked what she was doing. Mia said she was going ""turn a date"" because she  needed money. Eden said she wanted to go. When Mia questioned why, Eden said, ""Oh, I've done it before."" Mia  and Eden then left the apartment. According to Mia, Eden remained in the clothes she had been wearing when she  arrived at the apartment. Mia and Eden walked to a Jack in the Box, where they met three ""johns"" that Mia had arranged to meet. Mia and  Eden got into a car with the men, who drove to a liquor store and then a hotel. One of the men rented a room, and  they all went into the room. Eden followed Mia into the bathroom, where they discussed ""what [they] were about to  do."" One of the men, who was half African American, came into the bathroom and said he wanted to have sex with  Eden and that he would pay $100, the amount Mia had previously discussed with him. Mia performed oral sex on  the man, then left the bathroom. Mia later knocked on the bathroom door and asked if Eden was okay. Mia said that she had to call ""dad,"" referring  to defendant. When she [*10]  called defendant, he asked to speak with Eden. Mia denied telling Eden what to say  to defendant, but she acknowledged that defendant had a rule against having sex with other African American men. Eden gave Mia around $150 to hold after coming out of the bathroom. Mia and Eden left the hotel but came back  after one of the three men called. Eden went with one of the men to a second room. When she returned, she gave  Mia another $150 to hold. Mia and Eden then called a cab and left. During the cab ride, Eden was holding her head  and had watery eyes. Eden said she was fine, however. Mia paid for the cab and then gave Eden the rest of her  money back. Eden later gave the money to defendant. Mia and Eden returned to the apartment. After dinner, Mia and defendant had sexual intercourse. Defendant then  told Mia and Eden to have sexual intercourse with one another. According to Mia, they did so, even though she did  not want to. Mia was afraid of defendant becoming angry and hitting her, which he had done before. The next morning, defendant pulled Mia out of bed by her hair. He reprimanded Mia for having ""let a black guy  touch"" Eden, and then he beat her. Defendant then told Mia to get dressed and [*11]  to get Eden some clothes.  Defendant said they were going out of town, but he did not say where they were going. Eden, Mia, defendant, and Mia's children went to the light rail station and took a train to the Fremont BART station,  then took a BART train to Concord. Defendant's mother took the group to Fairfield, where they dropped Mia's  children off at the home of defendant's ""baby mama"" and then to an area where defendant had brought her before.  Defendant and Eden got out, and defendant said, ""You know what to do."" Mia and Eden walked around all day, but  neither was able to solicit any customers. Defendant came back to check on them at one point. Mia denied that defendant was a pimp for her or Eden. She asserted that Eden wanted to do everything that she  did. Eden was not shy or afraid and appeared comfortable interacting with Mia and defendant. Eden brought and  smoked her own marijuana. Eden did not want to go home and said that her parents were going to send her away. Mia had five prior convictions of crimes involving moral turpitude, including a 2007 conviction of engaging in  prostitution, a 2004 conviction of loitering with the intent to commit prostitution, and three convictions [*12]  of  petty theft. Page 5 of 13   C. Investigation After going to the hospital, Eden was transported for a Sexual Assault Response Team exam. Sexual Assault  Forensic Examiner Celia Breazile examined Eden. Eden reported that defendant had put his penis into her vagina  two times and had also put his fingers into her vagina and his mouth on her vagina. She referred to defendant as a  ""wannabe pimp"" and reported that defendant called her ""one of [his] hos."" Eden reported having had sexual  intercourse with a second person as well, referring to him as ""some trick."" Breazile observed abrasions and redness  as well as debris during her vaginal exam of Eden. She took DNA and semen swabs during the exam. Later tests  confirmed the presence of semen. Defendant was the source of the semen. San Jose Police Officer Tam Truong interviewed Mia. The interview was played for the jury at trial. Mia's statement  was inconsistent with her preliminary hearing testimony in several respects: Eden had not claimed to have prior  experience prostituting, defendant was Mia's pimp and would take her money after she engaged in prostitution,  and Eden did not smoke her own marijuana at the apartment. Officer Truong also interviewed defendant. [*13]  The interview was played for the jury at trial. Defendant admitted  having been a pimp and intending to be Mia's pimp, but he claimed she was ""a dope fiend"" who did what she  wanted, causing him not to want to pimp any more. Defendant denied knowing Eden but recognized a photograph  of her as someone who hung out with Cherish. Defendant denied inviting Eden to his apartment, talking to her  about prostitution, and having sex with her. Defendant speculated that his sperm could be in Eden's vagina if she  had taken a condom out of the trash and put it into her vagina. Defendant consented to a DNA swab. San Jose Police Officer Jeremy Martinez testified as an expert in human trafficking. Pimps are often called ""dad""  or ""daddy"" by the prostitutes working for them, but sometimes prostitutes consider their pimps to be their  boyfriends. A prostitute may be referred to as a ""ho"" or a ""bitch."" A ""trick"" or a ""john"" is someone who pays for  sexual services. The phrase ""walk the blade"" means to walk in an area where prostitution frequently occurs.  Pimps often target runaways for prostitution because they are easily manipulated. Pimps commonly go to places  like public transportation sites to find women. [*14]  Pimps will often offer women alcohol or drugs and then  manipulate them into becoming prostitutes. Pimps sometimes seek to get a woman pregnant in order to create a  ""sense of connection"" so that they can assert more control. It is common for a pimp to have a rule against  prostitutes having sex with other black men, because the pimp fears that other black men are pimps and that the  pimp will lose his income from his prostitutes. It is also common for a pimp to require his prostitutes to keep their  heads down, as a sign of submission. D. Defense Case Defendant admitted that he was a pimp when he met Mia. He had met Mia through an ex-girlfriend and had helped  her move into her San Jose apartment. Mia said she used to work as a prostitute but that she had not been getting  any ""dates"" lately. Mia wanted defendant to help her. Defendant agreed. At some point, Mia said she ""didn't want to  do it,"" but defendant later discovered that Mia was working as a ""renegade"" prostitute, without him serving as her  pimp. By March of 2010, he did not consider himself a pimp. Defendant claimed he did not know Eden, although he had seen her at his apartment complex before. The only  other time he had seen her [*15]  was in court. He would not have pimped for a 16-year-old girl, nor would he be  interested in such a young girl romantically. Defendant believed that Mia had used Eden to set him up. Defendant admitted he had pleaded guilty to misdemeanor domestic violence. He initially asserted that Mia had lied  about him beating her, but he later admitted he had pushed and slapped her. Defendant also admitted he had been  convicted of felony drug possession, misdemeanor battery, misdemeanor receiving stolen property, felony battery  on a spouse or cohabitant, and forgery or passing a bad check (two convictions). He had been arrested for pimping,  which led to a probation violation. Page 6 of 13   E. Charges, Verdicts, and Sentence Defendant was charged with pimping a minor over the age of 16 (§ 266h, subd. (b)(1); count 1), procuring a minor  over the age of 16 for prostitution (§ 266i, subd. (b)(1); count 2), pimping an adult (§ 266h, subd. (a); count 3), and  human trafficking a person under the age of 18 (§ 236.1, subd. (c); count 4). Counts 1, 2, and 4 pertained to Eden  Doe; count 3 pertained to Mia Doe. A jury found defendant guilty of all four charges. The trial court sentenced defendant to an eight-year prison term for  human trafficking (count 4), with a consecutive one-year four-month prison [*16]  term for pimping an adult (count  3); the terms for the other two offenses (counts 1 and 2) were stayed pursuant to section 654. III. DISCUSSION A. Challenges to Human Trafficking Instruction Defendant challenges the jury instruction on human trafficking, claiming the instruction erroneously incorporated  amendments to section 236.1 that became effective after the March 2010 incident involving Eden Doe. Defendant  contends that when section 236.1 was amended in 2012, the definition of human trafficking was broadened, and  thus the instruction violated the state and federal prohibitions against ex post facto laws. Defendant also contends  that the instruction on human trafficking violated his rights under the due process and jury trial provisions of the  Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. 1. Legal Background ""Article I, section 10 of the United States Constitution provides: 'No state shall . . . pass any . . . ex post facto law . .  . .' The ex post facto clause prohibits only those laws that 'retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the  punishment for criminal acts.' [Citation.]"" (People v. McKee (2010) 47 Cal.4th 1172, 1193, 104 Cal. Rptr. 3d 427,  223 P.3d 566.) The California state Constitution also prohibits ex post facto application of laws. (Cal. Const., art. I, §  9; see People v. Farley (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1697, 1705, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 702.) In March of 2010, former section 236.1 provided in pertinent part: ""(a) Any person who deprives or violates the  personal liberty of another with the intent [*17]  to effect or maintain a felony violation of Section 266, 266h, 266i,  267, 311.4, or 518, or to obtain forced labor or services, is guilty of human trafficking. [¶] . . . [¶] (d)(1) For  purposes of this section, unlawful deprivation or violation of the personal liberty of another includes substantial and  sustained restriction of another's liberty accomplished through fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace,  or threat of unlawful injury to the victim or to another person, under circumstances where the person receiving or  apprehending the threat reasonably believes that it is likely that the person making the threat would carry it out. [¶]  (2) Duress includes knowingly destroying, concealing, removing, confiscating, or possessing any actual or  purported passport or immigration document of the victim."" (Stats. 2005, ch. 240, § 7.) In 2012, section 236.1 was amended by Proposition 35 and substantially rewritten. (Prop. 35, as approved by  voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) [see § 6].) The offense described in former section 236.1, subdivision (a) is now  described in section 236.1, subdivision (b), with additional enumerated target offenses: ""Any person who deprives  or violates the personal liberty of another with the intent to effect or maintain a violation of Section 266, 266h, 266i,  266j, 267, 311.1, 311.2, 311.3, 311.4, 311.5, 311.6, or 518 [*18]  is guilty of human trafficking . . . ."" The 2012 amendments to section 236.1 placed the definitions of certain terms in subdivision (h). Section 236.1,  subdivision (h)(3) provides: ""'Deprivation or violation of the personal liberty of another' includes substantial and  sustained restriction of another's liberty accomplished through force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence,  duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury to the victim or to another person, under circumstances where the  Page 7 of 13   person receiving or apprehending the threat reasonably believes that it is likely that the person making the threat  would carry it out."" Section 236.1, subdivision (h)(4) provides: ""'Duress' includes a direct or implied threat of force,  violence, danger, hardship, or retribution sufficient to cause a reasonable person to acquiesce in or perform an act  which he or she would otherwise not have submitted to or performed; a direct or implied threat to destroy, conceal,  remove, confiscate, or possess any actual or purported passport or immigration document of the victim; or  knowingly destroying, concealing, removing, confiscating, or possessing any actual or purported passport or  immigration document of the victim."" Section 236.1, subdivision (i) now provides: ""The total circumstances, including the age of the victim, [*19]  the  relationship between the victim and the trafficker or agents of the trafficker, and any handicap or disability of the  victim, shall be factors to consider in determining the presence of 'deprivation or violation of the personal liberty of  another,' 'duress,' and 'coercion' as described in this section."" 2. Proceedings Below Pursuant to CALCRIM No. 1243, the jury was instructed as follows: ""The defendant is charged in count four with  human trafficking in violation of Penal Code Section 236.1. To prove that the defendant is guilty of this crime, the  People must prove that: [¶] (1) The defendant either deprived another person of personal liberty or violated that  other person's personal liberty; and [¶] (2) When the defendant did so, he intended to effect or maintain a felony  violation of Penal Code Section 266 (h) or Penal Code Section 266 (i). [¶] Deprivation [or] violation of personal  liberty as used here includes substantial and sustained restriction of another [person's] liberty accomplished  through fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, [or] threat of unlawful injury to the victim, or to another  person under circumstances in which the person was receiving or perceiving the threat reasonably believes that [it  is] likely that the person making the threat would [*20]  . . . carr[y] it out. [¶] Duress means a direct or implied threat  of violence, danger, hardship, or retribution that is enough to cause a reasonable person of ordinary sensitivity to do  or submit to something that he or she would not otherwise do or submit to. When deciding whether the act was  accomplished by duress, consider all the circumstances, including the age of the other person and his or her  relationship to the defendant."" Defendant did not object to the above instruction. 3. Analysis The question presented in this case is whether, at the time of defendant's offenses, section 236.1 defined duress  solely in terms of ""knowingly destroying, concealing, removing, confiscating, or possessing any actual or purported  passport or immigration document of the victim"" (former § 236.1, subd. (d)(2); see Stats. 2005, ch. 240, § 7) or  whether duress also could be found if the defendant made ""a direct or implied threat of force, violence, danger,  hardship, or retribution sufficient to cause a reasonable person to acquiesce in or perform an act which he or she  would otherwise not have submitted to or performed"" (§ 236.1, subd. (h)(4)). This case also presents the question  of whether, at the time of defendant's offenses, ""[t]he total circumstances, including the [*21]  age of the victim""  could to be considered in determining the existence of duress. (§ 236.1, subd. (i).) In other words, we must  determine whether the 2012 amendments to section 236.1 expanded the definition of duress or merely clarified  existing law. We apply settled rules of statutory construction in determining the meaning of ""duress"" as used in former section  236.1. In interpreting the statute, ""'our fundamental task . . . is to determine the Legislature's intent so as to  effectuate the law's purpose.' [Citation.] 'We begin with the plain language of the statute, affording the words of the  provision their ordinary and usual meaning and viewing them in their statutory context, because the language  employed in the Legislature's enactment generally is the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.' [Citations.] The  plain meaning controls if there is no ambiguity in the statutory language. [Citation.] If, however, 'the statutory  language may reasonably be given more than one interpretation, ""'""courts may consider various extrinsic aids,  including the purpose of the statute, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, and the statutory  Page 8 of 13   scheme encompassing the statute.""'""' [Citation.]"" (People v. Cornett (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1261, 1265, 139 Cal. Rptr. 3d  837, 274 P.3d 456 (Cornett).) Looking [*22]  at the plain meaning, the statute in effect at the time of defendant's offenses did not limit the  definition of duress to acts involving passports or immigration documents. Rather, former section 236.1, subdivision  (d)(2) provided that ""[d]uress includes knowingly destroying, concealing, removing, confiscating, or possessing any  actual or purported passport or immigration document of the victim."" (Stats. 2005, ch. 240, § 7, italics added.)  ""'Includes' is 'ordinarily a term of enlargement rather than limitation.' [Citation.] The 'statutory definition of a thing as  ""including"" certain things does not necessarily place thereon a meaning limited to the inclusions.' [Citation.]""  (Flanagan v. Flanagan (2002) 27 Cal.4th 766, 774, 117 Cal. Rptr. 2d 574, 41 P.3d 575.) Thus, by using the word  ""includes,"" the Legislature indicated that ""knowingly destroying, concealing, removing, confiscating, or possessing  any actual or purported passport or immigration document of the victim"" (Stats. 2005, ch. 240, § 7) would be  sufficient to constitute duress for purposes of former section 236.1, but that such an act would not be necessary for  a finding of duress. (See People v. Arnold (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 1408, 1414, 52 Cal. Rptr. 3d 545 [reading the  word ""includes"" as a term of enlargement in statutes defining ""firearm""].) Moreover, ""interpretations that render  statutory terms meaningless as surplusage are to be [*23]  avoided"" (People v. Hudson (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1002,  1010, 44 Cal. Rptr. 3d 632, 136 P.3d 168 (Hudson)), and defendant's proposed interpretation of former section  236.1, subdivision (d)(2) would render the term ""includes"" meaningless. Defendant points out that ""there are exceptions to the rule"" regarding the term ""includes,"" relying on People v.  Horner (1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 23, 87 Cal. Rptr. 917 (Horner). That case does not support defendant's position,  however. In Horner, the court examined former section 12401, which purported to define ""tear gas"" for purposes of  certain penal statutes. (Horner, supra, at pp. 26-27.) The statute provided: ""'""Tear gas""' as used in this chapter shall  apply to and include all liquid, gaseous or solid substances intended to produce temporary physical discomfort or  permanent injury through being vaporized or otherwise dispersed in the air. . . ."" (Ibid.) Applying the principle that  ""the words 'include' and 'including' are ordinarily words of enlargement, and not of limitation,"" the court held that the  Legislature intended the term ""tear gas"" ""to include substances not ordinarily understood to be tear gas."" (Id. at p.  27.) Thus, contrary to defendant's representation, the Horner court did not find an exception to the general rule of  statutory interpretation regarding the word ""includes."" Defendant presents several additional arguments in support of his claim that the plain meaning [*24]  of former  section 236.1 is not dispositive. First, defendant contends the legislative history shows that the Legislature enacted  former section 236.1 in order to curb international human trafficking and that the statute was not intended to apply  to ""general prostitution offenses."" As noted above, the plain meaning of a statute controls if there is no ambiguity in the statutory language, and we  look to legislative history only if ""'the statutory language may reasonably be given more than one interpretation.'""  (Cornett, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 1265.) Since we have concluded that under the plain meaning of former section  236.1, ""duress"" was not limited to acts involving a victim's passport or immigration document, we need not consider  the legislative history. However, even assuming that the definition of the ""duress"" was ambiguous, the legislative  history does not support defendant's position. Defendant references bill analyses of Assembly Bill 22 (A.B. 22), which enacted former section 236.1 in 2005. As  defendant notes, the bill's author described human trafficking as ""the fastest growing industry in the world"" and  cited statistics about the number [*25]  of people who were being trafficked into the United States. (See Sen. Rules  Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill No. 22 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.) as amended  Sept. 7, 2005, p. 10.) However, as the Attorney General points out, the bill's author also referenced the number of  American children who are victims of human trafficking annually. (See Sen. Com. on Pub. Saf., Analysis of  Assem. Bill No. 22 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 16, 2005, p. P.) The bill's author also noted that in  addition to confiscating passports and visas, human traffickers ""keep victims enslaved"" through ""debt bondage,    Page 9 of 13   isolation from the public, and confiscation of . . . pieces of identification."" (See Sen. Com. on Pub. Saf., Analysis of  Assem. Bill No. 22 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 16, 2005, p. P.) Another bill analysis quoted from a  report on human trafficking, which stated that while the majority of victims come from abroad, some victims are  ""United States citizens who have fallen into the clutches of traffickers."" (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of  Assem. Bill No. 22 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.) as amended April 21, 2005, p. E.) The legislative history thus  shows [*26]  that former section 236.1 was enacted to combat human trafficking of all types, including but not  limited to international human trafficking. Defendant next contends that the 2012 amendments to section 236.1 show that the Legislature was ""clean[ing] up  an oversight"" with respect to the definition of duress, rather than clarifying the meaning of that term. In fact, former  section 236.1 was amended by the electorate, not the Legislature, through Proposition 35, which enacted the  Californians Against Sexual Exploitation Act (CASE Act). (Prop. 35, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6,  2012) [see §§ 1, 6].) Nothing in the ballot materials or text of the initiative measure indicates that the electorate's  intent was to expand the definition of duress. The Legislative Analyst's analysis of Proposition 35, printed in the  ballot pamphlet for the General Election of November 6, 2012, states that the initiative would include more crimes in  the definition of human trafficking, increase penalties for human trafficking, provide services for human  trafficking victims, change evidentiary rules in human trafficking cases, require law enforcement training in  human trafficking, and expand requirements for sex offenders. Likewise, nothing in the ""Findings [*27]  and  Declarations"" or ""Purpose and Intent"" sections of the CASE Act indicates an intent to expand the definition of  duress. (Prop. 35, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) [see §§ 2, 3].) The Attorney General asserts that the 2012 addition of a more general and expansive definition of duress ""merely  codified the long-standing judicial construction of the term . . . ."" In other words, when the Legislature enacted  section 236.1 in 2005, it intended duress to have a meaning consistent with the definition provided by case law. As  explained below, we agree. In 1985, the court in People v. Pitmon (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 38, 216 Cal. Rptr. 221 (Pitmon) noted that ""[d]uress,  as an element of a criminal offense[,] ha[d] not been previously given legal definition."" (Id. at p. 48.) The Pitmon  court held that in the context of section 288, which prohibits lewd acts, duress should be given its ""commonly  understood meaning."" i.e., ""a direct or implied threat of force, violence, danger, hardship or retribution sufficient to  coerce a reasonable person of ordinary susceptibilities to (1) perform an act which otherwise would not have been  performed or, (2) acquiesce in an act to which one otherwise would not have submitted."" (Pitmon, supra, at p. 50,  fn. omitted.) The court further noted, ""The total circumstances, including the [*28]  age of the victim, and his  relationship to defendant are factors to be considered in appraising the existence of duress."" (Id. at p. 51.) In 2004,  the California Supreme Court noted that ""[t]he Pitmon definition of 'duress' ha[d] been followed consistently for  almost 20 years,"" not just with respect to section 288 but with respect to other sex offenses. (People v. Leal (2004)  33 Cal.4th 999, 1004, 1005, 16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 869, 94 P.3d 1071 (Leal).) ""It is a settled principle of statutory construction that the Legislature '""is deemed to be aware of statutes and judicial  decisions already in existence, and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof. [Citation.]"" [Citation.]'  [Citation.] Courts may assume, under such circumstances, that the Legislature intended to maintain a consistent  body of rules and to adopt the meaning of statutory terms already construed. [Citations.]"" (People v. Scott (2014) 58  Cal.4th 1415, 1424, 171 Cal. Rptr. 3d 638, 324 P.3d 827.) Here, at the time former section 236.1 was enacted in 2005, the term ""duress"" had a ""commonly understood  meaning"" confirmed by case law. (See Pitmon, supra, 170 Cal.App.3d at p. 50; Leal, supra, 33 Cal.4th at pp. 1004- 1005.) That meaning was ""a direct or implied threat of force, violence, danger, hardship or retribution sufficient to  coerce a reasonable person of ordinary susceptibilities to (1) perform an act which otherwise would not have been  performed or, (2) acquiesce in an act to which one otherwise would [*29]  not have submitted."" (Pitmon, supra, at p.  50, fn. omitted.) It was also settled that in determining the existence of duress, ""[t]he total circumstances, including  the age of the victim, and his relationship to defendant are factors to be considered."" (Id. at p. 51.) The instruction  on duress given in the instant case was consistent with this definition. Page 10 of 13   Defendant argues that the Legislature could not have intended to adopt the Pitmon definition of duress when it  enacted former section 236.1 in 2005, because there were other definitions of duress in existence at that time. First,  as noted in Pitmon, the term duress was defined differently for the defense of duress (§ 26, subd. (6)). In Pitmon,  the court noted that ""[t]he defense of duress"" had a different definition—""it is established only if one acted out of  fear of imminent death or great bodily harm""—and found that definition to be ""inapplicable"" in the context of an  element of a sex offense. (Pitmon, supra, 170 Cal.App.3d at p. 49.) Second, as noted in Leal, the term duress was  defined differently for the crimes of rape (§ 261, subd. (b)) and spousal rape (former § 262, subd. (c); Stats. 1996,  ch. 1077, § 15). (See Leal, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 1007.) In Leal, the court found it ""clear"" that the definitions of  duress in the rape and spousal rape statutes did not apply ""to any other sexual offenses."" (Ibid. [*30] ) Since  section 236.1 did not involve the defense of duress or the crimes of rape or spousal rape, it is reasonable to find the  Legislature intended former section 236.1 to incorporate the Pitmon definition of duress, including the factors to be  considered in determining the existence of duress. Next, defendant points out that following the 2012 amendments to section 236.1, the Bench Notes to CALCRIM No.  1243 provided: ""This instruction is based on the language of the statute effective November 7, 2012, and only  applies to crimes committed on or after that date."" However, the 2012 amendments to section 236.1 changed more  than the definition of duress. The 2012 amendments to section 236.1 also amended the definition of the phrase  ""[d]eprivation or violation of the personal liberty of another."" (Compare former § 236.1, subd. (d)(1) [Stats. 2005, ch.  240, § 7] with § 236.1, subd. (h)(3).) Thus, it is far from clear that the cautionary admonition in the Bench Notes was  intended to apply to the definition of duress. Moreover, ""the Bench Notes and the CALCRIM jury instructions are not  themselves legal authority."" (People v. Johnson (2016) 243 Cal.App.4th 1247, 1269, 197 Cal. Rptr. 3d 353.) Finally, defendant argues that the rule against rendering statutory language surplusage (see Hudson, supra, 38  Cal.4th at p. 1010) should lead this court to hold that the Legislature intended to give ""duress"" a restricted meaning  in former section 236.1 As defendant [*31]  points out, the 2012 amendments to section 236.1 changed the  definition of the phrase ""[d]eprivation or violation of the personal liberty of another"" to specify that a ""substantial and  sustained restriction of another's liberty"" may be accomplished through ""force"" or ""fear"" in addition to ""fraud, deceit,  coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury to the victim or to another person."" (§ 236.1, subd.  (h)(3); see former § 236.1, subd. (d)(1); Stats. 2005, ch. 240, § 7.) However, this change did not affect the definition  of duress, which is defined as including ""a direct or implied threat of force, violence, danger, hardship, or retribution  sufficient to cause a reasonable person to acquiesce in or perform an act which he or she would otherwise not have  submitted to or performed."" (§ 236.1, subd. (h)(4), italics added.) A threat of force or violence is not the same as  actual force or violence. Thus, including a ""threat of force"" in the definition of duress does not render meaningless  the terms ""force,"" ""violence"" and ""threat of unlawful injury"" as used in the current definition of ""deprivation or  violation of the personal liberty of another"" under section 236.1, subdivision (h)(3). Because the jury instruction on human trafficking correctly stated the definition of duress in effect at the [*32]  time  of defendant's offenses, the instruction did not violate the prohibitions against ex post facto laws or defendant's  rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments. B. Failure to Instruct on Accomplice Testimony Defendant contends the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that Mia Doe was an accomplice whose  testimony required corroboration. 1. Legal Background Section 1111 provides that ""[a] conviction can not be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless it be  corroborated by such other evidence as shall tend to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense;  and the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the offense or the circumstances  Page 11 of 13   thereof."" Section 1111 defines an accomplice as ""one who is liable to prosecution for the identical offense charged  against the defendant on trial in the cause in which the testimony of the accomplice is given."" A person is ""liable to prosecution"" for an offense (§ 1111), if he or she is a principal to that offense. (People v. Lewis  (2001) 26 Cal.4th 334, 368-369, 110 Cal. Rptr. 2d 272, 28 P.3d 34 (Lewis).) Principals are ""[a]ll persons concerned  in the commission of a crime, . . . whether they directly commit the act constituting the offense, or aid and abet in its  commission, or, not being present, have advised and encouraged [*33]  its commission . . . ."" (§ 31.) ""When there is sufficient evidence that a witness is an accomplice, the trial court is required on its own motion to  instruct the jury on the principles governing the law of accomplices. [Citations.]"" (People v. Frye (1998) 18 Cal.4th  894, 965-966, 77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 25, 959 P.2d 183, disapproved on other grounds by People v. Doolin (2009) 45  Cal.4th 390, 421, fn. 22, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 209, 198 P.3d 11.) Whether a witness is an accomplice is a question of  fact for the jury when the facts are disputed or susceptible to different inferences. However, if the evidence  establishes as a matter of law that the witness is an accomplice, the court must instruct the jury of that fact. (People  v. Hayes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 1211, 1270-1271, 91 Cal. Rptr. 2d 211, 989 P.2d 645.) Furthermore, if the evidence is  insufficient as a matter of law to support a finding that a witness is an accomplice, the trial court may make that  determination and, in that situation, need not instruct the jury on accomplice testimony. (Lewis, supra, 26 Cal.4th at  p. 369.) A defendant has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a witness is an accomplice.  (People v. Fauber (1992) 2 Cal.4th 792, 834, 9 Cal. Rptr. 2d 24, 831 P.2d 249.) 2. Analysis Defendant asserts that Mia was liable to prosecution for pimping, since Mia knew Eden was a prostitute and used  some of the proceeds of Eden's prostitution. (See § 266h, subd. (b).) Defendant points out that the prosecutor  even told the jury that Mia could have been charged because she, like defendant, had encouraged [*34]  Eden to  be a prostitute and ""took the money."" The Attorney General contends that defendant ""did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Mia was an  accomplice,"" because in his trial testimony he ""vehemently denied knowing Eden and instead suggested that he  was being set up by Mia and/or Eden."" However, a defendant need not affirmatively introduce evidence in order for  the trial court to give an accomplice testimony instruction. ""When the prosecution calls an accomplice as a witness,  the trial court must instruct the jury that the witness's testimony should be viewed with distrust."" (People v. Mincey  (1992) 2 Cal.4th 408, 461, 6 Cal. Rptr. 2d 822, 827 P.2d 388.) The cases cited by the Attorney General are  inapposite and do not hold that an accomplice instruction is unnecessary when, as here, the sole defendant denies  guilt. (See, e.g., People v. Sagehorn (1956) 140 Cal.App.2d 138, 150-151, 294 P.2d 1062 [no evidence witness  was the defendant's accomplice]; People v. Terry (1970) 2 Cal.3d 362, 399, 85 Cal. Rptr. 409, 466 P.2d 961  [accomplice instruction would have been prejudicial to codefendant who ""testified in her own behalf, not as a  prosecution witness, and denied her guilt""], disapproved of on other grounds by People v. Carpenter (1997) 15  Cal.4th 312, 381-382, 63 Cal. Rptr. 2d 1, 935 P.2d 708.) We will assume that an accomplice instruction should have been given because there was ""record evidence""  indicating that Mia ""participated in (or aided and abetted)"" the crimes [*35]  of pimping or pandering. (See People  v. Williams (1997) 16 Cal.4th 153, 247, 66 Cal. Rptr. 2d 123, 940 P.2d 710.) We proceed to consider whether the  error was prejudicial. ""A trial court's failure to instruct on accomplice liability under section 1111 is harmless if there is sufficient  corroborating evidence in the record. [Citation.] 'Corroborating evidence may be slight, may be entirely  circumstantial, and need not be sufficient to establish every element of the charged offense. [Citations.]' [Citation.]  The evidence 'is sufficient if it tends to connect the defendant with the crime in such a way as to satisfy the jury that  the accomplice is telling the truth.' [Citation.]"" (Lewis, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 370.) Page 12 of 13   Defendant argues that he was prejudiced by the lack of an accomplice instruction because there was no  corroboration of Mia's testimony that Eden gave money to defendant. (See § 266h, subd. (b) [crime of pimping a  minor requires that the defendant ""lives or derives support or maintenance in whole or in part from the earnings or  proceeds of the person's prostitution"" or ""solicits or receives compensation for soliciting for the person""].) As noted above, corroborating evidence need not establish every element of the charged offense. (Lewis, supra, 26  Cal.4th at p. 370.) ""'""[O]nly a portion . . . of the accomplice's testimony need be corroborated""'"" and ""[i]t is only [*36]   required that the evidence '""'tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime in such a way as may  reasonably satisfy the jury that the [accomplice] is telling the truth.'""' [Citation.]"" (People v. Miranda (1987) 44 Cal.3d  57, 100, 241 Cal. Rptr. 594, 744 P.2d 1127, abrogated on other grounds by People v. Marshall (1990) 50 Cal.3d  907, 933, fn. 4, 269 Cal. Rptr. 269, 790 P.2d 676.) Here, Mia's testimony about defendant pimping Eden was corroborated by Eden in many respects, and Eden's  testimony tended to connect defendant with the commission of that offense such that the jury could be reasonably  satisfied that Mia was telling the truth. Eden corroborated Mia's testimony about how the two of them met three men  at a Jack in the Box and went to a hotel with the men, about how Eden went into the bathroom with one of the men,  and about how Mia and Eden both spoke to defendant on the phone afterwards. Eden's testimony also  corroborated Mia's testimony about other matters, including defendant's order that Eden and Mia engage in sexual  acts with each other, defendant's physical abuse of Mia, and the trip to Concord. In addition, defendant's sperm was  found in Eden's vagina, which further connected defendant to the charged offenses. Also, Mia's testimony was  corroborated by the expert, who explained that a pimp is often referred to as [*37]  ""dad,"" the term Mia said she  used when referring to defendant, and that many pimps have a rule again their prostitutes having sex with other  African American men, as Mia testified defendant had. The instant case is thus distinguishable from the case  defendant relies on, in which the alleged accomplice's testimony was ""crucial"" because he was the only witness to  have seen the defendant attack a particular victim. (People v. Hernandez (2003) 30 Cal.4th 835, 876, 134 Cal. Rptr.  2d 602, 69 P.3d 446, disapproved of on other grounds by People v. Riccardi (2012) 54 Cal.4th 758, 824, fn. 32, 144  Cal. Rptr. 3d 84, 281 P.3d 1.) In addition, ""other instructions given . . . were sufficient to inform the jury to view [Mia's] testimony with care and  caution."" (See Lewis, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 371.) The jury learned that Mia had five prior convictions of crimes  involving moral turpitude and that she was testifying under an immunity agreement with the prosecution. Pursuant  to CALCRIM Nos. 226 and 316, the jury was instructed that a felony conviction and a promise of immunity could be  considered when evaluating a witness's testimony. Thus, ""there was no reasonable probability that defendant would  have received a more favorable result if the trial court instructed the jury to view [Mia's] testimony with distrust.  [Citation.]"" (Lewis, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 371.) C. Cumulative Prejudice Defendant contends there was cumulative prejudice from the multiple [*38]  alleged errors in this case. (See People  v. Hill (1998) 17 Cal.4th 800, 844, 72 Cal. Rptr. 2d 656, 952 P.2d 673 [""a series of trial errors, though independently  harmless, may in some circumstances rise by accretion to the level of reversible and prejudicial error""].) However,  we have not found multiple errors and thus there is no cumulative prejudice. IV. DISPOSITION The judgment is affirmed. BAMATTRE-MANOUKIAN, J. WE CONCUR: ELIA, ACTING P. J.

"State v. Taylor-Hollingsworth, 2023 Ohio App. LEXIS 4249","[*1] DECISION APPEAL from the Franklin County Court of Common  Pleas MENTEL, J. {¶  1}  Defendant-appellant,  Richard  J.  Taylor- Hollingsworth, appeals from the August 10, 2022  judgment entry of the Franklin County Court of Common  Pleas sentencing him to an aggregate term of 16 years  in prison for committing the offenses of aggravated  robbery and felonious assault. For the following  reasons, we affirm. I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY {¶ 2} On September 28, 2018, appellant was indicted by  a Franklin County Grand Jury for aggravated robbery in  violation of R.C. 2911.01, a felony of the first degree  (Count One); felonious assault in violation of R.C.  2903.11, a felony of the second degree (Count Two);  and having weapons under disability in violation of R.C.  2923.13, a felony of the third degree (Count Three).  Counts One and Two also included firearm and repeat  violent offender specifications in violation of R.C.  2941.145(A) and 2941.149(A), respectively.  No. 22AP-527 2  {¶ 3} On October 10, 2018, appellant pleaded guilty,  pursuant to a plea agreement, to aggravated robbery  and felonious assault with firearm specifications, in  exchange for dismissal of the having weapons while  under disability count and the repeat violent offender  specifications. The trial court accepted [*2]  appellant's  plea and immediately moved to a sentencing hearing. At  the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court sentenced  appellant to serve an aggregate term of 16 years in  prison. Specifically, the trial court ordered appellant to  serve ten years of incarceration for aggravated robbery,  with a consecutive three-year sentence for the firearm  specification, and seven years for felonious assault, with  a consecutive three-year sentence for the firearm  specification. The trial court ordered the felonious  assault and aggravated robbery sentences to be run  concurrent  with  each  other,  and  the  firearm  specifications to run consecutive to the primary  convictions. Appellant appealed the trial court's sentence arguing  that the plea was not made knowingly, intelligently, and  voluntarily because the trial court did not give any  advisement concerning the mandatory imposition of  post-release control. On January 30, 2020, this court  found the trial court plainly erred during the plea  colloquy by failing to advise appellant that the sentence  included a mandatory term of post-release control. State  v. Taylor-Hollingsworth, 10th Dist. No. 18AP-873, 2020- Ohio-278,discretionary appeal not allowed, 2020-Ohio- Page 2 of 6 3018. Accordingly, we vacated appellant's plea and  remanded the matter back [*3]  to the trial court. {¶ 4} On August 10, 2022, the trial court held a second  sentencing hearing in this matter. Appellant, after being  advised of his rights pursuant to Crim.R. 11, entered a  plea of guilty to the aggravated robbery and felonious  assault offenses with firearm specifications. The having  weapons while under disability charge and repeat  violent offender specifications were dismissed nolle  prosequi. {¶ 5} The parties proceeded to a sentencing hearing  pursuant to R.C. 2929.19. During the hearing, the state  delivered an oral summary of the case. Counsel for the  appellant raised no objection to the state's recitation of  the underlying facts. (Aug. 10, 2022 Tr. at 6-7.) {¶ 6} According to the state, on August 27, 2017, at  approximately 1:32 a.m., the victims in this case, M.B.  and G.T., stopped at the Sunoco gas station located at  2281 Sullivant Avenue in Columbus, Ohio. As M.B.- wearing a large gold chain-exited his  No. 22AP-527 3  vehicle, he observed G.T. speaking with two individuals,  one of which was later identified as appellant. G.T.  heard the two individuals state that they could rob M.B.  Appellant then proceeded to brandish a firearm. To  avoid an altercation, M.B. continued into the Sunoco  gas [*4]  station store. Surveillance video showed that  appellant followed M.B. and chased him around the  inside of the store. Appellant pursued M.B out of the  store and down a nearby alleyway. Appellant then shot  M.B. in the back. While on the ground, appellant ripped  the chain off M.B.'s neck. While the unidentified  individual told appellant to kill M.B, appellant declined  and fled the scene. {¶ 7} At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court  imposed an aggregate term of 16 years in prison.  Specifically, the trial court sentenced appellant to ten  years of incarceration for aggravated robbery with an  additional  three-year  sentence  for  the  firearm  specification. The trial court also imposed seven years  of incarceration for the felonious assault with an  additional  three-year  sentence  for  the  firearm  specification. While trial court determined that the  aggravated robbery and felonious assault convictions  did not merge, it ordered the convictions to run  concurrent with each other but consecutive to the  firearms specifications. The trial court found appellant  was entitled to 225 days of jail-time credit. {¶ 8}  Appellant filed a timely appeal in this matter. II. ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR {¶ 9}  Appellant [*5]  assigns the following as trial court  error: The trial court erred in failing to merge Mr. Taylor  Hollingsworth's convictions in counts one and two at  sentencing in violation of R.C. 2941.25, the Fifth and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United  States  Constitution, and Article I, Section 10 and 16 of the Ohio  Constitution. III. STANDARD OF REVIEW {¶ 10} A trial court's decision as to whether multiple  offenses merge, pursuant to R.C. 2941.25, is a judicial  determination, which we review de novo. State v. Bailey,  __ Ohio St. __, 2022-Ohio-4407, ¶ 6, citing State v.  Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 482, 2012-Ohio-5699, ¶ 1;  State v. McKnight, 10th Dist. No. 20AP-595, 2022-Ohio- 591, ¶ 34, citing State v.Flood, 10th Dist. No. 18AP-206,  2019-Ohio-2524, ¶ 25.  No. 22AP-527 4  IV. LEGAL ANALYSIS A. Appellant's Sole Assignment of Error {¶ 11} In appellant's sole assignment of error, he argues  that the trial court erred by failing to merge the  aggravated robbery and felonious assault convictions. {¶ 12} The legal doctrine of merger is rooted in the  Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the  United States Constitution as made applicable to the  states through the Fourteenth Amendment. State v.  Pendleton, 163 Ohio St.3d 114, 2020-Ohio-6833, ¶ 8.  The Ohio Constitution similarly provides, ""[n]o person  shall be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense.""  Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 10. Among the  protections afforded under the Double Jeopardy Clause,  is the protection against multiple punishments for the  same offense. State v. Ruff, 143 Ohio St.3d 114, 2015- Ohio-995, ¶ 10. {¶ 13} The General Assembly codified the judicial  doctrine of merger in R.C. 2941.25. The statute  precludes the ""cumulative punishment of a defendant for  the same criminal act where his conduct can be  construed to constitute two statutory offenses, when in  substance and [*6]  effect, only one offense has been  committed."" State v. Roberts, 62 Ohio St.2d 170, 172-73  Page 3 of 6 (1980). R.C. 2941.25 directs: (A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be  construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of  similar import, the indictment or information may contain  counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be  convicted of only one. (B) Where the defendant's conduct constitutes two or  more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct  results in two or more offenses of the same or similar  kind committed separately or with a separate animus as  to each, the indictment or information may contain  counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be  convicted of all of them. {¶ 14} Ohio's felonious assault statute, R.C. 2903.11(A),  provides: ""(A) No person shall knowingly do either of the  following: (1) Cause serious physical harm to another or  to another's unborn; (2) Cause or attempt to cause  physical harm to another or to another's unborn by  means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance.""  Additionally, the offense of aggravated robbery, as set  forth under R.C. 2911.01, is defined as: (A) No person, in attempting or committing a theft  offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised  Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or  offense, shall do any of the following: [*7]   No. 22AP-527 5  (1) Have a deadly weapon on or about the offender's  person or under the offender's control and either display  the weapon, brandish it, indicate that the offender  possesses it, or use it; (2) Have a dangerous ordnance on or about the  offender's person or under the offender's control; (3) Inflict, or attempt to inflict, serious physical harm on  another. {¶ 15} The Supreme Court of Ohio has shaped the  nature of our allied-offenses analysis under R.C.  2941.25 through its evolving interpretations of the  statute. See, e.g.,State v. Logan, 60 Ohio St.2d 126  (1979); State v. Roberts, 62 Ohio St.2d 170 (1980);  State v. Thomas, 61 Ohio St.2d 254 (1980);State v.  Donald, 57 Ohio St.2d 73 (1979); State v. Blankenship,  38 Ohio St.3d 116 (1988); State v. Rance, 85 Ohio  St.3d 632 (1999);State v. Cabrales, 118 Ohio St.3d 54,  2008-Ohio-1625; State v. Johnson, 128 Ohio St.3d 153,  2010-Ohio-6314. {¶ 16} In Ruff, the Supreme Court revisited its decision  in Johnson to resolve when two or more offenses are  allied offenses of a similar import as contemplated  under R.C. 2941.25. State v. Ruff, 143 Ohio St.3d 114,  2015-Ohio-995, ¶ 1. The Ruff court found that when  engaging in R.C. 2941.25 analysis, ""courts must  evaluate three separate factors- the conduct, the  animus, and the import."" Id. at paragraph one of the  syllabus; State v.Harris, 10th Dist. No. 15AP-683, 2016- Ohio-3424, ¶ 42. The Supreme Court explained that  when determining whether two or more offenses are  allied offenses of a similar import as contemplated  under R.C. 2941.25, courts must ask three questions: (1)  Were  the  offenses  dissimilar  in  import  or  significance? (2) Were they committed separately? and  (3) Were they committed with separate animus [*8]  or  motivation? Ruff at ¶ 31. {¶ 17} An answer in the affirmative to any of the above  questions will permit separate convictions. State v.  Bailey, __Ohio St.3d __, 2022-Ohio-4407, ¶ 10, citing  Statev. Earley, 145 Ohio St.3d 281, 2015-Ohio-4615, ¶  12, citing Ruff at ¶ 31. ""At its heart, the allied-offense  analysis is dependent upon the facts of a case because  R.C. 2941.25 focuses on the defendant's conduct."" Ruff  at ¶ 26. When determining whether multiple offenses  merge pursuant to R.C. 2941.25, a court must review  the entire record. State v. Junod, 3d  No. 22AP-527 6  Dist. No. 10-18-08, 2019-Ohio-743, ¶ 60, citing State v.  Washington, 137 Ohio St.3d 427, 2013-Ohio-4982, ¶ 24. {¶ 18} Since Ruff, the Supreme Court has rejected ""a  bright-line rule for analyzing the issue of multiple  punishments because a one-size-fits-all rule will not  work in every situation. [Ruff] at ¶ 30. Rather, an allied- offenses analysis must be driven by the facts of each  case."" State v. Ramunas, __Ohio St.3d__, 2022-Ohio- 4199, ¶ 22 (Fischer, J., dissenting). ""[B]ecause an  offense may be committed in a variety of ways[,] and the  offenses committed may have different import,"" the Ruff  analysis must focus on the appellant's conduct to  resolve whether one or more convictions may result.  Ramunas at ¶ 22 (Fischer, J., dissenting). While a  court's R.C. 2941.25 analysis has been properly applied  as a legal question, ""it necessarily turns on an analysis  of the facts, which can lead to exceedingly fine  distinctions."" Bailey, 2022-Ohio-4407, at ¶ 11. Page 4 of 6 {¶ 19} Whether two offenses merge is a sentencing  question [*9]  and not an additional burden of proof  shouldered by the state. Washington at ¶ 18. The  defendant holds the burden to establish their entitlement  to the protections under R.C. 2941.25 against multiple  punishments for a single criminal act. Id.; see also State  v. Morris, 12th Dist. No. CA2019-12-205, 2020-Ohio- 4103, ¶ 15, citing State v. Conrad, 12th Dist. No.  CA2018-01-016,  2018-Ohio-5291,  ¶  44  (finding  defendant failed to meet their burden to demonstrate  that his convictions for aggravated robbery, aggravated  burglary, and kidnapping were allied offenses as the  facts indicated that the crimes were each committed  separately and with a separate animus).1 1 There is no dispute regarding the underlying facts that  form the basis for the felonious assault conviction, i.e.,  appellant shooting M.B. in the back causing him serious  physical harm. However, the state contends there are  three  separate  incidents  that  could  constitute  aggravated robbery: (1) when M.B. saw appellant  outside the Sunoco and overheard, ""we can rob this  guy"" before appellant pulled out a gun, which resulted in  M.B. fleeing into the store; (2) when appellant chased  M.B. around the interior of the store while brandishing a  firearm; and (3) when appellant, while holding a gun and  having just shot M.B, ripped the chain from the victim's  neck. While appellant solely discusses [*10]  the third  theory in its brief, the state argues the first two theories  are equally available as a basis to find that the felonious  assault and aggravated robbery convictions were  separate offenses. The state reasons that because  appellant pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery in  violation of R.C. 2911.01, felony of the first degree, the  nature of the aggravated robbery was never narrowed to  a single theory. The state also points to the language in  the indictment and bill of particulars that support both  R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) and (A)(2) analysis. Concerning the  first two theories, the state posits that because the  aggravated robbery was completed before the felonious  assault, the offenses were committed separately and do  not merge. ""[I]f one offense is completed before the  other begins, the offenses are considered separately for  sentencing purposes even though the two offenses may  have been committed in close proximity in time."" State  v. Fields, 12th Dist. No. CA2014-3-025, 2015-Ohio- 1345, ¶ 18. However, because we find that the  No. 22AP-527 7  1. Offenses dissimilar in import or significance {¶ 20} Our analysis begins and ends with the first prong  of the Ruff analysis- whether the offenses were  dissimilar in import and significance. There are two  circumstances  in  which  offenses  will  be  considered [*11]  dissimilar in import making sentences  of multiple counts permissible. The first is "" '[w]hen a  defendant's conduct victimizes more than one person  [because] the harm for each person is separate and  distinct.' * * * The second circumstance is when a  defendant's conduct against a single victim constitutes  two or more offenses and 'the harm that results from  each offense is separate and identifiable from the harm  of the other offense.' "" Ramunas at ¶ 23 (Fischer, J.,  dissenting), quoting Ruff at ¶ 26. As this case concerns  a single victim, we will focus our analysis on whether the  harm from the offenses of felonious assault and  aggravated robbery was separate and identifiable. {¶ 21} Offenses are"" 'not allied offenses of similar import  if neither [offense] is incident to the other.' "" State v.  Bishop, 1st Dist. No. C-220231, 2023-Ohio-947, ¶ 18,  quoting Ruff at ¶ 23. In conducting an analysis of  whether two offenses are allied offenses of similar  import, we must look beyond the statutory elements and  focus on the defendant's conduct. Flood, 2019-Ohio- 2524, at ¶ 29. The evidence at trial, or during a plea and  sentencing hearing, will determine whether the offenses  are of a similar import. Ruff at ¶ 26. {¶ 22} In the present case, first harm occurred when  appellant  committed  the  felonious  assault  by  shooting [*12]  M.B. in the back as he fled down an  alleyway. This harm would have occurred had appellant  elected not to steal the victim's chain. The second harm,  derived from the aggravated robbery, occurred when  appellant stole M.B.'s chain resulting in the loss of  property. These are two, separate and identifiable  harms that preclude merger under R.C. 2941.25(B). {¶ 23} Likewise, the resulting harms are fundamentally  distinct in their import. The word ""import"" in the context  of allied offenses means "" 'offenses of similar  importance,  consequence  and  signification.'  ""  Thundercloud v. Ross Corr. Inst., S.D.Ohio No. 2:20-cv- 4747, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48869, *21 (Mar. 16,  2021), quoting State v. Baer, 67 Ohio felonious assault and aggravated robbery do not merge  under the third theory, which is the basis for appellant's  argument, we decline to resolve the state's alternative  arguments.  No. 22AP-527 8  St.2d 220, 226 (1981). ""[O]ffenses are not allied  Page 5 of 6 offenses of similar import if they are not alike in their  significance and their resulting harm."" Ruff at ¶ 21.  Here, the harm from the felonious assault was a serious  bodily injury, i.e., a bullet wound to M.B.'s back, while  the harm suffered from the aggravated robbery was the  loss of a gold chain. Due to the disparity in the resulting  harm caused by a bullet wound as compared to [*13]   the loss of property, we cannot find that these offenses  are of a similar import. {¶ 24} Our resolution of the first prong in the Ruff  analysis aligns with numerous Ohio courts that have  found the offenses of felonious assault and aggravated  robbery were dissimilar in import and significance. See,  e.g., State v. Gambino, 11th Dist. No. 2021-T-0018,  2022-Ohio-1554, ¶ 49 (finding the ""grave injuries""  inflicted upon the victim during the felonious assault and  the subsequent harm from the aggregated robbery-the  loss of a wallet, keys, and cellphone after appellant shot  the victim-were separate, identifiable harms); State v.  Gillespie, 12th Dist.

(Appellant's Brief at 9.) Appellant cites the  Eighth District Court of Appeals decision in State v.  Sutton, 8th Dist. No. 102300, 2015-Ohio-4074 as  instructive. Appellant acknowledges that while Sutton  did not find the felonious assault and aggravated  robbery merged, the facts of this case fill in the gaps  that were fatal to the analysis in Sutton. A brief review is  instructive. {¶ 26} In Sutton, the defendant lured the victim to her  home for the alleged purpose to have sex for hire but  with the true intention of robbing him by force. Once the  victim entered the home and undressed in the bedroom,  the defendant's boyfriend entered the room. Upon the  boyfriend entering the bedroom, Swanson reached for  his firearm, which was located in his discarded pants.  An altercation ensued over control of a firearm. Id. at ¶  4. During the altercation, the boyfriend obtained control  of the gun and shot the victim from a distance of ten  feet. Sutton then threw the victim's car keys outside and  left the residence with the boyfriend, who was carrying  the victim's firearm. Id. at ¶ 6. Sutton [*16]  was later  found guilty of, among other offenses, aggravated  robbery and felonious assault. The trial court concluded  that the offenses did not merge as they were not allied  offenses. While the Eighth District Court of Appeals  agreed with the trial court that the felonious assault and  aggravated robbery did not merge as the offenses were  committed with a separate animus, it did find that  because the serious physical harm element in both  counts reference the same gun-related injuries suffered  by the victim, the offenses were of a similar import. Id. at  ¶ 60. Page 6 of 6  No. 22AP-527 10  {¶ 27} Upon review, Sutton is distinct from the instant  case in several ways. In Sutton, the shot occurred after  an altercation over control of the gun. Here, the  feloniousassault and resulting harm, i.e., gunshot  wound, occurred after M.B. attempted to evade  appellant by fleeing down an alleyway. Moreover, unlike  Sutton, the indictment in this case was not specific as to  the serious physical harm element in the aggravated  robbery charge. As such, even under appellant's theory  of the case, the possession or brandishing of the firearm  while taking the chain could just as easily form the basis  for an aggravated robbery conviction as [*17]  utilizing  the serious physical harm element, i.e., the gunshot  wound. Finally, Sutton was charged with setting up the  victim while her boyfriend committed the aggravated  robbery. Here, appellant acted alone in shooting M.B.  before stealing his gold chain. As often is the case when  resolving whether offenses are of a similar import, the  R.C. 2941.25 analysis turns on the particular facts,  ""which can lead to exceedingly fine distinctions."" Bailey,  2022-Ohio-4407, at ¶ 11. Given the differing fact  patterns, as well as the abundance of caselaw that has  found felonious assault and aggravated robbery  offenses resulted in separate, identifiable harms,  appellant's reliance on Sutton is misplaced. {¶ 28} Accordingly, we find that the offenses of felonious  assault and aggravated robbery were dissimilar in their  import and significance. Because appellant has failed to  demonstrate all the elements under the Ruff analysis,  we decline to examine the remaining factors. McKnight,  2022-Ohio-591, at ¶ 35 (""We note again that Ruff  directed that if any one of the three prongs is met, the  counts do not merge.""). {¶ 29} Appellant's sole assignment of error is overruled.",0
"United States v. Mujahid, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166391","ORDER ON MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENA [Doc. 350] I. MOTION PRESENTED Defendant Sabil Mujahid, through his counsel, filed four subpoenas in the Spring of 2010 on the Hiland Mountain  Correctional Center pursuant to Rule 17(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The four subpoenas  requested copies of phone calls placed from Hiland to four different phone numbers over a period of about two  years. In September of 2010, attorneys for the State of Alaska Department of Corrections filed this motion to quash the  four subpoenas. They argue that the subpoenas should be quashed because compliance is unreasonable and  oppressive and because they are in the nature of a ""fishing expedition."" They also argue that there are privacy and  security concerns related to releasing the recordings to persons other than law enforcement. It provided the affidavit  of David Beaulieu, the security sergeant at Hiland Mountain Correctional Center, in support of its argument that  compliance with the subpoena will be difficult. Mujahid opposes the motion. In his opposition, he asserts that the subpoena materials requested are relevant, [*3]   admissible at trial, and specific. Specifically, he argues that the requested calls will help Mujahid demonstrate that  the victims were not engaged in prostitution because of force, fraud, or coercion at the hand of Defendant  Mujahid. He did not provide any affidavits in support of his argument that the calls will be relevant and admissible. This Court held a hearing on November 5, 2010. At the hearing, the state again argued that compliance with the  subpoenas will be unreasonable and oppressive. It also argued that Mujahid has not provided any evidence  regarding the relevance of the calls. In addition, the state submitted the affidavit of Garland Armstrong, the Director  of Institutions for the State of Alaska Department of Correction. The affidavit explains that Mr. Garland opposes the  release of recorded phone calls to non-law enforcement. It also explains that law enforcement agents are trained to  make copies of any recorded phone calls, and thus the agents, not DOC staff, should copy any requested phone  calls. He attests in the affidavit that going forward, the DOC, through the State Attorney General's Office, will seek  to quash any subpoenas from non-law enforcement for recorded [*4]  phone calls made from the state's  correctional facilities. The defense argues that they believe the phone calls requested are in fact relevant based on information Defendant  Mujahid provided to them about the phone calls during attorney-client conferences. The defense also argued that  there is no recognized privacy interest in phone calls from Hiland Mountain Correctional Facility. The defense  offered to provide the testimony of Defendant Mujahid in order to sufficiently establish the relevancy of the  requested phone calls. His testimony was taken ex parte and under seal. II. FACTS The following summary is based upon testimony, affidavits and evidence provided to the Court. The four subpoenas  filed on Hiland Mountain Correctional Facility requested the following: 1) Copies of all recorded inmate phone calls from October 1, 2008 to present from the Hiland Mountain  Correctional Facility to Phone No. 868-4893. 2) Copies of all recorded inmate phone calls from June 1, 2009 to present from the Hiland Mountain  Correctional Facility to Phone No. 929-4250. 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166391, *2 Page 3 of 5   3 Copies of all recorded inmate phone calls from October 1, 2008 to present from the Hiland Mountain  Correctional Facility to Phone No. 864-0572. [*5]  4) Copies of all recorded inmate phone calls from October 1, 2008 to October 31, 2009 from the Hiland  Mountain Correctional Facility to Phone No. 562-0971. In addition to the four subpoenas defense counsel sent to Hiland, they also sent out two subpoenas to the  Anchorage Correctional Complex (ACC). The two ACC subpoenas ask for copies of all recorded inmate phone calls  from two specific numbers with a date range of about a year to a year-and-a-half. The jail did not fight the  Anchorage subpoenas and filed 28 CDs with the requested recordings. Based on the affidavit of Mr. Armstrong, the  Director of Institutions for the State of Alska Department of Corrections, such compliance with the subpoenas was a  mistake. The staff at the Anchorage Jail were not supposed to give non-law enforcement copies of inmates' phone  calls but instead were supposed to have referred the matter to the Attorney General's Office. Furthermore, Mr.  Armstrong states that if law enforcement needs copies, the agents are trained to make copies without using staff  time. In the briefing, the state attorneys cite to the affidavit of David Beaulieu, the security sergeant at Hiland in charge of  the recorded calls. Based on [*6]  his affidavit, the subpoenas would result in copying 1,729 calls, which would be a  total of 14,667 minutes of recorded conversations. He asserts copying all those calls to CDs would take 144 hours  of work and would generate 28 CDs. He estimates that given his hourly rate, compliance would cost about $4,700,  which reflects the value of his time. Detailed and specific information regarding conversations which allegedly occurred on the four phone lines was  provided to the Court. Because some of it was provided ex parte and under seal, only a brief summary is provided  here. 868-4893 The Court received direct, sworn evidence that two defendants charged in this case used this phone number at  different times to discuss providing prostitution services with third parties. One defendant discussed splitting the  profits from acts of prostitution with a third party. 929-4250 The Court received direct, sworn evidence that two defendants and one unindicted co-conspirator used this phone  line to discuss providing prostitution services. One defendant discussed setting up prostitution services outside  Anchorage with alleged victims in this case. 864-0572 The Court received only hearsay statements about who [*7]  used this phone and what was said during the  conversations. 562-0971 The Court received direct, sworn evidence that one defendant used this phone number at different times to discuss  providing prostitution services with third parties and alleged victims in this case. III. APPLICABLE LAW 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166391, *4 Page 4 of 5   Rule 17(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, allows for the inspection of materials prior to trial through the  issuance of a subpoena duces tecum. ""A subpoena may order the witness to produce any books, papers,  documents, data, or other objects the subpoena designates. The court may direct the witness to produce the  designated items in court before trial . . . ."" Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1). The court may quash or modify the subpoena  after motion by the receiving party if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive. Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(2).  United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 698, 94 S. Ct. 3090, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1039 (1974). A subpoena duces tecum is intended to expedite the trial by setting a time and place before trial for the inspection  of subpoenaed materials. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 698-99. It is not intended to provide a means of discovery for criminal  cases. Id. at 698. Therefore, a party seeking the evidentiary material before trial generally should explain (1) how  the materials are evidentiary and relevant; (2) why they are not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial  by exercise of due diligence; [*8]  (3) why the party cannot properly prepare for trial without such production in  advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that  the application is made in good faith and is not intended as a general 'fishing expedition.' Id. at 699. The Court in  Nixon explained the party seeking the early production of subpoenaed materials has the burden to show that the  materials sought are (1) relevant; (2) admissible; and (3) specific. Id. at 700. In Nixon, the Supreme Court held that the District Court did not err under Rule 17(c) in allowing the Special  Prosecutor to seek recorded conversations through a subpoena duces tecum. It found that there was a sufficient  likelihood that each of the tapes contained conversations relevant to the offenses charged in the indictment. For  some of the recordings, it based this finding on the fact that the Special Prosecutor offered the sworn testimony or  statements of one or more of the participants in the conversations as to what was said at that time. As for the  remainder of the recordings, the court based this finding on the fact that all the circumstances of the conversations  in context, permit a rational inference that [*9]  at least part of the conversations relate to the offenses charged in  the indictment. It also found that there was a preliminary showing that each of the subpoenaed recordings contained evidence  admissible with respect to the offenses in the indictment despite arguments that the recorded conversations  contained inadmissible hearsay. The Court ruled that most of the recordings contain conversations to which one or  more of the defendants named in the indictment were a party and thus statements by a defendant made during  those conversations would be admissible against that particular defendant. It also concluded that many of the  statements by defendants in those conversations would be admissible against the other co-defendants if made in  furtherance of the conspiracy and statements made by unindicted co-conspirators may be admissible if made in  furtherance of the conspiracy. Declarations by one defendant may also be admissible against other defendants upon a sufficient showing, by  independent evidence, of a conspiracy among one or more other defendants and the declarant and if the  declarations at issue were in furtherance of that conspiracy. The same is true of declarations of co- conspirators [*10]  who are not defendants in the case on trial. Id. at 701. The court also found that the recorded conversations could also be admissible as impeachment evidence against  any defendant who testifies or any other co-conspirator who testifies. Id. But it recognized that it will generally be  insufficient for a person seeking a Rule 17(c) subpoena materials to argue that such materials could be admissible  as impeachment evidence against other, non-defendant or non-coconspirator witnesses. Id. (""Generally, the need  for evidence to impeach witnesses is insufficient to require its production in advance of trial."") IV. DISCUSSION As stated above, in order to defeat this motion to quash, Mujahid must demonstrate that the evidence derived from  the requested calls will be relevant, admissible, and specific. The Court has received evidence that three of the  phone numbers listed on the subpoena were used to conduct discussions about prostitution by defendants,  2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166391, *7 Page 5 of 5   witnesses and victims in this case. Based on this proffered evidence, the Court concludes that the Defendant has  made a sufficient showing that there will be some relevance between the requested phone calls and the case.  Specifically, the calls appear to relate to the [*11]  issue of whether the alleged victims were pushed to prostitution  through the use of force, fraud, or coercion or whether they were willing partners. Based on Nixon, statements made in those conversations by any co-defendant or unindicted co-conspirator could  potentially be admissible if made in furtherance of the conspiracy. The statements could also be admissible for  impeachment of co-defendants or unindicted co-conspirators who testified at trial. Phone calls on three numbers — 868-4893, 929-4250, and 561-0971 — have been shown to be relevant and  specific. Furthermore, is appears that there are admissible potential evidentiary uses for the material requested.",1
"United States v. Carter, 960 F.3d 1007","[*1010]  KOBES, Circuit Judge. This case involves five defendants: Mark Philip Carter II, Darren O. Coleman, Sarina Ann Williams, Ronzell Montez  Williams, and Breeanna Lynae Brown. All were members of a prostitution and sex trafficking conspiracy based in  Iowa. Each pleaded guilty to at least one charged offense, and all appeal their sentences. We affirm. I. Carter was charged with several counts related to conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking and prostitution of five  victims. He pleaded guilty to sex trafficking children. 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1) & (b)(2). Coleman was charged with  several counts relating to conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking and prostitution of two victims. He pleaded  guilty to assisting an individual to engage in prostitution, 18 U.S.C. § 2422(a), and to coercing and enticing [**3]   an individual to engage in prostitution, 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1), (a)(2), & (b)(1). Prior to sentencing, both Carter and Coleman filed extensive objections to their presentence investigation reports.  Carter argued that his PSR contained information about counts dismissed as part of his plea agreement and  wrongly increased his offense level for ""unduly influenc[ing] a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct,""  U.S.S.G. § 2G1.3(b)(2)(B), and for ""the commission of a sex act or sexual contact,"" U.S.S.G. § 2G1.3(b)(4)(A).  Coleman claimed that his Guidelines range was improperly enhanced by additional victims when he had not  pleaded guilty to conduct involving those victims. The district court overruled these objections and made factual  findings before imposing their sentences. Carter and Coleman were sentenced to 175 and 300 months in prison,  respectively. Sarina pleaded guilty as charged to interstate transportation of an individual to engage in prostitution, 18 U.S.C. §  2421, and conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, 18 U.S.C. § 1594(c). The  indictment described the conspiracy as one ""to cause 'Victim 4' to engage in a commercial sex act, in violation of  18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1), (a)(2) & (b)(1)."" Ronzell and Brown also pleaded guilty to charges under § 1594(c), and the indictment described their offenses in  the [**4]  same way as Sarina's except they conspired to traffic a different victim. Based on the conspiracy charges,   Page 6 of 9   the district court set a base offense level of 34 for all three defendants. The district court sentenced Sarina to 135  months in prison, Ronzell to 36 months, and Brown to 50 months. Each was sentenced below their Guidelines  range—Ronzell and Brown significantly so. II. Carter and Coleman both argue that the district court erred when applying enhancements to their offense levels.  HN1[ ] We review the district court's construction and application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings  for clear error. United States v. Cordy, 560 F.3d 808, 817 (8th Cir. 2009). A. Carter argues that the district court erred when it applied an enhancement for exerting ""undue influence"" over   [*1011]  Minor Victim A. See U.S.S.G. § 2G1.3(b)(2)(B). HN2[ ] Whether a defendant unduly influenced a victim  is a factual question subject to clear error review. See United States v. Hagen, 641 F.3d 268, 270 (8th Cir. 2011).  The key question is ""whether a participant's influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor's  behavior."" U.S.S.G. § 2G1.3(b)(2)(B) cmt. 3(B). At sentencing, the evidence showed Carter had physically abused Minor Victim A. In one instance, he told her to  get out of his car and then drove away while she was still getting out, hurting her and causing [**5]  her to fall.  Carter's co-defendant proffered that he saw Carter hit Minor Victim A. Another victim reported seeing pictures of  Minor Victim A's face when her ""eye was black, literally, like black, it was swollen shut; her nose was bleeding"" as a  result of an altercation with Carter. Carter also emotionally abused Minor Victim A. He would get angry with her  when she wouldn't ""go on a date"" he had arranged. Based on this evidence and given that Carter was nine years  older than Minor Victim A, the district court did not clearly err when it found that Carter unduly influenced her and  compromised the voluntariness of her behavior. B. Carter next argues that the district court erred by applying the enhancement for an offense involving ""the  commission of a sex act or sexual contact."" See U.S.S.G. § 2G1.3(b)(4)(A). HN3[ ] The Guidelines authorize a  two-level increase if ""the offense involved the commission of a sex act or sexual contact,"" id., or if the offense was  not one under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(b) and "" involved a commercial sex act,"" U.S.S.G. § 2G1.3(b)(4)(B). Carter does  not dispute that sex acts occurred. Rather, he makes the purely legal argument that the enhancement should not  apply because his offense under § 1591(b)(1) involved commercial sex acts, which he views as only [**6]   enhancing convictions under different statutes. Any other reading, he argues, would reduce the special rule for  commercial sex acts to ""mere surplusage."" We disagree. Section 2G1.3(b)(4)(A) imposes a two-level increase for any offense to which § 2G1.3 applies that  ""involved the commission of a sex act or sexual contact."" Because Carter's offense falls under § 2G1.3 and  involved the commission of a sex act, the enhancement applies. This reading does not render § 2G1.3(b)(4)(B)  ""mere surplusage."" HN4[ ] Where (b)(4)(A) applies to offenses that ""involved the commission of a sex act or  sexual contact,"" (b)(4)(B) applies only to offenses other than those under § 1591(b) but is triggered wherever the  offense ""involved a commercial sex act."" Because it does not require ""the commission of"" a commercial sex act,  the (b)(4)(B) enhancement may be applied, for example, in a case where someone attempts to coerce a minor into  committing a commercial sex act, but no sex act ultimately occurs. See 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b) (prohibiting, subject  to jurisdictional elements, coercion of minors to engage in criminal sexual activities). The district court properly  applied the enhancement here. C. Both Carter and Coleman challenge their enhancements for promoting commercial sex acts with additional [**7]   victims (Victims 1 and 2 in Carter's case, Victims 5 through 9 in Coleman's). They argue that because they did not  plead guilty to any charges involving those additional victims and because they objected to the facts related to  those victims in their PSRs, it was inappropriate for the district court to consider those victims at sentencing. Page 7 of 9    [*1012]  HN5[ ] Both U.S.S.G. § 2G1.3(d), which applies to Carter, and § 2G1.1(d), which applies to Coleman,  prescribe how to account for additional victims. Under these provisions, where the ""relevant conduct of an offense  of conviction"" includes promoting a commercial sex act with respect to additional individuals, whether or not those  individuals are referenced in the count of conviction, each victim is treated as though they were represented by a  separate count."" U.S.S.G. §§ 2G1.1 cmt. 5, 2G1.3 cmt. 6. ""Relevant conduct"" includes ""all acts and omissions  committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant . . . that  occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction."" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)(A). Coleman's additional victims are relevant conduct under this definition. Although the charges relating to these  victims were dismissed, they still may be considered to enhance Coleman's [**8]  sentence. See United States v.  Williams, 879 F.2d 454, 457 (8th Cir. 1989). HN6[ ] The broad language in § 1B1.3 ""indicates the Sentencing  Commission's intent to give courts the discretion to consider a broad range of conduct in making adjustments,"" and  so we have declined to infer a limitation precluding courts from considering conduct related to dismissed counts. Id. The claim that Coleman's enhancement lacked supporting factual findings also fails. The district court made the  findings necessary to apply the enhancements to Coleman and, to the extent that he argues that his plea  agreement forbids the attribution of additional victims, he is mistaken. Coleman's plea agreement left the  Government free to ""make whatever comment and evidentiary offer [it] deem[s] appropriate at the time of  sentencing,"" notwithstanding the dismissal of the counts directly related to these victims. All of the above would apply equally to Carter, but for one important difference between the Guidelines provisions at  issue. Section 2G1.3(d), unlike § 2G1.1(d), specifies that the additional victims used to enhance a sentence under  that section must be minors, and Carter's were not. Carter therefore argues that his sentence should not have been  enhanced under § 2G1.3(d). Carter HN7[ ] first identified this issue in his reply [**9]  brief and so we can decline  to consider it. United States v. Head, 340 F.3d 628, 630 n.4 (8th Cir. 2003). We do so here, because it is clear from  the record that the district court would have given Carter the same sentence regardless of his Guidelines  recommendation. III. Coleman makes two arguments that we cannot consider on appeal. First, he argues that the district court should  not have followed U.S.S.G. § 2G1.1(a)(1) to apply a base offense level of 34 to his conviction for coercing an  individual to engage in prostitution. In his view, this provision sets up an excessive disparity not based on  empirical data between the base level for offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(b)(1) and those under all other statutes. HN8[ ] We do not consider policy arguments about the Guidelines on appeal. United States v. Riehl, 779 F.3d  776, 778 (8th Cir. 2015) (per curiam). District courts are free to vary from the Guidelines based on them, but it is not  an abuse of discretion for a district court to decline to do so. United States v. Sharkey, 895 F.3d 1077, 1082 (8th  Cir. 2018). Second, Coleman argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion for a downward departure for  overrepresented criminal history under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(b)(1). We do not have authority to review that decision  because  [*1013]  the district court recognized it had the power to depart downward and Coleman does not argue it  had an unconstitutional motive for failing to do so. [**10]  United States v. Woods, 596 F.3d 445, 449 (8th Cir.  2010). IV. Finally, both Coleman and Carter argue HN9[ ] the district court committed procedural error at sentencing and  their sentences were substantively unreasonable. We first assess whether the district court committed significant  procedural error. United States v. Williams, 624 F.3d 889, 896 (8th Cir. 2010). If we find none, we review the  substantive reasonableness of the sentences, applying a deferential abuse of discretion standard. United States v.  Stoner, 795 F.3d 883, 884 (8th Cir. 2015). Page 8 of 9   Both Coleman and Carter argue the district court procedurally erred by relying but never ruling on objected to facts  in their PSRs. See United States v. Feemster, 572 F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir. 2009) (en banc) (A district court commits  procedural error if it sentences ""based on clearly erroneous facts.""). Nothing in the record supports this argument.  The district court made factual findings at Carter's sentencing that supported its conclusion that he behaved in a  ""depraved"" way and that society needed protection from him. Carter has failed to identify any moment during his  sentencing when the district court relied on still-disputed facts. See Carter Sent. Tr. 33. The record is even clearer  in Coleman's case. The district court overruled all his objections to the PSR and found that it was ""factually accurate  as to all material matters"" and sentenced him based on that finding. Coleman [**11]  Sent. Tr. 87-88. Coleman claims that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to account for his  history and characteristics and considered his co-defendants' actions in setting his sentence. HN10[ ] A sentence  may be substantively unreasonable if a district court fails to consider a relevant factor that deserves significant  weight, gives significant weight to an inappropriate factor, or commits a clear error of judgment in weighing the  appropriate factors. Stoner, 795 F.3d at 884. Again, Coleman's argument finds no support in the record. In fact, the  court considered each § 3553(a) factor, specifically mentioned Coleman's criminal history, and grappled with the  ""astounding depravity"" of Coleman's conduct. We also note that Coleman's sentence is below his Guidelines range.  It is ""nearly inconceivable"" that it could be substantively unreasonable. United States v. Lazarski, 560 F.3d 731, 733  (8th Cir. 2009). V. Sarina, Ronzell, and Brown all object to the base offense level of 34 for their convictions for conspiracy to engage in  sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1594(c). We review the proper construction  of the Guidelines de novo. Cordy, 560 F.3d at 817. HN11[ ] Conspiracies punished under § 1594(c) are not covered by a specific offense Guideline, so we begin  with [**12]  the catch-all provision at U.S.S.G. § 2X1.1. Section 2X1.1(a) sets the base offense level for a  conspiracy conviction not covered by a specific  [*1014]  Guideline as the ""base offense level from the guideline for  the [underlying] substantive offense."" The indictment lists the underlying substantive offense for all three of these  defendants as 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1), (a)(2), & (b)(1). HN12[ ] For those offenses, we refer to § 2G1.1, which  prescribes a base offense level of 34 ""if the offense of conviction is 18 U.S.C. § 1591(b)(1)"" and 14 if ""otherwise.""  Because the underlying substantive offense for all three defendants is § 1591(b)(1) and the applicable Guidelines  provision (§ 2X1.1) directs that we treat these defendants as though they were convicted under § 1591(b)(1), we  conclude the district court correctly assigned all three of these defendants base offense levels of 34. See United  States v. Sims, 957 F.3d 362, 363 (3d Cir. 2020) (following the same steps to reach a base offense level of 34). The defendants suggest otherwise. Noting that § 2G1.1 directs that the base offense level for any convictions other  than those under § 1591(b)(1) should be 14, they argue they should have received the lower base offense level for  their convictions under § 1594(c). This argument only works if we read § 2G1.1 in isolation, but we cannot do that.  Section 2G1.1 is not the applicable Guideline for convictions under § 1594(c). We only get there [**13]  through §  2X1.1, so we must read § 2G1.1 in light of § 2X1.1. Even if that were not the case, the specific guidance from §  2X1.1 comports with the general rule that ""[u]nless otherwise specified, an express direction to apply a particular  factor only if the defendant was convicted of a particular statute includes the determination of the offense level  where the defendant was convicted of conspiracy . . . in respect to that particular statute."" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3, cmt. 7.  Following both general interpretive principles for the Guidelines and the specific provisions at issue here, the district  court assigned the correct base offense levels.      Page 9 of 9   The defendants rely on United States v. Wei Lin, 841 F.3d 823 (9th Cir. 2016) to support their reading of § 2G1.1. In  Wei Lin, the Ninth Circuit held that the base offense level of 34 applied only in cases where defendants were  subject to the statutory 15-year mandatory minimum sentence described in § 1591(b)(1). Id. at 826. Because  conspiracies under § 1594(c) are not subject to those minimums, the Wei Lin rule prevents any conspiracy  conviction from receiving a base offense level of 34. We do not believe Wei Lin should govern our decision here. See Sims, 957 F.3d at 364 (noting that applying Wei  Lin ""lead[s] to absurd results""). The Ninth Circuit arrived at its rule based on what it believed was ""most likely [**14]   what the Sentencing Commission intended."" Id. at 827. HN13[ ] Because the base offense level of 34 in §  2G1.1(a)(1) was created in response to Congress adding the 15-year mandatory minimum for trafficking victims  under 14 years old, the Wei Lin court concluded that ""the Commission likely intended § 2G1.1(a)(1) to apply only  when the defendant received a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence."" Id. Compelling as this history might be,  ""[w]hen construing the Guidelines, we look first to the plain language, and where that is unambiguous we need look  no further."" United States v. Bah, 439 F.3d 423, 427 (8th Cir. 2006). And here, where the applicable Guidelines  provision directs us to apply the provisions of § 2G1.1(a)(1) as though these defendants were convicted of violating  § 1591(b)(1), we find no ambiguity.  [*1015]  * * * Finding no error in the defendants' sentences, we affirm. [**15]",1
"People v. De Jesus Hernandez, 2023 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 7292","[*1] APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of  San Bernardino County, Tony Raphael, Judge. Affirmed  with directions to correct the sentencing minute orders  and abstracts of judgment. Patricia L. Brisbois, under appointment by the Court of  Appeal, for Defendant and Appellant. Rob Bonta, Attorney General, Lance E. Winters, Chief  Assistant Attorney General, Charles C. Ragland,  Assistant Attorney General, and Christopher P. Beesley  and Britton B. Lacy, Deputy Attorneys General, for  Plaintiff and Respondent. INTRODUCTION Jose De Jesus Hernandez was convicted of sexually  abusing his stepdaughter and two nieces over a period  of years and was initially sentenced to serve a prison  term of 30 years to life, consecutive to 8 years and 8  months. In his first appeal, Hernandez successfully  argued, and the People conceded, that the trial court  imposed an unauthorized sentence of 15-years-to-life  for his conviction on count 4 (continuous sexual abuse  of a child in violation of Penal Code1section 288.5,  subd. (a)) because Hernandez committed that offense  from September 1996 through September 2001, before  the Legislature amended section 667.61, subdivision (c)  to add section 288.5 as a One Strike offense. The  matter was remanded for resentencing on count 4 without application of the [*2]  One Strike Law (  667.61) and for correction of clerical errors in the  sentencing minute order and abstracts of judgment.  (See People v. Hernandez (Sept. 20, 2022, D080015)  [nonpub. opn.] (Hernandez).) In this second appeal, Hernandez claims the sentence  on count 4 (mid-term of 12 years, consecutive) must  again be reversed and also seeks the correction of trial  court records as directed in Hernandez as well as  subsequent court records. After initially claiming the  resentencing violated ex post facto prohibitions based  on an incomplete and inaccurate legislative history of  section 667.6, Hernandez now concedes the trial court  had discretion and the authority to impose the sentence  on count 4 pursuant to the applicable version of section  667.6, but he raises two additional arguments in his  supplemental letter brief: (1) the record does not clearly  show the trial court understood the applicable version of  section 667.6 did not mandate a full term consecutive  sentence, and (2) the trial court failed to  1 All further statutory references are to the Penal Code.   2  provide a statement of reasons for its election to  sentence Hernandez under section 667.6 in lieu of  section 1170.1. Page 2 of 5 We reject Hernandez's challenges to the sentence and  affirm the trial court's judgment with directions [*3]  for  the correction of the trial court record. RELEVANT BACKGROUND After a jury convicted Hernandez on all four counts of  child sexual abuse in 2021, the trial court sentenced him  to the upper term of 8 years on count 3, a consecutive  term of 8 months on count 2 (one-third of the midterm),  and consecutive sentences of 15 years to life on counts  1 and 4, for a total indeterminate term of 30 years to life.  Following remand in Hernandez, the trial court  scheduled a resentencing hearing for February 1, 2023,  where the trial court imposed an indeterminate prison  term of 15 years to life and a determinate term of 18  years and 8 months to be followed by a lifetime period  of parole with a total credit of 2,010 days. On count 4,  Hernandez was sentenced to the midterm of 12 years,  consecutive, for his continuous sexual abuse of Jane  Doe 3 in violation of section 288.5, subdivision (a) from  September 1996 through September 2001. Hernandez  timely appealed. In this second appeal, Hernandez initially argued that  the sentence on count 4 violated ex post facto  prohibitions based on the erroneous assumption that  section 288.5 had not been added to section 667.6 as  an offense for which a full-term consecutive sentence  was permitted until 2006. The People conceded [*4]   error despite this faulty premise, and both parties  agreed the matter should be remanded for the  correction of the February 1, 2023 resentencing minute  order and the February 6, 2023 abstracts of judgment in  addition to corrections to previous court records as  directed in Hernandez. On October 23, 2023, we issued an order requesting  supplemental briefing to address Assembly Bill 2212  (Stats. 1989, ch. 1402, 4, 7) 3 whereby  the  Legislature  enacted  section  288.5  (continuous sexual abuse) and amended Penal Code  section 667.6, subdivision (c), to include Penal Code  section 288.5 as an offense that could trigger an  increased prison term. Both parties acknowledged in  their respective supplemental letter briefs that the  Legislature had amended section 667.6 to include  continuous sexual abuse of a child in violation of section  288.5 prior to the commission of the count 4 offense,  and that the trial court had discretion to impose a full- term consecutive sentence. However, Hernandez  maintains reversal is still warranted. As discussed below, we conclude (1) the trial court  properly exercised its discretion to impose a lawful  sentence, and (2) Hernandez forfeited his claim that the  trial court failed to provide a statement of reasons for  sentencing him pursuant to section 667.6 in lieu of  section 1170.1. We therefore affirm the judgment and  direct the [*5]  trial court to correct the relevant trial  court records. DISCUSSION A. The Applicable Version of Penal Code Section 667.6.  Section 667.6 was enacted by the Legislature in 1979 to  provide longer prison terms for certain sex offenders  than otherwise permitted under section 1170.1. (Stats.  1979, ch. 944, 10, p. 3258.) In 1989, the Legislature  enacted section 288.5 (continuous sexual abuse) and  amended Penal Code section 667.6, subdivision (c), to  include Penal Code section 288.5 as an offense that  could trigger an increased prison term. (Stats. 1989, ch.  1402,  7.) Subdivision (c) of the applicable version of section  667.6, which was in effect from 1996 through 2001  when Hernandez committed the count 4 offense, states  in part: ""In lieu of the term provided in Section 1170.1, a  full, 4 separate, and consecutive term may be imposed for  each violation of . . . Section 288.5 . . . . If the term is imposed  consecutively pursuant to this subdivision, it shall be  served consecutively to any other term of imprisonment,  and shall commence from the time the person would  otherwise have been released from imprisonment. The  term shall not be included in any determination pursuant  to Section 1170.1. Any other term imposed subsequent  to that term shall not be merged therein but shall  commence at the time the person otherwise would have  been released from prison."" In 2006, the Legislature made substantive and  organizational amendments to section 667.6. (Stats.  2006, ch. 337, 32.) In the current version of the  statute, [*6]  ""[c]ontinuous sexual abuse of a child, in  violation of Section 288.5"" is listed in subdivision (e)(6)  as one of the offenses for which the trial court ""shall""  Page 3 of 5 impose ""[a] full, separate, and consecutive term"" for  each violation of section 288.5. ( 667.6, subd. (e)(6).) B. The Trial Court Was Fully Aware of the Scope of its  Discretion. Although it is now undisputed that the trial  court had discretion to impose a full, separate, and consecutive term for count  4 pursuant to subdivision (c) of the operative version of  section 667.6, Hernandez argues in his supplemental  letter brief that the sentence is still subject to reversal  because it is unclear from the record whether the trial  court mistakenly relied on the current version of section  667.6, which mandates a full term consecutive sentence  for violations of section 288.5, and posits the trial court  did not realize it had discretion to not impose a full term  consecutive sentence. ""The general rule is that a trial court is presumed to  have been aware of and followed the applicable law.""  (People v. Mosley (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 489, 496.) Yet,  when a sentencing court was unaware of the full scope  of its 5 discretionary powers at the time the defendant was  sentenced, ""the appropriate remedy is to remand for  resentencing unless the record 'clearly indicate[s]' that  the trial court would have reached the [*7]  same  conclusion 'even if it had been aware that it had such  discretion.' "" (People v. Gutierrez (2014) 58 Cal.4th  1354, 1391.) Our review of the record reveals the trial court was fully  aware of its discretionary power to impose either a  concurrent or consecutive sentence despite references  to subdivision (e)(6) of the current version of the statute  during the resentencing hearing. Before pronouncing  the sentence, the trial court unequivocally stated: ""The  Court acknowledges that it has discretion to sentence  concurrent. But it's choosing to sentence consecutive in  this  case.""  (Italics  added.)  This  express  acknowledgment by the trial court of its authority to  sentence  Hernandez  either  concurrently  or  consecutively makes clear the trial court exercised  informed discretion when it resentenced Hernandez. Furthermore, the record shows the trial court would  have sentenced Hernandez consecutively in any event.  In addition to informing the parties that it intended to  impose the maximum sentence possible at the initial  sentencing hearing (see Hernandez, supra, D080015),  the trial court informed the parties of its intention to  sentence Hernandez consecutively in chambers prior to  the resentencing hearing and repeated its intention  twice prior to its pronouncement [*8]  of the sentence.  On this record, we conclude the trial court properly  exercised its discretion when it imposed a consecutive  sentence on count 4 in accordance with the applicable  version of section 667.6. Nor was there any violation of state or federal ex post  facto clauses. (See People v. Simmons (2012) 210  Cal.App.4th 778, 796-797.) The initial ex post facto  argument raised in Hernandez's opening brief was  based on the 6 erroneous  premise  that  ""a  full-term  consecutive  sentence for the violation of section 288.5, subdivision  (a) in count 4 was not available before 2006"" and  therefore fatally flawed. Hernandez attempted to  resurrect the ex post facto argument in his supplemental  letter brief by claiming ""the trial court expressly relied on  a later version of 667.6"" that was not in effect at the time  the offense in count 4 was committed. Not only is this  argument belied by the record as previously discussed,  but Respondent aptly argues that no ex post facto  violation occurred ""because section 667.6 did, in fact,  provide an increased penalty for continuous sexual  abuse at the time appellant committed his continuing  offense[.]"" C. Hernandez Forfeited any Error Based on a Deficient  Statement ofReasons for Sentencing Pursuant to  Section 667.6. Prior to its pronouncement of the sentence, the trial  court offered the following statement of [*9]  reasons for  imposing consecutive terms in this case: ""I find that the  crimes  and  their  objectives  were  predominantly  independent of each other. The crimes involved  separate acts of violence, or threats of violence, and the  crimes were committed at different times with separate places rather than being committed so closely in time  and place as to indicate a single period of aberrant  behavior. Certainly from the testimony at trial, this is not  a case of aberrant behavior. I do find that any one of  these factors by itself justifies the imposition of  consecutive sentences or consecutive terms in this  case."" The trial court informed the parties of the sentence it  intended to impose at a chambers conference prior to  the  resentencing  hearing  and  provided  counsel  Page 4 of 5 adequate opportunity to object at the hearing both  before and after it stated its reasons and pronounced  the sentence. Defense counsel did not raise any  objection or seek a separate statement of reasons  regarding 7 the trial court's election to sentence Hernandez pursuant  to section 667.6 in lieu of section 1170.1. Relying on People v. Belmontes (1983) 34 Cal.3d 335,  347-348, Hernandez argues for the first time in his  supplemental brief that the trial court failed to include a  statement of reasons for electing [*10]  to sentence him  under section 667.6 instead of section 1170.1. By failing  to object on this ground in the trial court, Hernandez  forfeited the issue on appeal. (See People v. Scott  (2015) 61 Cal.4th 363, 406.) D. Clerical Errors Must be Corrected. Hernandez provided the following directions for the  correction of various clerical errors in the sentencing  minute order and abstracts of judgment: At sentencing, the trial court imposed three separate  victim restitution orders under section 1202.4 in the  amounts of $2,654.95, $375, and $225, for a total of  $3,254.95 in victim restitution. However, the sentencing  minute order and indeterminate abstract of judgment  state that Hernandez is to pay victim restitution in four  specific amounts: $3,254.95, $2,654.95, $375, and  $225. Both parties agree the first enumerated amount of  $3,254.95, which is the total of the other three amounts  of victim restitution when combined, is erroneous.  Accordingly,  the  sentencing  minute  order  and  indeterminate abstract of judgment shall be corrected to  comport with the oral pronouncement of judgment.  [Citation.] Additionally,  the  indeterminate  and  determinate  abstracts of judgment incorrectly state 2010 as the year  Hernandez committed all of his crimes. Based on the  charges in the information, evidence [*11]  at trial, jury  instructions, and verdicts, the parties agree count 1  occurred between 2010 to 2016; count 2 occurred  between 2016 to 2017, count 3 occurred between 1994  to 1995, and count 4 occurred between 8 1996 to 2001. The abstracts of judgment shall be  corrected accordingly. [Citation.] At the outset of the resentencing hearing following  remand, the trial court referred to the remittitur issued in  Hernandez, acknowledged that the corrections would be  made as directed, and requested ""the clerk's office""  make the corrections. However, it appears the trial court  clerk has yet to make the corrections as previously  directed, and the parties also correctly observed that the  February 1, 2023 minute order and the February 6,  2023 abstracts of judgment also require correction. On February 1, 2023, the trial court made the following  restitution order: ""The Court orders restitution - orders  the defendant to pay restitution under 1202.4 to be  collected by the Department of Corrections and  Rehabilitation  as  follows:  $2,654.95  to  Victim  Compensation Board, case number A17[-]6655906;  $375 to Victim Compensation Board, case number  A17[-]6667869; and $225 to Victim Compensation  Board, case number A17[-] [*12]  6667919. The Court  will continue to reserve on victim restitution."" The  February 1, 2023 minute order again separately lists the  ""$3,254.95"" total to be collected in addition to the  separate amounts comprising the total. The February 6,  2023 indeterminate and determinate abstracts of  judgment similarly reflect the restitution error as well as  the errors identified in Hernandez. The trial court must ensure the prompt correction of  these records. DISPOSITION The February 1, 2023 sentence is affirmed. The trial  court is directed to correct the trial court records as  stated in this opinion, including the ""**Corrected** [¶] Minute Order"" dated September 20,  2021, page 2, and the minute order dated February 1,  2023, page 2, to remove ""$3,254.95."" The 9 trial court is instructed to issue amended abstracts of  judgment reflecting the sentence entered on February 1,  2023, correcting the years the count 4 crimes were  committed (1996-2001), and removing ""$3,254.95"" from  the restitution amounts listed. The trial court shall  forward the amended abstracts of judgment to the  California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. CASTILLO, J. WE CONCUR: DO, Acting P. J.

In short,  Rule 403 requires the court to ""make a 'conscientious assessment' of whether unfair prejudice substantially  outweighs probative value"" with regard to each piece of proffered evidence. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d at 160 (quoting  United States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 110 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam)). II. DISCUSSION The court addresses each of Raniere's requests in turn. A. Applicability of Rule 412   Page 3 of 7   Rule 412 prohibits a party, in a criminal proceeding ""involving alleged sexual misconduct,"" from introducing ""(1)  evidence offered to prove that a victim engaged in other [*4]  sexual behavior; or (2) evidence offered to prove a  victim's sexual predisposition."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(a). In his letter regarding Rule 412, Raniere urges the court to find that ""the vast majority of the evidence that the  government is concerned about in the context of a Rule 412 analysis is admissible."" (Raniere Letter at 1.) Raniere  argues that, among other things, the evidence he seeks to introduce falls outside the scope of Rule 412 because it  does not concern ""other"" sexual behavior or relate to victims' alleged ""sexual predispositions,"" but is instead  ""intrinsic to the offense charged."" (Id. at 2.) Specifically, Raniere anticipates introducing ""evidence from multiple  witnesses that [the government's] witnesses were interested in pursuing sexually oriented discussions and often a  sexual relationship with Raniere, and that they not only consented to such a relationship but also eagerly pursued  it."" (Id. at 2.) Such evidence would include ""not only sexual contact between Raniere and the witness at issue, but  also conversations, communications and other interactions between Raniere and these women concerning sex,  intimacy and other related issues,"" which ""gave Raniere ample reason to believe that he was engaging in  consensual sexual relations."" (Id.) For example, [*5]  Raniere might introduce evidence showing that ""one witness  expressed a desire to be more comfortable in certain sexual situations"" (id. at 2) and that Raniere engaged in  ""certain conduct because it would help this person overcome certain limitations, fears or concerns of which Raniere  was aware"" (id. at 3). Such evidence, Raniere contends, ""is absolutely essential and admissible because it is the  whole reason behind Raniere's decision to engage in certain conduct that the government now claims is criminal in  nature."" (Id. at 3.) The Government does not address Raniere's argument with respect to the scope of Rule 412. In United States v. Rivera, a case involving sex trafficking and forced labor charges, the Second Circuit held that  the district court had not erred by precluding ""[e]vidence of victims' prior acts of commercial sex"" because such  evidence was ""irrelevant to whether those victims were coerced into working as prostitutes [by the defendants].""  799 F.3d 180, 185 (2d Cir. 2015). The court noted approvingly, however, that the district court had not prevented  the defendants from cross-examining the victims with respect to whether the defendants had coerced them into  engaging in acts of prostitution: Even without pursuing the precluded line [*6]  of inquiry, [defendants] effectively cross-examined the victims  and argued that they engaged in prostitution for pecuniary reasons—not because they were forced. The  testimony that some of the victims quit working and subsequently returned or chose to work at the bars  because they earned more money than they would at their next-best employment option could have been  received by the jury as suggesting consent. Thus, the testimony elicited by [defendants'] counsel, as  emphasized by Rivera's counsel in closing, allowed [defendants] to contend that the victims freely consented to  engage in prostitution. Because [defendants] were able to argue that the victims voluntarily engaged in  prostitution, the court's exclusion of any evidence concerning the victims' prior engagement in a sexualized  business did not prejudice [defendants] with respect to their sex trafficking or forced labor charges. Id. at 186. Here, evidence that Raniere's alleged victims had engaged in sexual acts prior to or ""other"" than the ones on which  Raniere's criminal charges are based, or that they had a certain ""sexual predisposition"" to engage in such acts,  would likely be irrelevant to the question of whether they were coerced into [*7]  engaging in sexual acts with  Raniere. Such evidence would certainly come within the scope of Rule 412. However, based on his representations  (see Raniere Letter), the court does not understand Raniere to be seeking leave to introduce such evidence.  Indeed, he does not appear to intend to argue that ""because the victim previously consented to have sex—for love  or money—her claims of coercion should not be believed."" Rivera, 799 F.3d at 186 (explaining that the purpose of  Rule 412 is to preclude such arguments). Instead, Raniere appears to be seeking permission to introduce evidence  that is intrinsic to and purportedly undermines the claims of coercion that are at the heart of many of the charged     Page 4 of 7   crimes. In other words, he seeks to introduce evidence not of other sexual acts or behavior, but of Raniere's and  the alleged victims' behavior in engaging in the sexual acts at issue here. Such evidence is outside the scope of  Rule 412. See Advisory Committee Notes, 1994 Amendments, Fed. R. Evid. 412 (noting that ""[t]he word 'other' is  used to suggest some flexibility in admitting evidence 'intrinsic' to the alleged sexual misconduct""); 23 Charles Alan  Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 5374.1 (2d ed. April 2019 update) (observing that ""[t]he  sexual behavior excluded by Rule 412(a)(1) must [*8]  be . . . 'other' than the 'alleged sexual misconduct' that brings  a given civil or criminal proceeding involving that misconduct within the scope of Rule 412""); see also United States  v. Brown, No, 3-CR-17-396, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42603, 2019 WL 1227427, at *2 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 15, 2019)  (allowing sex trafficking defendant to ask victim witnesses about ""other prostitution acts that occurred during the  time period charged in the indictment, as they are relevant to the issue of force or coercion,"" but precluding him  from introducing evidence or cross-examining victim witnesses regarding such acts engaged in before or after the  time period charged in the indictment). The Government may of course challenge particular evidentiary proffers or  lines of cross-examination at trial. B. Evidence of Abortions With respect to evidence regarding abortions, Raniere makes three motions in the alternative, requesting that the  court: (1) preclude the Government from introducing any testimony or evidence of abortions; (2) preclude the  Government from introducing any testimony or evidence concerning abortions unless the relevant witness testifies;  or (3) require the Government to redact abortion records. (Mots. at 1.) The court takes these motions in turn. 1. Exclusion of All Evidence of [*9]  Abortions In support of his motion to preclude ""all evidence, references and testimony concerning abortions,"" Raniere  advances several arguments under Federal Rules of Evidence 401, 402, and 403. (Raniere Mem. in Supp. of Mots.  (""Mem."") at 7.) For the' following reasons, Raniere's motion to exclude all evidence of abortions is DENIED. The  Government is, however, DIRECTED to alert the court and defense counsel within 48 hours of any expected  testimony or the admission of documentary evidence regarding abortion. a. Relevance The Government contends that evidence of abortions is relevant to prove that Raniere was having sex with the  individuals who had abortions and to establish the timing of those sexual relationships, as well as ""Raniere's control  over members of his enterprise and the lengths to which members of the enterprise would go to placate his  desires."" (Gov't Resp. to Def. Mots. (""Gov't Resp."") at 3-4.) Raniere argues that the Government should not be  permitted to argue that abortion histories of Raniere's alleged victims are relevant to the enterprise because the  Government failed to reference such evidence in their motion to admit enterprise evidence. (Id. at 3-4.) The court  agrees with the Government that evidence of [*10]  abortions meets the ""very low"" threshold for relevance, see  White, 692 F.3d at 246 (quoting Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d at 176), and finds that the omission of such evidence from the  enterprise motion is not a bar to its potential introduction at trial so long as it is not otherwise inadmissible. b. Cumulative Raniere further argues that evidence of abortions is not necessary to prove sexual relationships because he will  concede at trial that he had sexual relationships with many women, including all women for whom the government  has abortion records. (Mem. at 4; see Gov't Resp. at 4; Reply at 2-3.) Although he labels this a challenge on  relevance grounds, it appears to be an argument under Rule 403 that the evidence, while arguably relevant, is  needlessly cumulative. In any case, the Government objects to excluding evidence on these grounds given that  Raniere has not specified how such a concession will come into evidence—whether by stipulation or otherwise.  (Gov't Resp. at 4.) Moreover, Raniere does not state that he will stipulate to the timing of such relationships. (Id.)  For example, the Government states that it is unlikely that Raniere will stipulate to having had a sexual relationship  with Jane Doe 2 while she was a minor. The Government [*11]  contends that evidence that she had an abortion  when she was eighteen years old would therefore be relevant to and probative of the Government's contention that  he had a sexual relationship with her before that time. (Id.) The court agrees that evidence of abortions meets the  Page 5 of 7   threshold for relevance and does not appear at this time to be needlessly cumulative. Of course, Raniere remains  free to object at trial to the admission of such evidence if, in the context of other evidence introduced at trial, it  becomes, for example, ""needlessly [] cumulative."" See Fed. R. Evid. 403. c. Prejudice Raniere also argues that introduction of evidence pertaining to abortions would be unduly prejudicial and would  serve ""solely [to] inflame the jury."" (Mem. at 4.) He expects that the evidence concerning abortions will be  inflammatory because abortion is ""one of the most contested issues facing this country;"" [TEXT REDACTED BY  THE COURT] (Def. Mem. at 4-5.) Raniere highlights certain medical records pertaining to an abortion obtained by  Jane Doe 2 that Raniere contends the Government seeks to admit. (Raniere Reply in Further Supp. of Mots.  (""Reply"") at 2.) Such records apparently include images of pregnancy tests and [*12]  sonogram photos. (Id.) The Government responds that it ""recognize[s] the sensitivities regarding abortion and intends to offer only limited  testimony and records regarding abortion."" (Gov't Resp. at 4.) [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] (Id.) It also  plans to take to take steps to protect the privacy of individuals who received abortions. (Id.) Finally, the Government  offers to alert the court and defense counsel within 24 hours of any expected testimony or evidence regarding  abortion to address outstanding issues. (Id.) The court acknowledges the sensitivity of the subject of abortions and agrees that the Government must be careful  to present any such evidence in a circumscribed and thoughtful manner to avoid any unfair prejudice to Raniere. To  that end, the court adopts with modification the Government's suggestion for how to proceed. So that ""questions of .  . . potential prejudice may be resolved in proper context,"" Hennessy, 840 F. Supp. 2d at 554 (quoting Viada, 2005  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32854, 2005 WL 3435111, at *1), the Government is DIRECTED to alert the court and defense  counsel within 48 hours of any expected testimony or the admission of documentary evidence regarding abortion. d. Undue Delay Raniere also argues that the Government should not be permitted to argue that ""Raniere [*13]  unduly influenced []  women into receiving abortions"" because the defense will be ""forced to introduce contradictory evidence"" showing  that women obtained abortions voluntarily, which will ""significantly delay trial and effectively create a mini-trial over  irrelevant collateral evidence."" (Mem. at 4-5; 6-7.) At this time, the court does not agree that the introduction of  otherwise admissible evidence pertaining to abortions will unduly delay trial. See Fed. R. Evid. 403. 2. Request to Preclude Evidence or Testimony Regarding Abortions Unless the Woman Who Received the Abortion  Testifies If the court does determine that evidence and testimony regarding abortions is admissible, Raniere asks that such  evidence and testimony be allowed only if the woman who had the alleged abortion testifies to provide ""context and  explanation."" (Mem. at 7.) [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] At this stage, however, the court cannot make an informed ruling. The court  therefore RESERVES JUDGMENT on the admissibility of testimony regarding abortions until trial, at which point the  testimony sought and the purpose for which is offered can be properly assessed in context. See [*14]  Wechsler v.  Hunt Health Sys., Ltd., 381 F. Supp. 2d 135, 140 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (""A court considering a motion in limine may  reserve judgment until trial, so that the motion is placed in the appropriate factual context."" (citation omitted)). 3. Redaction of Abortion Records      Page 6 of 7   Raniere also moves to preclude the government from introducing a statement in Jane Doe 2's medical records on  the ground that it is impermissible hearsay as it is unrelated to medical treatment. (Mem. at 8-9.) [TEXT  REDACTED BY THE COURT] [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] The court thus RESERVES JUDGMENT on the admissibility of the notation in Jane Doe 2's medical file until after  the Government has had an opportunity to lay this foundation and place these records in their full context. At that  time, Raniere may of course object on the ground that the notation's purported ambiguity is likely to cause unfair  prejudice such that its probative value is substantially outweighed, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 403. C. Evidence of Clare Bronfman's Contributions to a Defense Trust Raniere also moves to exclude any evidence that Clare Bronfman created and funded an irrevocable trust (the  ""Trust"") that paid the legal fees for her co-defendants in this case (including Raniere). [*15]  (Mem. at 9-11.)  According to the Government, this evidence is relevant as ""direct evidence of the Enterprise, the relationship  between and among the defendants and co-conspirators, and of Bronfman's status within the Enterprise."" (Gov't  Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Admit Enterprise Evid. (Dkt. 414) at 38.) Raniere makes three arguments for why this evidence should be excluded. (Mem. at 9-11.) First, he avers that the  Trust cannot be direct evidence of the Enterprise because it was established in May 2018, while the alleged  Enterprise ceased to exist in March 2018 (according to the Indictment). (Mem. at 9-10.) As the Government  observes, however, the Enterprise did not necessarily end as of the date identified in the indictment. (Gov't Resp. at  5-6.) ""A RICO conspiracy continues until the objectives of the conspiracy are either accomplished or abandoned.""  United States v. Eppolito, 543 F.3d 25, 48 (2d Cir. 2008) (alteration adopted) (quoting United States v. Spero, 331  F.3d 57, 61 (2d Cir. 2003)). ""Where the government has presented sufficient evidence to show a conspiracy that  has continuing purposes or goals, the burden is on the defendant to prove that the conspiracy was terminated or  that he took affirmative steps to withdraw."" Eppolito, 543 F.3d at 49. Accordingly, the Government may introduce                   Page 7 of 7   evidence of the Trust [*16]  to show that the conspiracy continued even after Bronfman and her co-defendants were  indicted. Second, Raniere contends that the Trust evidence unfairly suggests that his lawyers acted improperly. (Mem. at  10.) The court disagrees. There is no suggestion Raniere's counsel has done anything wrong. Further, the  Government does not plan to show that any of Raniere's current lawyers accepted Trust funds; the evidence is  meant only to establish the existence and continuance the Enterprise. (Gov't Resp. at 6.) Third, Raniere insists that admission of the Trust evidence will require him to submit evidence concerning the  Trust's bona fides, creating a ""mini-trial on an entirely collateral issue"" and prejudicing Raniere's counsel. (Mem. at  10-11.) Again, the court disagrees. The bona fides of the Trust and the lawyers involved with it are not relevant; the  Trust evidence is meant only to show a continuing relationship between Raniere, Bronfman, and the other members  of the Enterprise. (See Gov't Resp. at 6.) To the extent issues concerning the Trust's bona fides become relevant,  these issues can be addressed in a stipulation. (See id.) Therefore, Raniere's motion to exclude [*17]  the Trust evidence is DENIED.",1
"United States v. Lucious, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14871","MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendant Keron Lucious' Objections to Revised PSR and Supplemental  Sentencing Memorandum. Doc. 520. The Court held a sentencing hearing on January 26, 2022. Doc. 513. At that  hearing, the Court addressed Mr. Lucious' objections, accepted Mr. Lucious' Amended Plea Agreement and  sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 60 months, followed by a five-year period of supervised release. In this  Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Court will provide further context for its decision. BACKGROUND On August 19, 2021, Mr. Lucious pled guilty to Count 1 of a one-count Superseding Information charging him with  Conspiracy to Commit Sex Trafficking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1594(c). Doc. 418; Doc. 415. His Amended Plea  Agreement recommends a sentencing range of five years to twelve years imprisonment under Federal Rule of  Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C). Doc. 418 at ¶ 11. The Court will accept the plea agreement; therefore, the  agreement's recommended sentencing [*2]  range is binding. Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C). Mr. Lucious raised two objections which the Court addressed at his sentencing hearing. See generally Doc. 520.  First, Mr. Lucious objected to a two-level ""vulnerable victim"" enhancement assessed under U.S.S.G. § 3A1.1(b)(1).  Doc. 520 at 1-6. His objection was granted. Therefore, Mr. Lucious' total offense level was revised from 33 to 31.  Page 2 of 17   Mr. Lucious is in criminal history category I; therefore, his final advisory guideline sentencing range is 108 to 135  months. Second, Mr. Lucious objected that submitting to a sex offender assessment while on supervised release was  unnecessary. Doc. 520 at 6-7. His objection was denied; however, the Court granted his request in the alternative  that the assessment and all supporting testing or documentation would be provided to defense counsel. Id. at 7. Having accepted the plea agreement and addressed Mr. Lucious' objections, the Court sentenced Mr. Lucious to a  term of imprisonment of 60 months, followed by a five-year period of supervised release. At the time he was  sentenced, Mr. Lucious had been in custody for 1,387 days. Doc. 490-1 at 1. DISCUSSION I. Objections A. Objection to the Vulnerable Victim Enhancement Under U.S.S.G. § 3A1.1(b)(1) First, Mr. Lucious objected to a two-level [*3]  ""vulnerable victim"" enhancement assessed under U.S.S.G. §  3A1.1(b)(1). He argues that ""[Jane Doe 1] was not a vulnerable victim, and if she was, Lucious did not know nor  had reason to have known that she was vulnerable,"" citing his ""limited contact"" with Jane Doe 1 during the course  of the offense. Doc. 520 at 1, 5. The United States responded by arguing that multiple factors rendered Jane Doe 1  a vulnerable victim, specifically the fact that she had ""no home, and no parents to look out for her wellbeing,"" as  well as the fact that she ""used alcohol and marijuana on a regular basis"" and was ""reported to have been a user [of]  cocaine, ecstasy, and codeine."" Doc. 522 at 5. ""Certainly,"" the government writes, ""Langton and Perkins knew that  Jane Doe 1 was a vulnerable victim . . . . Due to the nature of the conspiracy, the defendant should have known this  as well. He is liable for what is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the conspiracy."" Id. Probation agreed with  the government: The following enhancement was not applied simply because [Jane Doe 1] was a minor. Instead, [Jane Doe 1]  was especially vulnerable for reasons other than age—including that [Jane Doe 1] was particularly susceptible  to the criminal [*4]  conduct given her lack of a stable home, being a runaway and she was without parental or  other appropriate guidance, which made her unusually vulnerable. Therefore, the enhancement will remain  unchanged. Doc. 521 at 2. Section 3A1.1 states that ""[i]f the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a  vulnerable victim, increase by 2 levels."" U.S.S.G. § 3A1.1(b)(1). Commentary instructs that a ""vulnerable victim"" is  someone who is ""unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly  susceptible to the criminal conduct."" U.S.S.G. § 3A1.1 cmt. n.2. Further, the Commentary instructs that the  enhancement should only apply to offenses ""in which the defendant knows or should have known of the victim's  unusual vulnerability. The adjustment would apply, for example, in a fraud case in which the defendant marketed an  ineffective cancer cure or in a robbery in which the defendant selected a handicapped victim."" Id. ""'[V]ulnerable victims' are those who are in need of greater societal protection."" United States v. Brunson, 54 F.3d  673, 676 (10th Cir. 1995). ""Specifically, the enhancement should apply when the victim is 'less able to resist than  the typical victim.'"" United States v. Scott, 529 F.3d 1290, 1300 (10th Cir. 2008) (quoting United States v.  Castaneda, 239 F.3d 978, 980 (9th Cir. 2001)). ""Moreover, the vulnerable victim enhancement cannot be based  solely [*5]  on the victim's membership in a certain class; the sentencing court is required to make particularized  findings of vulnerability, focusing on the individual victim and not the class of persons to which the victim belonged.""  United States v. Smith, 133 F.3d 737, 749 (10th Cir. 1997). ""[T]he evidence must also distinguish the victim as  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14871, *2 Page 3 of 17   atypical of the usual targets of the relevant criminal conduct."" United States v. Caballero, 277 F.3d 1235, 1251 (10th  Cir. 2002). Notably, if a victim's age has already been taken into account under the relevant offense guideline, it cannot be the  basis for the vulnerable victim enhancement. Scott, 529 F.3d at 1301. In this case, both Mr. Lucious and the  government agree that this Court should not consider Jane Doe 1's age when deciding whether to impose the  vulnerable victim enhancement. Doc. 520 at 2; Doc. 522 at 5. In United States v. Scott, the Tenth Circuit considered whether to apply the vulnerable victim enhancement in a  case involving the transportation of a minor across state lines with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. Scott,  529 F.3d at 1293. The district court had found that the victim, S.H., was unusually vulnerable to sex trafficking  because she was ""exceedingly petite"" and ""naïve,"" as well as an intravenous methamphetamine user with mental  health problems; in addition, she had run away from home. Id. at 1301. Evaluating this [*6]  justification, the Tenth  Circuit held that ""an unstable personal life is sufficiently common among Mann Act victims that S.H.'s runaway  status cannot support the enhancement."" Id. It also held that the defendant did not know or could not have  reasonably known about other vulnerabilities, including her methamphetamine use and mental illness. Id. at 1302.  However, the Tenth Circuit ultimately upheld the enhancement, concluding that ""S.H.'s small physical size and her  naivete rendered her unusually vulnerable to trafficking, compared to the average 12-to-16-year—old victim of  such a crime."" Id. at 1302-03. The Tenth Circuit has not discussed whether the enhancement can be premised upon poverty, drug use,  homelessness, and/or lack of parental supervision as related to a minor sex trafficking victim. As the government  notes, other circuits have applied the enhancement based on these characteristics. See United States v. Royal, 442  F. App'x 794, 798 (4th Cir. 2011) (drug dependence vulnerability, homelessness, and lack of contact with family);  United States v. Irving, 554 F.3d 64 (2d Cir. 2009) (homelessness and lack of parental supervision); United States  v. Jimenez-Calderon, 183 F. App'x 274 (3d Cir. 2006) (victims who ""were young, uneducated, naive and from  extremely impoverished families""). Similarly, there is little in-circuit guidance instructing district courts on how to determine [*7]  whether a defendant  ""should have known"" about a victim's vulnerabilities. In Scott, the Tenth Circuit reasoned as follows: Regarding S.H.'s methamphetamine use, the district court found that Scott was aware that S.H. used ""illegal  drugs,"" but the evidence shows only that he knew she used marijuana and alcohol . . . . [T]here is no indication  in the record that Scott knew or should have known that S.H. used methamphetamine. Similarly, there is no  suggestion that Scott knew of S.H.'s mental problems . . . . Nor does evidence in the record suggest that Scott  had any other reason to doubt her mental state, including any notice of her habit of self-mutilation . . . . It may  well be that during the course of Scott's subsequent employment of S.H., he became aware of her drug usage  or her mental illness. But the law requires that he hold this knowledge at the time that he placed S.H. in his car  and transported her across state lines, the offense for which he was convicted. Scott, 529 F.3d at 1302. This analysis suggests that, in evaluating what a defendant ""should have known,"" courts  should pay close attention to information that defendant observed or was told during the offense, as opposed to  relying on knowledge gained [*8]  after the offense. So, too, does this analysis suggest that courts should refrain  from making large analytic leaps: for example, even if a defendant knew that a victim used ""illegal drugs,"" a court  should not conclude that a defendant should have known about a victim's active methamphetamine addiction if he  did not witness methamphetamine use. The Tenth Circuit is clear: neither Jane Doe 1's runaway status nor her age can serve as a basis for applying the  enhancement. Nor will the Court apply the enhancement based on Jane Doe 1's homelessness or lack of parental  supervision. These characteristics are common to the class of minor sex trafficking victims; in Jane Doe 1's case,  they are not characteristics ""atypical of the usual targets of the relevant criminal conduct."" Caballero, 277 F.3d at  1251. In addition, homelessness and lack of parental supervision are so tied up in the concept of being a ""runaway""  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14871, *5 Page 4 of 17   with an ""unstable personal life"" that Scott precludes the application of the enhancement based upon these  characteristics. Scott, 529 F.3d at 1301. Nor can the enhancement be premised upon Jane Doe 1's alleged drug use. Even assuming that such use is  atypical among minor sex trafficking victims, the Court does not have enough evidence to [*9]  conclude that Mr.  Lucious knew or should have known about Jane Doe 1's drug use. None of the social media exchanges involving  Mr. Lucious discuss such drug use; nor has the government established that Mr. Lucious witnessed Jane Doe 1's  use or was informed of it. Without additional evidence, the Court cannot conclude that a preponderance of the  evidence supports the enhancement. See United States v. Kirk, 894 F.2d 1162, 1164 (10th Cir. 1990). Therefore,  Mr. Lucious's first objection was GRANTED. The two-level ""vulnerable victim"" enhancement does not apply. B. Objection to a Sex Offender Assessment as a Condition of Supervised Release Mr. Lucious also objected to one of Probation's recommended conditions of supervised release: that Mr. Lucious  complete a ""sex-offense-specific assessment to determine the level of risk for sexual dangerousness, recidivism,  and amenability to treatment and formulate treatment recommendations if treatment is necessary."" Doc. 494-1 at 1.  Mr. Lucious objects that the sex offender assessment is unnecessary because he ""did not have sexual contact of  any sort with a minor, or any other victim of the venture,"" and because he has ""no history of any criminal conduct  directed towards a minor."" Doc. 520 at 6-7. The government [*10]  did not respond to Mr. Lucious' second objection. See generally Doc. 522. Probation  responded as follows: The sex offense-specific assessment is necessary to assess a defendant's risk for reoffending and current  amenability for treatment; guide and direct specific recommendations for the defendant's conditions of  treatment and supervision; provide information that will help to identify the optimal setting, intensity of  intervention, and level of supervision; and assess the potential dangerousness of the defendant. This condition  also serves the statutory sentencing purposes of public protection and rehabilitation under 18 U.S.C. §  3553(a)(2)(C)-(D). This condition enables the probation officer to satisfy the statutory requirements to keep  informed as to the conduct and condition of the defendant; report the defendant's conduct and condition to the  sentencing court; and aid the defendant and bring about improvements in his conduct and condition. Therefore,  the recommendation for a sex offense-specific assessment will remain unchanged. Doc. 521 at 2. In imposing a condition of supervised release, this Court is guided by 18 U.S.C. § 3583, which provides that district  courts may order non-standard conditions of supervised release ""to [*11]  the extent that"" the condition is: (1) . . . reasonably related to the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D); (2) involves no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth in section  3553(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D); and (3) is consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28  U.S.C. 994(a). 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d). The ""pertinent policy statement"" here is U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(b), which closely mimics the  language of the statute. The Tenth Circuit has held that:    2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14871, *8 Page 5 of 17   The special conditions imposed ""must be reasonably related to at least one of the following: the nature and  circumstances of the offense, the defendant's history and characteristics, the deterrence of criminal conduct,  the protection of the public from further crimes of the defendant, and the defendant's educational, vocational,  medical, or other correctional needs."" United States v. Francis, 891 F.3d 888, 898 (10th Cir. 2018) (emphasis added) (quoting United States v. Mike, 632  F.3d 686, 692 (10th Cir. 2011)). ""A sentencing court need not provide reasons for each specific special condition  that it imposes; rather, it must only provide a generalized statement of its reasoning."" Mike, 632 F.3d at 693.  Generally, a district court ""enjoys broad discretion in setting a condition of supervised release."" United States v.  Erwin, 299 F.3d 1230, 1232 (10th Cir. 2002). The condition that Mr. Lucious receive a sex offender assessment is reasonably [*12]  related to the nature of his  offense and the need to protect the public from further crimes. Here, Mr. Lucious' offense conduct involved actively  trying to become the ""pimp"" for Breeauna Langton and Jane Doe 1. See Doc. 520 at 8 (Mr. Lucious identified  himself as a ""pimp"" when he first messaged Ms. Langton); Doc. 490-1 at ¶ 24 (Ms. Langton tells Mr. Lucious ""I'll  work for you""); Doc. 522 at 3-4 (Jane Doe 1 told law enforcement that Mr. Lucious had ""tried to get her to work for  him, but it never happened""). Mr. Lucious went so far as to line up dates for Ms. Langton. Doc. 490-1 at ¶ 22.  Furthermore, the Facebook messages imply that Mr. Lucious arranged to profit from the sex work. See, e.g., Doc.  490-1 at ¶¶ 24 (Mr. Lucious telling Ms. Langton ""we need half of that if we doing this as a team,"" ""U keep 40 and  put 40 on the table,"" and ""after this u have to stat going half""), 26 (Mr. Lucious tells Mr. Perkins ""She got my  money.""). In sum, Mr. Lucious' offense conduct indicates knowledge of how to operate as a ""pimp."" A condition  requiring Mr. Lucious to submit to a sex offender assessment will allow the Court to address the risk that he might  return to this lifestyle upon his release. [*13]  Just as the term ""sex offender"" does not refer only to those who are attracted to minors, sex offender assessments  are not designed to evaluate only those who are attracted to minors. See 42 U.S.C. § 16911 (defining a ""sex  offender"" as ""a person who has been convicted of a sex offense""); see also Administrative Office of the United  States  Courts,  Overview  of  Probation  and  Supervised  Release  Conditions,  83  (Nov.  2016),  https://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/overview-probation-supervised-release-conditions  (indicating  that  the  purpose of sex offender assessments is to ""help those who have committed sex offenses accept responsibility for  sexually deviant thoughts and behavior; develop an increased level of recognition and focus on details of actual  sexual behavior; and recognize the arousal patterns, fantasies, planning, and rationalizations of their sexually  deviant thoughts and behavior""). In addition to the clinical judgment of qualified evaluators, sex offense  assessments often draw upon empirical instruments to determine a given offender's risk of recidivism. See Andrew  J. Harris, Risk Assessment and Sex Offender Community Supervision: A Context-Specific Framework, 70 Fed.  Probation 36, 38-39 (Sept. 2006). There are over 20 empirical instruments which a sex offender [*14]  assessment  may use to evaluate a person's risk of recidivism, and attraction to minors is just one predictive variable in those  models, along with factors like age, number of prior offenses, marital status, and prior treatment outcomes. Id. at  37. In this context, the Court is justified in ordering a sex offense assessment for Mr. Lucious. The assessment's purpose is to provide the Court and the Probation Office with the information necessary to  effectively supervise Mr. Lucious. For example, if the sex offender assessment determines that Mr. Lucious is not in  need of sex-offense-related treatment, Mr. Lucious will not be required to attend such treatment. This ""stepped  approach"" is designed to ensure that Mr. Lucious is not subjected to a greater deprivation of liberty than is  reasonably necessary. Therefore, the assessment is proper under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d)(2). Additionally, because  the condition is reasonably related to the nature of his offense and the need to protect the public from further  crimes, its imposition is consistent with U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(b). For these reasons, Mr. Lucious' second objection is DENIED and he is required to undergo a sex offender  assessment. However, the Court will also require that the assessment and [*15]  all supporting testing and/or  documentation be provided to Mr. Lucious' defense counsel. 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14871, *11 Page 6 of 17   II. Sentencing Pursuant to United States v. Booker, this Court must consider the advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines as  well as each of the additional factors stated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) in imposing a reasonable sentence that is  sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in Section 3553(a). See United  States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 245, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2005). Section 3553(a) requires the Court  to consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant. See  18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). It also requires the Court to impose a sentence that complies with the purposes of sentencing,  which include (1) retribution, (2) deterrence, (3) incapacitation, and (4) rehabilitation. Id. This Court carefully  considered each of the Section 3553(a) factors, as well as the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, and found that a  sentence of 60 months imprisonment is appropriate in Mr. Lucious' case. A. Nature and Circumstances of the Offense At one point, eight individuals were charged in this case, which arose from a sex trafficking investigation focused  on two minor victims: Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2. Doc. 20. Mr. Lucious did not know Jane Doe 2; he is held  accountable for his conduct involving Jane Doe [*16]  1. [Jane Doe 1] was a troubled 14-year-old middle-school student with a history of running away from home and  placement in shelters and foster homes overseen by the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department  (CYFD). During her time under CYFD care, Jane Doe 1 befriended Breeauna Langton, who periodically  engaged in commercial sex work. As early as April 14, 2017, Jane Doe 1 became involved in commercial  sex work . . . . Jane Doe 1's involvement in commercial sex work continued from at least April 14, 2017, until  June 13, 2017 . . . . During this period, she was trafficked by Langton, Devin Perkins, Jason Jackson, and  Keron Lucious. Doc. 490-1 at ¶ 13.Mr. Lucious' co-defendant, Breeauna Langton, introduced Jane Doe 1 to the commercial sex  trade in the spring of 2017. Id. at ¶ 14 (""Jane Doe 1 did not want to return to CYFD care . . . . Langton took her in,  but soon required Jane Doe 1 to engage in sex work as a condition for staying with her""). Though Ms. Langton was  also a sex worker, she facilitated Jane Doe 1's prostitution by posting advertisements for Jane Doe 1 on  Backpage.com, setting up ""dates,"" and booking hotel rooms. Doc. 490-1 at ¶¶ 14-15, 17; Doc. 372 at 6-7;  Doc. [*17]  372-2 at 1. Indeed, Ms. Langton's role was that of a ""bottom girl."" See Doc. 372 at 3-4 (""In addition to  still engaging in commercial sex at the trafficker's behest . . . . [t]he Bottom-girl is seen as being responsible for the  rest of the girls.""). Ms. Langton reported during one interview that she struggled to control Jane Doe 1, and that  struggle is memorialized in Facebook messages between the pair. Notably, Ms. Langton's Facebook messages  also indicate that she knew Jane Doe 1 was underage. See, e.g., Doc. 520 at 9-10. Ms. Langton and Jane Doe 1 soon began working with another of Mr. Lucious' co-defendants, Devin Perkins. Doc.  490-1 at ¶ 16. Jane Doe 1 stated Perkins ""was around a lot[,]"" . . . . [a]s Jane Doe 1 saw it: ""I wouldn't, per se I worked for him  but maybe in his eyes, he would say, yeah, she worked for me . . . because I do give him money when he asks  for it and I did buy him drugs and I did buy him food and I did pay for all the hotel rooms and stuff but . . . I  didn't see myself working for him."" But Perkins saw her working for him, ""because, like, I'd hear him on the  phone. He was, like, yeah, I'm with my bit*h.""       2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14871, *15 Page 7 of 17   Id. at ¶ 16. Mr. Perkins, too, knew of Jane Doe 1's age. [*18]  Id. (""Jane Doe 1 also told investigators . . . . '[h]e was  actually really against my age when we first met . . . because I was younger but as he found me bringing money in,  he kind of was just like, I can use that.'""); see also Doc. 372-1 at 1. Mr. Perkins also had sex with Jane Doe 1. Doc.  372-5 at 2; Doc. 372-1 at 1. Eventually, he began setting up dates for her. Doc. 490-1 at ¶ 17. ""Devin would post  the advertisements on his phone, and would wait for her to do her outcalls in an Uber."" Doc. 372 at 7 (citing Doc.  372-3 at 1). The two came up with a scheme to ""rip off"" customers: Devin would post advertisements on Backpage using fake pictures from the Internet. When clients would  respond to the hotels that they were in, [Jane Doe 1] stated they would then rip off the clients. She stated they  would tell them they were going to call the police after the clients put the money on the table and agreed to the  sexual acts. Doc. 372-1 at 1. Jason Jackson, another co-defendant, met Jane Doe 1 through Mr. Perkins. Doc. 372-14 at 1 (""[Jane Doe 1] stated  she first met Jackson at Devon's mother's residence.""). Mr. Jackson knew that Jane Doe 1 was underage, and, like  Mr. Perkins, had sex with her. [*19]  Doc. 490-1 at ¶¶ 29, 36-39. Mr. Jackson's cell phone was linked to two  Backpage advertisements featuring Jane Doe 1, and Jane Doe 1 indicated to law enforcement that Mr. Jackson  trafficked her in Santa Fe. Id. at ¶¶ 30, 32, 34. Mr. Lucious' involvement with this group ""began with Langton."" Doc. 520 at 8. ""He messaged her on Facebook on  May 5, 2017, where she asked him who he was, and he identified himself as 'a pimp.' On May 6, 2017, she  responded 'I'm good.'"" Id. (citations omitted). In early law enforcement interviews with sex workers, Mr. Lucious is  not mentioned. See Doc. 372-1 at 1 (June 15, 2017 report of an interview with Jane Doe 1); Doc. 372-2 at 1 (June  21, 2017 report of an interview with Jane Doe 1); Doc. 372-3 at 1 (same); Doc. 372-4 (August 4, 2017 report of an  interview with G.A.); Doc. 372-5 at 1 (April 11, 2018 report of interview with Breeauna Langton). However, May 14,  2017 Facebook messages between Ms. Langton and Mr. Lucious appear to confirm Mr. Lucious' prior assertion  that he was a ""pimp"": he asks Ms. Langton if she is ""trying to make some money,"" and tells her ""I got some dates  for you."" Doc. 490-1 at ¶ 22. Ms. Langton rejects the offer, telling him that it's [*20]  ""just so fu*king much right now  and I can't handle it."" Id. When she was interviewed about these and similar messages, Ms. Langton told  investigators that Mr. Lucious (who went by ""Smash Bro"" on social media) was ""involved with Devin as a type of  partner in forcing them to work."" Doc. 372-5 at 2. Later Facebook messages appear to corroborate Ms. Langton's report, though they leave much unclear about the  power dynamic within the group. For example, on May 15, 2017 Mr. Lucious ""left a message on Mr. Perkins'  Facebook asking, 'Were u get the room at . . . So, I can tell the dates.'"" Doc. 490-1 at ¶ 24. And between May 17  and 18, 2017, Mr. Lucious' messages to Breeauna Langton indicate that he had arranged to profit financially from  the sex workers. See id. at ¶ 24 (Mr. Lucious telling Ms. Langton ""we need half of that if we doing this as a team,""  ""U keep 40 and put 40 on the table,"" and ""after this u have to stat going half.""). Those same messages indicate that  Mr. Lucious was familiar with Jane Doe 1: Langton: Jane Doe 1 is asleep Langton: She won't get up Lucious: Where she at Langton: In bed not doing shit and Devin isn't there either I'm trying to tell her to get up and she won't  listen [*21]  Lucious: Well tell bro I said to make her get up Id. As the government notes, this exchange indicates that Mr. Lucious had ""some control over when Jane Doe 1  could and could not sleep."" Doc. 522 at 2. Still, these messages do little to clarify the exact relationship between Mr.  Lucious and the sex workers: later on in the conversation, Ms. Langton tells him ""You aren't my pimp nobody is,""  before saying ""I'll work for you."" Id. Then, however, when Mr. Lucious says ""Im going to get yo own room,"" Ms.  Langton replies ""For? I'm working with Jon Jon I needed your help and you weren't there."" Id. Relationships within the group appear to remain fluid through the end of May 2017. In messages between Mr.  Lucious and Mr. Perkins on May 24 and 25, 2017, Mr. Lucious tells Mr. Perkins ""She got my money."" Id. at ¶ 26.  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14871, *17 Page 8 of 17   Mr. Perkins replies ""How it turn in to urs"" and the two have a longer conversation, with Mr. Perkins telling Mr.  Lucious ""u pose to take the money n give me half,"" and Mr. Lucious later retorting ""Wasent the plan gor yaya and  Jane Doe 1 to work with me anyway."" Id. On May 25, 2017, Mr. Perkins messages Mr. Lucious about being angry  with one of the sex workers; Mr. Lucious asks ""Can I have [*22]  her."" Id. at ¶ 28. Mr. Perkins replies ""Idc lol she  doin to much bro yeah u can."" Id. These messages appear to document a constantly evolving relationship among  the group—but one where Mr. Lucious was not necessarily ""in charge."" Indeed, in a later interview, Jane Doe 1 told  law enforcement that Mr. Lucious had ""tried to get her to work for him, but it never happened."" Doc. 522 at 3-4. Mr. Lucious describes his relationship to Jane Doe 1 and to his co-conspirators in the Amended Plea Agreement: Between on or about April 2017 and June 2017, in Bernalillo County, in the District of New Mexico, I, Keron  Lucious, agreed with co-conspirators Jason Jackson, Devin Perkins and Breaunna Langton to Commit Sex  Trafficking as that crime is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2) and (b)(2) . . . . I had a reasonable opportunity to  observe Jane Doe 1 on more than one occasion, and agree that the Government could prove that Jane Doe 1  was between 14 and 18 years old in April, 2017, and June, 2017. As part of the venture, Jane Doe 1 would be  caused to engage in prostitution, which is a commercial sex act. The venture secured hotel rooms for her to  use to engage in commercial sex acts. We did rent hotel rooms for the purpose of others [*23]  to engage in  commercial sex acts, including Jane Doe 1. We also used Facebook accounts and cellular phones, which I  now know operate in interstate commerce, to communicate with each other about the logistics of our sex  trafficking activities, to include how the money would be split up. Doc. 418 at ¶ 9. His admission is corroborated by a series of May 24, 2017 messages. On May 24, 2017, Perkins and Jackson had an exchange on Facebook, in which they discuss the codes for  Jackson's credit card ""[t]o pull the money off,"" and Jackson also states, ""I'll be right there in [I'm] almost done  getting the room."" Then Lucious and Perkins discussed the money, with Lucious asking, ""Ay bro whats up the  money shit . . . I'm tryna come collect I need my money."" Perkins responded, saying, ""He dint make it he said  at 8 am it should e there."" Doc. 490-1 at ¶ 31; see also Doc. 100-4 at 8. Again, however, the exact nature of the power dynamic between Mr.  Lucious, Mr. Perkins, and Mr. Jackson remains unclear. The government points to one May 23, 2015 exchange between Mr. Lucious and Mr. Perkins as proof that Mr.  Lucious ""also called the shots and made decisions among Devin Perkins and Jason Jackson."" Doc. 522 [*24]  at 3.  However, that conclusion is overstated. The messages in question read as follows: Lucious: The room is not for use to be chilling at bro Lucious: I got the room for the hoes we can get or own roo. Perkins: I'm not chilling there my bit*h there I need to collect Doc. 490-1 at ¶ 25. In this exchange, it is not clear whether Mr. Lucious was indeed giving commands and ""calling  the shots"" or whether he was merely upset and blustering. In his sentencing memorandum, Mr. Lucious asserts that he only had limited contact with Jane Doe 1. Lucious did not have a cell phone during the time he had contact with [Jane Doe 1]. He had to use other  people's phones or computers to access his Facebook page, or communicate with people; as such, he was not  continuously ""connected"" to social media. A review of all the Facebook records provided by the government  reveals that Lucious and [Jane Doe 1] were not Facebook friends and never communicated with each other via  social media. The only contact Lucious had with [Jane Doe 1], that he can specifically recall now, occurred  when Lucious drove [Jane Doe 1], Langton and Perkins; even then, [Jane Doe 1] was always with either  Perkins or Langton. Lucious probably [*25]  saw [Jane Doe 1] at parties attended by Langton and Perkins, as  [Jane Doe 1] was always with one of them. Lucious knew very little about [Jane Doe 1], only that she seemed  to be in a relationship with Perkins. Doc. 520 at 5. B. Sentencing Disparities 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14871, *21 Page 9 of 17   Only Mr. Lucious, Mr. Perkins, Mr. Jackson, and Ms. Langton were significantly involved in the trafficking of Jane  Doe 1. Therefore, the Court will focus on comparing Mr. Lucious' conduct and sentence to that of his three co- conspirators. Jason Jackson pled guilty to two counts of Sex Trafficking of a Minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a) and  (b)(2). He is still awaiting sentencing; however, his offense of conviction carries a mandatory minimum of ten years.  Doc. 182. His Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement stipulates to a range of 132 to 180 months, while his advisory  guidelines sentencing range is currently 292 to 365 months. Doc. 231 at 40. He was assessed an aggravating role  adjustment. Id. at ¶ 94. He has entered into a separate fifteen-year plea agreement in a related state case. Doc.  368 at 2. Devin Perkins pled guilty to a one-count Information charging him with Conspiracy to Commit Sex Trafficking of  Minors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1594(c). Doc. 200. He is also awaiting sentencing. [*26]  His Rule 11(c)(1)(C)  plea agreement stipulates to a range of 120 months and his advisory guidelines sentencing range is 324 to 405  months. Doc. 240 at 38. He was assessed an aggravating role adjustment. Id. at ¶ 84. Breeauna Langton pled guilty to a one-count Information charging her with False Statement, in violation of 18  U.S.C. § 1001(a)(2). Doc. 285. She received a sentence of 3 days or time served. Doc. 358. She had no mandatory  minimum, and her advisory guidelines sentencing range was 24 to 30 months. Doc. 297 at ¶ 37. She was not  assessed an aggravating role adjustment. After reviewing the evidence submitted, the Court concludes that Mr. Lucious was less involved—and therefore less  culpable—than either Mr. Perkins or Mr. Jackson. While those two men ""would trade Jane Doe 1 back and forth,""  Mr. Lucious merely ""attempted to recruit Jane Doe 1 to work for him; however, that never occurred."" Doc. 490-1 at ¶  45. While, as Mr. Lucious admits, he had a ""reasonable opportunity to observe her,"" there is no evidence that he  had actual knowledge of her age. Doc. 418 at ¶ 9; see also Doc. 520 at 3. Nor did Mr. Lucious have sex with Jane  Doe 1. For these reasons, Mr. Lucious will receive a lower sentence than Mr. Jackson and Mr. [*27]  Perkins. It is more difficult to assess Mr. Lucious' culpability as compared to Breeauna Langton. As noted above, Ms.  Langton was a bottom girl—both a victim and a perpetrator. Doc. 372 at 6. That difference is important: as the  government notes, ""[n]o one made [Mr. Lucious] have sex for money. He was not subject of [sic] the control of  others."" Doc. 522 at 9. Still, Ms. Langton had actual knowledge of Jane Doe 1's age, and that Jane Doe 1 might not  have become involved in sex work if it had not been for Ms. Langton. For these reasons, the Court believes that the  ""gap"" between Ms. Langton and Mr. Lucious' sentences should be minimized so as to avoid unwarranted  sentencing disparities. C. History and Characteristics Keron Eugene Lucious is 24 years old. Doc. 490-1 at 3. He was born in Los Angeles, California to La'Kesha  Chaney and Kenneth Lucious. Id. at ¶ 77. He moved to Albuquerque at age 12 and has six siblings. Id. at ¶¶ 77, 80.  Mr. Lucious was primarily raised by his mother and his mother's family in Albuquerque, as his father was  ""disengaged"" from his life. Id. at ¶ 80. Consequently, his childhood was ""rough"" because his single mother  struggled to financially support her family. [*28]  Id. For four years, Mr. Lucious lived with his grandmother, ""due to           2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14871, *25 Page 10 of 17   [his] mother's financial hardships."" Id. In a letter to the Court, Mr. Lucious' grandmother describes the impact of his  childhood: I am very familiar with the circumstances he grew up in, including his absent father. We all know that fathers  can have positive effects on children's social and emotional well-being . . . . unfortunately, my daughter was  young when she had Keron and did the best she could to raise him without a father. I believe that Keron was  out looking for that love that only a father could give when he became involved with a crowd[] I consider to be  bad influences. Doc. 320 at 17. Mr. Lucious' aunt, Erica Turner, also described Mr. Lucious' home life in a letter to the Court, noting  that he ""devoted his spare time [to] his sister and brother,"" and took on a caretaker role by picking up his younger  siblings from school and bringing them ""on outings while his Mother would have to work."" Doc. 320 at 11. Mr. Lucious' instability at home was mirrored by instability at school. He transferred to three different high schools in  three years and dropped out of school after completing 9th grade. Id. at ¶¶ 80, 96-97. [*29]  These frequent  transfers made it difficult for the schools to address his learning disabilities. See, e.g., Doc. 490-2 at 5 (2013  Student Profile noting that ""although student was initially compliant and meeting this social worker, his attendance  has become a huge issue""); Doc. 490-2 at 45 (2015 Student Profile noting that Mr. Lucious is ""[b]ehind earning  credits due to poor attendance and dropping out""). Albuquerque Public School records reflect that Mr. Lucious was  enrolled in special education ""due to deficits in the areas of basic reading skills, reading comprehension, written  expression, math calculation, math reasoning, and auditory processing."" Doc. 490-1 at ¶ 98; see also Doc. 490-2 at  4-5, 30-31. When Mr. Lucious was 18 years old, his reading comprehension was at a 4th or 5th grade level. Doc.  490-2 at 41. Still, he had a few factors working in his favor: one 2015 Student Profile noted that he was a ""[t]alented  athlete"" and was ""[q]uite independent,"" able to care for himself at home, and ""contribute[] to the household."" Id. at  39. The same assessment noted that he was ""currently working"" and in possession of ""job retention skills like being  on time, listening to instructions, [*30]  [and] cooperating with peers."" Id. Growing up poor in Albuquerque meant that it was not easy for Mr. Lucious to keep his nose clean. He witnessed  his friends get arrested and physically assaulted. Doc. 490-1 at ¶ 82. He was introduced to marijuana by friends at  age 17, and his use escalated to ""a few 'joints' daily"" by age 19. Id. at ¶ 91. He experimented with cocaine at age 19  but did not develop an addiction. Id. at ¶ 93. Additional records indicate that Mr. Lucious used opiate pain pills for  about one year, between 2013 and 2014, and that he began using alcohol during his adolescence. Doc. 328-1 at 5. Mr. Lucious successfully completed a 30-day inpatient drug program at Turquoise Lodge in 2014. Doc. 490-1 at ¶  94. He was 17 years old at the time that he was referred to the program; while records reflect that his referral was  for ""drug court,"" Mr. Lucious' criminal record does not reflect any juvenile convictions. Id. at ¶ 94; Doc. 328-1 at 5.  Records indicate that ""[o]verall, he did well in rehab and was no [sic] oppositional or defiant."" Doc. 328-1 at 3. He  received diagnoses of Marijuana Dependence, Opiate Abuse, Underage Alcohol Use, Tobacco Abuse in  Remission, and Cognitive Disorder. [*31]  Id. at 1. Rule-out diagnoses were given for PTSD and ""psychotic  disorder versus cannabinoid-induced psychosis."" Id. Mr. Lucious also reported to Turquoise Lodge providers that  he wondered if he might have ADHD. Id. at 6. However, he was never diagnosed with a specific learning disability,  behavioral disorder, or mental health condition other than depression. Doc. 490-1 at ¶ 90; Doc. 490-3 at 30  (documenting a diagnosis of ""major depression, recurrent""). Despite the challenges that Mr. Lucious faced in school and at home, he was able to maintain steady employment,  working as a loader at Walmart from 2017 until his arrest. Doc. 490-1 at ¶ 100. Mr. Lucious' employment was  necessary to support his children, Air'eon (age 6) and Xy'Marion (age 5). See id. at ¶¶ 85-87. Air'eon was born to Mr. Lucious and Ms. Ashley Cooper (age 22). Id. at ¶ 87. Mr. Lucious and Ms. Cooper met in  high school and had a three-year relationship before growing apart; Air'eon is in good health, enrolled in T-Ball, and  doing well. Id. at ¶¶ 85, 87. Xy'Marion was born to Mr. Lucious and Ms. Meshelline Dotson (age 23). Id. at ¶ 86. Mr.  Lucious and Ms. Dotson met through a friend and had a two-year relationship before [*32]  growing apart. Id.   2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14871, *28 Page 11 of 17   Mr. Lucious has been in a relationship with Lasha Chavarria (age 23) for the past four years. Id. at ¶ 85. The couple  met while Mr. Lucious was attending Manzano High School; Ms. Chavarria currently works as a delivery driver and  caregiver and has been supportive of Mr. Lucious throughout the pendency of his case. Id. She wrote a letter of  support to the Court, referring to Mr. Lucious as her spouse and writing that he ""is a family-person and loving father  who has always presented themselves with levelheadedness and grace."" Doc. 320 at 12. Following his arrest and incarceration, Mr. Lucious began to experience more significant mental health issues.  While at Cibola County Correctional Facility, he reported ""having intense anxiety and feeling paranoid."" Doc. 490-3  at 22. At one point, he also reported ""hearing voices."" Doc. 362-1 at 52. Additionally, he was diagnosed with  ""complicated bereavement"" following the death of his younger brother, Ja'Zay, in 2019. Doc. 490-1 at ¶ 89. Ja'Zay was killed in a Northeast Heights apartment fire in April 2019. Id. at ¶ 79. He was ten years old. Doc. 189 at  4. His two sisters were also injured in the fire, inhaling enough smoke to require [*33]  hospitalization. Doc. 490-1 at  ¶ 79. The official cause of the fire is still under investigation, and Mr. Lucious has repeatedly expressed how guilty  he feels for not being able to provide emotional support for his family. Id. at ¶¶ 79, 82; see also Doc. 490-4 at 2. While Mr. Lucious could benefit from therapy to help him work through his grief, his physical health problems  appear relatively well-controlled. His current diagnoses include exercise-induced asthma, which is controlled with  inhalers, and eczema, which is controlled with topical creams. Doc. 490-3 at 22; see also Doc. 521 at 3. He also  suffers from knee pain. Doc. 490-1 at ¶ 89. In the future, Mr. Lucious hopes to realize his long-held goal of becoming a physical therapist. Id. at ¶ 83. Crucially,  he has secured a job with a remodeling company upon his release from custody. Id. at ¶ 99. He will also enjoy  significant family support, as is evinced in the letters of support received by this Court. In addition to letters from Ms.  Chavarria, Ms. Turner, and Ms. Stafford-Chaney, this Court received letters from Eric Turner Jr., Betty Lawson, and  Yvette M. Jones, all of whom expressed that Mr. Lucious was a kind and supportive [*34]  person. Doc. 320 at 13- 14, 16. Mr. Lucious also wrote a letter to the Court ""taking full responsibility for my role and acts."" Doc. 490-4 at 1. ""I  was a young kid not thinking and only thinking about myself,"" he writes. Id. D. Deterrence The need for specific deterrence can be evaluated by reviewing a defendant's criminal history. Notably, Mr. Lucious  has no adult criminal convictions; nor could this Court find record of any juvenile adjudications. Doc. 490-1 at ¶¶ 70- 71. He was arrested once, at age 20, for Shoplifting — Over $250 but not More than $500. Id. at ¶ 75. That incident  allegedly took place at a Walmart, where the loss prevention officer advised that ""subjects in a silver Honda just  committed shoplifting and one of the males told the manager he was going to shoot him."" Id. This single arrest  constitutes the entirety of Mr. Lucious' documented criminal history. His total criminal history score is therefore zero  and he is in criminal history category I. Id. at ¶ 73. In assessing the need for deterrence, this Court also takes Mr. Lucious' post-arrest history into account. While Mr.  Lucious was in pretrial custody, Cibola County Correctional Center conducted a ""shakedown"" of the [*35]  pod  where he was housed. ""During the shakedown, a homemade sharpened instrument which was approximately four  inches in length was in a cell the defendant was occupying with another inmate. The defendant denied knowledge  of the weapon and was cooperative during the investigation."" Doc. 490-1 at ¶ 73. The weapon was located under  the bottom bunk, in a hole in the wall ""which looked like it had been refilled with toothpaste."" Doc. 328-2 at 1. Mr.  Lucious told investigators that ""he never knew nothing was in the wall,"" because ""he never would get under the  bunk to investigate the crack in the wall."" Id. at 2. The Court finds Mr. Lucious' explanation credible, and will not  weigh this incident heavily in his sentencing. E. Just Punishment 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14871, *32 Page 12 of 17   With respect to the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for  the law, to provide just punishment for the offense, and to promote public safety, the instant offense was extremely  serious. Mr. Lucious' choices caused great harm to a 14-year-old girl who was pressured into sex work by others  when she found herself homeless. While Mr. Lucious was, perhaps, unaware of Jane Doe 1's background, he did  know that [*36]  she was having sex for money. Instead of attempting to profit from Jane Doe 1, Mr. Lucious should  have sought to help her leave sex work behind. What he did was morally wrong. However, Mr. Lucious has already been severely punished for his conduct. Though he is a first-time offender, he  has been in continuous custody since his arrest on April 11, 2018. Doc. 490-1 at 1. He was unable to attend his  brother's funeral, and he has been in custody for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, deprived of rehabilitative  programming while his detention facility cycles in and out of lockdown. In this way, Mr. Lucious has already been  severely punished. F. Appropriateness of a 60-Month Sentence 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) requires this Court to impose a sentence that is ""sufficient, but not greater than necessary"" to  comply with the sentencing factors set forth in that section. The Court has carefully considered each of those  factors and ultimately believes that a sentence of 60 months best serves the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. §  3553(a). The Court comes to this conclusion for several reasons. As to the nature and circumstances of the offense, Mr. Lucious was involved in a sex trafficking conspiracy which  caused great harm to Jane Doe 1, and [*37]  it was wrong of him to profit from her misfortune. Still, the offense did  not involve force, fraud, or coercion. Additionally, Mr. Lucious' level of involvement in the conspiracy is mitigating.  The evidence indicates that he had relatively little contact with Jane Doe 1 as compared to his co-defendants.  Unlike Ms. Langton and Mr. Perkins, he had no actual knowledge of Jane Doe 1's age. And unlike Mr. Perkins and  Mr. Jackson, Mr. Lucious never had sex with Jane Doe 1. Likewise, the evidence does not indicate that Mr. Lucious  ever achieved unambiguous authority over Jane Doe 1: in her own words, Mr. Lucious ""tried to get her to work for  him, but it never happened."" Doc. 522 at 3-4. Mr. Lucious' history and characteristics are also mitigating. As the government points out, sex workers often have  ""limited options in life."" Doc. 372 at 2. They are often socialized into believing that ""participating in commercial sex  is what they do to survive."" Id. at 5. Mr. Lucious shares those characteristics with his victims, something that is not  true of all ""pimps"" or traffickers. He grew up poor; his lack of education and processing difficulties would have made  it extraordinarily difficult for him [*38]  to find a job which paid enough to support his family. While it is laudable that  Mr. Lucious was able to find and maintain employment at Wal-Mart, his wages fluctuated between $750 and $1,000  per month. Doc. 490-1 at ¶ 100. It is not difficult to understand how Mr. Lucious found himself in a financial  quagmire. Nor is it difficult to see how he learned that participating in the sex trade is what he had to do to survive,  especially at such a young age. With respect to the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for  the law, and to provide just punishment and deterrence, Mr. Lucious' actions were clearly serious. However, this is  his first conviction, and he has been punished in a way that reflects the seriousness of the offense. In particular, he  has been incarcerated for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, kept apart from his family in an environment with  almost no rehabilitative programming. His sentence has been harsh; in his own words, it has deterred him from  future criminal conduct by showing him how difficult it is ""trying to be a brother, husben [sic], son, a father and a role  model from behind these wall[s]."" Doc. 490-4 [*39]  at 1. Additionally, Mr. Lucious has been unable to pursue  educational or vocational training while in custody. Such training would provide him with a legal avenue to financial  stability, thereby removing his primary motive for entering the sex trafficking industry. This lack of correctional  treatment is yet another way in which Mr. Lucious' sentence has been particularly harsh, and the Court has taken  the absence of programming and rehabilitative treatment into consideration when deciding on an appropriate  sentence. 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14871, *35 Page 13 of 17   Finally, a sentence of 60 months is necessary to minimize the disparity between Mr. Lucious and Ms. Langton.  Some level of disparity is justified by the fact that Ms. Langton was indeed a victim who became involved in sex  work at a young age. However, the Court finds that this disparity should be as small as possible, given that Ms.  Langton played a larger role in recruiting Jane Doe 1 into the sex trafficking conspiracy. Mr. Lucious is extremely young. So are his children. It may be difficult to rebuild his relationship with Air'eon and  Xy'Marion in the wake of a five-year sentence. However, the Court has confidence in Mr. Lucious. Unlike many of  the defendants that come [*40]  before this Court, he has demonstrated the ability to maintain loving family  relationships and to work a legitimate job. He has faced many obstacles in life and has proved himself resilient. For  these reasons, the Court believes that Mr. Lucious will succeed on supervised release and will live up to his  potential to be the brother, husband, son, father, and role model that he wishes he could be.",1
"State ex rel. Marshall v. TY Green_s Massage Therapy, Inc., 332 So. 3d 413","[*414]  PER CURIAM. The State appeals from an order of the Madison Circuit Court denying its request for a preliminary injunction against  TY Green's Massage Therapy, Inc., Yuping Tang, and Jiao Liu a/k/a Serena Tang (collectively referred to as ""the  defendants""). We affirm the trial court's order. Facts Yuping Tang and her daughter, Jiao Liu a/k/a Serena Tang, owned and operated a business that was incorporated  as TY Green's Massage, Inc. The business had four locations: one on University Drive in Huntsville, one on South  Parkway in Huntsville, one in Madison, and one in Decatur. In September 2018, the Madison Police Department  received an anonymous tip that a customer had gone into the defendants' Madison location for a massage and that  he had been touched inappropriately. As a result, the department started an investigation of TY Green's Massage  Therapy that included, among other things, sending multiple men into the business locations undercover to get  massages and conducting surveillance of the [**2]  business locations and of the houses where the employees of  the business were housed. During the investigation, some of the massage therapists touched clients in places they were not supposed to touch  according to Board of Massage Therapy guidelines; that some massage therapists straddled clients and/or touched  the clients with the intimate parts of their bodies and/or touched the intimate parts of the clients' bodies; and that at  332 So. 3d 413, *413; 2021 Ala. LEXIS 12, **1 Page 4 of 16   least one massage therapist engaged in sexual acts, including intercourse, with a client. The investigation also  revealed that the massage therapists lived in houses owned by the Tangs; that the Tangs provided transportation  for the therapists each day to get to the business locations where they worked;  [*415]  and that the therapists  normally worked 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Procedural History On April 17, 2019, the State, by and through Attorney General Steve Marshall, filed a complaint in the Madison  Circuit Court against TY Green's Massage Therapy, Inc., doing business as Massage Foot Care and/or Massage  and Foot Care Spa, Health Massage, SO Massage, and/or Massage Spa; Yuping Tang; and Jiao Liu a/k/a Serena  Tang. The complaint set forth 41 counts, including [**3]  13 counts alleging first-degree human trafficking,  violations of § 13A-6-152, Ala. Code 1975; 26 counts alleging second-degree human trafficking, violations of §  13A-6-153, Ala. Code 1975; and 2 counts alleging deceptive trade practices, violations of § 8-19-5(27), Ala. Code  1975. Among other things, the State requested injunctive and declaratory relief, damages, and civil penalties. In the complaint, the State alleged that the defendants were operating ""illicit massage businesses that serve as  fronts for a human trafficking operation."" Specifically, it contended: a""In the Defendants' organization, the 'employees' work incredibly long hours during which at least some of  them are expected to engage in sex acts with the businesses' customers. When the victims are not 'Working,'  they seem to have little freedom of movement; they are transported in groups to and from the Defendants'  businesses and are kept in houses owned by the Defendants where they are left to eat and sleep in terrible  conditions. The Defendants, on the other hand, have reaped millions of dollars in revenue from their  businesses, and the Attorney General now brings this action in order to put an end to their conduct and protect  their victims from further harm."" The State also alleged that the defendants' [**4]  actions violate Alabama's Deceptive Trade Practices Act. See § 8- 19-1 et seq., Ala. Code 1975. In particular, it asserted: ""The Deceptive Trade Practices Act authorizes the Office of the Attorney General to seek a temporary  restraining order, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, when it has reason to believe that a  person or business is engaging in any act or practice declared to be unlawful under the Deceptive Trade  Practices Act. Ala. Code § 8-19-8(a). Section 8-19-5(27) of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act specifically  prohibits engaging in any 'unconscionable ... act or practice in the conduct of trade or commerce.' It is, without  a doubt, unconscionable to coerce immigrant women into serving as virtual slaves in furtherance of one's  business. For that reason, too, the State brings this action to stop the Defendants' ongoing unlawful practices  and to prevent such unlawful conduct in the future."" The State attached extensive documentation in support of the complaint. In addition to the complaint, the State also  filed an ""Ex Parte Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, Asset Freeze, Appointment of a Receiver, & Order to  Show Cause Why a Preliminary Injunction Should Not Issue."" On April 17, 2019, the same day the complaint and ex parte [**5]  motion were filed, the trial court entered an ""Ex  parte Temporary Restraining Order with Asset Freeze, Appointment of a Receiver, Other Equitable Relief, and  Order to Show Cause Why a Preliminary Injunction Should Not Issue."" The order was executed, and the receiver  and law-enforcement officers went to each of the business locations and residences and seized, among other  things, cellular telephones, electronic devices, money, and vehicles.  [*416]  After several continuances, the trial court conducted a hearing on whether to issue a preliminary injunction  on August 12 and 14, 2019. Thereafter, on August 16, 2019, it entered the following order: ""This case came on for hearing for consideration of the petition filed by the State of Alabama Attorney General  (hereinafter 'State of Alabama') for a preliminary injunction against Defendants, TY Green's Massage Therapy,  332 So. 3d 413, *414; 2021 Ala. LEXIS 12, **2 Page 5 of 16   Inc., Yuping Tang, and Liu Jiao a/k/a Serena Tang. All parties were represented by counsel. Upon  consideration of the evidence received ore tenus, the Court finds as follows: ""On April 17, 2019, the State of Alabama filed its Verified Complaint for Injunctive, Declaratory or Other Relief.  This Court entered the Ex Parte Temporary Restraining [**6]  Order with Asset Freeze, Appointment of a  Receiver, Other Equitable Relief, and Order to Show Cause Why Preliminary Injunction Should Not Issue on  the same date. This Court set a preliminary injunction hearing for April 29, 2019. On April 24, 2019, counsel for  the Defendant, Liu Jiao a/k/a Serena Tang, made an oral motion to continue the preliminary injunction hearing.  This Court granted said request and reset the preliminary injunction hearing to June 17, 2019. On June 10,  2019, the Defendant, Liu Jiao a/k/a Serena Tang, filed a second motion to continue hearing on the preliminary  injunction. This Court granted said request and reset the hearing to August 12, 2019. ""This Court must view the State of Alabama's petition for injunctive relief in light of the following requirements  recognized by the Alabama Supreme Court: ""'A preliminary injunction should be issued only when the party seeking an injunction demonstrates: (1)  that without the injunction the [party] would suffer irreparable injury; (2) that the [party] has no adequate  remedy at law; (3) that the [party] has at least a reasonable chance of success on the merits of his case;  and (4) that the hardship imposed on the [party opposing [**7]  the preliminary injunction] by the injunction  would not unreasonably outweigh the benefit accruing to the [party seeking the injunction].'

The evidence  introduced by the State of Alabama failed to establish such irreparable injury. ""Second, the State of Alabama failed to establish that there is no adequate remedy at law. To the contrary, the  Court is satisfied that there are adequate remedies at law, to include other civil, criminal and/or administrative  remedies; i.e., the Alabama Board of Massage Therapy to revoke licenses."" (Emphasis added.) On August 16, 2019, the State filed a  [*417]  notice of appeal to this Court. On that same date, it also filed a  motion for a stay of the action pending appeal; the trial court denied that motion on August 19, 2019.

Discussion The State argues that it was entitled to a preliminary injunction because, it says, it proved all four elements  necessary for the issuance of a preliminary injunction. We disagree. In its complaint in this case, the State alleged: 332 So. 3d 413, *417; 2021 Ala. LEXIS 12, **8 Page 7 of 16   ""1. Human trafficking is commonly referred to as a modern-day form of slavery. Although human trafficking  cases traditionally fall within two general categories -- sex trafficking or labor trafficking -- approximately  twenty-five business models have been identified, including the illicit massage business model ('IMB'), see The  Typology of Modern Slavery, Polaris Project, https://polarisproject.org/typology (last accessed April 4, 2019).  Under this business model, the business is presented as a single storefront that [**11]  offers legitimate  massage services from women from China that are in their mid-thirties to late fifties. Traffickers use victims'  cultural background, coupled with psychological and/or financial manipulation, to coerce and/or deceive the  victims. ""2. Traffickers exploit long-standing cultural values and/or beliefs to coerce victims. These include the ideas of:  (a) preserving honor of self and family; (b) maintaining the status quo or solidarity; (c) honoring an obligation of  reciprocation and/or repaying a 'favor'; (d) relying on existing relationships or an established group  for  support; and (e) being self-sufficient and choosing to endure conditions, maintaining an inner focus on control  and acceptance of failure. Victims are typically indirect in their communications, emphasizing non-verbal  methods, and value tradition over change; thus, disclosure of providing sex for money or accepting they are a  'victim' of human trafficking can be difficult due to these cultural beliefs. ""3. These cultural beliefs also provide a mechanism for traffickers to isolate and control victims. When  recruited, this business model initially appears reasonable based on the victims' business experience  [*419]   in [**12]  China and the belief that massage therapy can be 'learned, on the job' without any previous work  experience. See Recognize the Signs, Polaris Project,https://polarisproject.org/human-trafficking/recognize- signs (last accessed April 10, 2019). Victims may also consider the situation safer because they are rarely  alone. It is common for victims to live together, either in an apartment or a house, and be transported from their  residence to work by individuals connected to the trafficker. This may prevent the victims from independently  meeting basic needs, such as purchasing food or feminine products. ""4. Victims may be monitored on closed circuit television cameras, both at the IMB and where they live. ""5. Oftentimes victims are moved frequently between IMB locations, as well as moved to different cities and  states. This may prevent the victims from having knowledge of their location. It is also common for traffickers to  hold victims' identification documents. Further, in some instances, victims may fear being arrested or deported. ""6. It is also not uncommon for human trafficking victims to work excessively long hours or to go unpaid, be  paid very little, or be paid only through tips.  [**13] See Recognize the Signs, Polaris Project,  https://polarisproject.org/human-trafficking/recognize-signs (last accessed April 10, 2019). They may also  have a scripted or inconsistent story. Id. ""7. Additionally, there are numerous misconceptions about human trafficking that help organizations like the  Defendants' thrive. Two common misconceptions are that human trafficking does not occur in the United  States, see, e.g., The Department of Homeland Security's Blue Campaign, https://www.dhs.gov/blue- campaign/myths-and-misconceptions (last accessed April, 3, 2019), and that an individual who initially  consents to his or her situation is not being trafficked. See Human Trafficking Myths and Facts, Polaris  Project, https://polarisproject.org/human-trafficking-myths-and-facts)(last accessed April 9, 2019). Yet human  trafficking is not only occurring in the United States, but also in Madison County, Alabama. Individuals from  other countries may immigrate to the United States on the belief that they will find legal, gainful, employment in  the United States, but actually find themselves under the control of traffickers and being coerced to perform  commercial sex acts and/or labor. This is what is [**14]  happening at the Defendants' massage businesses  in Huntsville, Madison, and Decatur, where their 'employees' are subjected to both labor and sexual servitude  so the Defendants' enterprise can profit. ""8. This case involves both first-and second-degree human trafficking as those offenses are defined in  Sections 13A-6-152 and -153 of the Code of Alabama. Under Section 13A-6-157.1(a) of the Code of Alabama,    332 So. 3d 413, *418; 2021 Ala. LEXIS 12, **10 Page 8 of 16   the Attorney General is authorized to bring an action seeking 'to restrain by temporary restraining order, or  temporary or permanent injunction,' acts of human trafficking if he 'has reason to believe that any person,  corporation, or any other legal entity is engaging in, has engaged in, or is about to engage in' acts of human  trafficking. In addition, Section 13A-6-157.1(b) authorizes the Attorney General to bring an action 'to recover  actual damages for victims of acts or practices performed in violation of' Alabama's Human Trafficking laws. ""9. The evidence collected during this investigation has revealed that the Defendants are running illicit  massage  [*420]  businesses that serve as fronts for a human trafficking operation. In the Defendants'  organization, the 'employees' work incredibly long hours during which at least some of them are expected to  engage in sex acts with the businesses' customers. [**15]  When the victims are not 'working,' they seem to  have little freedom of movement; they are transported in groups to and from the Defendants' businesses and  are kept in houses owned by the Defendants where they are left to eat and sleep in terrible conditions. The  Defendants, on the other hand, have reaped millions of dollars in revenue from their businesses, and the  Attorney General now brings this action in order to put an end to their conduct and protect their victims from  further harm. ""10. This case also involves Alabama's Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Ala. Code § 8-19-1, et seq. The  Deceptive Trade Practices Act authorizes the Office of the Attorney General to seek a temporary restraining  order, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, when it has reason to believe that a person or  business is engaging in any act or practice declared to be unlawful under the Deceptive Trade Practices Act.  Ala. Code § 8-19-8(a). Section 8-19-5(27) of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act specifically prohibits engaging  in any 'unconscionable ... act or practice in the conduct of trade or commerce.' It is, without a doubt,  unconscionable to coerce immigrant women into serving as virtual slaves in furtherance of one's business. For  that reason, too, [**16]  the State brings this action to stop the Defendants' ongoing unlawful practices and to  prevent such unlawful conduct in the future. (Citations to exhibits omitted.) During the hearing, the State argued that it had established that the defendants were engaging in human  trafficking. Then, with regard to the irreparable-injury element, it asserted: ""[T]he State does suffer immediate and irreparable harm. The duty of the State -- part of the duty of the State is  to protect its citizens from being subjected to this type of behavior. If these businesses are allowed to reopen  while this case continues, then this behavior can continue."" Finally, in its brief to this Court, the State argues: ""The [first] factor to be considered is whether the State would suffer immediate and irreparable injury without  the issuance of an injunction. See Ormco Corp.[ v. Johns], 869 So. 2d [1109,] 1113 [(Ala. 2003)]. The trial court  ruled that the State had failed to satisfy this factor. (C. 769.) But there can be no doubt that it did. Human  trafficking is evil, [**17]  and giving the [defendants] the opportunity to continue perpetrating that evil during  the pendency of this litigation would clearly cause the State immediate and irreparable injury. Thus, the trial  court's ruling was erroneous."" Based on its allegations in its complaint and its arguments during the hearing and before this Court, the State could  have established an irreparable injury only if it presented evidence to establish that the defendants were engaging  in human trafficking. Because the trial court found that the State had not established an irreparable injury, it  appears that, even though it did not make an explicit finding, that court at least implicitly made a finding  [*421]  of  fact that the State had not presented evidence indicating that it had at least a reasonable chance of succeeding in  proving that the defendants were engaging in human trafficking. The evidence before the trial court and before  this Court supports such a conclusion. With regard to first-degree human trafficking, § 13A-6-152, Ala. Code 1975, provides, in relevant part: ""(a) A person commits the crime of human trafficking in the first degree if: 332 So. 3d 413, *419; 2021 Ala. LEXIS 12, **14 Page 9 of 16   ""(1) He or she knowingly subjects another person to labor servitude or sexual servitude. "".... "".... [**18]  ""(c) A corporation, or any other legal entity other than an individual, may be prosecuted for human trafficking  in the first degree for an act or omission only if an agent of the corporation or entity performs the conduct which  is an element of the crime while acting within the scope of his or her office or employment and on behalf of the  corporation or entity, and the commission of the crime was either authorized, requested, commanded,  performed, or within the scope of the person's employment on behalf of the corporation or entity or constituted  a pattern of conduct that an agent of the corporation or entity knew or should have known was occurring."" With regard to second-degree human trafficking, § 13A-6-153, Ala. Code 1975, provides, in relevant part: ""(a) A person commits the crime of human trafficking in the second degree if: ""(1) A person knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a  venture or engagement for the purpose of sexual servitude or labor servitude. ""(2) A person knowingly recruits, entices, solicits, induces, harbors, transports, holds, restrains, provides,  maintains, subjects, or obtains by any means another person for the purpose of labor servitude or [**19]   sexual servitude.

With regard to Alabama's statutes criminalizing human trafficking, § 13A-6-151, Ala.

LEXIS 12, **20 Page 11 of 16   During the hearing, the State presented evidence indicating that, in September 2018, the Madison Police  Department received an anonymous tip that a customer had gone into the [**24]  defendants' Madison location for  a massage and that he had been touched inappropriately. As a result, the department started an investigation of TY  Green's Massage Therapy that included, among other things, sending multiple men into the business locations  undercover to get massages and conducting surveillance of the business locations and of the houses where the  employees of the business were housed. The evidence showed that the private massage rooms had signs  instructing customers to keep their underwear on. Those rooms also had peepholes in the doors from which  managers could look in to make sure that nothing illegal was occurring behind closed doors. The State also presented evidence indicating that, during the investigation, some of the massage therapists  touched clients in places they were not supposed to touch according to Board of Massage Therapy guidelines;  some massage therapists straddled clients and/or touched the clients with the intimate parts of their bodies and/or  touched the intimate parts of the clients' bodies; and at least one massage therapist engaged in sexual acts,  including intercourse, with a client. In the factual background set forth in the complaint, however, [**25]  the State  alleged that one of the ""victims"" had attempted to attribute the sexual contact to ""bad customers"" rather than to the  defendants. The investigation also revealed that the massage therapists lived in houses owned by the Tangs; that  the Tangs provided transportation for the therapists each day to get to the business locations where they worked;   [*424]  and that the therapists normally worked 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. The State further presented evidence indicating that the defendants transported their employees to their banks;  however, the testimony indicated that the defendants waited in the lobby area while the employees conducted their  own banking transactions. Investigators found personal papers and banking documents, as well as cash, personal  cellular telephones, and iPad tablet computers, when they searched the various business locations and residences. Finally, the State presented testimony about facts and circumstances that are common in human-trafficking  cases. However, the State did not present any testimony from any of the employees of the defendants that it  alleged were victims of human trafficking, including those who were named specifically in the complaint,  even [**26]  though a Mandarin Chinese interpreter was available during the hearing. In contrast, the defendants presented evidence from two of the defendants' former employees, an expert on  Chinese culture, and multiple former clients. Pengyu testified that he was born in Hebei, China; that he was not smuggled into or coerced to live in the United  States; that he had worked for the defendants from March 2017 until their business was shut down; and that he now  lives in Houston and provides massages. He also testified that he has a passport and a work permit, that he had  them in his possession while he worked for the defendants, and that the defendants' other employees also all kept  their own legal documents. Pengyu further testified that he was trained in massage at a school in New York and  that he was not threatened, forced, or coerced to leave New York and start working for the defendants in Huntsville. Pengyu testified that, while he worked for the defendants, he lived in a house that they provided; that he paid the  defendants $10 rent per day to live there; that 5 or 6 other people lived there; and that they were allowed to leave  the house for shopping, fun, etc. He also testified that he had [**27]  been free to live somewhere else but that he  had chosen to live in the provided housing. Pengyu stated that the defendants had a vehicle to transport employees  to work, but he also stated that some of the employees owned their own vehicles. He also stated that he normally  had worked from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. for the defendants; that the days and hours he had worked had been his  choice; that he had never been threatened in any way to work certain hours or certain days; and that he had been  free to take off when he wanted to or needed to. Pengyu testified that the defendants' employees were paid half in cash and half by check. Specifically, he stated  that each employee was paid one-half of the cost of each massage he or she gave and was allowed to keep the  entire tip and that the employees had kept ledgers of the work they did each day and of the tips they had received.  He also stated that he could have left the job with the defendants any time he wanted to and that he had seen other  workers leave and discontinue their employment with the defendants. Finally, Pengyu testified that he had never  been told or encouraged to touch a customer in a sexual way; that employees had been told [**28]  every day not to  332 So. 3d 413, *423; 2021 Ala. LEXIS 12, **23 Page 12 of 16   have sexual contact with customers; and that the employees would have been fired if they had had such contact  with customers. Cheng Xiu Chai testified that she was born in China; that she had worked for the defendants for about four years;  that she had voluntarily left the defendants' employment in September 2018 and had gone  [*425]  to Los Angeles;  and that she now lives in Austin, Texas, and provides massages. She also testified that she has a passport and a  work permit and that she had kept them in her possession while she worked for the defendants. She further testified  that she had met the Tangs through friends and that she had moved from Los Angeles to Huntsville to work for the  defendants and that nobody had forced or coerced her to do so. Chai testified that she had lived in a house that had been provided by the defendants but that she could have  provided her own housing if she had wanted to. She also testified that she had worked at other places providing  massages and that other employers had provided housing and transportation and also had had similar hours of  operation. Chai further testified that the residents had been responsible for cleaning the house and that [**29]  they  could leave the house when they were not working. She stated that she did not have her own transportation when  she worked for the defendants, but she added that some employees did have their own transportation. Chai testified that she normally had worked for the defendants from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. However, she stated  that she had been allowed to take off any time she had wanted to and that, in fact, she had taken off a lot to rest.  She testified that she had kept one-half of the cost of each massage and all of her tips; that she had kept a ledger  every day that she had worked; and that she had been paid partially in cash and partially by check. Chai also  testified that she had her own bank account and that the defendants did not have access to it. Finally, Chai testified  that she had never been instructed to touch customers in a sexual manner; that she had been told daily not to touch  customers in a sexual manner; and that she had never touched any customer in a sexual manner. Jing Shu Zhao, who has lived in the United States for 9 years and works in real estate in the Huntsville area, but  who was born in China and had lived there for almost 30 years, was presented as an expert [**30]  on Chinese  culture. She testified that, in China, it is common for employers to provide communal or dormitory-type housing and  transportation to work for employees. She also testified that some Chinese and other Asian businesses that are  located in the United States provide such housing and transportation for their employees. Finally, multiple clients testified that they had been to the various business locations over various periods. They all  testified that they had not ever seen, heard, or experienced any inappropriate or sexual contact by an employee  during a massage. In this case, the State did not present any evidence to establish that the defendants knew that sexual contact was  occurring between some employees and customers, much less evidence that they had induced, coerced, or forced  the employees to engage in such activity. In fact, both of the former employees who testified stated that they had  been specifically instructed each day not to have sexual contact with customers. Likewise, even though many of the  employees had worked long hours, the State did not present any evidence to establish that the defendants had  induced, coerced, or forced them to work those long hours. In [**31]  fact, both of the former employees who  testified stated that they had been allowed to take time off when they wanted to, and Chai specifically testified that  she had taken a lot of time off to rest. Also, the State did not establish that the defendants had controlled where their employees lived or their  transportation. Instead, even though the employees had  [*426]  lived in housing that was provided by the  defendants and had been transported to work in the defendants' vehicles, both of the former employees who  testified stated that they could have lived somewhere else and that they could have provided their own  transportation if they had so chosen. The State also presented evidence to establish that at least one other  employee had owned and driven his own vehicle at times. Further, the State did not present any evidence to establish that the defendants had controlled the employees'  money. Rather, the evidence showed that the employees had been paid one-half of their fee for each service plus  100% of their tips, that the employees had their own bank accounts, and that the employees met individually with  332 So. 3d 413, *424; 2021 Ala. LEXIS 12, **28 Page 13 of 16   bank tellers to determine how they would manage their money. Also, the State did not present [**32]  any evidence  to establish that the defendants had controlled their employees' personal documents. Instead, the evidence from  both the State and the defense showed that the employees had possession of their own passports, work permits,  immigration documents, and bank cards. Finally, both Pengyu and Chai testified that they had voluntarily chosen to  work for the defendants; Pengyu testified that he had seen other employees voluntarily leave their employment with  the defendants; and Chai testified that she had voluntarily left her employment with the defendants in September  2018. Applying the ore tenus rule, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that the State had not established that  the defendants were engaging in human trafficking. It also could have reasonably concluded that the State had  simply presented allegations to that effect and that the defendants had presented conflicting evidence to refute  those allegations. This Court has explicitly stated that HN5[ ] ""[i]njunctions will not be granted 'merely to allay  apprehension of injury; the injury must be both imminent and irreparable in a court of law.'"" Teleprompter of Mobile,  Inc. v. Bayou Cable TV, 428 So. 2d 17, 19-20 (Ala. 1983) (quoting Cullman Prop. Co. v. H.H. Hitt Lumber Co., 201  Ala. 150, 153, 77 So. 574, 577 (1917)).

Johns, 869 So. 2d at 1113-14. The evidence supports the trial court's finding that the State did not  establish that irreparable harm for which there would be no adequate remedy at law would likely result if the trial  court failed to enter a preliminary injunction. Therefore, the trial court did not exceed its discretion in making that  finding and in denying the State's request for a preliminary injunction.",1
"Davis v. McKenzie, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9735","ORDER ADOPTING REPORTS OF MAGISTRATE JUDGE THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon: 1. The Report and Recommendation [DE 71] submitted by United States Magistrate Judge Barry S. Seltzer  regarding the cross-motions for summary judgment filed by Defendant Public Broadcasting Service (""PBS"")  [DE 40] (""PBS's Motion"") and Plaintiff Corey Davis [DE 57] (""Davis's Motion""); 2. The Report and Recommendation [DE 72] submitted by Judge Seltzer regarding Plaintiff's Motion to Strike  pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f) [DE 59]; and 3. The Report and Recommendation [DE 73] submitted by Judge Seltzer regarding the claims against  Defendants Shamere McKenzie, Sun Gate Foundation (""Sun Gate""), and Hannah Terry contained in Plaintiff's  Complaint [DE 1] (Claims 1-19).  Page 2 of 3   The Court notes that no objections have been filed to the Reports, and the time for doing so has passed.  Nonetheless, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), the Court has conducted a de novo review of the record [*2]  in this  case, including the Complaint, PBS's Motion, Davis's Motion, and the Reports, and is otherwise advised in the  premises. Upon careful consideration, the Court agrees with Judge Seltzer's thorough analysis and will adopt the  Reports in their entirety. Plaintiff commenced this action in October 2016 and, in his Complaint, asserts claims for defamation, slander,  invasion of privacy, civil conspiracy, and infliction of emotional distress against Defendants based upon statements  made about Plaintiff by Defendant McKenzie, and later disseminated through various media, including website  postings, a live speech, and television, which were allegedly viewed in Florida by Plaintiff's friends and family. See  DE 1. On February 27, 2017, the Court granted Plaintiff permission to proceed in forma pauperis (""IFP"") and  determined that this matter should proceed because the Complaint states a plausible claim for relief. DE 18.  However, as Judge Seltzer notes, ""the Court's initial screening occurred before opposing counsel had entered an  appearance and before the parties had briefed the issues and proffered evidence for the Court's consideration."" DE  71 at 3 n.3. Now, based on the record currently [*3]  before the Court, it is clear that Plaintiff's claims are frivolous. As set out in  the Reports, Plaintiff filed a nearly identical defamation action in the Northern District of Illinois (the ""Illinois Action"")  that was dismissed with prejudice for failing to state a claim (under Florida law) pursuant to § 1915(e)(2), (g). DE 71  at 23. Plaintiff never disclosed either the filing or the dismissal of that action to the Court. The Court agrees with  Judge Seltzer that the reasons for the dismissal of the Illinois Action apply here, that Plaintiff is incapable of  establishing either the ""falsity"" element or the ""defamatory"" element of his claims against PBS as Plaintiff's  reputation was already thoroughly damaged by ""the widely disseminated allegations of [his] violence and physical  and sexual abuse of several adult and minor females, his conviction for sex trafficking a 12-year oId girl, and his  subsequent conviction for assaulting a fellow inmate resulting in serious bodily injury,"" and that Plaintiff's claims  against PBS are frivolous. Id. at 38. The Court also agrees that Plaintiff's claims against McKenzie, Sun Gate, and  Terry are barred by res judicata and are frivolous or malicious due to the dismissal of [*4]  the Illinois Action and  Plaintiff's failure to disclose same to the Court. Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows: 1. The Reports [DE 71, DE 72, and DE 73] are ADOPTED; 2. PBS's Motion for Summary Judgment Pursuant to Section 768.295, Florida Statutes (Anti-Slapp Statute) [DE  40] is GRANTED; 3. Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment [DE 57] is DENIED; 4. Plaintiff's Motion to Strike [DE 59] is DENIED; 5. All claims contained in Plaintiff's Complaint [DE 1] are DISMISSED with PREJUDICE pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  § 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), (ii), and (g) as Plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and/or the  claims are ""frivolous or malicious;"" and 6. The Clerk of Court is directed to CLOSE this case and DENY as moot all pending motions. DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at Fort Lauderdale, Broward County, Florida, this 18th day of January, 2018.

"United States v. Todd, 627 F.3d 329","[*330]  AMENDED OPINION NOONAN, Circuit Judge: Jerome Eugene Todd appeals his conviction of three counts of sex trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a)(1) and one count of conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. We affirm the  convictions. The statute, captioned the Trafficking Victim's Protection Act (TVPA), is a new effort to deal with a social ill whose  international as well as interstate dimensions have invited federal attention and action. The TVPA was enacted in  December 2000 and amended, as relevant here, in December 2003, July 2006 and December 2008. The statute  focuses on those (usually men) who make money out of selling the sexual  [*331]  services of human beings  (usually women) they control and treat as their profit-producing property. Subtitled  [**2] ""Sex trafficking of children or by force, fraud, or coercion,"" the law strikes at two particularly  vicious permutations of commercialized sex: at the exploitation of minors in the business of selling sex and at the  use of criminal means to produce the product being sold. This case falls into the second slot. FACTS We state the facts as to Todd's treatment of four women: Todd and Kelsey Kirschman. Just eighteen in January 2005, Kelsey was still in high school in Bellingham. Todd,  age 26, was not working but had cash. They dated, going to dinner and to the movies. In May 2006, Todd  suggested they get a place together. He also told her that they could get rich together if she worked as a  prostitute. He would advertise her in the Seattle Weekly. She agreed. He ran the ad with a picture of her, offering  ""full service"" for $200. Calls came in from men, and she responded to them. She gave up a job at Fred Meyer  because Todd wanted her available for prostitution 24/7. Todd also arranged for her services to be posted on  Craigslist. At Todd's direction, she also ""walked the track,"" that is, she hung out in an area frequented by prostitutes  and potential customers. Todd laid down rules for her to  [**3] obey. As she testified, ""You had to, basically, do  everything he wanted."" Most basically, ""You had to give him all the money."" Todd allotted Kelsey $35 each day to  pay for condoms, food, and gas. Todd maintained his rules psychologically by making Kelsey feel that she was ""nothing."" He maintained his rules  physically by beating her ""from head to toe,"" blacking one of her eyes and chipping one of her teeth. When she was  2 1/2 months pregnant, he demanded that she abort the child, and she complied. She tried to hide some of her  earnings as a prostitute from Todd, but he found them and confiscated them. She did not leave him because she  thought that she ""had nowhere else to go,"" was ""scared,"" and had lived ""under this man's rules"" for a year and a  half. Reduced to this state of dependence, Kelsey performed a number of acts by agreement with Todd to further his  traffic in the bodies of other women. She ""groomed"" Whitney T. — that is, coached her — as to how she should  conduct herself as a prostitute working for Todd. She placed ads in Craigslist and Seattle Weekly advertising the  sexual availability of Whitney and two other women who came to work for Todd as prostitutes. She rented hotel   [**4] rooms for these women to use with customers, provided them with cellphones to receive calls from  customers, and purchased condoms for them to supply to customers. In these actions, she collaborated with Todd. Todd and Whitney T. Whitney T., aged twenty, met Todd at a party in October 2006. Whitney was the unmarried  mother of a young child. She was unemployed and living with a girlfriend in Everett. She and Todd liked each other  and began a relationship. Todd had no job but he wore nice clothes and had cash. Whitney learned eventually that  his income came from Kelsey's work as a prostitute. 627 F.3d 329, *329; 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 23501, **1 Page 4 of 9   In January 2007, Todd told Whitney that if she too worked as a prostitute for a couple of years she could have nice  cars and a nice house. In February 2007, Whitney went on her first call. She moved into an apartment with Todd  and Kelsey. Todd advertised her services on Craigslist and the Seattle Weekly.  [**5] Todd imposed the rules that  Whitney earn $500 in a day and  [*332]  that she turn the money over to him. She believed that Todd would beat  her if she held any money back. She saw Todd beat Kelsey for violating one of his rules and was herself beaten by  him for breaking his rule against speaking to black pimps. Whitney T. twice left Todd and twice voluntarily returned to him. On July 3, 2007, she left him for good. She  continued to work as a prostitute on her own. Todd and Whitney E. Todd met Whitney E., aged eighteen, in June 2007. She had dropped out of high school, had  left her father's home and her mother's home, was using drugs, was living with a boyfriend, and had been working  for a week as a prostitute. The day after she met Todd, her boyfriend suggested that she work for Todd. The next  day she began to work for him as a prostitute. He gave her a cellphone and clothes from Wal-mart. He advertised  her on Craigslist. He told her that he expected her to service five customers per day and earn at least $900. He put  her in an apartment with a prostitute who worked for his cousin, Trent. Trent told her he would enforce Todd's  rules physically. In July 2007, Todd himself assaulted her when she  [**6] questioned one of his rules. She  telephoned her mother for help and later the same day left the apartment with her mother and reported the assault  to the police. Todd and Jemelle L. Todd met Jemelle on her twentieth birthday in July 2007. She was living with her mother and  working as a caregiver. They began to date. Todd had no job but had cash. In October 2007, she leased a house,  and she and Todd moved in together. Jemelle had previously engaged in four or five acts of prostitution. Todd now told her it would be an easy way to  make money and have nice things. Todd gave her a phone to take calls from customers, and she began to respond  to them after initially protesting. Todd advertised her availability in the Seattle Weekly and on the internet without  her knowledge or consent. Todd told her that his rule was that she provide ""full service,"" charge $200 per customer,  report the transaction by telephone and turn all the money over to him. He provided her with marijuana. Jemelle was scared seeing Todd beat Kelsey, and she was scared by his threat that she would regret it if she left  him. Once she attempted to leave and he ""pushed me down."" The indictment covered the use of Jemelle from   [**7] October 2007 to November 2007. PROCEDURE On November 21, 2007, Todd was indicted. On February 8, 2008, a superseding indictment was returned. Trial  began May 12, 2008. After seven days, the jury found Todd guilty on all counts. Both before and after the verdict  Todd moved for a judgment of acquittal. On September 29, 2008, Todd was sentenced to five years imprisonment for conspiracy to violate the TVPA; to 26  years to run concurrently on each of the TVPA counts involving respectively Whitney T., Whitney E., and Jemelle;  and to ten years on the count of transporting a prostitute in interstate commerce. Todd does not appeal his conviction or sentence on the count of transportation of a prostitute. He appeals his  conviction on all of the other counts. ANALYSIS The Statute. HN1[ ] Sex trafficking of children or by force, fraud, or coercion (a) Whoever knowingly— 627 F.3d 329, *331; 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 23501, **4 Page 5 of 9   (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or within the special maritime [*333]  and territorial jurisdiction  of the United States, recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture which has engaged in  an act described  [**8] in violation of paragraph (1), knowing that force, fraud, or coercion described in subsection (c)(2) will be used to cause the person to  engage in a commercial sex act, or that the person has not attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b). (b) The punishment for an offense under subsection (a) is— (1) if the offense was effected by force, fraud, or coercion or if the person recruited, enticed, harbored,  transported, provided, or obtained had not attained the age of 14 years at the time of such offense, by a fine  under this title and imprisonment for any term of years not less than 15 or for life; or (2) if the offense was not so effected, and the person recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, or  obtained had attained the age of 14 years but had not attained the age of 18 years at the time of such offense,  by a fine under this title and imprisonment for not less than 10 years or for life. (c) In this section: (1) The term ""commercial sex act"" means any sex act, on account of which anything of value is given to or  received by any person. (2) The term ""coercion"" means— (A) threats of serious harm  [**9] to or physical restraint against any person; (B) any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that failure to perform an act would  result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any person; or (C) the abuse or threatened abuse of law or the legal process. (3) The term ""venture"" means any group of two or more individuals associated in fact, whether or not a legal  entity. 18 U.S.C. § 1591. We consider the statutory elements in turn. Effect on interstate or foreign commerce. The TVPA was enacted after Congress took a substantial amount of  evidence on the traffic in the sexual services of women based on importing women from around the world by force  or fraud. See Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-386, 114 Stat. 1464,  1466 (2000). Congress concluded that prostitution in American cities encouraged and enlarged the market for this  traffic from abroad. Id. Sex traffic is a global matter. In addition to effect on foreign commerce, sex traffic in this case was conducted by advertising across state lines  and so affected interstate commerce. The TVPA is unlike the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 13981, which sought  [**10] to protect  women by making gender-motivated crimes of violence actionable and was found to be beyond the power of  Congress because its subject matter was not commerce. United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 120 S. Ct. 1740,  627 F.3d 329, *332; 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 23501, **7 Page 6 of 9   146 L. Ed. 2d 658 (2000). The TVPA deals with commerce within the power of Congress to regulate. The defendant  does not question the act's constitutionality. Todd's knowledge. Here is a crux. Could Todd have known when he soft-soaped Whitney T., Whitney E., and  Jamelle L. to go to work for him that later  [*334]  ""force, fraud, or coercion would be used"" to cause each of them  to engage in commercial sex? How does anyone ""know"" the future? HN2[ ] What the statute means to describe, and does describe awkwardly, is a state of mind in which the knower  is familiar with a pattern of conduct. If ""to know"" is taken in the sense of being sure of an established fact, no one  ""knows"" his own or anyone else's future. As William Shakespeare said of time in Sonnet 115, its ""million'd accidents  creep in"" and nothing is completely stable, no plan is beyond alteration. When an act of Congress requires  knowledge of a future action, it does not require knowledge in the sense of certainty as to a future act. What the  statute requires  [**11] is that the defendant know in the sense of being aware of an established modus operandi  that will in the future cause a person to engage in prostitution. The government's evidence showed that Todd had such awareness when he persuaded Whitney T. to work for him.  He had an established practice of living off the earnings of Kelsey, doing so by rules controlling her work and  payment of the proceeds to him. The jury could conclude that Todd knew he would follow the same pattern with  Whitney T. and then with Whitney E. and Jamelle L. Just as a mother who has had one child in school and  prepared his lunch knows that she will prepare the school lunch for her second child, just as a judge knows that his  law clerks will use Westlaw, so Jerome Todd knew that he would use coercion to cause his sex workers to make  money for him. The findings of the jury. The jury was instructed: The defendant is charged with count 2 of the first superseding indictment with sex trafficking, in violation of  Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591(a)(1) and 1591(b)(1). In order for the defendant to be found guilty  of that charge, the government must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: First,  [**12] beginning in or about February 2007, and continuing through in or about July 2007, the defendant  knowingly did recruit, entice, harbor, transport, provide, or obtain a person, that is, [Whitney T.]; Second, the defendant did so knowing that force, fraud, or coercion would be used to cause [Whitney T]. to  engage in a commercial sex act; and Third, the defendant's actions were in or affecting interstate commerce. The jury answered these questions affirmatively as to Whitney T. and answered the same questions affirmatively as  to Whitney E. and Jamelle L. The evidence of Todd's knowledge of his own modus operandi in securing an income  from prostitution by a pattern of coercion was sufficient to support the jury's verdict. HN3[ ] The knowledge required of the defendant is such that if things go as he has planned, force, fraud or  coercion will be employed to cause his victim to engage in a commercial sex transaction. That required  knowledge brings the predictable use of force, fraud, or coercion into the definition of the defendant's crime. The sentence. HN4[ ] Section (b) is entitled ""The punishment for an offense under subsection (a)"". Section (b),  therefore, does not create a new crime. It specifies the  [**13] penalties for each of the crimes set out in (a). Two of  these crimes depend on the age of the victim. The third crime is referenced summarily as an offense ""effected by  force, fraud or coercion."" The summary reference does not enlarge the crime identified in (a). Section (b) is  punishing the act identified in (a). A defendant who satisfies the elements of subsection (a) [*335]  ""shall be  punished as provided in subsection (b)."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) (emphasis added). This reading comports with  Congress's desire that the ""sentencing provision of section 1591(b). . . correspond fully with the language in the  substantive offense provision in section 1591(a)."" H.R. Rep. No. 108-264, pt. 1, at 20 (2003) (emphasis added). The evidence was enough to support Todd's conviction on the counts of sex trafficking. 627 F.3d 329, *333; 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 23501, **10 Page 7 of 9   Other counts. Todd was also convicted of conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 and sentenced  to five years imprisonment, and he was convicted of transporting a prostitute in interstate commerce in violation of  18 U.S.C. § 2421 and sentenced to ten years imprisonment. The sentences are concurrent. Todd appeals his  conviction for conspiracy, but not his conviction for  [**14] transporting a prostitute. Sufficient evidence was  presented to show that he entered into agreement with Kelsey Kirschman to further a practice of sex trafficking,  and the jury found the necessary facts. There was no error. The judgment of conviction and the sentence are AFFIRMED. Concur by: M. SMITH  M. SMITH, Circuit Judge, concurring: I join in full the panel's amended opinion affirming Todd's convictions and sentence for sex trafficking in violation  of 18 U.S.C. § 1591, and conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. I write separately  only to explain my decision to join in the amended opinion. We previously held, sua sponte, that Todd's sentence  violated United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 236, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2005), because the jury  was not asked whether ""the offense was effected by force, fraud, or coercion."" See United States v. Todd, 584  F.3d 788, 793-94 (9th Cir. 2009). Having reconsidered the issue in light of the government's petition for rehearing, I  have changed my perspective.  As I read 18 U.S.C. § 1591, there  [**15] is no ""hole in the statute."" Contra Todd, 584 F.3d at 793. Rather, 18  U.S.C. § 1591(a) covers only those instances of sex trafficking in which force, fraud, or coercion was actually  used, or where the trafficking involved children under the age of 14 or between ages 14 and 18. Subsection (b)(1)  simply establishes the punishment for those offenses. Where a defendant engages in sex trafficking without the  use of force, fraud, or coercion, or where children are not involved, his conduct is criminalized by a different set of  statutes. This reading is compelled both by a plain reading of the statute and by its legislative history. Title 18, section 1591 is titled ""Sex trafficking of children or by force, fraud, or coercion."" ""Although statutory titles  are not part of the legislation, they may be instructive in putting the statute in context."" Singh v. Gonzales, 499 F.3d  969, 977 (9th Cir. 2007). By using this title, Congress intended to criminalize two forms of sex trafficking it  considered ""severe forms of trafficking in persons"": sex trafficking where the victim is under 18 years of age, and  sex trafficking in which the act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion. See Pub. L. No. 106-386, 114 Stat. 1464,  1466, 1470 (2000)  [**16] (explaining that in passing the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, which enacted  18 U.S.C. § 1591, Congress was especially concerned  [*336]  with these two ""severe forms of trafficking in  persons""). Subsection (a) bears this out. A prosecution may be brought under subsection (a) where a person ""recruits, entices,  harbors, transports, provides, or obtains by any means a person,"" ""knowing"" either that: (1) ""force, fraud, or  coercion . . . will be used to cause the person to engage in a commercial sex act,"" or (2) the victim ""has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)  (emphasis added). The phrase ""will be used"" in subsection (a) does not leave open the possibility that force, fraud, or coercion was  not eventually used in committing the offense. Rather, it simply allows for a conviction even where the defendant    627 F.3d 329, *335; 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 23501, **13 Page 8 of 9   did not personally use force, fraud, or coercion. In other words, a defendant will only be charged with violating the  statute if force, fraud, or coercion was actually used at some point in commission of the offense. By using the  phrase ""will be used"" as opposed to something more speculative such as ""could be used""  [**17] or ""might be  used,"" the statute describes definitive conduct. Had force, fraud, or coercion not actually been used to cause the victim to engage in a commercial sex act, Todd  could not have been prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 1591. The appropriate statutes criminalizing sex trafficking not  involving the use of force, fraud, or coercion are 18 U.S.C. §§ 2421 and 2422. Section 2421 proscribes ""knowingly  transport[ing] any individual in interstate or foreign commerce, or in any Territory or Possession of the United  States, with intent that such individual engage in prostitution, or in any sexual activity for which any person can be  charged with a criminal offense."" Unlike the minimum 15-year term of imprisonment under section 1591, section  2421 carries a 10-year maximum. Section 2422 criminalizes ""knowingly persuad[ing], induc[ing], entic[ing], or  coerc[ing] any individual to travel in interstate or foreign commerce, or in any Territory or Possession of the United  States, to engage in prostitution, or in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal  offense.""  It carries a 20-year maximum sentence. The government's decision to prosecute the case is a backwards-looking exercise. The use of force, fraud, or  coercion to cause a victim to engage in a commercial sex act brings the case into the realm of section 1591, and  the government must then ask whether the defendant ""knew"" that force, fraud, or coercion would be used. The  only question, and that which Todd argued in his appeal, is whether the defendant knew at the time he committed  the offense that force, fraud, or coercion would be used.  As the panel members now agree, Todd's knowledge  that force,  [*337]  fraud, or coercion would actually be used ""does not require knowledge in the sense of   [**19] certainty as to a future act."" Amended Maj. Op. at 18515. Based on an established pattern of conduct, Todd  knew that force, fraud, or coercion would be used to cause his victims to engage in commercial sex acts. Under this reading of section 1591(a), there is no gap in the statute. Section 1591(b) provides that ""if the offense  was effected by force, fraud, or coercion"" the defendant is to be sentenced to a mandatory 15-year minimum  prison term. So too if no force, fraud, or coercion was involved but the victim is under 14. If no force, fraud, or  coercion was involved, but the victim is between 14 and 18, the defendant is to be sentenced to no less than 10  years imprisonment.  If a jury finds that the defendant knew ""force, fraud, or coercion"" would be used to cause a  person to engage  [**20] in a commercial sex act, it necessarily finds that ""the offense was effected by means of  force, fraud, or coercion."" Indeed, a defendant who satisfies the elements of subsection (a) ""shall be punished as  provided in subsection (b)."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) (emphasis added). This reading comports with Congress's desire  that the ""sentencing provision of section 1591(b). . . correspond fully with the language in the substantive offense  provision in section 1591(a)."" H.R. Rep. No. 108-264, pt. 1 (2003) (emphasis added). The record in this case shows that Todd in fact used such ""force, fraud, or coercion"" to commit the offense.  Whitney T. testified that once in May 2007, Todd demanded she perform oral sex on him. After she refused, Todd              627 F.3d 329, *336; 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 23501, **16 Page 9 of 9   grabbed her by her throat, threw her backwards over the bed, and threatened to hit her with a bottle over her head  while ""screaming at the top of his lungs."" On another occasion, Todd woke Whitney  [**21] T. up in the middle of the  night and began screaming at her for talking to another pimp. Todd punched her in the back, then grabbed her by  the throat and threw her up against the wall while calling her an ""out-of-pocket bitch."" On a third occasion, Todd  beat her because she met with a black male friend of hers. According to Todd, all black men are potential pimps  and so Todd forbade Whitney T. from any contact with them. After Whitney T. violated this rule, Todd choked her  and punched her in the chest until she was black and blue. Because of this evidence, all of which the jury heard, the government prosecuted and the jury convicted Todd of  violating section 1591(a). Indeed, the jury was asked whether Todd knew that ""force, fraud, or coercion would be  used to cause [Whitney T.] to engage in a commercial sex act."" Amended Maj. Op. at 18515 (emphasis added).  By finding that Todd knew that force, fraud, or coercion would be used, the jury necessarily found that force,  fraud, or coercion was actually used.         627 F.3d 329, *337; 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 23501, **18",1
"People v. Campbell, 51 Cal. App. 5th 463","BUTZ, Acting P. J.—Defendant Isiah Campbell appeals from the judgment entered after a jury found him guilty of  three counts of pimping (Pen. Code, § 266h, subd. (a)) and 11 counts of pandering (§ 266i, subd. (a)). He  contends reversal is required for a variety of reasons, including improper venue, insufficient evidence, the  pandering statute is void for vagueness, instructional error, ineffective assistance of counsel, and improper  conviction on multiple counts of pimping.  [**145]  We reject defendant's contentions and shall affirm the judgment. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND Factual Background We summarize the relevant facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdicts. (See People v. Abilez (2007) 41  Cal.4th 472, 504 [61 Cal. Rptr. 3d 526, 161 P.3d 58].) Additional information necessary [***2]  to the resolution of  this appeal is set forth below. For purposes of consistency and clarity, we refer, as the parties did in the trial court,  to the alleged victims in this case as Jane Doe 1 through Jane Doe 12 (hereafter JD1, JD2, etc.; collectively Jane  Does).  51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *468; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **136; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***1 Page 16 of 40   JD1's Testimony JD1 is from Serbia. When she lived there, she occasionally had sex with men in exchange for money or favors,  which was an acceptable and a common occurrence at the time. Around 2008, JD1 immigrated to the United States. Thereafter, she married a man named Rade and worked  various jobs. At some point, she posted an advertisement on Backpage.com, a classified advertising Web site  commonly used to advertise for prostitution activities, and had sex with men in exchange for money or favors  “from time to time.” In early 2014, JD1 met defendant online and they began exchanging messages. They met in person about a year  later. Shortly thereafter, she [*470]  became pregnant. At the time JD1 met defendant in person, she was living at a  motel in Sacramento. Although JD1 and Rade never “formally separated,” they had gone their “separate ways” by  2015. Defendant was good with computers and came up with a plan in early 2015 to make money [***3]  and travel by  having JD1 engage in sex for money. As part of the arrangement, he took pictures of her, designed and posted  advertisements for her on the Internet (e.g., Backpage.com), established the prices she charged for specific sexual  acts, negotiated the “meet up” or “dates” (which largely took place in hotel rooms), booked hotels for her, drove her  around as necessary, and protected her. In return, she agreed to split her earnings with him equally. Defendant set up dates for JD1 in Seattle and various cities in the Sacramento area, the San Francisco Bay Area,  the Central Valley, and Southern California. During the dates, he would wait outside the hotel or somewhere  nearby. Defendant used fear and violence to dominate and control JD1. Following the birth of their daughter in December  2015, JD1's relationship with defendant changed for the worse. He became controlling and violent. He dictated  when and where she would engage in prostitution activities and forced her to work all day, including shortly after  giving birth. He decided where she lived and when she could see her daughter. He had sex with her against her will  and occasionally beat her before they had sex. He also beat her [***4]  if she failed to follow his directions or if she  expressed her opinion. The beatings occurred frequently, about “every other day.” On a few occasions, the beatings  were “very bad, very, very bad.” JD1 attempted to end her relationship with defendant several times. However, he  [**146]  would eventually find her  and “bad things would happen,” including an incident where he beat her and hit their daughter. In addition to his  violent and controlling behavior, defendant decided to take a larger share of JD1's earnings. He took her bank card  and withdrew money from her account without her permission to pay for his personal expenses and expenses  related to other women with whom he was working. When she complained about how he was handling her  earnings, he beat her. JD1 worked with defendant until he was arrested in March 2017. During the time period she worked with defendant,  he also worked with JD2, JD3, JD5, JD6, JD7, JD8, JD9, JD10, and JD11. Although JD1 never worked with [*471]   JD4, she recognized JD4 from a photograph and noted that defendant had told her that he worked with JD4. When  asked, JD1 explained that “working” for the women meant exchanging sex for money. The Sting Operation    51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *469; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **145; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***2 Page 17 of 40   On March 16, 2017, [***5]  detectives from the El Dorado County Sheriff's Department conducted an undercover  human trafficking sting operation at the Best Western Motel in Placerville. After researching various Web sites, an  undercover investigator set up a date with JD1 at the motel. At 8:45 p.m., defendant dropped JD1 off at the motel. After she and the undercover investigator agreed on the sex  act to be performed and she received the negotiated sum of $300, officers entered the room and detained her.  Meanwhile, officers approached defendant's car and detained him. A search of his person revealed the following  items: approximately $2,000 in cash, two cell phones (hereafter, HTC cell phone & ZTE cell phone), some currency  from the Philippines, a credit card, a bank deposit receipt in the amount of $1,100, and a receipt from a 7-Eleven  store in Seattle. JD2's and JD3's Testimony JD2's and JD3's testimony was similar to and consistent with JD1's testimony. They both began working with  defendant, who referred to himself as “Pharaoh” the tech/computer savvy personal assistant, after he promised to  provide them Internet advertising services in exchange for a share of their earnings from prostitution activities.  He [***6]  gave them “professional” names and linked their phone numbers to his Google Voice account, which  allowed him to monitor their communications and to communicate with clients on their behalf. He placed  advertisements for them online (e.g., Backpage.com), set up their dates with clients, established the prices they  charged for specific sex acts, booked their hotel rooms, drove them to meet clients, and waited nearby during their  dates. He also provided JD2 with condoms and lubrication, and supplied some of the women with drugs. Defendant was physically and verbally abusive to JD2. While he did not physically abuse JD3, he threatened her  with physical violence and verbally abused her. He was also controlling over JD2 and JD3 and frequently angry. He  demanded that the women he worked with stay in their hotel rooms all day; they were allowed to leave only with his  permission. He decided how many dates the women would go on and attempted to make JD3 engage in [*472]   sexual acts she was not comfortable with, including sex without a condom and allowing a client to urinate in her  mouth. He also decided when the women had earned enough money to travel to a new location. At some point, he  decided to take [***7]  a larger  [**147]  share of JD2's and JD3's earnings. He also took JD2's bank card and  withdrew money from her account to pay for expenses related to other women working with him. During the time period JD2 worked with defendant, he also worked with JD1, JD3, JD5, JD6, JD8, JD9 and JD11.  At times, JD2 worked with JD1, JD3, and JD5. She explained that she occasionally shared a room with these  women, and that the “work” the women engaged in was exchanging sex for money. According to JD2, defendant  treated JD1 better than the other women he worked with and seemed to care about her more and was more  controlling over her. When asked, JD2 said that she saw defendant provide JD1 with condoms and lubrication. During the time period JD3 worked with defendant, he also worked with JD1, JD2, JD6, JD8, and JD11. JD3  estimated that approximately 10 different women worked with defendant from the summer of 2016 to early 2017.  When asked, JD3 indicated that the “work” the women engaged in was exchanging sex for money. She noted that  she shared a room with JD1, JD6, JD8, and JD11. After defendant was arrested, he called JD2 from jail and asked her to change the passwords to some of his  accounts, including his Hotels.com [***8]  account and his “pinknjuicy” and “yunggoon” e-mail accounts. He  explained that she needed to do this because he “got caught human trafficking.” He also told her not to talk to the  police.     51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *471; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **146; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***4 Page 18 of 40   Police Contact in Galt Around 12:15 a.m. on August 17, 2016, a Galt police officer found defendant asleep in his car, which was parked in  a city parking lot. A search of the car revealed the following items: a large quantity of condoms, vaginal fungus  cream, female hygiene products and toiletries, a bottle of Extenze pills (a male sex enhancement supplement), a  piece of paper containing a list of e-mail addresses and passwords (one of which had JD5's name next to it), a  laptop computer, and multiple motel keys and digital cameras. When the officer opened the laptop, he observed an  e-mail account with a “bunch” of e-mails, one of which was asking about availability and prices for different sex  acts. The laptop also contained numerous photos of women wearing lingerie or very little clothing.  [*473]  When defendant was searched, the officer found cash, credit cards, and wire-transfer receipts in the amount of  $1,030 and $130. Electronic Evidence Following defendant's arrest, the police monitored his jail calls. [***9]  During one of those calls, he asked a woman  to change the passwords to his Backpage.com account and his nottierose@xxxxx.com e-mail account. In doing so,  he revealed the passwords to those accounts. Thereafter, a search warrant was obtained for several e-mail  accounts associated with defendant: nottierose@xxxxx.com, zaemai@xxxxx.com, pinknjuicyqueens@xxxxx.com,  and yunggoon.blogspot@xxxxx.com. The search yielded a large data file, which included folders for each of the  women involved in this case, i.e., JD1 through JD12. Inside the folders were pictures of the women, some of which  showed them posed in provocative positions. The women were partially nude or barely clothed in the pictures. The  data file also contained a photograph of defendant and photographs of many of the women involved in this case in  a file named “PinknJuicy Logo Designs.” A search warrant was also obtained for information from Hotels.com related to defendant's  [**148]  zaemai e-mail  address. The information obtained from the execution of this warrant showed that between December 1, 2015, and  March 15, 2017, this e-mail address was used in 432 hotel reservations with Hotels.com. The hotels were located in  Seattle, [***10]  and in various locations throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, the Sacramento area, Yuba City,  the Central Valley, and Southern California. The reservations were made under the names of defendant, JD1, JD2,  JD3, JD7, JD8, JD9, JD10, and JD11. A search warrant was also obtained for documents from Backpage.com related to phone numbers and an e-mail  address (pinknjuicyqueens@xxxxx.com) associated with defendant. In response to the warrant, Backpage.com  provided law enforcement over 1,000 portable document format (PDF) files, all of which referenced the user name  nottierose. The search revealed the following: From May 23, 2015, to March 15, 2017, there were 241 posts for  JD1. From October 16, 2016, to March 16, 2017, there were 249 posts for JD2. From April 11, 2016, to November  14, 2016, there were 74 posts for JD3. From January 31, 2016, to February 22, 2016, there were two posts for  JD4. From August 9, 2016, to February 2, 2017, there were 38 posts for JD5. From April 11, 2016, to November  12, 2016, there were 20 posts for JD6. From May 31, 2016, to September 16, 2016, there were 28 posts for JD7.  From November 5, 2015, to December 18, 2016, there were 76 posts for [*474]  JD8. From [***11]  November 9,  2015, to March 16, 2017, there were 87 posts for JD9. From March 29, 2016, to May 21, 2016, there were 23 posts  for JD10. From December 22, 2015, to November 30, 2016, there were 27 posts for JD11. From December 12,  2015, to November 30, 2016, there were six posts for JD12. The posts (i.e., advertisements) included barely clothed images of the women posed in provocative positions. Some  of the images contained nudity.  51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *472; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **147; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***8 Page 19 of 40   Cell Phone Evidence A search of defendant's HTC cell phone disclosed that he had logged into the Backpage.com account with the user  name nottierose on multiple occasions on the day he was arrested. The data on the phone also showed that he had  user accounts for various Web sites, including Backpage.com, Hotels.com, and Reddit.com. The phone also had  Google Voice service, which was associated with the nottierose e-mail address. The HTC cell phone contained numerous e-mails from Backpage.com and Google Voice that were sent to the  nottierose e-mail address. In some of the e-mails from Backpage.com, defendant's name was printed underneath  the nottierose e-mail address. The HTC cell phone contained a list of 1,243 contacts, including [***12]   zaemai@xxxxx.com, ladydianatheprincess@xxxxx.com, pinknjuicyqueens@xxxxx.com, nottierose@xxxxx.com,  and yunggoon.blogspot@xxxxx.com. The contact profile for the zaemai e-mail account referenced defendant's ZTE  cell phone number. The contact profile for defendant referenced the nottierose e-mail account. A search of defendant's ZTE cell phone disclosed files with folders for some of the women involved in this case.  The phone also had various applications (or “apps”) on it, including apps for Hotels.com and Google Voice, and  contained nearly 13,000 e-mails from Backpage.com indicating that advertisements had been renewed or moved to  the top of the list. The e-mails were sent to the nottierose e-mail  [**149]  address, which was associated with  defendant's name in the phone's contact list. In some of the e-mails from Backpage.com, defendant's name was in  the body of the e-mail. The ZTE cell phone also contained various other prostitution-related information (e.g., information related to  Backpage.com advertisements) as well as images and/or messages involving JD1 through JD11 and Rade. There  was also information related to JD1's and JD2's bank cards. The HTC cell phone [***13]  and ZTE cell phone both contained text message exchanges between JD1 and  defendant. In one text message, JD1 indicated [*475]  that she was considering working with another person due to  defendant's behavior. There were also threatening messages sent from defendant to JD1. Among other things, he  told her, “I beat Bitches for doing dumb shit,” “Tomorrow I will beat your ass,” and “Bitch, I'll smack the shit out of  you.” Defendant's cell phones also contained threatening text messages sent to JD2 and JD3. In one of the  messages to JD2, defendant said: “I'm gonna beat you up stay off the phone while you're with your client.” He also  texted JD3, “I hit girls.” Reddit.com Based on recorded jail conversations involving defendant, a warrant was obtained to search an online discussion  blog, Reddit.com, for posts and comments by a user named “Zaemai” on the board “PimpFeet.” The name Zaemai  was associated with a photograph of defendant found on one of his cell phones. The search revealed that in March 2015, August 2015, and May 2016, the user named Zaemai posted comments  on the board PimpFeet. In the March 2015 post, Zaemai stated that he was “new to pimping” and asked for advice  on how to “better advertise [***14]  for more upscale clients.” He wrote, “I have one ho right now from Eastern  Europe who is about 30. We are in Nor Cal, about an hour and a half from Frisco, and making less than $500 a day  online. I told her we are not leaving town until she makes 1K per day for 10 straight days. I am trying to figure out  how to better advertise for more upscale clients. Can you all help? If I can figure that out, I may even be able to get  a couple more hos added to my stable.” In response to advice he received, he stated, “We are in Nor Cal, not far  from Cow Town. We don't dance at clubs or hang out in hotels. She wants to move to a better apartment. As soon  as we can figure out how to obtain some better clients, high-class independent escorts is my vision.” In the August 2015 post, the user named Zaemai commented on a post titled, “Knocking Independent Hos.” He  indicated that he had a woman that was “turning five tricks a day from Backpage” but complained that she had no  high-end clients, no car, and a “shitty home.” He wrote, “She has been independent for two years because the last  51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *474; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **148; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***11 Page 20 of 40   P told her a bunch of shit and nothing happened. I like her because she's not on drugs and she stays in the room  all [***15]  day for a measly $300. I'm trying to get some information on how to get her out of this situation.” Later that same day, the user named Zaemai commented on a post titled, “Lacing Her With Game.” In his comment,  he offered advice on how to avoid the police, advising that, “One way to avoid the police is to teach her not  to [*476]  talk about services over the telephone.” He also advised that pimps should “[c]heck [their] local forum and  read what independent providers are saying,” explaining: “This site is more about clothes and cars pimps should try  to catch bitches with as well as for passing on catch phrases and lingo to impress bitches. I've never seen any  discussions on screening,  [**150]  booking travel arrangements, encryption devices, and that sort of stuff pimps in  2015 should be aware of. There are few pimps who are aware human trafficking is a charge a lot of young  brothers are being dealt. Nobody wants to talk about that issue because it's boring. I'm not a pimp, I'm here for the  entertainment.” In the May 2016 post, the user named Zaemai indicated that he was working with several prostitutes but  complained about the price of hotel rooms and asked for help in how to secure a private residence, [***16]   explaining that: “The challenge is I only want to stay a couple of months and I may have to stack two to three  chickens in the same place and the traffic and headaches are sure to increase.” He later posted several comments  about pimping, including: “Being a pimp is about finding what a bitch lacks in her life and meeting that need for her.  Identify the needs of a bitch and fulfill them, then use that to your advantage and that's the day you'll be a pimp.”  He also said, “When pimping crosses real life, many of y'all don't know where to go… . If a bitch want to raise my  seed, she married to game for life. I ain't changing for no ho bitch. The heart of a pimp is a cold thing… . A bitch  with kid just received a ball and chain with no key. That bitch has checkmated every time. She can't go nowhere,  but back to me. I'm not a pimp, I'm here for the entertainment.” In another comment, he said, “I do know pimps are  supposed to get bitches to fall in love with them and trust them. There are no rules to getting another person to fall  in love. A pimp has gotta do what path a pimp is to do to build his stable… . I ain't no pimp, I am here for the  entertainment. Your pimp.” Defendant's [***17]  Testimony Defendant testified on his own behalf at trial. He confirmed that he began texting with JD1 around early 2014, and  that they exchanged messages for about a year before they met in person. At that time, he was living in  Sacramento. Defendant explained that he started exchanging messages with JD1 after he saw her advertisement  on MyRedBook.com. He claimed that he wanted to date her and that he did not know the Web site was commonly  used to advertise prostitution services.  [*477]  After defendant met JD1 in person, she asked him if he was familiar with Backpage.com and posting  advertisements on that Web site. She explained that another person had set up her Backpage.com account and  that she did not know how to post advertisements online. Defendant claimed that he did not know anything about  the Web site but agreed to take a look at it and get back to her. After doing some research, he agreed to post  advertisements for her if she paid the posting fee. When asked, defendant could not recall ever having a  conversation with JD1 about exchanging sex for money. Defendant explained that he primarily used JD1's premium Backpage.com account, nottierose@xxxxx.com, for his  postings on that Web site. [***18]  He posted an advertisement for himself, offering his services as an assistant in  various services, including marketing, creating profiles and Web pages, making travel arrangements, and screening  clients. He acknowledged that he also posted advertisements for some of the women involved in this case.  However, he claimed that the advertisements were not for prostitution activities. Rather, the advertisements he  posted were for services that did not involve sexual acts (e.g., modeling,  [**151]  dancing, massages, body    51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *475; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **149; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***14 Page 21 of 40   blotting). He insisted that he never encouraged the women to engage in prostitution activities with clients and  claimed that he did not know exactly what the women did with clients. He also claimed that he did not use any  nudity in his postings and did not advertise any services for money, although he bragged about his skill in posting  advertisements and said that every person he posted for told him they made more money with his advertisements.  According to defendant, the women he worked with had access to their advertisements, had seen them, and could  delete them if they wanted to. He noted that JD1, JD5, JD8, JD9, and JD11 posted online advertisements for  themselves and other women [***19]  using JD1's Backpage.com account. As for JD1, defendant explained that she was experienced in the “industry,” and that she dated other men while  they dated. She told him what cities they should travel to and where they should stay. He claimed that she worked  with other men who posted advertisements for her, and that he did not care that she worked with these men. When  asked, he said that he never forced her to travel without their daughter. As for JD2, defendant explained that they agreed to start a business relationship after she responded to his  Backpage.com advertisement. He claimed that their business relationship did not involve him arranging for her to  have sex with other men in exchange for money. Rather, he agreed to fix [*478]  and repost her advertisement on  Backpage.com, and told her she would have to pay him about half of her earnings to cover advertisement fees,  hotel costs, and transportation expenses. He admitted that he had access to her bank account and that he used her  bank card to make hotel reservations in her name. When asked, he explained that he took JD2 and JD5 with him  to Seattle in February 2017 for seven to 10 days. He stayed with family while they stayed in hotel rooms [***20]  he  booked for them. As for JD3, defendant explained that he met her in March 2016 through one of her friends who was already working  with him—JD6. Thereafter, they entered into a similar business relationship that he had with JD2, except that he  estimated JD3's expenses would be about 30 percent of her earnings because she was only 18 years old and  needed to share a hotel room with other women for safety reasons. As for JD4 through JD12, defendant admitted that he posted advertisements for JD5, JD8, JD9, and JD12, but  denied or did not remember posting advertisements for JD4, JD6, JD10, and JD11. He claimed that he was not  the primary person who responded to clients asking for services from the women he worked with. Rather, he only  replied and communicated with clients if the women asked him to, or when he first started working with them. He  further explained that all of the women who worked with him shared a hotel room at some point, and that he did not  force  [**152]  them to do anything. He noted that his financial arrangement with each woman was different; the  amount they paid him depended on their expenses. According to defendant, the women did not work for him but  rather he worked with them. [***21]  He was just their assistant. Defendant denied beating any of the women involved in this case but admitted to smacking JD1's head once and  “popp[ing]” her in the face once. He also admitted that he hit his daughter once, and that he pushed JD2 one time  and sent text messages to JD1, JD2, and JD3 threatening to hit them. He explained that he threatened to beat JD2  because she was texting while on a date with a client. He further explained that he threatened to beat JD1 because  she texted negative things all day and called him a “stupid, dumb nigger.” Defendant admitted that he linked JD1's, JD2's, and JD3's phone numbers to his Google Voice account but claimed  that he did not set up dates for them [*479]  on his own, explaining that he only responded to messages from clients          51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *477; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **151; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***18 Page 22 of 40   when the women requested his assistance. He maintained that he did not provide condoms or drugs to any of the  women who worked with him. When asked about the numerous condoms found in his car by the Galt police officer,  he claimed the condoms belonged to him, explaining that he had many girlfriends. Although he was aware that the owner of Backpage.com was arrested on prostitution charges, defendant admitted  that he continued [***22]  to post advertisements on that Web site. He also admitted that he observed men come to  the hotel rooms occupied by the women in this case and stay for a short period of time, and that he collected money  from the women to pay for online advertising and other costs associated with their working relationship. However,  he insisted that he did not know exactly what the women did for the money they received. He made this claim after  he was confronted with evidence of two text messages he sent to JD1, which said: “You need your ass kicked  because it's wrong to have the baby in front of a client having sex,” and “You're looking for a guy that follows you  around while you fuck whoever, but want some for money and others don't have to pay.” Defendant did not deny  sending these messages. Instead, he explained that the messages were meant to be hurtful. Defendant denied posting any comments to the PimpFeet board on Redditt.com, explaining that the e-mail account  associated with the postings (zaemai@xxxxx.com) was a “group account” accessible by several other people and  that one of those people must have made the postings. Procedural History In June 2018, an amended information was filed in the [***23]  El Dorado County Superior Court charging  defendant with 18 counts: human trafficking (§ 236.1, subd. (b); counts 1, 4 & 7); pimping (§ 266h, subd. (a);  counts 2, 5 & 8), and pandering by procuring (§ 266i, subd. (a); counts 3, 6 & 9 through 18). Counts 1 through 3  were alleged to have occurred in El Dorado County and involved JD1. Count 18 was alleged to have occurred in  Santa Clara County and involved JD12. The remaining counts were all alleged to have occurred in Sacramento  County and involved JD2 (counts 4, 5 & 6), JD3 (counts 7, 8 & 9), JD4 (count 10), JD5 (count 11), JD6 (count 12),  JD7 (count 13), JD8 (count 14), JD9 (count 15), JD10 (count 16), and JD 11 (count 17). Following a jury trial, defendant was found guilty on counts 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 through 17 (i.e., 11 counts of  pandering involving JD1 through JD11 and three counts of pimping involving JD1, JD2, & JD3).  [**153]  He was  found not guilty on counts 1, 4, 7 (i.e., the human trafficking counts involving JD1, [*480]  JD2, & JD3), and count  18 (pandering involving JD12). The trial court sentenced him to an aggregate term of 19 years 4 months in state  prison. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. DISCUSSION 1.0 Improper Venue As noted, this case was prosecuted in El Dorado County. The [***24]  amended information alleged that counts 1  through 3 occurred in El Dorado County and counts 4 through 17 occurred in Sacramento County. According to the  People, jurisdiction was proper in El Dorado County as to counts 4 through 17 pursuant to section 784.7,  subdivision (c)—the statute authorizing a single trial of specified sex offenses committed in multiple counties. On  appeal, defendant contends that his convictions on counts 10 through 17 must be reversed due to improper  venue. He argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over these counts because the People failed to present       51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *479; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **152; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***21 Page 23 of 40   written evidence showing that the Sacramento County District Attorney's Office agreed to the prosecution of the  offenses in El Dorado County. We disagree. 1.1 Applicable Legal Principles HN1[ ] Determining the proper venue presents an issue of law to be decided prior to trial. (People v. Posey (2004)  32 Cal.4th 193, 201 [8 Cal. Rptr. 3d 551, 82 P.3d 755].) Accordingly, we apply the de novo standard of review.  (People v. Galvan (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 846, 852 [85 Cal. Rptr. 3d 776].) HN2[ ] CA(1)[ ] (1) “Traditionally, venue in a criminal proceeding has been set, as a general matter, in the county  or judicial district in which the crime was committed. Under the provisions of … section 777, that continues to be the  general rule in California. That statute provides in part: ‘[E]xcept as otherwise provided by law the [***25]   jurisdiction of every public offense is in any competent court within the jurisdictional territory of which it is  committed.’” [*481]  (People v. Simon (2001) 25 Cal.4th 1082, 1093–1094 [108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 385, 25 P.3d 598]  (Simon), fn. omitted; see § 777.) HN3[ ] Nevertheless, “[a]lthough under section 777 the county in which a felony was committed is, in the absence  of another statute, the locale designated as the place for trial, in California numerous statutes—applicable to  particular crimes or in specified circumstances—long have authorized the trial of a criminal proceeding in a county  other than the county in which the offense itself occurred.” (Simon, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 1094.) Accordingly, as  long as a statute provides for a trial to be in a county other than the one in which the crime was committed, a  defendant has no “right” to be  [**154]  tried in the locale of the crime. A change of venue may be ordered by the  court in a criminal case under appropriate circumstances. (Id. at p. 1097 [explaining that “venue statutes do not  involve a court's jurisdiction in the fundamental sense of subject matter jurisdiction”].) Section 784.7, subdivision (c) provides: “If more than one violation of Section 236.1 [(human trafficking)], 266h  [(pimping)], or 266i [(pandering)] occurs in more than one jurisdictional territory, the jurisdiction of any of those  offenses, and for any offenses properly joinable [***26]  with that offense, is in any jurisdiction where at least one of  the offenses occurred, subject to a hearing pursuant to Section 954, within the jurisdiction of the proposed trial. At  the Section 954 hearing, the prosecution shall present written evidence that all district attorneys in counties with  jurisdiction of the offenses agree to the venue. Charged offenses from jurisdictions where there is not a written  agreement from the district attorney shall be returned to that jurisdiction. In determining whether all counts in the  complaint should be joined in one county for prosecution, the court shall consider the location and complexity of the  likely evidence, where the majority of the offenses occurred, the rights of the defendant and the people, and the  convenience of, or hardship to, the victim or victims and witnesses.” HN4[ ] “A defendant's right to be tried in a venue authorized by statute is a right subject to waiver by the  defendant.” (People v. Aleem (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1160, fn. 9 [51 Cal. Rptr. 3d 140], citing Simon, supra,  25 Cal.4th at p. 1097.) In Simon, our Supreme Court stated, “[T]aking into account the nature and purpose of the  venue safeguard and the substantial state interest in protecting the integrity of the process from improper  ‘sandbagging’ by a defendant, we conclude that a defendant who fails [***27]  to raise a timely objection to venue in  a felony proceeding forfeits the right to object to venue—either at trial or on appeal.” (Simon, at p. 1104.)  [*482]  1.2 Analysis       51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *480; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **153; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***24 Page 24 of 40   The amended information charged defendant with human trafficking (§ 236.1, subd. (b)), pimping (§ 266h, subd.  (a)), and pandering (§ 266i, subd. (a)) in El Dorado County and in Sacramento County. Defendant did not file a  pretrial motion objecting to venue in El Dorado County. Nor did defense counsel orally object to venue at the pretrial  hearing where the prosecutor submitted three “jurisdiction letters” from the Sacramento County District Attorney's  Office. Instead, defense counsel asked the trial court whether the submitted letters would be part of the court's file  for purposes of the “appellate process.” On this record, we conclude defendant has forfeited his improper venue  claim. But even assuming the claim was preserved for appeal, it lacks merit. Having reviewed the relevant “jurisdiction” letters submitted to the trial court, we conclude the record contains  sufficient written evidence demonstrating that the district attorney in the county with jurisdiction over the offenses  alleged in counts 10 through 17 agreed to venue in El Dorado County. A fair reading of the record does not  support [***28]  defendant's contention that the Sacramento County District Attorney did not agree that venue was  proper in El Dorado County with respect  [**155]  to these offenses. The record reflects that an amended complaint  adding counts 10 through 17 was filed in March 2018. These counts alleged pandering in Sacramento County  involving JD4 through JD11. Eight days after the amended complaint was filed, the Sacramento County District  Attorney's Office sent a letter (i.e., the “third” letter) to the El Dorado County District Attorney's Office agreeing to  venue in El Dorado County for these offenses. The fact that the letter refers to the prosecution of defendant for  “Human Trafficking charges” and does not specifically mention pandering is not a basis to reverse defendant's  convictions on counts 10 through 17 for improper venue. The letter makes clear that the Sacramento County District  Attorney's Office agreed to the prosecution of defendant in El Dorado County for the offenses alleged in counts 10  through 17. The letter indicates that the Sacramento County District Attorney's Office was aware that, during the  course of the investigation of defendant for human trafficking, “it was determined that … [***29]  several of the  victims suffered similar conduct by … defendant in Sacramento.” (Italics added.) The letter goes on to [*483]   state, “It is our intention, by virtue of this letter, to enter into an agreement with your office [(i.e., the El Dorado  County District Attorney's Office)] pursuant to Penal Code section 784.7[, subdivision] (c), for your office to  prosecute the acts of human trafficking which occurred in Sacramento by [defendant].” On this record, we cannot conclude that reversal is required due to improper venue. Defendant provides no  authority and legal analysis compelling a contrary conclusion. Nor has he explained the purpose of the third letter  written by the Sacramento County District Attorney's Office. As noted, defendant concedes that the two earlier  letters written by the same office showed that the Sacramento County District Attorney agreed to venue in El  Dorado County for counts 4 through 9. In view of the timing and content of the third letter, it is evident that its  purpose was to provide consent to the prosecution of counts 10 through 17 in El Dorado County. 2.0 Sufficiency of the Evidence                 51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *482; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **154; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***27 Page 25 of 40   Defendant contends his convictions on counts 10 through 17 must be reversed  [**156]  because substantial  evidence [***30]  does not support the conclusion that he was guilty of pandering involving JD4 through JD11. He  argues there was insufficient evidence to establish that he “affirmatively influenced” any of these women to  “become a prostitute or continue in prostitution.” We disagree. 2.1 Standard of Review “HN5[ ] ‘When considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we review the  entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidence—that  is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value—from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the  defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.’ [Citation.] We determine ‘whether, after viewing the evidence in  the [*484]  light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements  of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.’ [Citation.] In so doing, a reviewing court ‘presumes in support of the  judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.’” (People v. Edwards  (2013) 57 Cal.4th 658, 715 [161 Cal. Rptr. 3d 191, 306 P.3d 1049].) “‘The same standard of review applies to cases in which the prosecution relies primarily on circumstantial evidence  … . [Citation.] “[I]f the [***31]  circumstances reasonably justify the jury's findings, the judgment may not be  reversed simply because the circumstances might also reasonably be reconciled with a contrary finding.” [Citation.]  We do not reweigh evidence or reevaluate a witness's credibility.’” (People v. Houston (2012) 54 Cal.4th 1186,  1215 [144 Cal. Rptr. 3d 716, 281 P.3d 799].) HN6[ ] The jury is entitled to draw reasonable inferences based on the evidence (People v. Livingston (2012) 53  Cal.4th 1145, 1166 [140 Cal. Rptr. 3d 139, 274 P.3d 1132]), and we must accept all logical inferences the jury might  have drawn from the evidence, even if we would have concluded otherwise (People v. Salazar (2016) 63 Cal.4th  214, 242 [202 Cal. Rptr. 3d 638, 371 P.3d 161]). “‘Although it is the jury's duty to acquit a defendant if it finds the  circumstantial evidence susceptible of two reasonable interpretations, one of which suggests guilt and the other  innocence, it is the jury, not the appellate court that must be convinced of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable  doubt. [Citation.]’” (People v. Zamudio (2008) 43 Cal.4th 327, 357–358 [75 Cal. Rptr. 3d 289, 181 P.3d 105].) “A  reversal for insufficient evidence ‘is unwarranted unless it appears “that upon no hypothesis whatever is there  sufficient substantial evidence to support”’ the jury's verdict.” (Id. at p. 357.) 2.2 Applicable Legal Principles HN7[ ] CA(2)[ ] (2) Pandering is “the business of recruiting a prostitute, finding a place of business for a  prostitute, or soliciting customers for a prostitute.” (People v. Dixon (2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1159–1160  [119 Cal. Rptr. 3d 901].) A panderer is “one ‘“who procures the [***32]  gratification of the passion of lewdness for  another.”’” (Id. at p. 1156, italics omitted.) The crime of “pandering comprises a broad range of conduct. [¶] The purpose of … section 266i is to ‘“… cover all  the various ramifications of the social evil of pandering and include them all in the definition of the crime” … .’”  (People v. DeLoach (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 323, 333 [254 Cal. Rptr. 831].) In enacting section 266i the Legislature  sought to “prevent prostitution ‘by discouraging persons other than the prostitute from augmenting and expanding  a prostitute's operation, or increasing  [**157]  the supply of [*485]  available prostitutes. [Citations.]’” (People v.  Zambia (2011) 51 Cal.4th 965, 973 [127 Cal. Rptr. 3d 662, 254 P.3d 965] (Zambia).) Taken together, “[t]he plain  intent and purpose behind all the provisions of section 266i … is to deter pimps or others from establishing new  working relationships in the unlawful prostitution trade.” (Id. at p. 978.) HN8[ ] Subdivision (a) of section 266i has six parts that “‘define the different circumstances under which the crime  of pandering may be committed.’” (People v. Leonard (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 465, 490 [175 Cal. Rptr. 3d 300]  (Leonard).) The commission of any one of the acts described in subdivision (a) constitutes the offense of  pandering. (People v. Charles (1963) 218 Cal.App.2d 812, 816 [32 Cal. Rptr. 653].) The statutory parts or  alternatives are not mutually exclusive, i.e., the parts can be violated at the same time. (See People v. Montgomery  (1941) 47 Cal.App.2d 1, 12, 24, 27–28 [117 P.2d 437] (Montgomery), disapproved on another ground in Murgia v.  51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *483; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **155; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***29 Page 26 of 40   Municipal Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d 286, 301, fn. 11 [124 Cal. Rptr. 204, 540 P.2d 44], People v. Dillon (1983) 34  Cal.3d 441, 454, fn. 2 [194 Cal. Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697] (plur. opn.), Zambia, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 981; see also  People v. Lax (1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 481, 486 [97 Cal. Rptr. 722].) The relevant subdivision [***33]  here is (a)(1),  (2), and (5). CA(3)[ ] (3) HN9[ ] Section 266i, subdivision (a)(1), provides that a person is guilty of pandering if he “[p]rocures  another person for the purpose of prostitution.” In the context of the pandering statute, the term “procure” has  been construed to mean “assisting, inducing, persuading or encouraging” a person to engage in prostitution.  (People v. Schultz (1965) 238 Cal.App.2d 804, 812 [48 Cal. Rptr. 328] (Schultz); Montgomery, supra, 47  Cal.App.2d at p. 12 [“the term ‘procure’ as used in the … [pandering] statute necessarily implies the use of  persuasion, solicitation, encouragement and assistance in achieving the [*486]  unlawful purpose”].) The  definition of “prostitution” as used in the pandering statute means “‘“sexual intercourse between persons for  money or other consideration”  [**158]  and “lewd” acts, for money or other consideration, confined to conduct  where the genitals, buttocks or female breasts of either the prostitute or the customer come in contact with some  part of the body or the other for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification of the customer or of the prostitute.’”  (People v. Maita (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 309, 317–318 [203 Cal. Rptr. 685].) CA(4)[ ] (4) HN10[ ] Section 266i, subdivision (a)(2), provides that a person is guilty of pandering if he “[b]y  promises, threats, violence, or by any device or scheme, causes, induces, persuades, or encourages another  person to become a prostitute.” Our Supreme Court [***34]  has held that causing, inducing, persuading or  encouraging someone to “become a prostitute” under this statute includes not only “recruiting someone to enter  the prostitution trade for the first time” but also behavior directed at “someone who is already an active  prostitute.” (Zambia, supra, 51 Cal.4th at pp. 973, 980–981 [this provision “places the focus on the defendant's  unlawful actions and intent, rather than making the targeted victim's character or occupation the determinative  factors for conviction”].) The Zambia court recognized “that when a pimp offers protection and support to a  prostitute in return for some or all of her income, the offer increases the likelihood that the prostitute will be able  to maintain or expand her activities, an outcome squarely at odds with the statutory goal.” (Zambia, at p. 974.) The  court further found that “[t]o encourage an established prostitute to change her business relationship necessarily  implies that a defendant intends a victim ‘to become a prostitute’ in the future regardless of her current status.” (Id.  at p. 975.)                                  51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *485; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **157; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***32 Page 27 of 40   Section 266i, subdivision (a)(5), provides a person is guilty of pandering if he “[b]y fraud or artifice, or by duress of  person or goods, or by abuse of any position of confidence or authority, procures another person [***35]  for the  purpose of prostitution, or to enter any place in which prostitution is encouraged or allowed within this state, or to  come into this state or leave this state for the purpose of prostitution.”  [*487]  HN12[ ] CA(5)[ ] (5) Pandering is a specific intent crime. To be guilty of the offense, the defendant must have  the specific intent to persuade, encourage or otherwise influence the target to become a prostitute. (Zambia,  supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 980 [construing § 266i, subd. (a)(2)].) In clarifying that pandering is a specific intent crime,  our Supreme Court explained that “the purpose and intent of the pandering statute … is to criminalize the knowing  and purposeful conduct of any person seeking to encourage ‘another person’ to work with the panderer or another  pimp in plying the prostitution trade.” (Zambia, at p. 980.) While Zambia involved the construction of section 266i,  subdivision (a)(2), our Supreme Court analyzed each of the parts of subdivision (a) and concluded that liability for  the proscribed conduct attaches regardless of whether the victim is already acting as a prostitute. The Zambia  court stated, “[W]hen harmonized and read together in context, [the parts of section 266i, subdivision (a)]  [**159]   plainly envision that any solicited ‘person,’ whether an active prostitute or not, may be the target of unlawful  pandering.” [***36]  (Zambia, supra, 51 Cal.4th at pp. 977–978; see id. at p. 981.) Such an interpretation “carries  out the Legislature's intent to combat the social evils inherent in recruitment for acts of prostitution, the  perpetuation of the trade by the management and support offered by pimps, and the particularly coercive and  socially dysfunctional activities associated with brothels.” (Id. at pp. 980–981 [noting that § 266i, subd. (a)(3) & (4)  are directed at conduct involving brothels].) HN13[ ] The crime of pandering requires no monetary gain. (§ 266i, subd. (a).) By contrast, the related crime of  pimping involves the deriving of support from another person's prostitution. (§ 266h, subd. (a).) 2.3 Analysis Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment, we conclude there was sufficient evidence from  which a reasonable jury could have concluded defendant was guilty on counts 10 through 17, which charged him  with pandering involving JD4 through JD11. At the outset, we pause to note that defendant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to his  pandering convictions involving JD1, JD2, or JD3. And with good reason. As set forth above, those witnesses  testified in detail about how defendant assisted and encouraged [*488]  them to engage in prostitution activities in  exchange for a share of their earnings. [***37]  Their testimony was corroborated by the sting operation,  defendant's testimony, evidence discovered during electronic searches (including cell phones), and searches of  defendant's person and car. We reject defendant's contention that there was insufficient evidence to support the  pandering convictions as to JD4 through JD11 because they did not testify, and therefore there was no substantial  evidence establishing that he “affirmatively influenced” any of these women “to become or be a prostitute.” On this  record, there was sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that defendant was guilty of  pandering involving JD4 through JD11. Collectively, the testimony of JD1, JD2, and JD3 showed that defendant worked with JD4 through JD11, and that  the “work” the women engaged in was prostitution activities. There was also evidence that defendant knowingly  assisted and encouraged JD4 through JD11 to engage in such activities. Among other things, the evidence showed  that he posted online advertisements for each of these women to perform “services,” which contained images of  them barely clothed and posed in provocative positions. Some of the images contained nudity. The       51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *486; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **158; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***34 Page 28 of 40   evidence [***38]  also showed that defendant booked hotel rooms for JD5 and JD7 through JD11. In addition, there  was evidence—the postings on Reddit.com—from which a reasonable jury could have concluded that defendant  admitted to being a pimp who assisted and encouraged the women he worked with to  [**160]  engage in  prostitution activities. When defendant testified, he admitted that he posted advertisements for some of the  nontestifying Jane Does, including posting advertisements on Backpage.com, which was a Web site commonly  used to advertise for prostitution activities. In view of the record, we conclude substantial evidence supports the pandering convictions on counts 10 through  17 involving JD4 through JD11. A reasonable jury could have found the essential elements of the crime as to each  woman beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence established that defendant was in the business of recruiting  prostitutes, finding a place of business for them (hotels), and soliciting customers for them. Substantial evidence  supports the jury's conclusion that JD4 through JD11 were part of that business. Contrary to defendant's contention, reversal is not required because there was no evidence that certain Jane Does  actually [***39]  engaged in an act of prostitution. HN14[ ] The crime of pandering does not require that actual  acts of prostitution take place. (People v. Osuna (1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 528, 531 [59 Cal. Rptr. 559].) Finally, we reject defendant's contention that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of pandering by procuring  because the evidence only showed [*489]  that he helped or assisted the nontestifying Jane Does engage in  prostitution by booking hotel rooms and/or posting online advertisements. In support of his position, defendant  relies on People v. Mathis (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1251 [219 Cal. Rptr. 693] (Mathis), which he argues recognized  that “‘procure’” does not mean assist, and that “[i]f a person decides to become a prostitute on her own, and the  defendant helps her engage in prostitution without affirmatively influencing her decision, the defendant could be  guilty of aiding and abetting [prostitution], but would not be guilty of pandering.” Contrary to defendant's  suggestion, Mathis does not hold as a matter of law that where a defendant assists a person who has already  decided to become a prostitute, the specific intent required for pandering cannot be satisfied. Rather, the Mathis  court held that the crime of pandering requires the specific intent to affirmatively influence a person to become a  prostitute, and that the [***40]  question of the defendant's intent is for the jury to decide, under a proper  instruction. (Id. at p. 1256.) In Mathis, the court reversed and remanded for retrial of the pandering charges  because the trial court had erroneously instructed the jury that the defendants could be convicted if they “‘assisted,  induced, persuaded, or encouraged another person to become a prostitute.’” (Id. at p. 1255.) Because the  instruction added the word “assisted” to the statutory terms, the Mathis court reasoned that the jury could have  convicted the defendants even if it found that they did not specifically intend to affirmatively influence the victim to  become a prostitute, but only helped her begin a new career. (Id. at p. 1256 & fn. 7.) Mathis instructs that while the  specific intent required for pandering by procurement “may well be inferred from acts of assistance, ‘we cannot  extrapolate therefrom, as a matter of law, that the inference must be drawn. Intent [to influence] is what must be  proved … .’” (Id. at p. 1256.) Here, unlike in Mathis, the jury was not instructed that it could convict defendant of  pandering by procuring for mere assistance. Rather, the jury was instructed that defendant could be convicted on  this theory only if it found [***41]  that the People proved he “successfully persuaded/procured a Jane Doe to  become a prostitute” with the “inten[t] to influence [her] to be a prostitute.” As we have discussed, the evidence   [**161]  was sufficient to support the pandering convictions involving the nontestifying Jane Does. 3.0 Constitutional Challenge to the Pandering Statute Defendant contends that section 266i, subdivision (a)(1), which criminalizes the “[p]rocur[ing of] another person for  the purpose of prostitution,” is unconstitutionally vague. His constitutional challenge is predicated on his  contention that the term “procure” along with the phrase “for the purpose of prostitution” are impermissibly vague  in violation of due process. First, he argues that the provision is unconstitutionally vague on its face because it fails  to provide “intelligible” notice of what is prohibited. According to defendant, the term “procure” is this context “is  ambiguous, confusing, and difficult to understand.” He insists that the provision “is so vague that it could [*490]  be  read as making it a felony for anyone to do anything relating to the prostitution of another person.” Second, he  argues that the provision is void for vagueness because, as applied to him in this case, “the statutory [***42]   language failed to give [him] fair notice that his conduct could amount to pandering by procuring, as defined in that  subdivision.” According to defendant, “[t]he statute gives notice that activity undertaken ‘for the purpose of  51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *488; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **159; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***37 Page 29 of 40   prostitution’ fell within the broad scope of the subdivision, but the vague term ‘procure’ used in that context failed  to differentiate between innocent activity, aiding and abetting misdemeanor prostitution, and felony pandering. It  failed to give [him] fair notice that posting an escort ad or providing technical escort assistance could amount to a  felony.” We reject each of defendant's related contentions, which we discuss together. 3.1 Applicable Legal Principles HN15[ ] CA(6)[ ] (6) “The constitutional interest implicated in questions of statutory vagueness is that no person  be deprived of ‘life, liberty, or property without due process of law,’ as assured by both the federal Constitution (U.S.  Const., Amends. V, XIV) and the California Constitution (Cal. Const., art. I, § 7). Under both Constitutions, due  process of law in this context requires two elements: a criminal statute must ‘“be definite enough to provide (1) a  standard of conduct for those whose activities are proscribed and (2) a standard for police enforcement and [***43]   for ascertainment of guilt.”’” (Williams v. Garcetti (1993) 5 Cal.4th 561, 567 [20 Cal. Rptr. 2d 341, 853 P.2d 507];  see People v. Maciel (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 679, 683 [6 Cal. Rptr. 3d 628] [“‘“[A] penal statute [must] define the  criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a  manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.”’”].) HN16[ ] “‘Although the [void-for-vagueness] doctrine focuses both on actual notice to citizens and arbitrary  enforcement, … the more important aspect of the vagueness doctrine “is not actual notice, but the other principal  element of the doctrine—the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.”  [Citation.] Where the legislature fails to provide such minimal guidelines, a criminal statute may permit “a  standardless sweep [that] allows policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal predilections.”’”  (People v. Brown (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 320, 336 [221 Cal. Rptr. 3d 854].) CA(7)[ ] (7) “‘HN17[ ] “[T]he starting point of our analysis is ‘the strong presumption that legislative enactments  “must be upheld unless their unconstitutionality clearly, positively, and unmistakably appears… .”’ [Citation.]”  [Citation.]’” (People v. Sullivan (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 524, 543 [59 Cal. Rptr. 3d 876].) [*491]   [**162]  “‘The fact  that a term is somewhat imprecise does not itself offend due process. Rather, so long as the language sufficiently  warns of the [***44]  proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and experience, the statute is  not unconstitutionally vague.’ [Citation.] ‘Inasmuch as “‘[w]ords inevitably contain germs of uncertainty,’”  mathematical precision in the language of a penal statute is not a sine qua non of constitutionality. [Citation.]’” (Ibid.) CA(8)[ ] (8) HN18[ ] “‘“A statute … cannot be held void for uncertainty if any reasonable and practical  construction can be given to its language.”’ [Citation.] Therefore, ‘a party must do more than identify some instances  in which the application of the statute may be uncertain or ambiguous; he must demonstrate that “the law is  impermissibly vague in all of its applications.” … [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Morgan (2007) 42 Cal.4th 593,  605–606 [67 Cal. Rptr. 3d 753, 170 P.3d 129].) Indeed, “‘[m]any, probably most, statutes are ambiguous in some  respects and instances invariably arise under which the application of statutory language may be unclear.’” (People  v. Ervin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1328–1329 [62 Cal. Rptr. 2d 231] [rejecting vagueness challenge as to  “‘immediately after’” and “‘in the vicinity’” in statute punishing robberies taking place while the victim is using an  ATM “or immediately after the person has used an [ATM] and is in the vicinity of the [ATM]”].) “‘[A] statute will not be  held void for vagueness at the [***45]  behest of a defendant whose conduct falls clearly within its bounds.  [Citation.]’” (Ibid.) HN19[ ] “[I]n determining whether the relevant language of [the statute] is sufficiently certain to meet the  constitutional requirement of fair notice, ‘we look first to the language of the statute, then to its legislative history,  and finally to the California decisions construing the statutory language.’” (People v. Heitzman (1994) 9 Cal.4th 189,  200 [37 Cal. Rptr. 2d 236, 886 P.2d 1229].) 3.2 Analysis CA(9)[ ] (9) We conclude that defendant's constitutional challenge to the pandering statute is without merit. A  similar challenge was rejected nearly 45 years ago in People v. Hashimoto (1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 862 [126 Cal.  Rptr. 848] (Hashimoto). In that case, the appellate court explained that section 266i is “designed to discourage  prostitution by discouraging persons other than the prostitute from augmenting and expanding a prostitute's  51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *490; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **161; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***42 Page 30 of 40   operation, or increasing the supply of available prostitutes.” (Hashimoto, at p. 867.) HN20[ ] The court concluded  that the language of section 266i is not vague, reasoning: “It is not reasonably susceptible of being interpreted to  cover any activity beyond that involved in the social evil of pandering. [Citation.] The terms ‘procuring, persuading  and encouraging’ are all words capable of precise definition. [*492]  [Citations.] [¶] The test is whether the conduct  of the defendant meets [***46]  the commonly accepted definitions of the words used in the statute.” (Hashimoto, at  p. 867.) We agree with the reasoning of Hashimoto. HN21[ ] The fact that section 266i does not define the term “procure” does not render the statute unconstitutionally  vague. The language of the statute is sufficiently clear and settled to provide fair notice of the proscribed conduct.  Indeed, long-standing case law in effect at the time of defendant's offenses provided adequate guidance as to what  the term “procure” means in the context of pandering. Since 1941, case law has construed the term to mean  assisting, inducing, persuading or encouraging a person to engage in prostitution. (Montgomery, supra, 47  Cal.App.2d at p. 12.)  [**163]  Such a construction is consistent with the purpose and intent of the pandering  statute, which our Supreme Court has explained is to criminalize the knowing and purposeful conduct of any person  seeking to persuade, encourage, or otherwise influence the target to become a prostitute. (Zambia, supra, 51  Cal.4th at p. 980.) In concluding that the six parts of subdivision (a) of section 266i apply to any victim, regardless of  whether that victim is already acting as a prostitute, the Zambia court explained, “The plain intent and purpose  behind all the provisions of section 266i, taken together, is to deter pimps or others from establishing [***47]  new  working relationships in the unlawful prostitution trade. Our appellate courts have long recognized that California's  pandering statute ‘“cover[s] all the various ramifications of the social evil of pandering and include[s] them all in  the definition of the crime, with a view of effectively combating the evil sought to be condemned.”’” (Zambia, at p.  978.) Accordingly, we conclude defendant had fair notice of what was proscribed under section 266i, subdivision  (a)(1) at the time of his offenses. We recognize that the Bench Notes to the pattern instruction for the crime of pandering (CALCRIM No. 1151)  explain that the term “persuade” was included as an option in element one where, as here, section 266i, subdivision  (a)(1) applies because the term “‘procure’ may be difficult for jurors to understand.” However, it does not follow,  as defendant suggests that section 266i, subdivision (a)(1) is impermissibly vague in violation of due  process. [*493]  The inclusion of the term “persuade” in the pattern instruction is supported by case law and reflects  the Judicial Council's determination that such an option would necessarily assist the jury in determining whether or  not a defendant is guilty of violating section 266i, subdivision (a)(1). HN22[ ] In the context of this part of section  266i, “persuading” is simply a means by which the illegal act of “procuring” may be [***48]  achieved. 4.0 Alleged Instructional Errors 4.1 Standard of Review HN23[ ] “In criminal cases, even in the absence of a request, a trial court must instruct on general principles of law  relevant to the issues raised by the evidence and necessary for the jury's understanding of the case.” (People v.  Martinez (2010) 47 Cal.4th 911, 953 [105 Cal. Rptr. 3d 131, 224 P.3d 877].) A claim of instructional error is  reviewed de novo. (People v. Cole (2004) 33 Cal.4th 1158, 1210 [17 Cal. Rptr. 3d 532, 95 P.3d 811].) An appellate  court independently reviews the wording of a jury instruction and assesses whether the instruction accurately states  the law. (People v. Posey, supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 218.) When making this determination, we consider the  instructions taken  [**164]  as a whole; we also presume jurors are intelligent people capable of understanding and  correlating all jury instructions and applying them to the facts of the case. (People v. Hajek and Vo (2014) 58          51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *491; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **162; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***45 Page 31 of 40   Cal.4th 1144, 1220 [171 Cal. Rptr. 3d 234, 324 P.3d 88], overruled on another ground in People v. Rangel (2016)  62 Cal.4th 1192, 1216 [200 Cal. Rptr. 3d 265, 367 P.3d 649]; People v. Smith (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 7, 13 [85 Cal.  Rptr. 3d 180].) HN24[ ] The Watson standard of prejudice (i.e., the error is reversible when there is a reasonable probability  defendant would have obtained a more favorable result in the absence of the error) applies to an instruction that  misdirects the jury, including incorrect, ambiguous, conflicting, or wrongly omitted instructions. In contrast, the  Chapman standard of review (i.e., error is harmless only when it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that  the [***49]  error did not contribute to the verdict obtained) applies when an instruction improperly describes or  omits an element of the offense. (People v. Larsen (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 810, 829–830 [140 Cal. Rptr. 3d 762].)  [*494]  4.2 CALCRIM No. 1151 4.2.1 Additional Background At the close of trial, the jury was instructed orally and in writing on the crime of pandering in accordance with  CALCRIM No. 1151. The trial court instructed the jury as follows: “The defendant is charged in Count [3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], and [18] with pandering, in violation of  Penal Code Section 266i. “To prove that the defendant is guilty of pandering, the People must prove that: “1. The defendant successfully persuaded/procured a Jane Doe to become a prostitute, or the defendant used  promises or any device or scheme to cause, persuade, encourage, induce a Jane Doe to become a prostitute, or  the defendant used fraud or trickery to persuade/procure a Jane Doe … to be a prostitute; and, “2. The defendant intended to influence a Jane Doe to be a prostitute. “It does not matter whether a Jane Doe was a prostitute already. “A prostitute is a person who engages in sexual intercourse or any lewd act with another person in exchange for  money. Pandering requires that an intended act of prostitution be with someone other than the defendant. [***50]   A lewd act means physical contact of the genitals, buttocks, or female breast of either the prostitute or customer  with some part of the other person's body for the purpose of sexual arousal and gratification.” The trial court instructed the jury with the foregoing language after an extended discussion with counsel regarding  the proposed instruction submitted by the prosecution. No objection or request for clarification or modification of this  language was made by the defense. 4.2.2 Analysis Defendant identifies two instructional errors regarding the CALCRIM No. 1151 instruction given to the jury in this  case. First, he argues that the instruction eliminated an essential element of the crime of pandering. Second, he  argues the instruction erroneously advised the jury that, “It does not matter whether a Jane Doe was a prostitute  already.” We reject these contentions.  [*495]   [**165]  The People preliminarily argue that defendant has forfeited his claims of instructional error. HN25[ ]  Generally, a party forfeits any challenge to a jury instruction that was correct in law and responsive to the evidence  if the party fails to object in the trial court. (See People v. Hudson (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1002, 1011–1012 [44 Cal. Rptr.    51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *493; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **164; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***48 Page 32 of 40   3d 632, 136 P.3d 168].) However, this rule does not apply if the instruction was an incorrect [***51]  statement of  the law. (Id. at p. 1012.) Here, defendant's position is that the challenged instruction, as given, was not a correct  statement of the law. Thus, while defendant did not object in the trial court, we will review his claims of instructional  error on the merits. We reject defendant's initial contention that the CALCRIM No. 1151 instruction given to the jury eliminated an  essential element of the crime of pandering because it allowed the jury to convict him of pandering based on a  finding that he “persuaded/procured a Jane Doe to become a prostitute,” without the additional finding that he did  so by promises, threats, violence, or by any device or scheme, as required by subdivision (a)(2) of section 266i.  According to defendant, the trial court's instruction misstated the crime codified in section 266i, subdivision (a)(1) by  “conflat[ing] pandering by ‘procuring’ with pandering by ‘persuasion’ and allow[ed] the jury to find pandering by  persuasion without finding the means of persuasion required by subdivision (a)(2).” We disagree. HN26[ ] As previously indicated, subdivision (a) of section 266i has six parts that “‘define the different  circumstances under which the crime of pandering may be committed.’” (Leonard, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p.  490.) The commission of any one of the acts described in subdivision (a) constitutes the offense of  pandering. [***52]  (People v. Charles, supra, 218 Cal.App.2d at p. 816.) The statutory parts or alternatives are not  mutually exclusive, i.e., the parts can be violated at the same time. (See Montgomery, supra, 47 Cal.App.2d at pp.  12, 24, 27–28; see also People v. Lax, supra, 20 Cal.App.3d at p. 486.) CA(10)[ ] (10) The jury in this case was instructed on three alternative theories of pandering liability under section  266i, subdivision (a)(1), (2), and (5). As relevant here, the jury was told that in order to convict defendant of the  crime of pandering, the prosecution had to prove, among other things, that he: (1) “successfully  persuaded/procured a Jane Doe to become a prostitute”; or (2) “used promises or any device or scheme to cause,  persuade, encourage, induce a Jane Doe to become a prostitute.” Contrary to defendant's contention, the first  alternative, which pertains to criminal liability under section 266i, subdivision (a)(1), did not eliminate an essential  element of the offense by allowing the jury to convict him on a theory of pandering by persuasion without a finding  that he “used promises or any device or scheme” to persuade a Jane Doe to become a prostitute. HN27[ ] As a  panel of this court recently [*496]  explained, to establish a violation of section 266i, subdivision (a)(1), the  prosecution need not prove the additional element of the second alternative (i.e., “‘promises, threats, violence, or  any device or scheme’”), which pertains to criminal liability [***53]  under section 266i, subdivision (a)(2). (People v.  Chatman (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th 989, 994 [242 Cal. Rptr. 3d 138] (Chatman).) To the extent defendant's claim of error rests on the premise that the term “procure” as used in the pandering  statute cannot be construed to mean “persuade” another person to become a prostitute, we find that it lacks merit.  HN28[ ] Again, we point out  [**166]  that long-standing case law has construed the term “procure” in the context  of the pandering statute to mean assisting, inducing, persuading or encouraging a person to engage in  prostitution. (Montgomery, supra, 47 Cal.App.2d at p. 12 [noting that the “alternatives recited in the statute are  plainly not all mutually exclusive of each other”]; Schultz, supra, 238 Cal.App.2d at p. 812.) Such a construction is  consistent with the purpose and intent of the pandering statute, which our Supreme Court has explained is to  criminalize the knowing and purposeful conduct of any person seeking to persuade, encourage, or otherwise  influence the target to become a prostitute. (Zambia, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 980; see id. at p. 973 [the statute is  meant to “‘“cover all the various ramifications of the social evil of pandering and include them all in the definition of  the crime”’”; the Legislature sought to “prevent prostitution ‘by discouraging persons other than the prostitute  from augmenting and expanding a prostitute's operation, or increasing the supply of available [***54]   prostitutes’”].) Moreover, as noted, the Legislature's numerous amendments to the pandering statute since  Montgomery and Schultz, without altering the judicial construction of the term “procure,” gives rise to the  presumption that the Legislature has acquiesced in and ratified the judicial interpretation of the statute. (Zambia, at  pp. 975–976.) We also reject defendant's contention that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury with the following language  of CALCRIM No. 1151: “It does not matter whether a Jane Doe was a prostitute already.” HN29[ ] In Zambia, our  Supreme Court concluded that each of the six parts of section 266i, subdivision (a) apply when the victim is already  51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *495; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **165; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***50 Page 33 of 40   an active prostitute, explaining that the plain intent and purpose behind all the parts of the pandering statute is to  “deter pimps or others from establishing new working relationships in the unlawful prostitution trade.” (Zambia,  supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 978; see Chatman, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at p. 996 [“The caveat the court gave the jurors  correctly emphasized that the fact [Jane Doe] was already a prostitute did not matter.”].) 4.3 CALCRIM Nos. 316, 375, and 852A Defendant contends the trial court prejudicially erred in instructing the jury, pursuant to CALCRIM Nos. 316, 375,  and 852A, that evidence of his [*497]  prior acts of domestic violence could be considered in assessing the  credibility [***55]  of his testimony. We disagree. 4.3.1 Additional Background The amended information charged defendant with three counts of human trafficking in violation of section 236.1,  subdivision (b). Each of these counts, which involved JD1, JD2, and JD3, alleged that defendant unlawfully and  knowingly violated the personal liberty of the identified Jane Doe with the intent to effect or maintain a violation of  section 266h (pimping) and section 266i (pandering). In relevant part, section 236.1, subdivision (b) provides: “A person who deprives or violates the personal liberty of  another with the intent to effect or maintain a violation of Section … 266h [or] 266i … is guilty of human trafficking  … .” “‘Deprivation or violation of the personal liberty  [**167]  of another’ includes substantial and sustained  restriction of another's liberty accomplished through force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace,  or threat of unlawful injury to the victim or to another person, under circumstances where the person receiving or  apprehending the threat reasonably believes that it is likely that the person making the threat would carry it out.” (§  236.1, subd. (h)(3).) Prior to trial, the prosecutor filed a motion pursuant to Evidence Code sections 1101 and 1109 requesting  permission to admit evidence of defendant's prior acts of domestic violence [***56]  involving three of his former  girlfriends for the purpose of proving his character for violence and his criminal intent with respect to the human  trafficking offenses. The trial court ruled that the prior acts evidence was admissible for these purposes. There was  no discussion as to whether the prior acts evidence would be admissible as impeachment evidence if defendant  testified. At the close of trial, the jury was instructed pursuant to CALCRIM No. 375 (Evidence of Uncharged Offense to  Prove Identity, Intent, Common Plan, etc.) and CALCRIM No. 852A (Evidence of Uncharged Domestic [*498]   Violence). The jury was instructed that it could consider the uncharged acts of domestic violence in deciding                 51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *496; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **166; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***54 Page 34 of 40   whether defendant acted with the  [**168]  requisite intent for the human trafficking offenses and in assessing his  credibility as a witness. The jury was also instructed with CALCRIM No. 316 (Additional Instructions on Witness  Credibility—Other Conduct), which as given here stated, in relevant part: “If you find that a witness has committed a  crime or other misconduct, you may consider that fact [only] in evaluating the credibility of the witness'[s] testimony.  The fact that a witness may have committed a crime or other misconduct does not necessarily destroy [***57]  or  impair a witness'[s] credibility. It is up to you to decide the weight of the fact and whether that fact makes the  witness less believable.” As previously indicated, the jury found defendant guilty on 11 counts of pandering involving JD1 through JD11 and  three counts of pimping involving JD1, JD2, and JD3. He was found not guilty on the pandering count involving  JD12 and the human trafficking counts involving JD1, JD2, and JD3. 4.3.2 Analysis HN30[ ] As a general rule, failure to object to an instruction forfeits the issue on appeal. (People v. Rivera (1984)  162 Cal.App.3d 141, 146 [207 Cal. Rptr.  [*499] 756].) An exception to the rule of forfeiture arises, however, if the  instruction affected the substantial rights of defendant. (§ 1259; Rivera, at p. 146.) Defendant's substantial rights  are affected if the instruction results in a miscarriage of justice, making it reasonably probable that absent the  erroneous instruction defendant would have obtained a more favorable result. (Rivera, at p. 146.; see Cal. Const.,  art. VI, § 13; Watson, supra, 46 Cal.2d at p. 836.) We agree with the People that defendant has forfeited his claim of instructional error by failing to object. At no point  did defendant object in the trial court on the ground that the challenged instructions were improper because the  prior uncharged acts of domestic violence did not amount to conduct [***58]  involving moral turpitude, and  therefore the acts could not be used in evaluating his credibility. Had defendant objected, the trial court could have  made an explicit determination as to whether the prior uncharged acts could be considered by the jury to assess his  credibility as a witness. That determination is a legal question that turns on whether the prior uncharged acts  involved moral turpitude. (See People v. Wheeler (1992) 4 Cal.4th 284, 296–297 [14 Cal. Rptr. 2d 418, 841 P.2d  938]; id. at p. 297, fn. 7 [a witness's prior conduct involving moral turpitude is admissible to impeach his or her  credibility “whether or not it produced any conviction, felony or misdemeanor”]; People v. Rodriguez (1992) 5  Cal.App.4th 1398, 1402 [7 Cal. Rptr. 2d 495] [domestic violence under § 273.5 involves moral turpitude and  admissible for impeachment purposes]; People v. Gray (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 635, 640 [69 Cal. Rptr. 3d 876]  [whether conduct involves moral turpitude is a legal question for the trial court to decide].) In any event, even assuming instructional error as defendant claims, we conclude the error did not result in a  miscarriage of justice. Since defendant was acquitted on the human trafficking charges, we limit our prejudice  inquiry to defendant's convictions for pimping and pandering. As relevant here, the jury was instructed that it could  consider the prior uncharged acts of domestic violence if it found, by a preponderance of [***59]  the evidence, that  defendant committed those acts. Furthermore, the jury was told that it could, but was not required to, consider the  uncharged acts evidence for the limited purpose of determining defendant's credibility  [**169]  as a witness.               51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *498; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **167; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***56 Page 35 of 40   (CALCRIM Nos. 316, 375, 852A.) The jury was further instructed that it alone must judge the credibility of witnesses  using common sense and experience (CALCRIM No. 226 [Witnesses]), and that defendant's commission of other  misconduct (i.e., the prior uncharged acts of domestic violence) does not necessarily destroy or impair his  credibility, and it was for the jury to decide the weight to be given to the evidence and whether it made defendant  less believable. (CALCRIM No. 316.)  [*500]  More importantly, the evidence presented at trial as to defendant's guilt on the pimping and pandering convictions  was strong in comparison to the evidence presented by the defense, which consisted only of defendant's testimony.  As discussed above, JD1, JD2, and JD3 testified in detail about defendant's conduct in assisting and encouraging  them to engage in prostitution activities (e.g., posting online advertisements, setting up dates with clients, booking  hotel rooms, providing transportation to dates) in exchange for a share of [***60]  their earnings. These witnesses  collectively testified that JD4 through JD11 also “worked” with defendant, and that the work the women engaged in  was prostitution activities. The testimony of JD1, JD2, and JD3 was corroborated by the sting operation,  defendant's testimony, evidence obtained from electronic searches (including cell phones), and evidence found on  defendant's person and in his car. When defendant testified, he admitted that he worked with some of the Jane  Does, which included posting advertisements on a Web site commonly used to advertise for prostitution activities  (i.e., Backpage.com), but claimed that he did not assist or encourage any of the women to engage in prostitution  activities. Instead, he maintained that he assisted the women in providing services which did not involve the  exchange of sexual acts for money (e.g., modeling, body massage, dancing). He claimed that he did not know  exactly what the women did for the money they earned, and that he only collected money for advertisement costs,  car expenses, and hotel rooms. However, he admitted that he knew JD1 was experienced in the “industry,” and did  not deny that he sent her text messages showing that he knew [***61]  she was engaging in sexual acts with  “clients.” On this record, the jury reasonably rejected defendant's denial that his relationship with the Jane Does did  not include his assistance and encouragement in their prostitution activities in exchange for a portion of their  earnings. Considering the instructions as a whole and the evidence presented at trial, we conclude it is not  reasonably probable defendant would have obtained a more favorable result absent the alleged instructional errors. 4.4 Alleged Failure To Instruct on Lesser Included Offenses Defendant contends the trial court prejudicially erred in failing to instruct the jury on aiding and abetting  prostitution, as a lesser included offense of pandering. Defendant further contends the trial court prejudicially  erred in failing to instruct the jury on attempted pandering, as a lesser included offense of pandering. In support of  his claims, defendant relies on the accusatory pleading test. We find no instructional error. 4.4.1 Applicable Legal Principles HN31[ ] CA(11)[ ] (11) “A criminal defendant has a constitutional right to have the jury determine every material  issue presented by the evidence, and an erroneous [*501]  failure to instruct on a lesser included [***62]  offense  constitutes a denial of that right. To protect this right and the broader interest of safeguarding the jury's function of  ascertaining the truth, a trial court must instruct on an uncharged offense that is less serious  [**170]  than, and  included in, a charged greater offense, even in the absence of a request, whenever there is substantial evidence  raising a question as to whether all of the elements of the charged greater offense are present. [Citations.] [¶] But  this does not mean that the trial court must instruct sua sponte on the panoply of all possible lesser included  offenses. Rather, … ‘“such instructions are required whenever evidence that the defendant is guilty only of the  lesser offense is ‘substantial enough to merit consideration’ by the jury. [Citations.] ‘Substantial evidence’ in this  context is ‘“evidence from which a jury composed of reasonable [persons] could … conclude[]”’ that the lesser  offense, but not the greater, was committed.”’ [Citation.] The classic formulation of this rule is … : ‘When there is  substantial evidence that an element of the charged offense is missing, but that the accused is guilty of a lesser  included offense, the court must instruct [***63]  upon the lesser included offense, and must allow the jury to return  the lesser conviction, even if not requested to do so.’” (People v. Huggins (2006) 38 Cal.4th 175, 215 [41 Cal. Rptr.  3d 593, 131 P.3d 995].) Substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable jury could find persuasive. (People v.  Williams (2015) 61 Cal.4th 1244, 1263 [192 Cal. Rptr. 3d 266, 355 P.3d 444].) 51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *499; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **169; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***59 Page 36 of 40   HN32[ ] In determining whether a trial court must instruct on a lesser included offense, “‘a lesser offense is  necessarily included in a greater offense if either the statutory elements of the greater offense, or the facts actually  alleged in the accusatory pleading, include all the elements of the lesser offense, such that the greater cannot be  committed without also committing the lesser. [Citations.]’” (People v. Smith (2013) 57 Cal.4th 232, 240 [159 Cal.  Rptr. 3d 57, 303 P.3d 368].) HN33[ ] We review the trial court's failure to instruct on a lesser included offense de novo, considering the  evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant. (People v. Millbrook (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1122, 1137 [166  Cal. Rptr. 3d 217].) The erroneous failure to instruct sua sponte on a lesser included offense in a noncapital case is  not subject to reversal unless an examination of the entire record establishes a reasonable probability that the error  affected the outcome. In other words, we apply the Watson standard of prejudice. (People v. Breverman (1998) 19  Cal.4th 142, 165 [77 Cal. Rptr. 2d 870, 960 P.2d 1094].) 4.4.2 Aiding and Abetting Prostitution We conclude the trial court had no duty to sua sponte instruct the jury on aiding and [***64]  abetting prostitution,  as a lesser included offense of pandering. As [*502]  an initial matter, defendant offers no authority recognizing the  existence of such a crime. (See People v. Gibson (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 371, 385 [108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 809] [noting  that “there is no crime of aiding and abetting prostitution”].) But even if such a crime exists, defendant was not  entitled to an instruction on this offense because, even assuming it is a lesser included offense of pandering by  procurement under the accusatory pleading test as defendant claims (cf. Mathis, supra, 173 Cal.App.3d at p. 1256,  fn. 7 [concluding that aiding and abetting an act of prostitution is not a lesser included offense of pandering]),  there is no substantial evidence that he was guilty only of aiding and abetting prostitution and not pandering. CA(12)[ ] (12) Defendant was charged with 12 counts of pandering by procuring in violation of section 266i,  subdivision (a). Each count alleged that he unlawfully procured the specified Jane Doe for the purpose of  prostitution. HN34[ ] Section 266i, subdivision (a)(1), criminalizes the “[p]rocur[ing of] another  [**171]  person for  the purpose of prostitution.” As we have previously described, the term “procure” has been construed to mean  “assisting, inducing, persuading or encouraging” a person to engage in prostitution. (Schultz, supra, 238  Cal.App.2d at p. 812; see Montgomery, supra, 47 Cal.App.2d at p. 12.) Pandering is a specific intent crime. To be  guilty of [***65]  the offense, the defendant must have the specific intent to persuade, encourage or otherwise  influence the target to become a prostitute. (Zambia, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 980.) In connection with prohibiting prostitution as a form of disorderly conduct, section 647, former subdivision (b)(1)  states: “An individual who solicits, or who agrees to engage in, or who engages in, any act of prostitution with the  intent to receive compensation, money, or anything of value from another person. An individual agrees to engage in  an act of prostitution when, with specific intent to so engage, he or she manifests an acceptance of an offer or  solicitation by another person to so engage, regardless of whether the offer or solicitation was made by a person  who also possessed the specific intent to engage in an act of prostitution.” (Stats. 2016, ch. 734, § 1.4.) HN35[ ] CA(13)[ ] (13) A person is liable as an aider and abettor when (1) with knowledge of the unlawful  purpose of the perpetrator and (2) with the intent or purpose of committing, encouraging, or facilitating the  commission of the crime, that person (3) by act or advice aids, promotes, encourages or instigates, the commission  of the crime. (People v. Beeman (1984) 35 Cal.3d 547, 560–561 [199 Cal. Rptr. 60, 674 P.2d 1318].) Here, defendant has failed to demonstrate that he is guilty only of [***66]  what he claims is a lesser offense of  pandering. He has not shown how a reasonable jury could have concluded that the alleged lesser offense of aiding  and abetting prostitution, but not the greater offense of pandering, was committed. [*503]  The evidence  presented by the prosecution, if credited by the jury, showed that he knowingly assisted and encouraged the Jane  Does in this case to engage in prostitution activities in exchange for a share of their earnings. The only possible  offenses he committed were that of pimping and pandering. Accordingly, we find no instructional error. HN36[ ] CA(14)[ ] (14) Generally, the court need not instruct on a lesser included offense when, as here, the  defendant completely denies the charged offense, and no evidence reasonably supports the inference that the  51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *501; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **170; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***63 Page 37 of 40   defendant committed only the lesser included offense. (People v. Sinclair (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1012, 1019–1020  [75 Cal. Rptr. 2d 626].) Defendant testified that the online advertisements he posted for the women involved in this  case were not for prostitution activities. Rather, the advertisements he posted were for services that did not  involve sexual acts (e.g., modeling, dancing, massages). He insisted that he never encouraged the women to  engage in prostitution activities with clients and claimed [***67]  that he did not know exactly what the women did  with clients for the money they received. He also claimed that he collected money from the women only to pay for  online advertising and other costs associated with their working relationship. In other words, defendant claimed he  had no knowledge that the Jane Does were engaging in prostitution activities and did not take a portion of their  earnings from such activities. If the jury credited his version of events, it would have returned not guilty verdicts.  HN37[ ] An instruction on a lesser included offense is not required “when the evidence shows that the defendant  is either guilty of the crime charged  [**172]  or not guilty of any crime.” (People v. Barton (1995) 12 Cal.4th 186,  196, fn. 5 [47 Cal. Rptr. 2d 569, 906 P.2d 531].) 4.4.3 Attempted Pandering We also reject defendant's contention that the trial court erred by failing sua sponte to instruct the jury on attempted  pandering, as a lesser included offense of pandering. As discussed, the prosecution's evidence, if believed,  established completed acts of pandering. If the prosecution's witnesses were not believed, the resulting verdict  would have been an acquittal. Based on the evidence presented, defendant was “either guilty of the crime charged  or not guilty of any crime,” and no [***68]  instruction on the lesser included attempt offenses was required. (People  v. Barton, supra, 12 Cal.4th at p. 196, fn. 5.) Contrary to defendant's contention, an instruction on attempted pandering was not required because there was no  evidence the nontestifying Jane Does (i.e., JD4 through JD11) engaged in any act of prostitution. (People v.  Osuna, supra, 251 Cal.App.2d at p. 531 [the crime of pandering does not require that actual acts of prostitution  take place].) Nor was such an instruction required because JD4 was a fictitious or imaginary target. There was no  substantial [*504]  evidence to support such a finding. Both defendant and JD1 recognized JD4 when they were  shown a picture of her. While defendant did not believe that he posted any advertisements for JD4, the prosecution  presented evidence showing that he posted two advertisements for her on Backpage.com. 5.0 Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Defendant contends his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to certain testimony based  on lack of foundation and hearsay. We disagree. 5.1 Applicable Legal Principles CA(15)[ ] (15) HN38[ ] “‘In order to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must first show  counsel's performance was “deficient” because his “representation fell below an objective standard of  reasonableness [***69]  … under prevailing professional norms.” [Citations.] Second, he must also show prejudice  flowing from counsel's performance or lack thereof. [Citation.] Prejudice is shown when there is a “reasonable  probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A  reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” [Citations.]’” (In re Harris  (1993) 5 Cal.4th 813, 832–833 [21 Cal. Rptr. 2d 373, 855 P.2d 391].) HN39[ ] “Reviewing courts defer to counsel's reasonable tactical decisions in examining a claim of ineffective  assistance of counsel [citation], and there is a ‘strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range  of reasonable professional assistance.’ [Citation.] Defendant's burden is difficult to carry on direct appeal, as [our  Supreme Court] ha[s] observed: ‘“Reviewing courts will reverse convictions [on direct appeal] on the ground of  inadequate counsel only if the record on appeal affirmatively discloses that counsel had no rational tactical purpose  for [his or her] act or omission.”’” (People v. Lucas (1995) 12 Cal.4th 415, 436–437 [48 Cal. Rptr. 2d 525, 907 P.2d  373].) “If the record on appeal sheds no light on why counsel acted or failed to act in the manner challenged, an  appellate claim of ineffective assistance of counsel [***70]  must be rejected unless counsel was asked for an  explanation and failed to provide one, or there simply could be no satisfactory explanation.” (People v. Carter  (2003) 30 Cal.4th 1166, 1211 [135 Cal. Rptr. 2d 553, 70 P.3d 981].) 51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *503; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **171; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***66 Page 38 of 40   HN40[ ] CA(16)[ ] (16)  [**173]  The decision whether to object to inadmissible evidence is a tactical one and is  accorded substantial deference on appeal. (People v. Riel (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1153, 1185 [96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 1, 998  P.2d 969].) “‘[I]n the heat of a trial, defense counsel is best able to determine proper tactics in the light of [*505]  the  jury's apparent reaction to the proceedings.’” (Id. at p. 1197.) “An attorney may choose not to object for many  reasons, and the failure to object rarely establishes ineffectiveness of counsel.” (People v. Kelly (1992) 1 Cal.4th  495, 540 [3 Cal. Rptr. 2d 677, 822 P.2d 385]; see People v. Wharton (1991) 53 Cal.3d 522, 567 [280 Cal. Rptr. 631,  809 P.2d 290] [“‘a mere failure to object to evidence … seldom establishes counsel's incompetence’”].) “In the usual  case, where counsel's trial tactics or strategic reasons for challenged decisions do not appear on the record, we will  not find ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal unless there could be no conceivable reason for counsel's acts  or omissions.” (People v. Weaver (2001) 26 Cal.4th 876, 926 [111 Cal. Rptr. 2d 2, 29 P.3d 103]; see People v.  Fosselman (1983) 33 Cal.3d 572, 581 [189 Cal. Rptr. 855, 659 P.2d 1144] [on appeal, a conviction will be reversed  on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel “only if the record on appeal affirmatively discloses that counsel  had no rational tactical purpose for his act or omission”].) 5.2 Analysis As previously indicated, JD1, JD2, and [***71]  JD3 were the only alleged victims that testified at trial. There was no  testimony elicited from JD4 through JD12. According to defendant, trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object  when JD1, JD2, and JD3 testified that certain Jane Does (JD5, JD6, JD8, JD9, & JD10) worked with defendant and  engaged in sexual acts in exchange for money. Defendant argues that trial counsel should have objected on the  ground that these witnesses lacked personal knowledge to give such testimony, as there was no reason to believe  that they observed any other Jane Doe receive money in exchange for sexual acts. Defendant further argues that  trial counsel should have made a hearsay objection when JD1 testified that JD8 told her not to tell defendant she  had earned $300 from a client, which, according to defendant, “established that JD8 actually received money from a  client and it implied that she owed some or all of it to [him].” Defendant maintains that, but for trial counsel's  unprofessional errors, there was a reasonable probability that he would have been acquitted on the pandering  convictions involving the nontestifying Jane Does (i.e., JD4 through JD11), because the other evidence  presented [***72]  at trial did not establish that any of these women was an actual prostitute who engaged in  prostitution. We conclude defendant has failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant has not carried his  burden to show deficient performance. He has failed to demonstrate that the unasserted evidentiary objections  would have been sustained. HN41[ ] Defense counsel cannot be considered ineffective for [*506]  failing to make  groundless objections. (People v. Boyette (2002) 29 Cal.4th 381, 437 [127 Cal. Rptr. 2d 544, 58 P.3d 391].) But  even assuming the unasserted objections had merit, there is no affirmative explanation in the record for  [**174]   counsel's failure to object to the challenged testimony, and defendant has made no effort to meet his burden to  show there is no satisfactory explanation for counsel's inaction. HN42[ ] Competent counsel may forgo even a  valid objection for tactical reasons. (People v. Slaughter (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1187, 1210 [120 Cal. Rptr. 2d 477, 47  P.3d 262], abrogated on other grounds in People v. Diaz (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1176, 1190–1191 [185 Cal. Rptr. 3d  431, 345 P.3d 62].) For example, defense counsel may forgo an objection to avoid highlighting testimony to the jury  (People v. Wharton, supra, 53 Cal.3d at p. 567), or to avoid causing a prosecutor to establish a more compelling  foundation for the admission of the contested testimony (People v. Dennis (1998) 17 Cal.4th 468, 532 [71 Cal. Rptr.  2d 680, 950 P.2d 1035]). We can conceive of more than one strategic reason for trial counsel's failure to object to the challenged testimony.  Counsel may have [***73]  concluded that JD1, JD2, and JD3 had additional personal knowledge about the other  Jane Does working with defendant and did not want the prosecutor to elicit that information. Under the  circumstances, competent counsel could have determined that the risk of hearing more details relating to how they  knew the other women engaged in prostitution activities was not worth the reward of a successful objection.  Alternatively, had the court sustained objections to the challenged testimony, the prosecution could have sought to    51 Cal. App. 5th 463, *504; 265 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136, **172; 2020 Cal. App. LEXIS 590, ***70 Page 39 of 40   introduce additional evidence, including testimony from the other Jane Does. Competent counsel could have  concluded that the testimony given by JD1, JD2, and JD3 was preferable to the prosecution calling the other Jane  Does to testify or the prosecutor presenting other evidence showing the prostitution activities of the Jane Does. In addition to failing to show deficient performance, defendant has failed to carry his burden to demonstrate that he  suffered prejudice as a result of trial counsel's failure to object. There was independent evidence showing that  defendant worked with the Jane Does implicated by his ineffective assistance claim. There was also strong  evidence [***74]  supporting the conclusion that the women he worked with engaged in prostitution activities, and  that he received a share of their earnings in return for his assistance in helping them engage in those activities,  including posting advertisements, setting up dates, booking hotels, and providing transportation. In other words,  there is ample independent evidence in the record supporting his pandering convictions with respect to JD4  through JD11.  [*507]  6.0 Multiple Pimping Convictions Defendant contends that he was improperly convicted and sentenced on multiple counts of pimping. Relying  primarily on People v. Lewis (1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 455 [143 Cal. Rptr. 587] (Lewis), he argues that two of his  pimping convictions must be reversed “[b]ecause all three counts occurred within the same time period … during  which [he] was continuously engaged in the unlawful profession of ‘pimping,’ only one conviction for pimping was  supported.” We disagree. HN43[ ] “In general, a person may be convicted of, although not punished for, more than one crime arising out of  the same act or course of conduct.” (People v. Reed (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1224, 1226 [45 Cal. Rptr. 3d 353, 137 P.3d  184].) But a person may not be subject to multiple convictions for the same crime arising out of a single course of  conduct. (Lewis, supra, 77 Cal.App.3d at p. 461.) In Lewis, the defendant was convicted of four separate [***75]   counts of pimping in violation of section 266h. (Lewis, at p. 457.) Each count involved the same  [**175]  woman  and differed only as to the date of the charged transaction. (Id. at pp. 457–459.) The Court of Appeal held that the  defendant had been improperly convicted on multiple counts for only one criminal offense arising out of “one  continuous criminal act,” i.e., deriving support from a prostitute's earnings over a five-year period. (Id. at pp. 461– 462; see People v. Garcia (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1162, fn. 1, 1163 [132 Cal. Rptr. 2d 694] [crime of  “‘flee[ing] or attempt[ing] to elude a [pursuing] peace officer’” violated only once by “an uninterrupted single course  of conduct, i.e., one continuous act of driving lasting 30 minutes” because the statute “contemplates a continuous  course of driving, which may transpire over a short or long period of time”].) CA(17)[ ] (17) Defendant's reliance on Lewis is misplaced. Here, in contrast to  Lewis, defendant was charged  and convicted of three counts of pimping involving three different victims. He was subjected to multiple convictions  for multiple criminal acts. The pimping counts charged distinct crimes—courses of conduct involving JD1, JD2, and  JD3—which did not constitute a single course of conduct. Defendant, for his part, cites no authority for the  proposition that a defendant cannot be convicted of [***76]  multiple counts of pimping involving separate and  distinct victims. HN44[ ] Indeed, because each victim harmed by defendant's criminal act of pimping represents a  separate injury the pimping statute was designed to prevent, defendant was properly convicted of three counts of  pimping. (See Hashimoto, supra, 54 Cal.App.3d at p. 867 [the pimping statute is “designed to discourage  prostitution by discouraging persons other than the prostitute from augmenting and expanding a prostitute's  operation, or increasing the supply of available prostitutes”].)

"United States v. Crow, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 32380","[*1] Appeal from the United States District Court for the  Southern District of Florida D.C. Docket No. 2:22-cr- 14035-JEM-1 ____________________ USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 2 of 10 2 Opinion of the Court 22-14267 Before ROSENBAUM, JILL PRYOR, and BLACK,  Circuit Judges. PER CURIAM: Daniel Crow appeals his sentence of 360 months'  imprison-ment for enticement of a minor to engage in  sexual activity and production of child pornography.  Crow asserts several issues on appeal, which we  address in turn. After review, 1 we affirm in part, and  vacate and remand for resentencing in part. I. DISCUSSION A. Grouping of Counts Crow contends the district court erred in failing to group  his counts together when calculating his guideline  range, because his counts involved substantially the  same harm under U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2. The Government  concedes error on this issue. Oﬀenses ""shall be grouped"" for guideline oﬀense level  calcu-lation purposes when they ""involve substantially  the same harm."" U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2. The Guidelines list  four circumstances where counts involve ""substantially  the same harm"": 1 When reviewing the district court's findings with  respect to Guidelines is-sues, we consider legal issues  de novo [*2] , factual findings for clear error, and the  court's application of the Guidelines to the facts with due  deference, which is akin to clear error review. United  States v. Rothenberg, 610 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir.  2010). In order to be clearly erroneous, the finding of the  district court must leave us with a ""definite and firm  conviction that a mistake has been committed."" Id.  (quotation marks omitted). USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 3 of 10 22-14267 Opinion of the Court 3 (a) When counts involve the same victim and the same  act or transaction. (b) When counts involve the same victim and two or  more acts or transactions connected by a common  criminal objective or constituting part of a common  scheme or plan. (c) When one of the counts embodies conduct that is  treated as a specific oﬀense characteristic in, or other  adjustment to, the guideline applicable to another of the  Page 2 of 4 counts. (d) When the oﬀense level is determined largely on the  basis of the total amount of harm or loss, the quantity of  a substance involved, or some other meas-ure of  aggregate harm, or if the oﬀense behavior is ongoing or  continuous in nature and the oﬀense guideline is written  to cover such behavior. Id. Subsection (d) specifically precludes the grouping of  a ""produc-tion of child pornography"" offense under that  subsection. Id. However, offenses need only meet the  criteria of one subsection of § 3D1.2 to qualify for  grouping [*3]  as ""substantially the same harm."" See id.  § 3D1.2(d) (""Exclusion of an offense from grouping  under this subsection does not necessarily preclude  grouping under an-other subsection""). The district court erred in failing to group Crow's counts.  See United States v. Nagel, 835 F.3d 1371, 1374 (11th  Cir. 2016) (re-viewing the district court's decisions  regarding grouping de novo). The conduct embodying  Crow's enticement offense was used to apply a specific  offense characteristic enhancement to his USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 4 of 10 4 Opinion of the Court 22-14267 production offense. Namely, Crow's production of child  pornog-raphy ""involved the use of a computer [to]  persuade, induce, en-tice, coerce, or facilitate the travel  of, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct, or to  otherwise solicit participation by a minor in such  conduct."" This enhancement placed Crow's counts  squarely within § 3D1.2(c), which requires grouping  ""[w]hen one of the counts embodies conduct that is  treated as a specific offense char-acteristic in . . .  another of the counts."" U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2(c). Thus, the  court erred in failing to group Crow's offenses, and we  vacate and remand for resentencing as to this issue. B. Pattern of Activity Enhancement Crow asserts the court [*4]  erred in applying a five-level  enhance-ment for a ""pattern of activity involving  prohibited sexual con-duct"" under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.5,  because the court sustained the pat-tern enhancement  on facts that were not suﬃciently proven at the  sentencing hearing. Under § 4B1.5, the district court applies a five-level  enhance-ment when the defendant engaged in a  ""pattern of activity involv-ing prohibited sexual conduct.""  U.S.S.G. § 4B1.5(b)(1). For pur-poses of § 4B1.5,  ""prohibited sexual conduct"" includes, among other  things, ""any oﬀense described in 18 U.S.C. §  2426(b)(1)(A) or (B)"" and ""the production of child  pornography."" U.S.S.G. § 4B1.5, comment. (n.4(A)). 2 It  does not include receipt or possession of 2Deferral to the Guidelines commentary is necessary  only if the text of the Guidelines is ambiguous. United  States v. Dupree, 57 F.4th 1269, 1275-77 (11th Cir.  2023) (en banc). USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 5 of 10 22-14267 Opinion of the Court 5 child pornography. Id. Section 2426(b)(1)(A) cross- references to oﬀenses contained in chapter 117, which  includes enticement of a minor under 18 U.S.C. §  2422(b). 18 U.S.C. § 2426(b)(1)(A). A defendant engaged in a ""pattern"" under § 4B1.5 if he  en-gaged in such conduct ""on at least two separate  occasions.""  Id.  §  4B1.5,  comment.  (n.4(B)(i)).  ""[R]epeated prohibited sexual con-duct with a single  victim may qualify as a 'pattern of activity' for purposes  of § 4B1.5(b)(1)."" United States v. Fox, 926 F.3d 1275,  1279 (11th Cir. 2019). But ""separate occasions""  requires [*5]   events  that  are  ""independent  and  distinguishable"" from one another. Id. at 1280.  Noncontinuous instances of prohibited sexual conduct  that occur on different days constitute ""separate  occasions."" United States v.Isaac, 987 F.3d 980, 994  (11th Cir. 2021). The Government did not put forth ""sufficient and  reliable"" evidence at the sentencing hearing in support  of any facts sustain-ing the pattern enhancement. See  United States v. Washington, 714 F.3d 1358, 1361 (11th  Cir. 2013) (""When the government seeks to apply an  enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines over a  de-fendant's factual objection, it has the burden of  introducing 'suffi-cient and reliable' evidence to prove  the necessary facts by a pre-ponderance of the  evidence.""). Because Crow made a factual ob-jection to  the enhancement, the record to be considered was lim- ited to Crow's factual proffer, which admitted to only a  single sex-ual encounter involving oral sex with Victim 1  on May 22, 2020. The Government's assertion of facts  at the sentencing hearing be-yond those contained in  the factual proffer, absent additional USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  Page 3 of 4 12/07/2023 Page: 6 of 10 6 Opinion of the Court 22-14267 supporting evidence, could not be relied upon by the  district court. See id. (""[A]bsent a stipulation or  agreement between the parties, [*6]  an attorney's  factual assertions at a sentencing hearing do not con- stitute evidence that a district court can rely on.""). The  district court stated the support for the enhancement  was provided ""based on what [Victim 1] said,""  suggesting that it relied upon every state-ment by or  about Victim 1 contained in the PSI when imposing the  enhancement, despite Crow's factual objections. The  court relied upon insufficiently proven evidence when it  sustained Crow's pat-tern enhancement based upon the  ""separation in time of the vari-ous relationships with  Victim 1."" However, the facts contained in Crow's factual proffer  are sufficient to sustain his pattern enhancement. See  United States v.Gill, 864 F.3d 1279, 1280 (11th Cir.  2017) (explaining we may affirm on any ground  supported by the record, regardless of whether the  district court considered or relied upon that ground  below). Crow concedes in his factual proffer that he  engaged in oral sex with Vic-tim 1 on May 22, 2020, and  that he produced child pornography when he filmed that  sexual encounter. He further concedes that at  unidentified points prior to his May 22 meeting with  Victim 1, Crow requested naked photos and videos from  Victim 1 and made plans with Victim 1 to meet and  engage in sexual [*7]  acts. Between his requests for  illicit images from Victim 1 and his formulation of plans  to meet up with Victim 1 for sex, Crow engaged in  entice-ment prohibited by 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), which  qualifies as ""prohib-ited sexual conduct"" under the  commentary to § 4B1.5. This con-duct occurred on a  different day than his production of child USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 7 of 10 22-14267 Opinion of the Court 7 pornography on May 22, constituting distinct, ""separate  occasions"" sufficient to establish a pattern under §  4B1.5. See Fox, 926 F.3d at 1279; Isaac, 987 F.3d at  994. Thus, while the district court sustained Crow's  enhancement  on  insufficiently  proven  factual  allegations, the existing and undisputed record supports  the enhancement on alternative grounds. Thus, we  affirm as to this issue. C. Distribution Enhancement Crow also argues the court erred in applying a two-level  en-hancement for ""distribution"" of child pornography  under U.S.S.G. § 2G2.1(b)(3), because his sending of a  video from his phone to Victim 1's phone did not  constitute ""distribution."" The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level  enhance-ment when a defendant ""knowingly engaged in  distribution""  of  child  pornography.  U.S.S.G.  §  2G2.1(b)(3). The commentary to the Guidelines  provides that: ""Distribution"" [*8]  means any act, including possession  with intent to distribute, production, transmission,  advertisement, and transportation, related to the transfer  of material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor.  Accordingly, distribution includes posting material  involving the sexual exploitation of a minor on a website  for public viewing but does not include the mere  solicitation of such material by a defendant. Id. § 2G2.1, comment. (n.1(A)). We have stated  ""distribute"" ordi-narily means ""to deliver, give out,  dispense, or disperse to others."" United States v.  Grzybowicz, 747 F.3d 1296, 1307 (11th Cir. 2014)  (holding a defendant did not engage in a ""distribution"" of  child USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 8 of 10 8 Opinion of the Court 22-14267 pornography under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a) when he sent  four images of child pornography from his cellphone to  his personal email ac-count, because the images were  not transferred ""to others""). More-over, distribution  impliedly involves ""deliver[y] to someone other than the  person who does the delivering."" Id. at 1307-08. The district court did not clearly err in imposing the  distri-bution  enhancement  under  §  2G2.1.  By  airdropping a video from his cell phone to Victim 1's cell  phone, Crow delivered, gave out, dispersed, or  dispensed that video to another. [*9]  See id. at 1307.  While Crow asserts Victim 1, presumably by virtue of  her inclusion in the video, does not constitute another  person to whom Crow could ""distribute"" the video, Crow  provides no argument or legal author-ity as to why  Victim 1 should not constitute an ""other"" for purposes of  determining whether he engaged in a distribution. Thus,  be-cause airdropping a video to another's cell phone is  Page 4 of 4 a ""deliver[y]"" to another, the court did not clearly err in  applying  a  two-level  en-hancement  for  Crow's  distribution. Accordingly, we aﬃrm as to this issue. D. Use of Computer Enhancement Crow asserts the court erred in applying a two-level en- hancement for ""use of a computer"" pursuant to U.S.S.G.  § 2G2.1(b)(6)(B), because an iPhone is not a  ""computer"" as in-tended in the Guidelines. Section 2G2.1 provides for a two-level enhancement  when, as part of a defendant's production of child  pornography, the of-fense involved: USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 9 of 10 22-14267 Opinion of the Court 9 the use of a computer or an interactive computer ser- vice to (i) persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facili-tate  the travel of, a minor to engage in sexually ex-plicit  conduct, or to otherwise solicit participation by [*10]  a  minor in such conduct; or (ii) solicit participation with a  minor in sexually explicit conduct . . . . U.S.S.G. § 2G2.1(b)(6). The Guidelines Commentary  cross-refer-ences to 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(1), which  defines ""computer"" as ""an electronic, magnetic, optical,  electrochemical, or other high speed data processing  device performing logical, arithmetic, or storage  functions."" 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(1) (cited in U.S.S.G. §  2G2.1, com-ment. (n.1)). We have previously held a  defendant's use of a cell phone constitutes the use of a  computer as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(1). United  States v. Mathis, 767 F.3d 1264, 1283 (11th Cir. 2014),  abrogated on other grounds by Lockhart v. United  States, 577 U.S. 347 (2016)). The court did not clearly err in applying a two-level  enhance-ment for ""use of a computer."" Crow's iPhone  possessed much of the functionality of a typical  computer, and he used it as such: send-ing and  receiving messages over the internet, booking a hotel  room, and filming and distributing a video. Thus, Crow's  use of an iPhone falls within the unambiguous, plain  reading of ""use of a computer"" as it appears in §  2G2.1(b)(6). Accordingly, we aﬃrm as to this issue. E. Downward variance Crow lastly argues the court abused its discretion in  denying a downward variance, because the facts and  circumstances of his USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 10 of 10 10 Opinion of the Court 22-14267 case place [*11]  it outside the heartland of cases for  which the Sentencing Guidelines were intended to  apply. Because our vacatur and re-mand of Crow's  sentence under Issue I will result in a new sentenc-ing  hearing under a new Guidelines range, we do not  address the merits of the district court's denial of a  downward variance.",0
"United States v. Bhula, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4641","MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER Page 2 of 6   This matter is before the Court on the Government's Motion to Limit Expert Testimony of Witness Mohr (Mot., Doc.  414). Defendant Johnathan Craft responded in opposition (Resp., Doc. 417), to which the Government filed a reply  (Reply, Doc. 420). After considering the motion, briefs, and relevant law, the Court concludes that motion will be  DENIED, in part, and GRANTED, in part. BACKGROUND According to the Superseding Indictment (Doc. 68), Defendants allegedly operated a sex and drug trafficking  enterprise at a Best Choice Inn in Albuquerque from September 2017 to June 2019 under the pretense of being  legitimate owners, managers, and employees. Defendant Kamal Bhula designated Beth Mohr as an expert in  ""police practices and interviews, false confessions and vice investigations (including prostitution and human  trafficking),"" and anticipates that she will offer her ""opinions [*3]  and observations regarding the investigation that  was conducted in this matter and the reports, testimony, evaluations and analysis presented by the United States'  witness."" Def.'s Expert Notice at 2, Doc. 313. The Court qualified Ms. Mohr to testify as an expert on these matters following an October 2022 hearing pursuant to  Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993). See Mem.  Op. and Order, Doc. 412. At the time of the Daubert hearing, Ms. Mohr had not yet submitted an expert report. The  Court therefore imposed a December 5, 2022, deadline for Defendants to amend their expert notices. See Clerk's  Minutes, Doc. 391. Ms. Mohr met this deadline and issued a 19-page expert report on December 4, 2022. See  Expert Witness Report of Beth A. Mohr (""Mohr Report""), Doc. 403-2. In response, the Government filed the instant motion to ""limit"" Ms. Mohr's anticipated testimony based on the  opinions she expresses in her report. Mot. at 1. The Government raises four specific objections: (1) Ms. Mohr's  opinions would invade the province of the jury, (2) her opinions violate Federal Rule of Evidence 412's prohibition  on evidence offered to prove the victim engaged in other sexual behavior or to prove a victim's sexual  predisposition, (3) Ms. Mohr will present uninformed and irrelevant [*4]  opinions regarding the quality of the  investigation, and (4) her testimony will impermissibly comment on the credibility of witnesses. The Court will  address each of these objections. DISCUSSION 1. Invading the Province of the Jury The Government challenges certain opinions by Ms. Mohr as improperly applying the law to the facts of the case  and intruding on the jury's function in deciding the facts. Specifically, it objects to four opinions by Ms. Mohr: that (a)  ""holding onto guests' belongings until the bill is paid does not, in and of itself, demonstrate debt bondage, or force,  fraud, or coercion, and is not a significant impact to the agency of the individual to choose to stay elsewhere, or  even pursue other lines of work""; (b) her opinion that ""the Best Choice Inn motel operation was not consistent with  human trafficking, nor with the operation of a bordello or brothel""; (c) that ""the Best Choice Inn motel operation  was not consistent with a debt bondage or slavery scheme,"" and (d) her opinion that ""the Best Choice Inn motel  operation was not consistent with human trafficking operations, or a debt bondage scheme."" Mohr Report at 5-6,  16. Federal Rule of Evidence 704 governs the Government's objections. Rule 704(a) ""allows [*5]  an expert witness to  testify about an ultimate question of fact. But the rule does not permit an expert to instruct the jury how it should  rule, if the expert does not provide any basis for that opinion."" United States v. Richter, 796 F.3d 1173, 1195 (10th    2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4641, *2 Page 3 of 6   Cir. 2015). ""Expert testimony of this sort has been excluded alternatively on the ground that it usurps the function of  the jury in deciding the facts, or because it interferes with the function of the judge in instructing the jury on the law.""  Id. at 1195-96 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Court denies the Government's motion. ""An opinion is not objectionable just because it embraces an ultimate  issue."" Fed. R. Evid. 704(a). Additionally, ""[w]itnesses are permitted to testify about how the law applies to a certain  set of facts, so long as they provide adequate explanations for their conclusions."" Richter, 796 F.3d at 1196. In the  context of expert testimony on prostitution, the Tenth Circuit has held that testimony about common terms in the  prostitute trade, the pimp/prostitute relationship, how pimps recruit and control prostitutes, and similar evidence  can assist the jury in understanding and evaluating evidence concerning the crimes charged. See United States v.  Brinson, 772 F.3d 1314, 1319 (10th Cir. 2014). Therefore, the Tenth Circuit considers the type of topics Ms. Mohr is  anticipated [*6]  to opine on helpful to the jury. Consistent with Tenth Circuit law, her opinions may embrace the  ultimate issue in this matter so long as she explains the basis for her opinions. See Richter, 796 F.3d at 1196. The Court concludes that, in her report, Ms. Mohr has adequately explained the basis for the opinions in her report.  She explains that she conducted an ""independent investigation"" that involved reviewing public records and  scholarly research, examining case-facts and discovery, and utilizing her prior experience as a patrol officer in a  vice and crimes units where she gained experience with prostitution and sex trafficking. Mohr Report at 3; see  also Mem. Op. and Order, Doc. 412 (describing Ms. Mohr's professional background). Her expert opinions will  therefore not ""simply tell the jury what result it should reach without providing any explanation of the criteria on  which that opinion is based or any means by which the jury can exercise independent judgment."" United States v.  Dazey, 403 F.3d 1147, 1171 (10th Cir. 2005). Ms. Mohr's training and analysis provide the jury the tools to  ""exercise [its] independent judgment"" Dazey, 403 F.3d at 1171, to analyze whether holding onto guests' property is  coercive or whether Defendants' operation of the Best Choice Inn was consistent with human [*7]  trafficking,  operation of a brothel, debt bondage, or a slavery scheme. See id. (upholding expert testimony where the expert  had ""considerable experience"" on the topic of bank fraud schemes and the expert ""did not simply tell the jury to  reach a particular verdict based on his own say-so."") The Government's motion to limit Ms. Mohr's testimony under  Rule 704 is therefore denied. II. Federal Rule of Evidence 412 The Government next raises a Federal Rule of Evidence 412 challenge to at least three opinions in Ms. Mohr's  report that she bases on her review of law enforcement officers' interviews with the victims in this case or other  people staying at the Best Choice Inn. First, Ms. Mohr opines that one of the victims ""made clear [to the  interviewing officer] that she was involved in prostitution before moving to the Best Choice Inn."" Mohr Report at 4.  Second, Ms. Mohr notes that ""most of the women who were asked [by law enforcement officers] stated that they  were acting as sex workers long before they came to the Best Choice Inn."" Id. at 10. Third, Ms. Mohr states that  most victims told the officers ""that they were involved in sex work prior to coming to stay or live at the motel."" Id. at  13. The Government contends that Ms. Mohr should not be allowed [*8]  to testify at trial regarding these issues.           2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4641, *5 Page 4 of 6   Defendant Craft invokes Rule 412's exception in criminal cases when the exclusion of the evidence ""would violate  the defendant's constitutional rights."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C). Specifically, Defendant argues that he has the  right to present a complete defense, which is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment's confrontation and compulsory  process clauses, as well as the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process. See United States v. Oldman, 979  F.3d 1234, 1252 (10th Cir. 2020). The Court is mindful of the Defendant's rights under the Constitution as it relates with his ability to defend himself  against the charges brought by the Government. As the Tenth Circuit has recognized, ""A criminal defendant's right  to present a defense is essential to a fair trial."" United States v. Serrano, 406 F.3d 1208, 1214-15 (10th Cir. 2005)  (citing United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, 458 U.S. 858, 875, 102 S. Ct. 3440, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1193 (1982)  (O'Connor, J., concurring)). ""Together, the Fifth and Sixth Amendments provide defendants with the 'right to present  a defense.'"" United States v. Palms, 21 F.4th 689, 702-03 (10th Cir. 2021). The right to ""present a defense,  however, is not unfettered. This right may, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in  the criminal trial process."" United States v. Pablo, 696 F.3d 1280, 1295 (10th Cir. 2012) (citation and quotation  marks omitted). The Court will grant the Government's motion on this issue as the Court has previously ruled that evidence of the  alleged victims' prior acts of prostitution will not be admitted at trial because it is prohibited by Tenth [*9]  Circuit  precedent. See 1/6/23 Memorandum Opinion and Order (Doc. 428). In United States v. Palms, 21 F.4th 689, 703  (10th Cir. 2021), the Tenth Circuit rejected the contention that evidence of a victim's prior commercial sex work or  prostitution should be allowed because it is relevant to countering the allegation that a defendant engaged in sex  trafficking. Under the holding in Palms, the fact the alleged victims in this case may have engaged in prostitution  before the charged crimes does not suggest Defendants did not later coerce them into commercial sex. See id. In  short, pursuant to Palms, such evidence is not relevant or probative of the issue raised in this case and would run  afoul of Federal Rule of Evidence 412. See id. Defendants therefore may not introduce evidence of prior  prostitution by the Jane Doe victims, either through the cross-examination of the victims or through the opinion  testimony of Defendant's expert witnesses, including Ms. Mohr. As the Court has previously noted, its ruling on this issue does not preclude the defense from presenting evidence  or argument that the alleged victims in this case were engaged in consensual prostitution as opposed to being  victims of sex trafficking during the time the government alleges the Defendants violated [*10]  18 U.S.C. §1591 or  conspired to do so. See Doc. 428 at 6. Thus, the Court's instant ruling only prohibits Ms. Mohr from testifying or  providing an expert opinion that references or relies on prior acts of prostitution by the alleged victims. III. Opinions Regarding the Investigation The Government seeks to exclude an opinion by Ms. Mohr that police officer ""group-think"" harms objectivity in  police investigations and that the federal prosecutor in this case did not act as a check on group-thinking.  Specifically, Ms. Mohr opined that: [G]roup loyalty can ... discourage productive interplay between investigators that involves playing devil's  advocate, testing alternate theories of the crime, and challenging the status quo. Top performing investigative  teams purposefully reserve an investigator or crime analyst who has not been part of the investigation, to give  a fresh look at the evidence and propose alternative theories, as a tactic to discourage ... herd mentality .... Sometimes the prosecutor serves in that role, playing devil's advocate, questioning police investigations, trying  to poke holes in the case from the viewpoint of defense counsel. In this case, however, it appears that the  prosecutor was [*11]  mentioned on the interview tapes as participating in decision-making early on. That tends  to preclude the prosecutor from acting in the roll [sic] as the neutral third-party, the person whose job it is to  poke holes in everyone's theories of the case. Id. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4641, *8 Page 5 of 6   The Government argues that the opinion about the prosecutor's role is illogical, uninformed, and irrelevant. See  Doc. 414 at 6. The Government also states that if Ms. Mohr testified about the prosecutor's actions in this case,  then the Government would not be able to rebut that testimony because the prosecutor cannot testify. However, the  Government cited no favorable caselaw in support of its position. The Court will allow Ms. Mohr's testimony on the topic of the quality of the investigation in this case. As this Court  has noted, ""the facts surrounding the government's investigation may become relevant . . . when they would affect  the reliability of a particular piece of evidence."" United States v. Perrault, No. CR 17-02558-MV-1, 2019 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 50383, 2019 WL 1375666, at *1 (D.N.M. Mar. 26, 2019) (quoting United States v. McVeigh, 153 F.3d 1166,  1192 (10th Cir. 1992)). ""The quality or bias of the government's investigation that produces the evidence that is  submitted to the jury may affect the reliability of the evidence, and would therefore be relevant information."" Id.  (citation omitted). ""It may bear on [*12]  the quality of the government's witnesses and, perhaps more importantly,  the weight to be given to evidence produced by [the] investigation."" Id. (citation omitted). The Court has already  qualified Ms. Mohr as an expert in, among other things, police practices and permitted her to testify about ""her  opinions and observations regarding the investigation that was conducted in this matter."" Mem. Op. and Order,  Doc. 412 (quotation marks omitted). Consistent with the Court's prior Order qualifying Ms. Mohr as an expert in the  field of police practices, along with the standards described in Perrault, Ms. Mohr may testify that evidence  submitted to the jury may have been affected by the quality or bias of the government's investigation. IV. Opinions Regarding Witnesses' Credibility Finally, the Government argues that Ms. Mohr's report indicates that she will improperly comment on the credibility  of witnesses. See Doc. 414 at 6. In the portion of her expert report entitled, ""Interaction of sex workers with law  enforcement — interviews and interrogation"", Ms. Mohr discussed modern policing protocol for prostitution crimes,  which typically involves arresting a prostitution worker and placing him or her [*13]  in rehabilitation services. See  Mohr Report at 12. Ms. Mohr suggested that in some instances, however, sex workers may have little choice but to  become police informants, as happened in this case with one of the alleged victims. Id. Ms. Mohr then stated that, [e]ach of the sex workers staying at the Best Choice are in a precarious situation when contacted by law  enforcement .... They will say anything to try to keep from being incarcerated, and they are very good at quickly  figuring out what the officers want to hear, and tailoring their statements around what is being reinforced, even  subtly, by law enforcement. Id. Ms. Mohr also opined later in the ""Summary of Opinions"" portion of her report that the Best Choice Inn was, in  fact, ""a legitimate business, even though its clients were sex workers, and other unsavory characters."" Id. at 16. The Government states that these opinions conflict with the Tenth Circuit directive that ""[t]he credibility of witnesses  is generally not an appropriate subject for expert testimony,"" because it ""(1) usurps a critical function of the jury; (2)  is not helpful to the jury, which can make its own determination of credibility; and (3) when provided by  impressively [*14]  qualified experts on the credibility of other witnesses is prejudicial and unduly influences the  jury."" United States v. Hill, 749 F.3d 1250, 1258 (10th Cir. 2014) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  Defendant did not address the Government's objection. The Court will reserve ruling on the Government's motion. The Court has already held that Ms. Mohr has  ""specialized knowledge"" Fed. R. Evid 702(a), on the topics of ""police practices and interviews, false confessions  and vice investigations (including prostitution and human trafficking)"" and that her testimony will assist the jury.  Mem. Op. and Order, Doc 412 at 13. Furthermore, the Court does not necessarily agree with the Government's  insistence that Ms. Mohr will provide an expert opinion on the credibility of any of the witnesses in this case. Her  report, read in context, discusses how sex workers' interactions with law enforcement officers can be affected by  fear of being incarcerated. This type of opinion is different than the opinion found improper in Hill, where the  Government's expert witness testified that, in his opinion and based on his experience and knowledge, the  defendant in that case was not being truthful during his interrogation by law enforcement officers. See Hill 749 F.3d  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4641, *11 Page 6 of 6   at 1256-61. Here, there is no [*15]  clear indication that Ms. Mohr is expected to opine at trial that the alleged  victims are not credible, but if she attempts to do so the Government may restate its objection at that time.",1
"Rice Enters., LLC v. RSUI Indem. Co., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217212","OPINION Plaintiff, Rice Enterprises, LLC, brings the within action  against Defendants, RSUI Indemnity Company and  Zenith Insurance Company, concerning insurance  coverage for defense and indemnification based upon a  pending Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas  lawsuit (L.H. lawsuit). (ECF No. 20). Specifically, Rice's Amended Complaint avers claims for  Declaratory Judgment (Counts I and II), Breach of  Contract (Counts III, IV, and V), and Statutory Bad Faith  under 42 Pa.C.S. § 8371 (Counts VI and VII) due to 1)  RSUI's denial of indemnification under Rice's Directors  and Officers [*2]  Liability policy (D&O policy); 2) RSUI's  denial of defense and indemnification under Rice's  Commercial Umbrella Liability policy (Umbrella policy);  and 3) Zenith's denial of defense and indemnification  under Rice's Employers' Liability policy (Zenith policy).  Id. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), Zenith moves for  dismissal, contending that it owes no duty to defend  and/or indemnify under the Zenith policy because of the  policy's exclusion language, and that Rice's claim for  statutory bad faith fails as a result. (ECF No. 23). RSUI  moves for partial dismissal, contending that it owes no  duty to defend and/or indemnify under the Umbrella  policy, and that Rice's claim for statutory bad faith fails.  (ECF No. 21). Upon consideration of Defendants' Motions (ECF Nos.  21 and 23), the respective briefs (ECF Nos. 22, 24, 27,  30, and 31), and for the following reasons, Zenith's  Motion to Dismiss will be granted, and RSUI's Partial  Motion to Dismiss will be granted. I. Background A. L.H. Lawsuit On or around September 21, 2021, L.H., a minor, by  and through her parents and natural guardians T.H. and  B.H. (collectively, ""L.H.""), filed a civil action in the Court  of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania,  Page 2 of 8 against [*3]  Rice Enterprises, McDonald's USA, LLC,  and McDonald's Corporation (collectively Rice and  McDonald's). (ECF No. 20 at ¶ 6 and ECF No. 20-1).  The plaintiffs allege that on October 25, 2020, L.H., then  14 years old, applied for a job with McDonald's via the  McDonald's Careers website. Id. at ¶ 27. L.H. was hired  to work as a ""Crew Member"" at a McDonald's restaurant  operated by Rice Enterprises. Id. at ¶ 36. L.H. allegedly  did not receive the full three-day orientation training that  she was promised, nor did she receive any training  concerning sexual harassment and reporting of the  same. Id. at ¶¶ 37-44. In January 2021, a new manager, Walter A. Garner,  was hired, and he thereafter supervised L.H.'s shift. Id.  at ¶ 46. ""Unbeknownst to [L.H.],"" Garner was hired,  even though he was (and remains) publicly registered  as a ""Lifetime Offender"" on Megan's Law Public Report  following  his  2003  guilty  plea,  conviction,  and  incarceration for sexual assault of a 10-year-old girl. Id.  at ¶ 47. L.H. alleges that ""Garner began sexually  harassing [her] almost immediately after they began  working together on the same shift."" Id. at ¶ 48. Other  McDonald's  employees  and  managers  allegedly  overheard Garner's [*4]  verbal harassment. Id. at ¶¶  49-50. L.H. alleges that Garner's comments soon  ""became both more overt and more frequent,"" and then  ""Garner began touching [L.H.] inappropriately, including  brushing up against her while walking by, touching her  hair, and touching other parts of her body."" Id. at ¶ 55.  L.H. avers that ""Garner was also abusing and harassing  other minor McDonald's employees"" at the same that he  was harassing L.H. Id. at ¶ 58. L.H. and two other  employees allegedly informed McDonald's ""about the  harassment they were experiencing and the identity of  the manager,"" but it is alleged that ""McDonald's did not  take any steps to stop the harassment."" Id. at ¶¶ 65, 67.  In mid-February 2021, during a work shift , Garner  followed L.H. into the bathroom at the McDonald's  restaurant and raped her. Id. at ¶ 71. Rice allegedly learned about Garner's harassment only  after an unrelated theft on the premises prompted Rice  to review surveillance footage, which coincidentally  showed Garner groping L.H. Id. at ¶¶ 77-78. Although  ""McDonald's management spoke to Garner about the  conduct viewed on video,"" Garner was neither  disciplined nor fired. Id. at ¶ 79. This harassment  allegedly continued [*5]  until Garner was arrested in  mid-April 2021. Id. ¶¶ 80-86. L.H. has alleged a single claim for negligence against  Rice and McDonald's. Id. ¶¶ 116-119. It is alleged that  Rice  and  McDonald's  were  negligent  in  failing  adequately train L.H. ""on how to identify, address, and  report incidents of sexual harassment, sexual assault  and/or battery, and sexually hostile work environment"";  and in ""[f]ailing to adequately perform screening and/or  background checks on Garner prior to hiring"" him; and  in ""[f]ailing to adequately supervise Garner""; and in  ""failing to properly address"" employee ""complaints of  harassment and abuse""; and in""[f]ailing to publish and  distribute policies and procedures on sexual harassment  and reporting."" Id. at ¶ 117. B. Present Lawsuit 1. Allegations against Zenith Rice alleges it was the named insured on a Zenith  Employers' Liability policy. Id. at ¶ 40. On August 15,  2022, Rice provided Zenith with notice of L.H.'s  Allegheny County Complaint, and requested Zenith's  defense and indemnification for that lawsuit. Id. at ¶ 41.  On September 19, 2022, Zenith sent Rice a coverage  denial letter. Id. at ¶ 43. Zenith relies upon two  exclusions for denying coverage. Id. at ¶ 44. [*6]  Rice  argues that Zenith's coverage denial under said  exclusions is nonsensical and meritless. Id. at ¶ 50. Rice  avers claims against Zenith for Declaratory Judgment  (Count I), Breach of Contract (Count III), and Bad Faith  Pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 8371 (Count VI). 2. Rice's allegations against RSUI Rice avers that it is the named insured on an RSUI  Directors and Officers Liability policy. (ECF No. 20 at ¶  25). In or around September 22, 2021, Rice submitted  the L.H. lawsuit to RSUI, requesting defense and  indemnification under the D&O policy. Id. at ¶ 26. On  September 29, 2021 and December 2, 2021, RSUI  acknowledged that it owed a duty to defend Rice for the  L.H. Lawsuit under the D&O policy. Id. at ¶ 27.  However, on March 3, 2023, RSUI, denied indemnity  coverage for the L.H. Lawsuit under the D&O policy. Id.  at ¶ 36. Rice avers claims against RSUI for Declaratory  Judgment (Count II), Breach of Contract (Count IV), and  Bad Faith Pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 8371 (Count VII)  concerning the D&O policy. Rice also avers that it is the named insured on an RSUI  Commercial Umbrella policy. Id. at ¶ 51. The Umbrella  policy affords coverage to Rice above and beyond the  Zenith policy and the RSUI D&O policy. Id. at ¶ 52 (ECF  No. 20-8). [*7]  In or around September 22, 2021, Rice  submitted the L.H. lawsuit to RSUI, requesting defense  Page 3 of 8 and indemnification pursuant to the Umbrella policy in  relation to the L.H. Lawsuit. Id. at ¶ 53. Rice alleges that  RSUI knew of the existence of the Umbrella policy, but it  failed to acknowledge Rice's tender of coverage under  the Umbrella policy in either of its September 29th or  December 2nd letters. Id. at ¶ 55. While acknowledging  its duty to defend Rice under the D&O policy, RSUI  denies any defense or indemnity coverage under the  Umbrella policy. Id. at ¶ 56. Rice avers claims against  RSUI for Declaratory Judgment (Count II), Breach of  Contract (Count V), and Bad Faith Pursuant to 42  Pa.C.S. § 8371 (Count VII) concerning the Umbrella  policy. II. Relevant Standards A. Motion to Dismiss When reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal  Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the court must ""accept  all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in  the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine  whether,  under  any  reasonable  reading  of  the  complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief."" Eid v.  Thompson, 740 F.3d 118, 122 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting  Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 233 (3d  Cir.2008)). ""To survive a motion to dismiss a complaint  must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true,  to 'state a claim to relief [*8]  that is plausible on its  face.'"" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct.  1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp.  v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L.  Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). ""A claim has facial plausibility when  the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court  to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is  liable for the misconduct alleged."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678  (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556); see also Thompson  v. Real Estate Mortg. Network, 748 F.3d 142, 147 (3d  Cir. 2014). ""Threadbare recitals of the elements of a  cause of action, supported by mere conclusory  statements, do not suffice."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  ""Factual allegations of a complaint must be enough to  raise a right to relief above the speculative level.""  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. A pleading party need not  establish the elements of a prima facie case at this  stage; the party must only ""put forth allegations that  'raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal  evidence of the necessary element[s].'"" Fowler v. UPMC  Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 213 (3d Cir.2009) (quoting  Graff v. Subbiah Cardiology Associates, Ltd., 2008 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 44192, 2008 WL 2312671 (W.D. Pa. June  4, 2008)); see also Connelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809  F.3d 780, 790 (3d Cir.2016) (""Although a reviewing  court now affirmatively disregards a pleading's legal  conclusions, it must still . . . assume all remaining  factual allegations to be true, construe those truths in  the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and then draw all  reasonable inferences from them."") (citing Foglia v.  Renal Ventures Mgmt., LLC, 754 F.3d 153, 154 n. 1 (3d  Cir.2014)). Nonetheless, a court need not credit bald assertions,  unwarranted inferences, or legal conclusions cast in the  form of factual averments. Morse v. Lower Merion  School District, 132 F.3d 902, 906, n. 8 (3d Cir.1997).  The primary question in [*9]  deciding a motion to  dismiss is not whether the Plaintiff will ultimately prevail,  but rather whether he or she is entitled to offer evidence  to establish the facts alleged in the complaint. Maio v.  Aetna, 221 F.3d 472, 482 (3d Cir.2000). The purpose of  a motion to dismiss is to ""streamline [ ] litigation by  dispensing with needless discovery and factfinding.""  Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 326-327, 109 S. Ct.  1827, 104 L. Ed. 2d 338, (1989). B. Insurance Policy Interpretation Pennsylvania courts apply traditional rules of contract  interpretation to insurance policies. The goal is to  ascertain the parties' intent, as manifested by the policy  language. Madison Constr. Co. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins.  Co., 557 Pa. 595, 735 A.2d 100, 106 (Pa. 1999).  Pennsylvania courts give words of common usage their  ""natural, plain, and ordinary sense."" Kvaerner Metals  Div. of Kvaerner v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 589 Pa.  317, 908 A.2d 888, 897 (Pa. 2006). Clear and  unambiguous terms must be given their effect.  Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. CPB Int'l, 562 F.3d 591, 595  (3d Cir. 2009); Kvaerner, 908 A.2d at 897. ""[A] provision  is ambiguous only if reasonable people could, in the  context of the entire policy, fairly ascribe different  meanings to it."" Frog, Switch & Mfg. Co. v. Travelers  Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 742, 746 (3d Cir. 1999). C. Duties to Defend and Indemnify In determining whether an insurer has a duty to defend,  Pennsylvania courts follow the ""four corners"" rule, which  requires comparison of ""the four corners of the  insurance contract to the four corners of the complaint.""  Am. & Foreign Ins. Co. v. Jerry's Sport Ctr., Inc., 606  Pa. 584, 2 A.3d 526, 541 (Pa. 2010). ""[O]nly allegations  contained within the underlying complaint pertaining to  Page 4 of 8 injuries which are either actually or potentially [*10]   within the scope of the insurance policy obligate the  insurer to defend the insured."" Erie Ins. Exch. v.  Claypoole, 449 Pa. Super. 142, 673 A.2d 348, 355-56  (Pa. Super. Ct. 1996). ""[T]he particular cause of action  that a complainant pleads is not determinative of  whether coverage has been triggered. Instead it is  necessary to look at the factual allegations contained in  the complaint."" Mut. Benefit Ins. Co. v. Haver, 555 Pa.  534, 725 A.2d 743, 745 (Pa. 1999); see also Scopel v.  Donegal Mut. Ins. Co., 698 A.2d 602, 605 (Pa. Super.  Ct. 1997) (""[I]n focusing attention upon the cause of  action pled, [claimants] run afoul of our caselaw, which  dictates that the factual averments contained in a  complaint determine whether an insurer must defend."").  This prevents ""the use of artful pleadings designed to  avoid exclusions in liability insurance policies."" Haver,  725 A.2d at 745. III. Discussion A. Zenith's Motion to Dismiss Zenith moves to dismiss Rice's claims for defense and  indemnification under its Employer's Liability policy in  Count I (Declaratory Judgment), Count III (Breach of  Contract), and Count VI (Statutory Bad Faith). 1. Zenith Policy Zenith's policy provides that it ""will pay all sums that you  legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury to  your employees, provided the bodily injury is covered by  this Employers' Liability Insurance."" (ECF No. 20-6 Part  Two, § B). Zenith argues that exclusions within said  policy precludes coverage [*11]  of the claims and  damages at issue in the L.H. lawsuit. Part Two of the  Zenith policy contains a number of exclusions, including  the following: This insurance does not cover: . . . 4.  Any  obligation  imposed  by  a  workers'  compensation,  occupational  disease,  unemployment compensation, or disability benefits  law, or any similar law; ... 7. Damages arising out of coercion, criticism,  demotion, evaluation, reassignment, discipline,  defamation, harassment, humiliation, discrimination  against or termination of any employee, or any  personnel practices, policies, acts or omissions; Id. at p. 8 (""Exclusions C.4 and C.7""). 2. Analysis a. Exclusion C.4 Zenith argues that coverage is barred under Exclusion  C.4, because the L.H. lawsuit arises out of an obligation  imposed by a worker's compensation law. Specifically,  Zenith contends that, as alleged in her complaint, L.H.  was subjected to harassment, inappropriate touching,  abuse, sexual harassment, coercion, and sexual assault  by her supervisor on Rice's premises and during her  work shifts. (ECF No. 20-1 at ¶¶ 5-6, 43-95). The L.H.  lawsuit also claims her harm was the result of Rice's  negligent decision to hire and failure to supervise  Garner. Id. Zenith [*12]  maintains that any recovery by  L.H. from Rice would be an ""obligation imposed by a  workers' compensation,"" such that coverage under the  Employer Liability policy is excluded by policy Exclusion  C.4. Rice maintains that none of the claims or damages  asserted in the L.H. lawsuit involve or implicate any  obligation imposed by any ""occupational disease,  unemployment compensation, or disability benefits law,  or any similar law."" Rice argues that Zenith's own denial  of coverage letter concedes that L.H. does not seek to  recover benefits under the Pennsylvania Workers'  Compensation Act (""PWCA""). Rice contends that, since  no worker's compensation claim has been filed by L.H.,  coverage under the Zenith Employers' Liability policy is  not excluded. In addition, Rice argues that an  employers' liability policy covers injuries to employees. As regards Rice's argument against Exclusion C.4,  based upon no worker compensation claim having been  filed, in cases interpreting the same policy language,  courts have held that said exclusion bars coverage for  claims that are subject to workers compensation  exclusivity, regardless of whether the employee actually  sought such benefits. ""It is the fact that the [*13]   employee's claim comes within the scope of the  workers' compensation statute rather than the actual  fact that he or she has recovered or is receiving  workers' compensation for his or her harm, which is the  basis for [the workers' compensation exclusion].""  Morales v. Zenith Ins. Co., 152 So. 3d 557, 563 (Fla.  2014) (quoting 8 Couch on Ins. § 115:89 (3d ed. 2013))  (holding identical Exclusion C.4 language barred  coverage for default judgment of personal injury claim).  ""The 'obligation imposed' by the workers' compensation  law is readily understood to mean the obligation as an  employer, under workers' compensation, to provide  benefits. That inchoate obligation exists whether or not  an employee actually chooses to seek benefits.""  Page 5 of 8 Culligan v. State Comp. Ins. Fund, 81 Cal. App. 4th 429,  96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 656, 664 (Cal. App. 2000) (emphasis  added) (holding that identical Exclusion C.4 language  barred coverage for tort lawsuit where injuries were  covered  by  workers  compensation  exclusivity,  regardless of whether the employee actually seeks  workers  compensation  benefits).  The  Court  is  persuaded, that consistent with Morales and Culligan,  application of Exclusion C.4 to deny coverage does not  require that L.H. seek or claim workers compensation  benefits. As such, Exclusion C.4 applies and precludes  coverage for the L.H. lawsuit, notwithstanding L.H. has  not claim [*14]  worker compensation benefits. As regards Rice's argument that the Zenith Employer's  Liability provides a path for coverage for an injury to  employees, such as those alleged by L.H., said  argument lacks merit. The PWCA also ""provides that  worker's compensation is the exclusive remedy for  injuries arising in the course of a worker's employment.""  Durham Life Ins. Co. v. Evans, 166 F.3d 139, 160 (3d  Cir. 1999); see 77 P.S. § 481(a). ""There is a rebuttable  presumption that the injury is work related where it  occurs on the premises of the employer."" Albright v.  Concurrent Techs. Corp., No. 3:21-CV-112, 2022 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 179060, 2022 WL 4640115, at *7 (W.D. Pa.  Sept. 30, 2022). Given the broad sweep of the PWCA's  exclusivity rule, ""the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has  held that even intentional torts committed by the  employer fall within the coverage of the Act"" and are  subject to the exclusivity rule. Danese, 784 F. Supp. at  229 (citing Poyser v. Newman & Co., 514 Pa. 32, 522  A.2d 548, 551 (Pa. 1987)). Courts have broadly applied  the PWCA's exclusivity rule to preempt civil claims for  workplace torts including assault, shootings, and fraud,  among others. See, e.g., Albright v. Concurrent Techs.  Corp., No. 3:21-CV-112, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 179060,  2022 WL 4640115, at *8 (W.D. Pa. Sept. 30, 2022)  (applying PWCA's exclusivity rule to allegations of  workplace ""harassment and hostility""); Abbott v. Anchor  Glass Container Corp., 2000 PA Super 249, 758 A.2d  1219, 1225 (Pa. Super. 2000) (holding PWCA's  exclusivity rule applied to the intentional shooting by a  co-employee, resulting in death). As particularly relevant here, courts have applied the  PWCA's exclusivity rule to preempt claims of workplace  sexual harassment [*15]  and attempted rape. See  Blazevich v. Star Hotels, Inc., Civ. A. No. 3:19-198,  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62988, 2021 WL 1214688, at *8  (W.D. Pa. Mar. 31, 2021) (holding PWCA exclusivity  applied to negligent supervision claims related to sexual  harassment by co-worker); Holland v. NTP Marble, Inc.,  No. 17-CV-2909, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78097, 2019  WL 2059966, at *11 (E.D. Pa. May 8, 2019); Hershey v.  Ninety-Five Assoc., 413 Pa. Super. 158, 604 A.2d 1068,  1070 (Pa. Super 1992) (holding PWCA's exclusivity rule  applied to physical attack and attempted rape). Here,  the injuries and damages alleged by L.H. occurred  during the course of and at L.H.'s Rice employment  worksite. As such, in the facts and circumstances  presented, employer liability to L.H. would be an  obligation imposed by PWCA, and coverage therefore is  excluded by Exclusion C.4 of the Zenith policy. Rice's  arguments to the contrary fail. Exclusion C.4 applies to  exclude coverage under the Zenith policy. b. Exclusion C.7 Zenith argues that Exclusion C.7 bars coverage,  because the L.H. lawsuit arises out of ""harassment,  humiliation, discrimination, or personnel practices,  policies, acts or omissions."" In the L.H. lawsuit, L.H.  contends she was harmed as an employee due to her  supervisor  Garner's  misconduct,  including  sexual  harassment. L.H. also alleges that Rice's negligence in  its personnel practices, policies, acts and omissions  caused her harm. Zenith denied coverage based upon  allegations within the L.H. lawsuit and the application of  Exclusion C.7. Rice asserts [*16]  that Exclusion C.7 does not apply to  the allegations in the L.H. lawsuit, because the  damages sought by L.H. arise out of ""coercion, criticism,  demotion,  evaluation,  reassignment,  discipline,  defamation, harassment, humiliation..."" from Garner and  not by employer Rice. Rice further contends that the  term ""sexual misconduct"" is not specified as an  exclusion under Exclusion C. 7. Further, as regards  Exclusion C.7's terms ""personnel practices, policies,  acts or omissions,"" Rice argues that said language is  ambiguous and undefined in the policy; and, where  Zenith now seeks to exclude coverage, based upon  such policy language, Zenith's failure to define such  terms prevents enforcement of Exclusion C.7 in this  case. Presently, where coverage is denied based on an  exclusion, the burden is on the insurer to prove the  applicability of the claimed exclusion. Nationwide Mutual  Insurance Co. v. Arnold, 2019 PA Super 213, 214 A.3d  688, 695, 701-02 (Pa. Super. 2019). Exclusion C.7  precludes damages that arise out of enumerated  circumstances or events. Pennsylvania courts interpret  the phrase ""arising out of"" in policy exclusions in a very  broad manner to mean a causal, ""but for"" relationship.  Madison Contr. Co. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., 557  Page 6 of 8 Pa. 595, 735 A.2d 100, 110 (Pa. 1999); McCabe v. Old  Republic Ins Co., 425 Pa. 221, 228 A.2d 901, 903 (Pa.  1967) (stating that ""arising out of"" unambiguously  means ""causally connected with, not proximately  caused by""). [*17]  If the alleged injuries would not have  happened but for the excluded conduct, the injuries  ""arise out of"" the conduct. First Liberty Ins. Corp. v. Coll,  2015 Phila. Ct. Com. Pl. LEXIS 14, at *14 (Pa. Ct.  Comm. Pl. Jan. 6, 2015), aff'd, 131 A.3d 85 (Pa. Super.  Ct. 2015). Rice's argument, that coverage under the Zenith Policy  cannot be excluded because of the conduct of Garner,  lacks merit. Other courts have addressed identical  language contained in Exclusion C.7 and ultimately  concluded that allegations of conduct similar to  Garner's, as alleged in the L.H. lawsuit, satisfies the  ""arise out of"" causal link to exclude coverage. See, e.g.  Gen. Star Indem. Co. v. Sch. Excess Liab. Fund, 888  F.Supp. 1022, 1028 (N.D. Cal. 1995) (finding exclusion  based upon allegations of coercive conduct by  supervisor and employee humiliation); Fisher v. St. Paul  Ins. Co., 02 C 9488, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6525, 2003  WL 1903983, at *9 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 17, 2003) (upholding  exclusion  based  upon  allegations  of  sexual  discrimination, harassment, and assault); TIG Ins. Co. v.  Sweet Factory, Inc., 748 So.2d 337, 339 (Fla. Dist. Ct.  App. 1999) (upholding exclusion based upon clear and  unambiguous language wherein, like the L.H. complaint,  alleged sexual harassment of minor employee by  supervisor). Here, the L.H. lawsuit unequivocally sets  forth  allegations  of  ""damages  arising  out  of""  harassment, humiliation, and coercion."" (ECF No. 20-1  at ¶¶ 48, 56, 61-62, and 82(a)). Thus, as to the conduct  of Garner, vis-à-vis coverage for Rice, Exclusion C.7  applies to preclude coverage. Further, the L.H. lawsuit alleges her damages ""arise  out [*18]  of"" Rice's personnel practices, policies, acts or  omissions, namely, in hiring Garner despite his sexual  misconduct history, and his status as a registered sex  offender, and Rice's failure to adequately train L.H. and  take action following the observation and/or reports of  Garner's misconduct. Each of these allegations support  the applicability of Exclusion C.7 to preclude coverage  to Rice. The Court finds no ambiguity in the policy  language, and L.H.'s complaint allegations fall squarely  within the plain meaning of the terms ""personnel  practices, policies, acts or omissions."" Thus, Exclusion  C.7 applies to preclude Zenith's coverage for Rice. c. Bad Faith Finally, as regards Rice's claim for Bad Faith against  Zenith, Zenith argues that Rice's statutory bad faith  claim fails because, where the policy provides for a  reasonable basis for exclusion, there can be no bad  faith as a matter of law. Rice contends that it has  sufficiently pleaded a bad faith claim against Zenith. ""Resolution of a coverage claim on the merits in favor of  the insurer requires dismissal of a bad faith claim  premised on the denial of coverage, because under the  circumstances  the  insurer  necessarily  has  a  reasonable [*19]  basis for denying benefits."" Gold v.  State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., 880 F. Supp. 2d 587, 597  (E.D. Pa. 2012) (citing Frog, Switch, & Mfg. Co., Inc. v.  Travelers Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 742, 751 n. 9 (3d Cir.  1999)). Here, given that Exclusions C.4 and C.7 of the Zenith  policy apply to exclude coverage to Rice, Zenith's denial  of a defense and indemnification under its policy was  reasonable. As such, Rice cannot maintain a statutory  bad faith claim against Zenith for its refusal to defend  and indemnify. Accordingly, based upon the foregoing, Zenith's Motion  to Dismiss will be granted. Rice's claims against Zenith,  Counts I, III, and VI will be dismissed. Because the  Court's analysis is based upon the policy language and  allegations within the L.H. lawsuit, any amendment to  Rice's claims against Zenith would be futile. Therefore,  there will be no leave to amend. All claims against  Zenith will be dismissed, with prejudice. B. RSUI's Partial Motion to Dismiss RSUI moves to dismiss Rice's claims for Declaratory  Judgment (Count II), Breach of Contract (Count V), and  Statutory Bad Faith (Count VII), concerning Rice's  tender for defense and indemnification under the RSUI  Umbrella policy. 1. The RSUI Commercial Umbrella Liability Policy The RSUI Umbrella policy provides in relevant part as  follows: I. INSURING AGREEMENT 1. We will pay on behalf of the insured those  sums [*20]  in excess of the ""retained limit"" which  the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as  damages to which this insurance applied because  of ""bodily injury"", ""property damage"" or ""personal  and advertising injury"". *** Page 7 of 8 2. We will have the right and duty to defend any  ""suit"" seeking those damages when: a. The applicable limits of insurance of the  ""underlying insurance"" and other insurance  have been used up in the payment of  judgments or settlements; or b. No other valid and collectible insurance is  available to the insured for damages covered  by this policy. *** 9. Loss Payments a. We will have liability for any one ""occurrence"" or  offense only when the amount of the ""retained limit""  with respect to such ""occurrence"" of offense has  been paid by: (1) The insured; (2) Us on behalf of the insured (other than this  policy; or (3) The insured's underlying insurer. b. If we are obliged to indemnify the insured for any  payment or judgments or settlements, the insured  must make a written claim within 12 months of: (1) Actually paying any amount in excess of the  ""retained limit""; or (2) The insured's liability being made certain  by: (a) The final judgment of a trial; or (b)  The  written  agreement  of  the  insured, [*21]   the  claimant  or  the  claimant's legal representative and us. (ECF No. 20-8 at pp. 31, 14-16). 2. Analysis a. Duty to Defend RSUI argues that any duty to defend Rice under its  Umbrella policy has not been triggered. Specifically,  RSUI maintains that Rice's underlying insurance, which  includes the RSUI D&O policy and the Zenith policy, has  not been ""used up in the payment of judgments or  settlements,"" and Rice does not aver that ""no other valid  or collectible insurance is available to the insured for  damages covered by [the RSUI Commercial Umbrella  Liability policy]."" Given this Court's above ruling, that  there is no coverage under the Zenith Policy, no further  discussion concerning Zenith is necessary. The only  remaining issue as regards the Umbrella policy is the  status of coverage under the RSUI D&O policy. In  regards to the RSUI D&O policy, RSUI contends that, if  the D&O policy partially applies to the claims in the L.H.  lawsuit, as Rice contends, then the L.H. lawsuit is not an  uncovered occurrence for purposes of the RSUI  Umbrella policy. Rice maintains that, because of the  Zenith  coverage  denial,  it  has  an  ""uncovered  occurrence"" that would trigger RSUI's Umbrella policy. ""When an insured [*22]  is covered by both a primary  policy and an excess policy, the general rule is that the  excess liability carrier is not obligated to participate in  the defense until the primary policy limits are  exhausted."" Steven Plitt et al., Couch on Insurance §  200:42 (3d. ed. 2020). The Third Circuit has explained  that ""a true excess or secondary policy is not 'triggered'  or required to pay until the underlying primary coverage  has been exhausted."" Koppers Co. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur.  Co., 98 F.3d 1440, 1454 (3d Cir. 1996). Here, Rice's Amended Complaint does not support the  triggering of RSUI's Umbrella policy, because RSUI has  accepted Rice's defense tender under its D&O policy.  (ECF No. 20 at ¶ 27). Therefore, under the Umbrella  policy language, there has yet to be an uncovered  ""occurrence,"" notwithstanding the lack of any coverage  under the Zenith policy. In addition, Rice's claim for  excess coverage under RSUI Umbrella policy is  premature because Rice does not allege the limits of  liability and defense under the D&O policy have been  exhausted. Thus, Rice cannot claim any present duty to  defend under RSUI's Umbrella policy. Accordingly,  RSUI's Partial Motion to Dismiss, as regards defense in  the L.H. lawsuit under the Umbrella policy, will be  granted. b. Duty to Indemnify [*23]  RSUI also argues that Rice's request for indemnification  under the Umbrella policy is premature. It maintains that  coverage for loss payments is only triggered when the  retained limit has been paid by the insured, or paid by  RSUI on behalf of the insured under policies other than  the Commercial Umbrella Liability policy, or paid by  Rice's other underlying insurer(s). RSUI contends that  none of these conditions have been met; therefore, no  duty has yet arisen under the RSUI Umbrella policy.  Rice argues that its demand for indemnification is timely  and judicially economical. Specifically, it maintains that  dismissal of the claims against RSUI's Umbrella policy  should not occur, given that the L.H. lawsuit remains  unresolved and the necessity of the Umbrella policy is  unknown. Under Pennsylvania law, ""[a]n insurer is required to  indemnify only where the insured is held liable for a  claim actually covered by the policy."" USX Corp. v.  Adriatic Ins. Co., 99 F.Supp.2d 593, 611 (W.D.Pa.2000)  Page 8 of 8 (citing Gen. Accident Ins. Co. of Am. v. Allen, 547 Pa.  693, 692 A.2d 1089, 1095 (1997)). ""As a general rule, a  court entertaining a declaratory judgment action in an  insurance  coverage  case  should  refrain  from  determining the insurer's duty to indemnify until the  insured is found liable for damages in the underlying  action."" Victoria Ins. Co. v. Mincin Insulation Servs., No.  Civ.A. 08-909, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106536, 2009 WL  90644, at *5 (W.D.Pa. Jan. 14, 2009) (quotation  omitted). [*24]  Here, Rice's argument against prematurity is unavailing  based upon the above well-settled law. Rice has not  alleged that liability in the L.H. lawsuit has been  established, and where Rice has not been found liable  for damages in the underlying action, any claim for  RSUI to indemnify is premature. Further, Rice has not  alleged that any underlying coverage under the RSUI  D&O policy has been exhausted. Thus, RSUI's partial  Motion to Dismiss, as regards indemnity under the  Umbrella policy, will be granted. c. Statutory Bad Faith Finally, RSUI argues that Rice's statutory bad faith claim  fails because, when no coverage for defense and/or  indemnification exists, there can be no bad faith as a  matter of law. Rice contends that it made a legitimate  demand for coverage pursuant to the terms and  requirements of the Umbrella Policy, and that the  question, of whether RSUI's refusal to defend and  indemnify under its Umbrella Policy was in bad faith,  remains a question of fact. ""Resolution of a coverage claim on the merits in favor of  the insurer requires dismissal of a bad faith claim  premised on the denial of coverage, because under the  circumstances the insurer necessarily has a reasonable  basis [*25]  for denying benefits."" Gold v. State Farm  Fire and Cas. Co., 880 F. Supp. 2d 587, 597 (E.D. Pa.  2012) (citing Frog, Switch, & Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Travelers  Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 742, 751 n. 9 (3d Cir. 1999)). Here, given that the language of the Umbrella policy  does not provide Rice within any present right to  coverage,  RSUI's  denial  of  a  defense  and  indemnification under the Umbrella policy is reasonable.  As such, Rice cannot presently maintain a statutory bad  faith claim against RSUI concerning RSUI's denial of  coverage under the Umbrella policy. Accordingly, based upon the foregoing, RSUI's Partial  Motion to Dismiss will be granted. Rice's claims, as  regards the RSUI Umbrella Policy within Counts II  (Declaratory Judgment), Count V (Breach of Contract),  and VII (Bad Faith) will be dismissed. Because the  Court's analysis is based upon the policy language, the  pending status L.H. lawsuit, and the non-exhaustion of  the RSUI D&O policy, any amendment to Rice's  dismissed claims against RSUI related to the Umbrella  policy would be futile. Therefore, there will be no leave  to amend. A separate order will follow pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. 58,  and will direct RSUI to answer the remaining claims  against it. DATED this 6th day of December, 2023. BY THE COURT: /s/ Marilyn J. Horan MARILYN J. HORAN United States District Judge ORDER Following consideration of Defendants' Motions to  Dismiss [*26]  (ECF Nos. 21 and 23), the respective  briefs (ECF Nos. 22, 24, 27, 30, and 31), and for the  reasons stated in this Court's Opinion (ECF No. 40),  Zenith's Motion to Dismiss is granted, and RSUI's  Partial Motion to Dismiss is granted. Therefore, it is  hereby ordered as follows: 1. All claims against Zenith are dismissed. 2. Counts II, V, and VII against RSUI concerning  the Umbrella policy are dismissed. 3. No leave to amend is granted. 4. RSUI shall file an Answer to Counts II, IV, and  VII of the Amended Complaint concerning the D&O  Policy on or before December 20, 2023.

"United States v. Gemma, 818 F.3d 23","[*27]  STAHL, Circuit Judge. In 2012, Defendant-Appellant Michael Gemma was convicted in federal district court  of sex trafficking and transporting minors to engage in prostitution. In this appeal, Gemma makes a plethora of  challenges to the district court's judgment. Finding none of merit, we AFFIRM. I. Facts and Background In September 2011, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Dylan Morris spotted a red Nissan Altima with  Pennsylvania tags traveling approximately 95 miles per hour on I-84. After giving chase, the officer pulled the  vehicle over. Upon approaching the vehicle, [**2]  the trooper requested identification from the driver, Michael  Gemma, who produced a Florida driver's license and a car rental agreement. Trooper Morris also noticed that the female passenger, ""A.L.,"" was not wearing a seatbelt. Because of this, Morris  asked her for identification in order to cite her for the violation. A.L. informed the trooper that she did not have her  I.D., but stated that her name was ""Ashley Torres."" Morris asked for her date of birth. A.L. responded ""December  23."" When asked for the year, A.L. responded ""1992?,"" with  [*28]  a rising vocal inflection as though her birth year  was a question. Trooper Morris then asked A.L. to step out of the car so that he could speak with her separately. A.L. told Morris  that she had moved back to Boston from Puerto Rico, gave her mother's address, and indicated that she had  known Gemma for about two years. Trooper Morris returned to the vehicle and asked Gemma about A.L. Gemma  responded that he knew only her first name and had known her only for about a month. Trooper Morris later testified that, at this point, he noticed a faint odor of raw marijuana coming from the interior of  the vehicle. Morris asked Gemma to step out of the vehicle, [**3]  advised him of his Miranda rights, and proceeded  to conduct a thorough search of the vehicle, including the trunk. Inside the vehicle, Morris observed lingerie, high  heel shoes, a quantity of condoms, and a laptop computer, but no marijuana. Around this time, Trooper Scott Shea arrived at the scene. Shea ran Gemma's driver's license information and  discovered that his right to operate a motor vehicle in Massachusetts had been suspended. Gemma was placed  under arrest for driving with a suspended license.  818 F.3d 23, *23; 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 5852, **1 Page 7 of 15   Trooper Morris then resumed questioning A.L. about her identity. A.L. provided her mother's name and address,  and said that her mother's phone number was stored in her cell phone, which was still in the vehicle. With A.L.'s  permission, Morris retrieved the phone from the car so that A.L. could call her mother. When A.L. turned the phone  on, Morris noticed text messages, such as ""Are you available for an outcall?"" and ""I have $200."" Trooper Morris  recognized these messages as consistent with prostitution. Morris then spoke on the phone with A.L.'s mother,  who provided A.L.'s true name, informed him that she was sixteen years old, and advised him that A.L. had run  away from Department of [**4]  Children and Families (""DCF"") custody. A.L.'s mother also informed him that there  was a Child-in-Need-of-Services warrant outstanding for her. The troopers took both Gemma and A.L. back to the  state police barracks in separate cruisers. Back at the barracks, Morris interviewed A.L., who revealed that she and Gemma were returning from New York  and New Jersey where Gemma had been posting internet advertisements offering sex with her. Trooper Morris  later found ads on the internet for sex that showed A.L.'s photograph and contained A.L.'s or Gemma's phone  number. During police questioning, Gemma admitted that A.L. was a prostitute, but he denied any involvement. On May 17, 2012, Gemma was indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts for sex  trafficking of children or by force, fraud, or coercion, and aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)  and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Count 1), and transporting minors to engage in prostitution and aiding and abetting, in violation  of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a) and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Count 2). Before trial, Gemma moved to suppress all physical and  testimonial evidence deriving from Trooper Morris' search of the Nissan Altima. The district court partially granted  this motion, excluding the [**5]  contents of the defendant's laptop and cell phone as well as Trooper Morris'  observations. The court, however, declined to suppress A.L.'s cell phone and the contents thereof. The court held  that neither party had adequately addressed the circumstances of its seizure and found that the phone had been  taken with A.L.'s consent. Because Gemma had ""no possessory interest in A.L.'s cell phone,"" the court held that he  lacked  [*29]  standing to challenge its seizure and subsequent search. At the start of the trial, as part of the preliminary instructions to the jury, the court read the allegations of the  indictment. This reading included the charges of aiding and abetting. During the course of the trial, A.L. testified that  she had run away from DCF custody and met the defendant through a friend. The defendant had communicated  with A.L. by text messages and Facebook. A.L. testified that she told the defendant how old she was, and that her  Facebook page listed her correct age. A.L. eventually went to stay with the defendant, who brought her to a hotel in  Woburn, Massachusetts and introduced her to a pimp who went by the name ""Rich Dollar"" and a prostitute, Nicki.  According to A.L., the defendant [**6]  then took ""sexual"" pictures of her with his cell phone, brought her to another  hotel in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, and instructed Nicki to explain to A.L. that she had been brought there to  exchange sex for money. After the defendant posted ads on the internet, A.L. began to receive calls and texts from  men who wanted to pay to have sex with her. A.L. testified that she initially refused these calls, but, after Gemma threatened to hit her if she did not answer them,  she thereafter engaged in prostitution, giving the money paid for her services to the defendant. According to A.L.,  Gemma continued to threaten her, telling her that if she told anyone what she was doing, she would not like the  outcome. She also testified that when Gemma brought her to New York and New Jersey, she told him that she did  not want to have sex for money anymore and threatened to call the police. In response, Gemma pushed A.L. into a  car, causing her to hit her head and suffer a slight concussion. At the trial's conclusion, the district court provided its final jury instructions. For Count 1, the court explained that  there were two theories under which the government could prove its sex trafficking case. The first [**7]  theory,  which the court referred to as ""Alternative 1A,"" was summarized as ""sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion.""  The second theory, ""Alternative 1B,"" required proving that ""the defendant knew or recklessly disregarded the fact  that A.L. was under the age of 18 and would be caused by anyone, not necessarily the defendant, to engage in a  commercial sex act."" This knowledge element could be proven by showing that ""[t]he defendant actually knew that  A.L. was under the age of 18; that he recklessly disregarded facts that would have given him that knowledge; or, . .  . that he had a reasonable opportunity to observe A.L. in the course of events."" 818 F.3d 23, *28; 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 5852, **3 Page 8 of 15   The court then instructed the jury on Count 2, explaining that the government must prove the transportation of a  minor to engage in prostitution by showing ""[1] that the defendant knowingly transported A.L. in interstate or  foreign commerce; [2] that he did so with an intent that A.L. would engage in prostitution; and, [3] that A.L. had not  attained the age of 18 years."" The court instructed that the government needed to prove A.L.'s age, but not the  defendant's knowledge of A.L.'s age. Neither the court's final jury instructions, nor the jury [**8]  form, mentioned a charge of aiding and abetting. After  deliberations, the jury found the defendant guilty on each count and found that the government had proven his guilt  under both alternative theories for liability under Count 1. II. Analysis On appeal, Gemma raises a number of challenges to the judgment of the district  [*30]  court. In short, the  defendant argues (1) that his indictment was defective based on its failure to allege facts to support the aiding and  abetting charges; (2) that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to exclude evidence from  A.L.'s cell phone; (3) that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for production of DCF records  that purportedly would show that A.L. had previously offered men sex in exchange for a place to stay; (4) that the  district court abused its discretion in admitting evidence that he had prostituted and assaulted another woman  named ""Faye""; (5) that the government improperly commented on his failure to take the stand in its closing  argument; and (6) that the district court erred in instructing the jury regarding the knowledge requirement of §  1591(a). We address these challenges seriatim. A. Defective Indictment The defendant alleges error from the outset, pointing first to the indictment, which he contends was defective  because it failed to provide facts to support the charges of aiding and abetting contained within each count. HN1[ ]  Because Gemma failed to timely object to the indictment, we review only for plain error. United States v. Laureano- Pérez, 797 F.3d 45, 60 (1st Cir. 2015). Thus, Gemma must show that ""(1) an error occurred; (2) which was clear or  obvious; and both (3) affected [his] substantial rights; and (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public  reputation of judicial proceedings."" Id. HN3[ ] ""[A]n indictment is sufficient if it, first, contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a  defendant of the charge against which he must defend, and, second, enables [**10]  him to plead an acquittal or  conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense."" United States v. Serino, 835 F.2d 924, 929 (1st Cir.  1987) (alteration in original) (quoting Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117, 94 S. Ct. 2887, 41 L. Ed. 2d 590  (1974)). The indictment should ""inform the court of the facts alleged"" and will generally be sufficient if it ""'set[s] forth  the offense in the words of the statute itself,' as long as those words set forth all the elements of the offense without  any uncertainty or ambiguity."" Id. (quoting Hamling, 418 U.S. at 117). Gemma points out that the indictment, and the court's recitation of the charges to the jury, included allegations of  aiding and abetting within each count. Gemma argues that the government's inclusion of the aiding and abetting  charges and failure to identify or allege the existence of a principal or codefendant rendered the indictment  defective and constitutes reversible error. United States v. Martin, 747 F.2d 1404, 1407 (11th Cir. 1984) (noting  that, because ""[t]he only person charged with committing [the] offense[s] is [the defendant],"" the indictment ""can be  read . . . as charging an offense not known to the law, i.e., [the defendant's] aiding and abetting himself""). Although        818 F.3d 23, *29; 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 5852, **7 Page 9 of 15   Gemma raises a potentially interesting question, we need not reach it because his contention stumbles from the  start.  [*31]  First, Gemma cannot show plain error. The courts of appeals have [**11]  divided over whether an indictment  that alleges aiding and abetting is defective if it does not identify a principal or codefendant. Compare United States  v. Somers, 950 F.2d 1279, 1283 (7th Cir. 1991) (finding an indictment charging aiding and abetting was not  required to name a principal or codefendant) and United States v. Mehrmanesh, 689 F.2d 822, 835 (9th Cir. 1982)  (finding aiding and abetting indictment not fatally defective where it failed to identify a principal), with United States  v. Garcia-Paulin, 627 F.3d 127, 133-34 (5th Cir. 2010) (finding indictment had insufficient factual basis where the  government identified no co-conspirators or principal whom the defendant aided and abetted) and Martin, 747 F.2d  at 1407-08 (finding indictment insufficient because no principal or codefendant was named and one cannot aid or  abet himself). Where this Court has not addressed an issue, and the law is unclear, the defendant cannot show  plain error. United States v. Diaz, 285 F.3d 92, 96 (1st Cir. 2002) (HN4[ ] ""If a circuit conflict exists on a question,  and the law is unsettled in the circuit in which the appeal was taken, any error cannot be plain or obvious.""). Second, even if this Court were to adopt Gemma's view of the law, his appeal would still fail. HN5[ ] As the  Eleventh Circuit has indicated, a denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment ""is not necessarily reversible error;  defects in an indictment can be harmless or can be cured by instructions to the [**12]  jury."" Martin, 747 F.2d at  1407. Here, the court omitted any instructions on aiding and abetting in its final charge and the verdict form did not  refer to aiding and abetting with respect to either count. Gemma, therefore, cannot show that his substantial rights  were affected or that any possible error seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial  proceedings. Because Gemma cannot show plain error, and any error would be harmless, his argument fails. B. Motion to Exclude/Suppress Before trial, Gemma moved to suppress the physical and testimonial evidence derived from the search of his  vehicle. The district court granted the motion in part, but declined to suppress evidence from A.L.'s cell phone. The  defendant later filed a motion to exclude evidence derived from A.L.'s cell phone, reiterating, inter alia, that the  evidence was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The court summarily denied this claim. Gemma contends that the district court erred because he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the vehicle,  A.L. lacked authority to consent to the seizure of her phone from the vehicle, and the phone should be suppressed  as ""fruits"" of Trooper Morris' initial, unlawful search. Although [**13]  the parties battle at length over the proper  standard of review, ""we would  [*32]  find no error in the district court's decision even if our review were de novo.""  United States v. Allen, 573 F.3d 42, 53 (1st Cir. 2009). The evidence supports the denial of Gemma's motion to suppress. United States v. Boskic, 545 F.3d 69, 77 (1st  Cir. 2008) (HN6[ ] ""If any reasonable view of the evidence supports the denial of a motion to suppress, we will  affirm the denial.""). A.L.'s phone was not seized during the initial search, which the court found unlawful. Instead, at  the time A.L.'s phone was retrieved so that she could call her mother, Morris found himself on the side of a major              818 F.3d 23, *30; 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 5852, **9 Page 10 of 15   interstate highway facing a now-unoccupied vehicle, an arrested driver, and an unidentified and seemingly  underage girl in a potentially unsafe situation. In these circumstances, the government is right to rely on the Fourth Amendment's general reasonableness  command. United States v. Rodriguez-Morales, 929 F.2d 780, 783 (1st Cir. 1991). The Supreme Court recognized  several decades ago that ""[l]ocal police officers, unlike federal officers, frequently . . . engage in what, for want of a  better term, may be described as community caretaking functions."" Cady v. Dombrowski, 413 U.S. 433, 441, 93 S.  Ct. 2523, 37 L. Ed. 2d 706 (1973). Apart from investigating crime, police are ""expected to aid those in distress,  combat actual hazards, prevent potential [**15]  hazards from materializing and provide an infinite variety of  services to preserve and protect public safety."" Rodriguez-Morales, 929 F.2d at 784-85. Here, Morris encountered the unfolding of ""unexpected circumstances present[ing] [a] transient hazard"" that he had  to ""deal[] with on the spot."" Id. at 787. Viewed objectively, Morris had ""solid, non investigatory reasons"" for retrieving  A.L.'s cell phone from the vehicle so that she could call her mother. Id. A.L. did not have identification, could not  make use of the defendant's vehicle, and was now effectively stranded. Gemma's and A.L.'s conflicting answers  suggested that A.L. might be in a potentially compromised position and require assistance ""separate and apart""  from an investigation into any crime. Id. at 784. Finally, A.L.'s hesitation with respect to her age and her response  that she lived with her mother all suggested that she was a minor who should be returned to the care of a confirmed  legal custodian, whoever and wherever that person may be. We will not find the officer's extempore actions  unreasonable in circumstances such as existed here. See id. at 786 (""There is no requirement that . . . officers must  select the least intrusive way of fulfilling their community caretaking responsibilities.""). Because [**16]  Morris retrieved the phone and witnessed the text messages suggestive of sex trafficking activity  in the course of his community caretaking duties, the evidence was properly admissible. Id. at 785 (HN7[ ]  ""[E]vidence which comes to light during the due execution of the caretaking function is ordinarily admissible at  trial.""). Although Morris' original search of the car may have been unlawful, Gemma introduced no evidence or  testimony suggesting that Morris' later retrieval of A.L.'s phone  [*33]  was a pretext for conducting an additional  search of the vehicle or of the phone itself. Id. at 787 (holding that, so long as an officer's actions are ""not a mere  subterfuge for investigation, the coexistence of investigatory and caretaking motives will not invalidate the [search  or] seizure""). On this record, Gemma's constitutional challenge, whether couched as a motion to suppress, to exclude, or to  reconsider, would fail any applicable standard of review. C. Production of Records Gemma next argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to compel the production of classified DCF  records. HN8[ ] The Court reviews the denial of a defendant's discovery motion for abuse of discretion. United  States v. Cartagena, 593 F.3d 104, 112 (1st Cir. 2010). Prior to trial, Gemma requested the production of records in the possession of DCF. A magistrate judge denied the  motion, finding that Gemma had failed to show that the requested records were relevant or to describe the  documents with any specificity. In addition, the magistrate judge noted that, to the extent the DCF records  contained information regarding prior instances of A.L. engaging in prostitution, such information might not be  admissible because Federal Rule of Evidence 412(a)(1) ""prohibits the admission of 'evidence offered to prove that a  victim engaged in other sexual behavior' in a case involving allegations of sexual misconduct."" Gemma thereafter filed a renewed motion for production in which he argued that the exclusion of evidence that A.L.  had previously engaged in prostitution before meeting him would violate his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to     818 F.3d 23, *32; 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 5852, **14 Page 11 of 15   confront her by cross-examination and to have a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense. After  reviewing a set of records submitted ex parte and under seal, the court [**18]  ordered the government to disclose  an email from a social worker that discussed an incident involving A.L. The email stated that another young woman  who had been on the run with A.L. told this social worker that A.L. had been wandering the streets offering to sleep  with men in exchange for a place to stay. At trial, A.L. denied these statements and testified that she did not  remember the names of the other two young women she was with at the time. The defendant then moved for  disclosure of records identifying these two young women. The court denied the motion, calling it ""speculative"" that  additional evidence would become available and noting that the defense already had an opportunity to cross- examine A.L. about the issue. HN9[ ] Under Federal Rule of Evidence 412(a), ""evidence offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual  behavior"" is generally prohibited in a ""criminal proceeding involving alleged sexual misconduct."" This rule ""aims to  safeguard the alleged victim against the invasion of privacy, potential embarrassment and sexual stereotyping that  is associated with public disclosure of intimate sexual details."" Fed. R. Evid. 412 advisory committee's note to 1994  amendment. Rule 412(b)(1)(C) provides an exception for ""evidence whose exclusion [**19]  would violate the  defendant's constitutional rights."" HN10[ ] ""The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the right of an  [*34]  accused in a criminal  prosecution to be confronted with the witnesses against him."" Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 315, 94 S. Ct. 1105,  39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974). Supreme Court ""cases construing the (confrontation) clause hold that a primary interest  secured by it is the right of cross-examination."" Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415, 418, 85 S. Ct. 1074, 13 L. Ed.  2d 934 (1965). Additionally, HN11[ ] the Fifth Amendment guarantees the right to a fair trial, and courts have ""long  interpreted this standard of fairness to require that criminal defendants be afforded a meaningful opportunity to  present a complete defense."" California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 485, 104 S. Ct. 2528, 81 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1984).  In order to protect this right, ""[a] defendant has a constitutionally protected privilege to request and obtain from the  prosecution evidence that is either material to the guilt of the defendant or relevant to the punishment to be  imposed."" Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963). ""Less clear . . . is the extent  to which the Due Process Clause imposes on the government the additional responsibility of guaranteeing criminal  defendants access to exculpatory evidence beyond the government's possession."" Trombetta, 467 U.S. at 486. On appeal, Gemma challenges the court's denial of his request for the production of additional evidence pertaining  to A.L.'s alleged prior prostitution. We can find no error. First, the evidence sought is either entirely [**20]   irrelevant or of such slight probative value in comparison to its prejudicial effect that a decision to exclude it would  not violate Gemma's constitutional rights. HN12[ ] A number of other circuits have held that evidence of prior  prostitution is irrelevant to a charge under § 1591(a), and thus is properly barred. See United States v. Rivera, 799  F.3d 180, 185 (2d Cir. 2015); United States v. Roy, 781 F.3d 416, 420 (8th Cir. 2015); United States v. Cephus, 684  F.3d 703, 708 (7th Cir. 2012); United States v. Valenzuela, 495 F. App'x 817, 819-20 (9th Cir. 2012) (unpublished). Gemma contends that he did not force A.L. into prostitution and that evidence of her prior sexual behavior would  shore up his cause. Not so. HN13[ ] ""The victim's participation in prostitution either before or after the time  period in the indictment has no relevance to whether [Gemma] beat her, threatened her, and took the money she  made from prostitution in order to cause her to engage in commercial sex."" Roy, 781 F.3d at 420. Nor is Gemma's contention significantly strengthened by shifting away from a coercion basis for criminal liability. HN14[ ] Because the victim[] [was a] minor[] and could not legally consent, the government did not need to  prove the elements of fraud, force, or coercion, which are required for adult victims. Instead, the government  was only required to prove [Gemma] knowingly recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, or obtained  a minor, knowing the minor would be caused [**21]  to engage in commercial sex acts. United States v. Elbert, 561 F.3d 771, 777 (8th Cir. 2009) (citations omitted). Moreover, even if we were to accept Gemma's contention that the evidence had some probative value with respect  to his relationship with A.L., the balance of probative and prejudicial effect is such that the court's decision could  818 F.3d 23, *33; 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 5852, **17 Page 12 of 15   hardly be said to have violated his constitutional rights. See id. In this case, there was no dispute that A.L. engaged  in prostitution; the only question was whether Gemma acted as her pimp. Rather than evincing Gemma's intent at  the time of the offense, introducing A.L.'s alleged acts of prior prostitution  [*35]  would have only strengthened  Gemma's hand by reinforcing a narrative that A.L. acted consistent with prior sexual behavior. This evidence and  line of reasoning falls squarely within a class deemed so extremely prejudicial as to warrant special treatment under  the Federal Rules of Evidence. Second, this is not a case wherein a discrete piece of identified evidence was deemed inadmissible by the district  court; rather, this is a case where the defendant's request for additional discovery was denied. As the district court  noted, this rendered the defendant's request more speculative than specific and weakened [**22]  an already  attenuated basis for his motion. Finally, the requested evidence was not only speculative and likely inadmissible, but bordered on cumulative. As  the court emphasized, the defense already had an opportunity to crossexamine A.L. about her alleged acts of prior  prostitution. This is arguably more than Gemma was entitled to in the first place. In sum, Gemma has a right to cross-examine the witnesses against him and a right to present a complete defense,  but these do not create an auxiliary right to have all discovery and evidentiary rulings turn in his favor. If Gemma  was deprived of anything, it was the opportunity to seek unspecified and presumably inadmissible evidence to  engage in additional cross examination on a topic of questionable relevance to begin with. D. Evidence Regarding Faye In what might be viewed as the inverse of the challenge above, Gemma also argues that the court erred in  admitting evidence that he [**23]  had previously prostituted and physically abused a woman named Faye. Gemma  points to HN15[ ] Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), which provides that ""[e]vidence of a crime, wrong, or other act  is not admissible to prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in  accordance with the character."" HN16[ ] This Court reviews a ruling that evidence was admitted consistent with Federal Rules of Evidence 404(b)  and 403 for abuse of discretion. United States v. Moon, 802 F.3d 135, 144 (1st Cir. 2015). ""Only rarely--and in  extraordinarily compelling circumstances--will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's  on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect."" United States v.  Bayard, 642 F.3d 59, 63 (1st Cir. 2011). HN17[ ] Under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), evidence of previous crimes or acts may be admitted for the  purpose of ""proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack  of accident."" In deciding whether to admit such evidence, ""[t]he court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative  value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues,  misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence."" Fed. R. Evid. 403. A critical factual dispute in this case was whether the relationship [**24]  between Gemma and A.L. was that of a  pimp and prostitute. Therefore, evidence that Gemma was in the prostitution business and exercised control  over prostitutes other than A.L., sometimes by means of physical violence, was highly probative of Gemma's  [*36]   intent. See United States v. Jarrett, 956 F.2d 864, 866-67 (8th Cir. 1992) (holding testimony by witnesses that  defendant approached them seeking to secure their services as prostitutes in his employ was admissible under  Rule 404(b) to show knowledge and intent); United States v. Love, 449 F. App'x 338, 339-40 (5th Cir. 2011)  (unpublished) (holding evidence that defendant prostituted another female a year prior to crime admissible because  defendant contested his intent to prostitute the victim).    818 F.3d 23, *34; 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 5852, **21 Page 13 of 15   At trial, the district court permitted A.L. to testify that she knew Faye, that Faye was a girl who used to prostitute for  Gemma, and that Gemma had an argument with Faye about prostitution and A.L. saw Gemma slap her. Unlike  A.L.'s alleged prior prostitution activities, which shed relatively little light on the disputed issue of Gemma's intent,  Gemma's prior acts as a pimp were highly probative of his intent in the instant case. Although Gemma contends that the introduction of this evidence carried an unacceptable risk that the jury would  find him guilty ""because he was a bad person [**25]  who deserved to be punished,"" we are hardly convinced that  the court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence given its probative value in answering the central question  of this case. To be sure, the similarity of ""other acts"" evidence ""simultaneously establishes its relevance and  heightens the possibility that the jury will draw an unfair inference of propensity."" United States v. Appolon, 715  F.3d 362, 374 (1st Cir. 2013). However, ""given the facts of this case and the notable similarity between the  uncharged conduct and the basis of [the defendant's] indictment,"" we find ""that the district court properly evaluated  the 'risk of an improper criminal propensity inference . . . in light of the totality of the circumstances.'"" Id. (second  alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Varoudakis, 233 F.3d 113, 123 (1st Cir. 2000)). E. Prosecutorial Misconduct Gemma's penultimate challenge is to certain statements by the government in its closing argument that he  contends constituted prosecutorial misconduct. During the government's closing, the prosecutor repeatedly pointed  to the defendant's admission of certain facts, emphasizing that these facts were undisputed. The defendant  objected, arguing that these references improperly shifted the burden to the defendant, and requested a curative  instruction. [**26]  The district court found that an instruction was unnecessary given that the jury would be  instructed on the government's burden of proof prior to deliberations. The defendant now argues that these remarks constituted improper comments on his failure to take the stand, in  violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. HN18[ ] Where a defendant contemporaneously objects on different  grounds than those raised on appeal, the Court reviews the issue as an unpreserved objection for plain error.  United States v. Bey, 188 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 1999). HN19[ ] The Fifth Amendment prohibits the government from commenting on a defendant's exercise of his right to  remain silent. United States v. Robinson, 485 U.S. 25, 30, 108 S. Ct. 864, 99 L. Ed. 2d 23 (1988); United States v.  Zarauskas, 814 F.3d 509, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 2305, 2016 WL 524250, at *4 (1st Cir. Feb. 10, 2016). References  to evidence as undisputed can constitute a violation when the defendant is the only person who could logically  dispute that evidence. Bey, 188 F.3d at 9. In deciding whether such comments violate the defendant's Fifth  Amendment rights, we consider ""whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, the language used was   [*37]  manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a  comment on the failure of the accused to testify."" United States v. Glantz, 810 F.2d 316, 322 (1st Cir. 1987)  (quoting United States v. Monaghan, 741 F.2d 1434, 1437, 239 U.S. App. D.C. 275 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (internal  quotation marks omitted)). Here, the government stated that certain facts in the case were not in dispute because Gemma had admitted to  them, particularly [**27]  with respect to Count 2 of the indictment. You've heard a lot of disputed facts about [A.L.] and her history and her time with the defendant. But before we  get into what is disputed I want to briefly go over with [you] what's not disputed. [A.L.] was prostituted both in  Massachusetts and in New Jersey. [A.L.] was 16 years old at the time. The defendant met [A.L.] through a girl,  M., who was 12 years old. Between September 27th and September 30th the defendant drove [A.L.] from  Massachusetts to New York and New Jersey, and back to Massachusetts for purposes of prostitution. These  facts are not in dispute because the defendant admitted to them. These facts are all you need to find the  defendant guilty of Count 2. . . . You have the rental car documents. You have the toll transponder documents. You have the documents that  show that this defendant rented a car on September 27th, and the documents that show that he drove from  Massachusetts to New York and New Jersey and back. And more importantly, you have his admission that he  818 F.3d 23, *36; 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 5852, **24 Page 14 of 15   drove [A.L.] and other girls to New York and New Jersey, and you have his admission that he knew [A.L.] and  girls were engaged in prostitution. And you know that [A.L.] [**28]  was 16 at the time. This is all you need to  convict him on Count 2. . . . There's also no dispute that the email account that posted these ads was the defendant's. He admitted them.  It's also not disputed that when she was posted in these ads, she was in hotel rooms rented by Michael  Gemma. You have before you all of the documents that you need to prove that the defendant was indeed  involved in prostituting [A.L.] (emphases added). Viewed in the context of the case, we can find no error, let alone plain error, in the court's decision to allow these  comments. The comments merely highlighted the defendant's own admissions, and the government tied the  evidence that it said was undisputed to admissions that Gemma made. No reasonable jury would have understood  these remarks as a comment on the defendant's failure to testify. Taken together, ""[t]he comment itself, the court's  response, and the defendant's failure to object or to move for a dismissal or new trial indicate that the prosecutor's  remark did not refer to the defendant's failure to testify."" United States v. Lavoie, 721 F.2d 407, 408 (1st Cir. 1984). Finally, any lingering trace of doubt would have been put to rest by the district court, which instructed the jury at the  end of the trial that [**29]  a defendant in a criminal case has a constitutional right not to testify, and that the jury  ""may not under any circumstances draw any inference or presumption against the defendant from his decision not  to testify."" See United States v. Smith, 145 F.3d 458, 462 (1st Cir. 1998) (HN20[ ] ""We 'must presume that jurors,  conscious of the gravity of their task, attend closely the particular language of the trial court's instructions in a  criminal case, and that they follow those instructions.'"" (quoting United States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1287 (1st  Cir. 1996))). For these reasons, Gemma's prosecutorial misconduct challenge fails.  [*38]  F. Instruction Regarding § 1591(a)'s Knowledge Requirement Lastly, Gemma floats an argument that there is ""uncertainty"" regarding the knowledge element of § 1591(a).  Because the defendant did not object to the jury instruction after the charge was given but before deliberations  began, we review for plain error. See United States v. Santana—Rosa, 132 F.3d 860, 863 n.1 (1st Cir. 1998); see  also Fed. R. Crim. P. 30(d). HN21[ ] The text of § 1591(a) proscribes two forms of sex trafficking: (1) sex trafficking involving a commercial  sex act induced by means of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion, or a combination thereof; and (2) child sex  trafficking in which the person induced to perform the commercial sex act is under the age of 18. 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a). The mens rea elements for the two forms of [**30]  sex trafficking are different. Under the first form, a  defendant must act knowingly, or in reckless disregard of the fact, that a commercial sex act was induced by  means of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion, or any combination thereof. Under the second form, a defendant  must act knowingly, or in reckless disregard of the fact, that the person induced to perform the commercial sex act  was not 18 years old. Id. With respect to this second form, Congress provided: HN22[ ] In a prosecution under subsection (a)(1) in which the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to  observe the person so recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, maintained, patronized, or  solicited, the Government need not prove that the defendant knew, or recklessly disregarded the fact, that the  person had not attained the age of 18 years. Id. § 1591(c). The government charged Gemma with violating both forms of § 1591(a), the court instructed the jury on both  theories of liability, and the court advised the jury that the government could prove the knowledge element under  the second theory by showing (1) that the defendant actually knew A.L. was under 18; (2) that he recklessly  disregarded facts that would have given him that knowledge; [**31]  or (3) that he had a reasonable opportunity to  observe A.L. in the course of events. 818 F.3d 23, *37; 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 5852, **27 Page 15 of 15   The defendant contends that this instruction was erroneous in light of our decision in United States v. Encarnación- Ruiz, 787 F.3d 581 (1st Cir. 2015). There, we examined whether an aider and abetter of the production of child  pornography under 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a), a strict liability crime for a principal, could be held liable without knowing  that the victim was a minor. We held that he could not. Id. at 591. Simply put, our holding in Encarnación-Ruiz has no import here. Not only are we examining an entirely separate  statute, § 1591(a), but Gemma was convicted as a principal, not an aider and abetter. Even more importantly,  Gemma was convicted under both theories of § 1591(a) liability, meaning that any error pertaining to his knowledge  of A.L.'s age would have been utterly harmless. Once again, the defendant's basis for appeal is distinctly  unpersuasive and falls far short of that necessary to survive the rigors of plain-error review.",1

Ct. 1955,  167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). In deciding a  Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court must accept  all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take  them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, Erickson v.  Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d  1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal conclusions without adequate  factual support are entitled to no assumption of truth,""  Mamani v. Berzaín, 654 F.3d 1148, 1153 (11th Cir.  2011) (citations omitted). Plaintiff's (second) amended complaint is brought  pursuant  to  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act (TVPRA). As previously stated, The TVPRA is a criminal statute that also provides  a civil remedy to victims of sex trafficking. Section  1591(a) of the Act imposes criminal liability for  certain sex trafficking: (a) Whoever knowingly-- Page 2 of 5 (1) in or affecting interstate or [*3]  foreign  commerce, or within the special maritime and  territorial jurisdiction of the United States, recruits,  entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains,  advertises, maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any  means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C.A. § 1591(a). In addition to a criminal  punishment, the TVPRA provides the following civil  remedy: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of [*4]  this chapter) in an appropriate  district court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Thus, the TVRPA authorizes a victim of sex  trafficking to bring a direct civil claim against the  perpetrator of the trafficking and a ""beneficiary"" civil  claim  against  ""whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of [the TVPRA]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). To  state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA, Plaintiff must plausibly allege that the  defendant ""(1) knowingly benefited (2) from  participating in a venture; (3) that venture violated  the TVPRA as to [A.D.]; and (4) [Defendants] knew  or should have known that the venture violated the  TVPRA as to [A.D.].""

The Court will consider each of the elements  as applied to the amended pleading. II. The operative amended complaint alleges the following:  Defendant Marriott International, Inc. (Marriott) knows  and has known for years that sex trafficking and  prostitution occur at their branded hotel locations.  Defendant CHM Naples II Hotel Partners LLC's (CHM  Naples) also knows and has known for [*5]  years of  both occurring specifically at the Fairfield Inn & Suites  Naples by Marriott (Fairfield) in Naples, Florida. (Doc.  #39, ¶¶ 2-3.) This action for damages is brought by the  Plaintiff, identified by her initials A.D., a survivor of sex  trafficking under the TVPRA. (Id. at ¶ 12.) A.D. was  trafficked for commercial sex at Fairfield by Trafficker 2  through force, fraud, and coercion. (Id. at ¶ 16.) ""With knowledge of the problem, and as a direct and  proximate result of Defendants' multiple failures and  refusals to act, mandate, establish, execute, and/or  modify their anti-trafficking efforts at the Fairfield hotel,  A.D. was continuously sex trafficked, sexually exploited,  and victimized repeatedly at the Fairfield hotel."" (Id. at ¶  18.) Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a  hotel operating venture and knowingly benefited from  this venture through room rentals, profits, third party  fees, and the value of the ""good will"" of the Marriott®  brand. The venture knew or should have known that  they were profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex  trafficking of A.D., in violation of the TVPRA."" (Id. at ¶  19.) Plaintiff further alleges that Marriott participated in a  hotel [*6]  operating venture that included staff at the  Fairfield. CHM Naples owns the Fairfield Inn & Suites  pursuant to a franchise agreement entered into with  Marriott. Plaintiff alleges an agency relationship through  Marriott's ""exercise of ongoing and systemic right of  control over Fairfield hotel."" (Id. at ¶¶ 29-32.) Marriott  makes decisions that directly impact the operations and  maintenance of their branded hotels, including the  Fairfield. (Id. at ¶ 39.) CHM Naples directly offered  public lodging services at the Fairfield where A.D. was  trafficked for sex. (Id. at ¶ 49.) Defendants ""participated  in a hotel operating venture in connection with the  management and operating of the Fairfield involving risk  and potential profit."" (Id. at ¶ 52.) During at least 2008 to 2012, emails were exchanged by  employees of Marriott that related to sex trafficking in  Page 3 of 5 hotels, including Fairfield. (Id. at ¶ 57.) Marriott had  actual and/or constructive knowledge of sex trafficking,  including A.D.'s sex trafficking and victimization,  occurring on its branded property. (Id. at ¶ 60.) Despite  having access to sex trafficking indicators, Marriott  continues to permit and profit from male clientele who  rented hotel [*7]  rooms to buy sex, including those who  bought Plaintiff. (Id. at ¶ 72.) CHM Naples employees and staff openly observed  signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. CHM Naples  received revenue and a percentage was provided to  Marriott. (Id. at ¶ 102.) Through Marriott's relationship  with the staff at the Fairfield, it benefited or received  royalty payments, licensing fees, franchise fees and  dues, reservation fees, and percentages of the gross  room revenue. (Id. at ¶ 103.) Through their ""continuous  business venture of renting hotel rooms"", CHM Naples  knowingly benefited. (Id. at ¶ 105.) Plaintiff alleges that  defendants benefit from the steady stream of income  that sex traffickers bring to their hotel brands and from  their reputation for privacy, discretion, and the  facilitation of commercial sex. (Id., ¶¶ 114-115.) III. As previously stated, plaintiff must sufficiently plead that  a defendant knowingly benefited from participating in a  venture, that the venture violated the TVPRA, and that  defendants knew or should have known that the venture  violated the TVPRA. A. Knowingly Benefited To satisfy the first element of a TVPRA beneficiary  claim, plaintiff must allege that defendant ""knew [*8]  it  was receiving some value from participating in the  alleged venture."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. As the  Eleventh Circuit stated, ""Knowingly benefits"" means ""an awareness or  understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of  mind in which a person has no substantial doubt  about the existence of a fact."" Knowledge, Black's  Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). And Section  1595(a) explains that a defendant may benefit  ""financially or by receiving anything of value.""  Accordingly, a plaintiff like the Does must allege  that the defendant knew it was receiving some  value from participating in the alleged venture. Id. at 723-24. In the absence of a more stringent  statutory pleading requirement, knowledge ""may be  alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Alleging a  ""continuous business relationship"" is sufficient to show a  knowing benefit. G.G. v. Salesforce.Com, Inc., No. 22- 2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015,  at *16 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023). The Court previously  found this element could be satisfied at this stage of the  proceedings. A.D. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 68592, [WL] at *3. B. Participation in Venture - Franchisor Plaintiff must allege that the benefits received by  Marriott were from ""participation in a venture"" which  defendants knew or should have known has engaged in  an act in violation of the TVPRA. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a).  The Eleventh Circuit rejected the statutory definition of  ""participation in a venture"" found in the criminal [*9]   provision, § 1591(e)(4), which defined ""participation in a  venture""  as  ""knowingly  assisting,  supporting  or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)."" Instead, the  Eleventh Circuit held that ""participation in a venture"" in  the civil context requires that plaintiff allege that the  franchisor ""took part in a common undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit."" Red Roof  Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture and knowingly benefited from this  venture through room rentals, profits, third party fees,  and the value of the ""good will"" of the Marriott® brand.  The venture knew or should have known that they were  profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking  of A.D., in violation of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #39, ¶ 19.)  Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture"" in connection with the Fairfield for  potential profit. (Id. at ¶ 52.) Plaintiff alleges that Marriott  ""had actual and/or constructive knowledge of sex  trafficking,  including  A.D.'s  sex  trafficking  and  victimization,"" at its branded property and it ""failed to  implement and enforce any of its own policy or policies  and protect Plaintiff A.D. from being sex trafficked""  and [*10]  failed to take action to prevent trafficking so  that it could continue to profit. (Id. at ¶ 60.) Plaintiff  alleges that Marriott knew or should have known that  the Fairfield hotel was an ""area known for high  incidence of crime and prone to sex trafficking activity  on and around the hotel premises."" (Id. at ¶ 60f.)  Marriott is alleged to have demonstrated actual and/or  constructive knowledge of the ""rampant culture of sex  trafficking"" at their properties around the country,  including through news stories and online reviews. (Id.  Page 4 of 5 at ¶ 75.) These additional facts in the Second Amended  Complaint do not remedy the problem in the original  pleading as to Marriott. ""[A]s the Eleventh Circuit has  acknowledged,  the  alleged  venture  can  be  a  'commercial venture' like running or expanding a  business. G.G. v. Salesforce.Com, Inc., No. 22-2621,  2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *6  (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023) (citing Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21  F.4th at 727 (emphasis added)). However, as before,  ""[t]he 'participation' in the sex trafficking venture is  essentially that the franchisor and the hotel operator did  not fight hard enough to keep these traffickers from  using their hotel. The Complaint acknowledges that  Defendants  opposed  sex  traffickers,  but  fault  defendants for taking ineffective steps to curtail the  traffickers. This hardly sounds [*11]  like participating in  a venture."" A.D. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 68592, [WL] at *4. The Court finds that Marriott must be dismissed  because the Second Amended Complaint does not  sufficiently plead that it participated in a sex trafficking  venture beyond participation in shared revenue as part  of its normal role as a franchisor. Red Roof Inns, Inc.,  21 F.4th at 726-27 (""These allegations may suggest that  the franchisors financially benefitted from renting hotel  rooms to the Does' sex traffickers. But they do nothing  to show that the franchisors participated in a common  undertaking involving risk or profit that violated the  TVPRA—i.e., the alleged sex trafficking ventures.""). C. Participation in Venture - Franchisee ""In order to plead Defendants participated in a venture,  Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court could  reasonably infer the hotels 'could be said to have a tacit  agreement' with the trafficker. Plaintiff need not show  that  defendants  had  actual  knowledge  of  the  participation in the sex-trafficking venture."" Doe v.  Rickey Patel, LLC, No. 0:20-60683-WPD-CIV, 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (S.D.  Fla. Sept. 30, 2020) (citation omitted). In other words,  plaintiff can show a ""continuous business relationship""  to show participation. J.G. v. Northbrook Indus., Inc.,  619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1235 (N.D. Ga. 2022); S.Y. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 519 F. Supp. 3d 1069,  1081 (M.D. Fla. 2021). Plaintiff alleges that ""Defendants"" knew or should have  known that A.D. was being trafficked based on red flags  such as A.D. checking [*12]  in and paying for one night  at a time. A.D. would approach the front desk in a  drugged state and would ask for an extension of another  night. (Doc. #39, ¶ 95.) Other red flags include  excessive requests for sheets, a personal relationship  between staff and the trafficker, and direct employee  encounters at the Fairfield. (Id.) These facts at least plausibly infer that employees of the  Fairfield were participating in an enterprise involving risk  and knowingly benefiting from the risk. Red Roof Inns,  Inc., 21 F.4th at 725 (citing Ricchio v. McLean, 853 F.3d  553, 556-58 (1st Cir. 2017) (agreeing with First Circuit  that an operator's association with traffickers to serve a  business objective establishes participation in a venture  with a sex trafficker). D. Knowledge This element requires the plaintiff to allege that the  defendant had either actual or constructive knowledge  that the venture violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff.  Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Knowledge requires an  awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance,  while constructive knowledge is knowledge that one  should have 'using reasonable care or diligence'. Id.  (citing Black's Law Dictionary). The 'red flags' supporting knowledge include payments  in cash, large amounts of used condoms and bodily  fluids on the sheets and towels, A.D.'s [*13]  physical  appearance, excessive requests for sheets and cleaning  services, the personal relationship with staff and A.D.'s  trafficker, and the direct employee encounters with A.D.  and her trafficker inside the Farfield. (Doc. #39, ¶ 95.)  CHM Naples employees and staff openly observed  signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. (Id. at ¶ 102.)  CHM Naples directly benefited financially from room  rentals for rooms in which plaintiff was trafficked. (Id. at  ¶ 110.) The Court finds these facts are sufficient to plausibly  allege knowledge at this stage of the proceedings. An  overt or direct act is not required. See, e.g., K.H. v. Riti,  Inc., No. 1:22-CV-3404-MHC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  93374, 2023 WL 3644224, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 17,  2023) (collecting cases of direct association between  hotel and trafficker); J.C. v. I Shri Khodiyar, LLC, 624 F.  Supp. 3d 1307, 1318 (N.D. Ga. 2022) (Plaintiff claims  that her daughter was forced to have sex with  Defendant's employees); J.G. v. Northbrook Indus., Inc.,  619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1239 (N.D. Ga. 2022)  (employees acted as lookouts for Plaintiff's traffickers). Page 5 of 5 Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED: 1. Defendant Marriott International, Inc.'s Motion to  Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint  (Doc. #41) is GRANTED and defendant is  dismissed with prejudice. 2. Defendant CHM Naples II Hotel Partners LLC's  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended  Complaint (Doc. #42) is DENIED. DONE and ORDERED at Fort Myers, Florida, [*14]  this  25th day of August 2023. /s/ John E. Steele JOHN E. STEELE SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE",1
"United States v. Bhula, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23247","MEMORANDUM [*2]  OPINION AND ORDER This matter is before the Court on Defendant Pragneshkumar Patel's Motion to Disqualify AUSA Letitia Simms and  Request for Evidentiary Hearing (Doc. 448) (""Motion""), which was joined by Defendant Kamal Bhula (Doc. 449) and  Defendant Johnathan Craft (Docs. 450 and 451). The Government responded in opposition (Doc. 452) and  Page 2 of 5   submitted exhibits in support of its response (Doc. 454). Defendant Craft replied (Doc. 457), as did Defendant Patel  (Doc. 459). The Government also responded to Defendant Craft's notice of joinder (Doc. 460). The Court heard  limited argument on the motion at a status conference on January 12, 2023 (Doc. 458). The Court held an  evidentiary hearing on the motion on January 25, 2023 (Doc. 469). After considering the motion, briefs, arguments,  and relevant law, the Court DENIES the motion as described herein. BACKGROUND According to the Superseding Indictment (Doc. 68), Defendants allegedly operated a sex and drug trafficking  enterprise at a Best Choice Inn in Albuquerque from September 2017 to June 2019 under the pretense of being  legitimate owners, managers, and employees. On January 10, 2023, Assistant United States Attorney Letitia Simms  sent a letter [*3]  to counsel for the four remaining codefendants in this matter pursuant to the United States' duties  under Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S. Ct. 763, 31 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1972). See Defendant's Exhibit A at 1  (""January 10, 2023 Letter""). As relevant here, the United States indicated the purpose of the letter was to notify  defense counsel of ""the following criminal histories and benefits offered or provided by the Government of  individuals the United States may be calling"" as witness against Defendants Craft and Patel. Id. The letter included  information regarding P.M., one of the Jane Does identified in the Superseding Indictment in this matter (Doc. 68).  The United States disclosed the following in relation to P.M.: . . . 5. She was not arrested on her outstanding warrants when contacted at her attorney's office on December 14,  2022. 6. The undersigned contacted the DA's office in Sandoval County and asked how she could resolve her  pending warrant 7. The undersigned contacted the DA's office in Bernalillo County and asked how she could resolve her  outstanding warrant. . . . . Def.'s Exhibit A. At the January 12, 2023 status conference, AUSA Simms provided additional information to the  Court about these events. See Transcript of January 12, 2023 Hearing (""January [*4]  12, 2023 Hr'g. Tr."") (Doc.  446). Based on this letter and AUSA Simms' statements in court on January 12, 2023, the defendants argued that Ms.  Simms is an ""essential and necessary witness under Brady and Giglio and must be subject to cross examination  under the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause."" Doc. 448 at 4. Defendants initially argued that AUSA Simms  ""by personally resolving P.M.'s state court warrants, has rendered herself the only witness to the benefit conferred  upon P.M. in exchange for her cooperation. There is no other available source of evidence such as a case agent or  any other law enforcement officers."" Doc. 448 at 5. Additionally, as a result of the advocate-witness rule, which  prohibits an attorney from appearing as both a witness and an advocate in the same litigation, Defendants argued  that AUSA Simms must recuse herself from prosecuting this matter. See id. at 6. Finally, Defendants argued that  because AUSA Simms must be a witness in this matter, the entire United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico  must be disqualified from prosecuting this matter. See id. at 7-8. After hearing witness testimony at the January 25, 2023 evidentiary hearing, Defendant Patel's counsel appeared to  concede that the there [*5]  was insufficient evidence to require recusal based AUSA Simms' contact with the  Bernalillo and Sandoval County District Attorney's office. See Transcript of January 25, 2023 Hearing (""January 25,  2023 Hr'g. Tr."") at 73:10-17. However, Defendant Patel maintains that AUSA Simms is a material witness on the      Page 3 of 5   limited subject of P.M. not being arrested on her outstanding warrants when contacted at her attorney's office on  December 14, 2022. Id. at 73:17-20. The United States opposes Defendants' Motion. The United States argues that the defendants have not shown that  AUSA Simms is a necessary witness, see Doc. 452 at 9, and that there is ""no basis in law to recuse the entire  United States Attorney's Office."" Id. at 12. On the first point, the United States argues that (1) AUSA Simms did not  personally resolve P.M.'s warrants, (2) even assuming the Government's contacts with state prosecutors conferred  a benefit to P.M., Defendants can inquire about this on cross-examination of P.M., (3) Defendants can call other  witnesses and/or use other sources of information, such as email communications, to elicit information about P.M.'s  warrants; and (4) Defendants can call DEA Special Agent Colin Stradling, [*6]  who was present at the December  14, 2022 meeting when P.M. was not arrested. See Doc. 452 at 9-10. In sum, the United States argues that  Defendants have failed to show that AUSA Simms' testimony is necessary. See id. at 11. LEGAL STANDARD The Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant ""compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.""  U.S. Const. amend. VI. A ""'defendant's right to due process and compulsory process includes the right to present  witnesses in his or her own defense.'"" United States v. Powell, 226 F.3d 1181, 1199 (10th Cir. 2000) (quoting  Richmond v. Embry, 122 F.3d 866, 871 (10th Cir.1997)). Additionally, the Sixth Amendment's confrontation clause  guarantees criminal defendants ""the right to effective cross-examination when attempting to show bias."" United  States v. Young, 952 F.2d 1252, 1258 (10th Cir. 1991). The term ""bias"" is used to describe the relationship between a party, which may be the prosecution, and a witness  which might lead the witness to slant, unconsciously or otherwise, his testimony in favor or against a party."" § 45:5.  Impeaching a witness for bias, 2 Federal Trial Handbook: Criminal § 45:5 (2022-2023 Edition). ""Proof of bias is  almost always relevant because the jury, as finder of fact and weigher of credibility, has historically been entitled to  assess all evidence which might bear on the accuracy and truth of a witness' testimony."" United States v. Abel, 469  U.S. 45, 52, 105 S. Ct. 465, 83 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1984). In addition to showing bias through cross-examination [*7]  of  the witness, extrinsic evidence of bias is also admissible. See id., 469 U.S. 45 (common law allowed extrinsic  evidence of bias and was not entirely displaced by the Federal Rules of Evidence). Nonetheless, restrictions on a  defendant's ability to present witnesses are permissible. See Powell, 226 F.3d at 1199. Similarly, ""the trial court  retains discretion to reasonably limit the scope of cross-examination."" United States v. Young, 952 F.2d 1252, 1258  (10th Cir. 1991) (citing Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986)). ""[A]n accused's right to call relevant witnesses and to present a complete defense may not be abrogated for the  sake of trial convenience or for the purpose of protecting a United States Attorney from possible embarrassment  while testifying, if he possesses information vital to the defense."" Gajewski v. United States, 321 F.2d 261, 268-69  (8th Cir. 1963). However, ""[i]t is well settled that the district court may decline to allow the defendant to call a  prosecutor as a witness 'if it does not appear the prosecutor possesses information vital to the defense.'"" United  States v. Wooten, 377 F.3d 1134,1142-43 (10th Cir. 2004) (quoting United States v. Troutman, 814 F.2d 1428,  1439 (10th Cir. 1987). A prosecutor does not possess information that is ""vital"" to the defense if the defendant can  obtain the evidence from another source. See Wooten 377 F.3d at 1143; Troutman 814 F.2d at 1440. Additionally,  ""a defendant has an obligation to exhaust other available sources of evidence before a court should sustain a  defendant's efforts [*8]  to call a participating prosecutor as a witness."" United States v. Prantil, 764 F.2d 548, 551  (9th Cir. 1985). ANALYSIS   Page 4 of 5   The primary issue before the Court is whether Defendants have shown that AUSA Simms possesses information  that is vital to the defense. The Court finds that Defendants have not met this burden because there are other  adequate substitutes for AUSA Simms' testimony. First, on the issue of AUSA Simms' communications with the district attorney's offices in Bernalillo and Sandoval  Counties about P.M.'s then-outstanding warrants, the Court finds these communications were merely informational  and not intended to confer a benefit to P.M. Therefore, AUSA Simms is not a necessary witness, and her testimony  would not be vital to the defense. Second, on the subject of P.M. not being arrested at the meeting on December 14, 2022, the Court finds that  Defendants can elicit evidence of this through the testimony of witnesses other than AUSA Simms. P.M. herself can  testify that she was not arrested at the December 14, 2022 meeting. Next, Drug Enforcement Administration  Special Agent Colin Stradling can testify on this subject. Defendants will be permitted elicit testimony from Special  Agent Stradling that he did not arrest P.M. on [*9]  her outstanding warrants at the December 14, 2022 meeting and  the reasons for that. Lastly, P.M.'s attorney, Ryan Villa, was present and available to testify at the evidentiary  hearing. See January 25, 2023 Hr'g. Tr. at 60:25-61:9. However, Defendants chose not to call him as a witness for  purposes of the instant motion. Id. While the Court does not believe Mr. Villa's testimony would be needed at trial,  because Defendants may call P.M. and Special Agent Stradling on the topic of her not being arrested at the  December 14, 2022 meeting, Mr. Villa's testimony could provide yet another adequate substitution for AUSA  Simm's testimony, and the Court would consider a request by Defendants to call Mr. Villa as a witness if it was  shown that his testimony would be necessary. In summary, Defendants have several alternative forms of evidence to elicit evidence of P.M.'s potential bias  without calling AUSA Simms as a witness. As a result, the Court finds Defendants have not shown AUSA Simms'  testimony would be vital to the defense. Because the Court will not permit Defendants to call AUSA Simms as a  witness in this matter, the Court need not address Defendants' remaining disqualification [*10]  arguments.",1

My true name is:     I am also known as:    . 2. My age is    . Date of Birth:    . 3. I have been informed and fully understand that I have  the right to a lawyer, and that if I cannot afford to pay for  a lawyer, the judge will provide me with one at no cost. I  understand that a lawyer can look at the social and legal  files in my case, talk to the [*3]  police, probation  counselor, and prosecuting attorney, tell me about the  law, help me understand my rights, and help me at trial. 4. I understand that I am charged with count 1     , the  elements of which are    ; Count 2    , the elements of  which are    . [ ] Count(s)     was(were) committed  against a family or household member. [ ] Count(s)      was(were) committed against an intimate partner. I have been given a copy of the charge(s). 5. I UNDERSTAND I HAVE THE FOLLOWING  IMPORTANT RIGHTS, AND I GIVE THEM ALL UP BY  PLEADING GUILTY: a. I have the right to a speedy and public trial in the  county where the offense(s) allegedly occurred. b. I have the right to remain silent before and during  trial and I need not testify against myself. c. I have the right to hear and question witnesses  who might testify against me. d. I have the right to testify and to have witnesses  testify for me. These witnesses may be required to  appear at no cost to me. e. I am presumed innocent unless the charge is  proven beyond a reasonable doubt or I enter a plea  of guilty. f. I have the right to appeal a finding of guilty after  trial. 6. I have been informed that, in order to determine an  appropriate sentence regarding [*4]  the charges to  which I plead guilty in this matter, the judge will take into  consideration my criminal history, which is as follows: a.     b.     c.     d.     e.     f.     7. The Standard Sentencing Range, which was  calculated using my criminal history as referenced in  Paragraph 6 above, is as follows: [ ] LOCAL SANCTIONS: Go to table1 I understand that if community supervision is  imposed, I will be required to comply with various  rules which could include school attendance,  curfew,  law  abiding  behavior,  associational  restrictions,  counseling,  treatment,  urinalysis,  and/or other conditions deemed appropriate by the  judge. Failure to comply with the conditions of  supervision could result in a violation being found  and further confinement imposed for the violation,  up to 30 days. [  ]  COMMITMENT  TO  DEPARTMENT  OF  CHILDREN, YOUTH, AND FAMILIES JUVENILE  REHABILITATION (DCYFJR): Go to table2 I understand that if I am committed to a DCYFJR  rehabilitation facility following my release, I may be  required to comply with a program of parole for a  Page 3 of 9 number of months. I understand that if placed on  parole, I will be under the supervision of a parole  officer. The conditions of parole will restrict my  actions and may require me to participate in  activities and programs including, but not limited to,  evaluation,  treatment,  education,  employment,  community  service,  electronic  monitoring,  or  urinalysis, and, if I am adjudicated of certain  offenses, a program applicable to juvenile firearm  offenders.

I understand that if any additional criminal history is  discovered, both the standard sentence range and  the prosecuting attorney's recommendation may  increase. Even so, my plea of guilty to this charge  is binding. 8. RIGHT TO APPEAL SENTENCE: I understand that  the judge must impose a sentence within the standard  range unless the judge finds by clear and convincing  evidence that the standard range sentence would  amount to a manifest injustice. If the judge goes outside  the standard range, either the state or I can appeal that  sentence. If the sentence is within the standard range,  no one can appeal the sentence. 9. MAXIMUM PUNISHMENT: I have been informed and  fully understand that the maximum punishment I can  receive is commitment until I am [ ] 21 years old [ ] 25  years old, but that I may be incarcerated for no longer  than the adult maximum sentence for this offense. 10.

[*7]  I  understand that if I am pleading guilty to 2 or more  offenses that arise out of the same course of conduct,  only the most serious offense will count as an offense in  my criminal history. I understand that my guilty plea will  remain part of my criminal history when I am an adult  and may affect my ability to remain in the Juvenile  Justice System should I re-offend. I understand that the  judge will consider my criminal history,  if I committed murder in the 1st or 2nd degree or a class  A sex offense, when sentencing me for any offense that  I commit in the future as an adult or juvenile, except  juvenile adjudications of guilt which are not murder in  the 1st or 2nd degree or a class A sex offense cannot  be included in my adult offender score later. 11. GROUNDS FOR DEPORTATION: If I am not a  citizen of the United States, a plea of guilty to an offense  punishable as a crime under state law may be grounds  for deportation, exclusion from admission to the United  States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of  the United States. 12.
