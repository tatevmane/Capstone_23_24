"A.B. v. Shilo Inn, Salem, LLC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143289","OPINION AND ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT  SUMMIT HOTEL TRS 085, LLC'S MOTION TO  DISMISS IMMERGUT, District Judge. Plaintiff A.B. (""Plaintiff"") filed a complaint against  Defendants Shilo Inn, Salem, LLC (d.b.a. Shilo Inn  Salem) and Summit Hotel TRS 085, LLC (d.b.a.  Residence  Inn  Portland  Airport)  (collectively,  ""Defendants"") in this Court on March 16, 2023. ECF 1.  Plaintiff alleges a violation of the Trafficking Victims  Protection Reauthorization Act (""TVPRA""), 18 U.S.C. §  1589 et seq., arising out of her being sex trafficked at a  two Oregon hotels. Id. at ¶¶ 127-131. On June 13, 2023,  Defendant Summit Hotel TRS 085, LLC (""Summit  Hotel"") filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint in  its entirety with [*2]  prejudice for failure to state a claim.  ECF 17 at 1. In the alternative, Defendant moves to  strike portions of Plaintiff's complaint or the complaint in  its entirety. Id. at 1-2. Plaintiff filed a Response in  Opposition on June 27, 2023, ECF 22, and Defendant  filed a Reply on July 11, 2023, ECF 25. On August 10,  2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority.  ECF 29. Before this Court is Defendant Summit Hotel's Motion to  Dismiss. ECF 17. For the following reasons, this Court  GRANTS Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's  complaint for failure state a claim. Accordingly, as  Plaintiff's sole claim against Defendant is dismissed, this  Court DENIES as moot Defendant's motion to strike.                      Page 2 of 6 LEGAL STANDARDS A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim may be  granted only when there is no cognizable legal theory to  support the claim or when the complaint lacks sufficient  factual allegations to state a facially plausible claim for  relief. Shroyer v. New Cingular Wireless Servs., Inc.,  622 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir. 2010). In evaluating the  sufficiency of a complaint's factual allegations, the court  must accept as true all well-pleaded material facts  alleged in the complaint and construe them in the light  most favorable [*3]  to the non-moving party. See  Daniels-Hall v. Nat'l Educ. Ass'n, 629 F.3d 992, 998 (9th  Cir. 2010). To be entitled to a presumption of truth,  allegations in a complaint ""may not simply recite the  elements of a cause of action, but must contain  sufficient allegations of underlying facts to give fair  notice and to enable the opposing party to defend itself  effectively."" Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1216 (9th Cir.  2011). The court must draw all reasonable inferences  from the factual allegations in favor of the plaintiff.  Newcal Indus., Inc. v. Ikon Office Sol., 513 F.3d 1038,  1043 n.2 (9th Cir. 2008). The court need not, however,  credit the plaintiff's legal conclusions that are couched  as factual allegations. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,  678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). A complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations to  ""plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief, such that it is  not unfair to require the opposing party to be subjected  to the expense of discovery and continued litigation.""  Starr, 652 F.3d at 1216. ""A claim has facial plausibility  when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the  court to draw the reasonable inference that the  defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged."" Iqbal,  556 U.S. at 678 (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550  U.S. 544, 556, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929  (2007)). ""The plausibility standard is not akin to a  probability requirement, but it asks for more than a  sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.""  Mashiri v. Epsten Grinnell & Howell, 845 F.3d 984, 988  (9th Cir. 2017) (quotation marks omitted) (quoting Iqbal,            556 U.S. at 678). BACKGROUND The following facts are taken from the complaint, [*4]   and are accepted as true, for purposes of this motion.  Plaintiff was 22 years old when she was first trafficked in  Oregon. ECF 1 at ¶ 5. Beginning in September 2012  through March 2013, Plaintiff alleges she was sold by  her trafficker for sex at the Shilo Inn Salem and  Residence  Inn  Portland  Airport  (""Residence  Inn  Portland""). Id. at ¶¶ 26, 28, 44. A. Plaintiff's Trafficking at the Residence Inn  Portland Defendant Summit Hotel owns and operates the  Residence Inn Portland. Id. at ¶ 15. While at the  Residence Inn Portland, Plaintiff was sold by her  trafficker to at least seven ""clients""—otherwise referred  to as ""buyers""—per night. Id. at ¶ 47. Plaintiff's trafficker  would book her at the Residence Inn Portland anywhere  from one to four nights at a time. Id. at ¶ 48. Plaintiff was  placed at the hotel up to two times in the same month,  for approximately six to twelve stays over four to five  months. Id. Plaintiff alleges that she was trafficked there  from February 28, 2013 through March 2, 2013; March  11, 2013 through March 12, 2013, and March 19, 2013  through March 21, 2013. Id. Plaintiff was trafficked to  ""clients"" through internet advertisements for commercial  sex posted on the following [*5]  dates: December 16,  2012; December 19, 2012; December 26, 2012;  February 5, 2013; February 7, 2013; February 19, 2013;  and February 25, 2013 through February 27, 2013. Id.  at ¶ 46. Plaintiff alleges that during the seven-month period  during which she was trafficked, there were ""obvious  signs"" of Plaintiff being sex trafficked at the Residence  Inn Portland. Id. at ¶ 61. These signs of sex trafficking  included  Plaintiff's  lack  of  eye  contact  and  malnourishment, the rental of a room with cash or debit  by a man for a woman who did not enter the hotel at the  same time, and constant foot traffic to and from  Plaintiff's room. Id. In addition, Plaintiff's room exhibited  signs of commercial sex work: used condoms in the  trash, bottles of lubricants, boxes of condoms, and  excessive requests for towels and linens. Id. at ¶¶ 61,  111. Plaintiff alleges that her trafficker always booked the  rooms directly from the front desk using a Residence  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143289, *2 Page 3 of 6 Inn Portland employee's discount card, although her  trafficker was not an employee and that data was  allegedly known to Defendant via the central reservation  system. Id. at ¶¶ 49, 51. After booking the room, her  trafficker would get two keys and take one key [*6]  to  Plaintiff, who would be waiting in the car. Id. at ¶ 49.  After waiting in the car while her trafficker checked in,  Plaintiff would walk to the hotel room by herself, without  ever having registered as a guest. Id. While Plaintiff was  with ""buyers,"" Plaintiff's trafficker used hotel wi-fi to post  advertisements, set up ""dates,"" and record Plaintiff's  sexual acts. Id. at ¶ 52. Plaintiff alleges that such  recordings would have signaled large amounts of data  usage identifiable to the hotel. Id. at ¶ 53. Plaintiff encountered the same hotel staff over the  course of the time she was trafficked on the property. Id.  at ¶ 60. Despite the alleged use of surveillance cameras  throughout the hotel, no help or attention was given to  Plaintiff by any hotel staff. Id. at ¶ 59. At an unspecified  time, Plaintiff and her trafficker were arrested on  property while registered guests. Id. at ¶ 58. B. Defendant's Alleged Knowledge of Sex  Trafficking In her complaint, Plaintiff highlights the intersection of  the sex trafficking and hotel industries, asserting that  hotels play a ""crucial role in the sex trade"" by offering  anonymity and non-traceability to those involved in sex  trafficking. Id. at ¶¶ 65, 67. [*7]  As a result, Plaintiff  alleges that, in addition to implementing anti-trafficking  policies, ""[t]raining hotel staff to identify the signs of sex  trafficking and sexual exploitation is a critical and  obvious legal obligation for Defendant[]."" Id. at ¶¶ 66,  123-24. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant, as a hotel  owner and operator, was ""cognizant of [its] role and  responisbilt[y] in the sex trafficking industry for years.""  Id. at ¶ 84. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant was apprised of  instances of sex trafficking at the Residence Inn  Portland. Id. at ¶ 91. Plaintiff references three online  reviews of the hotel ranging from 2017 to 2022, which  describe a gang shooting, lack of cleanliness, evidence  of drug use, theft, and general criminal activity. Id. at ¶  93. Plaintiff asserts that ""online reviews similar to those  outlined above provided Defendant with actual and/or  constructive knowledge of sex trafficking, commercial  sex, forced prostitution, and the foreseeable risk of sex  trafficking at the Residence Inn Portland."" Id. at ¶ 94. DISCUSSION A. Anonymity Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  10(a) This Court first addresses Plaintiff's request for  anonymity under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(a).  ECF 1 at ¶ 13. Due to Plaintiff's status as a victim [*8]   of sex trafficking and the ""sensitive nature"" of the  allegations in this case, Plaintiff seeks leave of this  Court to proceed under the pseudonym ""A.B."" Id. Under  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(a), a complaint must  ""name all the parties."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(a). ""In this  circuit, we allow parties to use pseudonyms in the  'unusual case' when nondisclosure of the party's identity  is necessary . . . to protect a person from harassment,  injury, ridicule or personal embarrassment."" Does I thru  XXIII v. Advanced Textile Corp., 214 F.3d 1058, 1067- 68 (9th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks and citation  omitted). ""[A] party may preserve his or her anonymity in  judicial proceedings in special circumstances when the  party's need for anonymity outweighs prejudice to the  opposing party and the public's interest in knowing the  party's identity."" Id. at 1068. The Ninth Circuit does not  require  a  plaintiff  to  obtain  leave  to  proceed  anonymously before filing an anonymous pleading. A.B.  v. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., 484 F. Supp. 3d 921,  945 (D. Or. 2020) (citation omitted). Because this Court  finds the need for anonymity outweighs any prejudice to  the Defendants and the public, this Court grants leave  for Plaintiff to proceed under the pseudonym ""A.B."" in  this case. B. TVPRA Claim Defendant Summit Hotel moves to dismiss Plaintiff's  complaint, arguing that Plaintiff has not stated a claim  for relief under the TVPRA [*9]  because Plaintiff has  failed to name the proper party and has not sufficiently  alleged the elements of a TVPRA claim. ECF 17 at 3-4.         2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143289, *5 Page 4 of 6 As an initial matter, this Court addresses Defendant's  argument that Plaintiff's claim fails because Plaintiff has  not named the proper party. Defendant contends that it  only leases the Residence Inn Portland, while an  unnamed operating company manages and operates  the Residence Inn Portland through a franchise  agreement. Id. at 3. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff has  failed to allege facts that Defendant, as a building  lessee and brand franchisee, is directly liable for  Plaintiff's alleged injuries under the TVPRA. Id. at 3-4.  However, Defendant has failed to provide any evidence  of its management structure in support of its motion.  Moreover, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Summit Hotel  is the ""hotel owner, operator, manager, and supervisor""  and that it ""controls all training, procedures, and policies  for the Residence Inn Portland."" ECF 1 at ¶ 15. For the  purposes of this motion, this Court accepts as true the  facts as alleged by Plaintiff in the complaint and  evaluates Defendant's motion on the merits accordingly.  See Daniels-Hall, 629 F.3d at 998. This Court next addresses [*10]  the merits of Plaintiff's  TVPRA claim. The TVPRA provides a private right of  civil action for victims of sex trafficking. Ditullio v.  Boehm, 662 F.3d 1091, 1094 (9th Cir. 2011). Section  1591 of the TVPRA defines sex trafficking as  commercial sex activity either involving a minor or  where ""force, threats of force, fraud, coercion . . . , or  any combination of such means [is] used to cause [a]  person to engage in a commercial sex act."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a). In outlining the private right of civil action for  victims, Section 1595 provides that victims: may bring a civil action against the perpetrator (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  or  attempts  or  conspires to benefit, financially or by receiving  anything of value from participation in a venture  which that person knew or should have known has  engaged in an act in violation of this chapter) in an  appropriate district court of the United States and  may recover damages and reasonable attorney  fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) (emphasis added). As such, the  statute affords a civil remedy both against individuals  who  directly  perpetrate  trafficking  and  against  individuals who financially benefit from participation in  the trafficking venture. Ditullio, 662 F.3d at 1094 n.1. As  a remedial statute, courts construe this statute liberally.  A.B. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 532 F. Supp.    3d 1018, 1024 (D. Or. 2021). Plaintiff brings a direct liability claim against Defendant  Summit Hotel [*11]  under a financial beneficiary theory.  To state a financial beneficiary claim under Section  1595(a), Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court  can reasonably infer that Defendant (1) knowingly  benefited financially (2) from ""participation in a venture""  (3) that Defendant ""knew or should have known""  engaged in sex trafficking as defined in 18 U.S.C. §  1591. J.C. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., No. 20-CV-00155- WHO, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL  6318707, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 28, 2020) (citation  omitted); see id. Defendant does not dispute the first  element,  that  Defendant  knowingly  benefited  financially. However, Defendant argues that Plaintiff  fails to plead facts sufficient to establish that Defendant  participated in a venture or knew or should have known  of its participation in a venture engaged in sex  trafficking. This Court addresses each argument in turn. 1. Participation in a Venture Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint,  arguing that Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently plead that  Defendant ""participated in a venture"" that was engaged  in sex trafficking. ""[T]he phrase 'participation in a  venture' requires [a plaintiff] to 'allege that the  [defendant] took part in a common undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit.'"" Doe #1 v.  Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 725 (11th Cir. 2021);  see also J.M. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., No.  222CV00672KJMJDP, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190054,  2022 WL 10626493, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 18, 2022). To  satisfy the ""participation"" element of a civil TVPRA  claim, Plaintiff [*12]  need not allege that Defendant had  actual knowledge of a venture engaged in trafficking by  ""force, threats of force, fraud, [or] coercion"" or that  Defendant performed an overt act in furtherance of the  venture. A.B., 532 F. Supp. 3d at 1025; see 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a); cf. Does 1-6 v. Reddit, Inc., 51 F.4th 1137,  1141 (9th Cir. 2022) (observing that TVPRA's criminal  standard is ""higher"" than the civil standard and requires          2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143289, *9 Page 5 of 6 actual knowledge). However, ""[i]n the absence of direct  association with traffickers, [Plaintiff] must 'allege at  least a showing of a continuous business relationship  between the trafficker and [Defendant] such that it would  appear that the trafficker and [Defendant] have  established a pattern of conduct or could be said to  have a tacit agreement.'"" Doe v. Mindgeek USA Inc.,  558 F. Supp. 3d 828, 837 (C.D. Cal. 2021) (citations  omitted). This Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to plausibly  establish Defendant's participation in a venture engaged  in sex trafficking. Plaintiff alleges that ""[t]here was a  continuous business relationship through the rental of  rooms between Plaintiff's traffickers, Defendants . . . . ,  and the hotels they operated and owned."" ECF 1 at ¶  117. In alleging this business relationship, Plaintiff  asserts  that  Defendant  knowingly  or  negligently  provided lodging to her trafficker, as well and lodging  and anonymity [*13]  to ""buyers."" Id. at ¶ 118. However,  Plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to establish a  tacit agreement between Defendant and Plaintiff's  trafficker, that the venture would involve commercial sex  activity by ""force, threats of force, fraud, [or] coercion,""  as required for relief under the TVPRA. See 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a). Plaintiff alleges that the ""the Residence Inn Portland  employees openly observed signs of [sex] trafficking  [and] did not aid Plaintiff."" ECF 1 at ¶ 92. For example,  Plaintiff plausibly alleges the following indicators of  commercial sex activity: bottles of lubricants, boxes of  condoms, used condoms in the trash, excessive request  for towels and linens, room rentals by Plaintiff's trafficker  with cash or debit, room rental by a man for a woman  who did not enter the hotel at the same time, and  consistent foot traffic to Plaintiff's room. Id. at ¶ 61.  Plaintiff claims that the Residence Inn Portland had  numerous surveillance cameras throughout the hotel  displaying ""unusual and suspicious"" behavior. Id. at ¶  59. Although Plaintiff encountered the same hotel staff  over the period in which she was trafficked, ""no help or  attention was given to [Plaintiff] by any hotel staff.""  Id. [*14]  at ¶¶ 59-60. In considering these allegations,  this Court notes that Plaintiff fails to allege facts to  establish that any particular Residence Inn employee  witnessed these signs or was otherwise aware of  Plaintiff's trafficking. Although Plaintiff plausibly alleges      indicia of commercial sex activity, when the victim is an  adult, Section 1591 only provides a remedy for  commercial sex activity involving ""force, threats of force,  fraud, [or] coercion."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Because  these allegations alone are not sufficient for this Court to  conclude that Defendant ever witnessed signs of  commercial sex activity by ""force, threats of force, fraud,  [or] coercion,"" as opposed to commercial sex activity  generally, these facts do not establish Defendant's  participation in a venture engaged in sex trafficking  under the TVPRA. Plaintiff also alleges that her trafficker would book  rooms at the hotel with a Residence Inn Portland  employee's discount card without being an employee,  which Plaintiff asserts was data known to Defendant  through the central reservation system. Id. at ¶¶ 49, 51.  While Plaintiff was with a ""buyer,"" Plaintiff's trafficker  would often use the hotel's wi-fi to record the sex acts  taking place inside the [*15]  room, which would have  signaled large amounts of data usage identifiable by the  hotel. Id. at ¶¶ 52-53. Plaintiff further alleges that  Defendant ""failed or refused to require any human  trafficking training despite knowing that trafficking was  occurring at [the Residence Inn Portland]."" Id. at ¶ 15.  Plaintiff seems to suggest by these allegations that  Defendant had an affirmative duty to monitor hotel  systems for indicators of trafficking or provide training to  employees. However, ""the TVPRA does not impose an  affirmative duty to police and prevent sex trafficking.""  A.B., 532 F. Supp. 3d at 1027. Accordingly, this Court  finds that these facts as pled also do not amount to  participation under the TVPRA. Accordingly, this Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to  allege  facts  sufficient  to  establish  Defendant's  participation in a venture engaged in sex trafficking by  force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion. 2. Actual or Constructive Knowledge Defendant Summit Hotel also moves to dismiss  Plaintiff's complaint by arguing that Plaintiff has failed to  sufficiently plead that Defendant ""knew or should have  known"" of its participation in a venture engaged in sex  trafficking. To establish the knowledge element of her  TVPRA [*16]  claim, Plaintiff need only assert facts  supporting Defendant's constructive knowledge of the  venture in which it allegedly participated, i.e., that    2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143289, *12 Page 6 of 6 Defendant ""rented rooms to people [it] knew or should  have known were engaging in sex trafficking."" B.J. v. G6  Hosp., LLC, No. 22-CV-03765-MMC, 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 88180, 2023 WL 3569979, at *5 (N.D. Cal. May  19, 2023) (citation omitted). In alleging Defendant's knowledge, Plaintiff likewise  relies on the indicators of Plaintiff's sex trafficking  outlined above—including the use of an employee  discount and signs of commercial sex activity in the  room—to argue that Defendant had personal knowledge  of Plaintiff's sex trafficking. Highlighting the intersection  of sex trafficking and the hotel industry writ large,  Plaintiff further asserts that Defendant has been  generally ""cognizant of [its] role and responsibilit[y] in  the sex trafficking industry for years."" ECF 1 at ¶ 84.  Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant has been aware of  sex trafficking occurring on-site at the Residence Inn  Portland. Id. at ¶ 91. Plaintiff points to a number of hotel  reviews of the property, which include allegations of a  gang shooting, drug use, and theft on-site. Id. at ¶ 93.  Plaintiff alleges that similar online reviews provided  Defendant with actual or constructive knowledge [*17]   of sex trafficking at the Residence Inn Portland. Id. at ¶  94. These allegations, even when viewed in the light most  favorable to Plaintiff, fall short of plausibly alleging  Defendant knew or should have known of its  participation in a venture engaged in sex trafficking.  Plaintiff has failed to allege that any hotel employees  witnessed the above-described indicators of Plaintiff's  trafficking or were otherwise on notice of commercial  sex activity by ""force, threats of force, fraud, [or]  coercion,"" as opposed to commercial sex activity  generally. See 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Absent such  allegations,  Plaintiff  fails  to  plausibly  establish  Defendant ""should have known"" of Plaintiff's trafficking.  Moreover,  general  knowledge  of  sex  trafficking  occurring at hotels across the United States is  insufficient on its own to establish knowledge under the  TVPRA. See A.B., 484 F. Supp. 3d at 938. Finally,  although Plaintiff highlights various allegations of  criminal activity in reviews of the Residence Inn  Portland, Plaintiff fails to cite to a single review which  includes a report of sex trafficking or a review posted  prior to the period of Plaintiff's trafficking. This Court  finds that Plaintiff has failed to plausibly allege  Defendant's actual [*18]  or constructive knowledge of  its participation in a venture engaged in sex trafficking. Plaintiff has not alleged facts sufficient to state a  financial  beneficiary  claim  under  the  TVPRA.  Accordingly, this Court GRANTS Defendants' motion to  dismiss Plaintiff's TVPRA claim against Defendant with  leave to amend.",1
"A.D. v. Best Western Int_l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150376","OPINION AND ORDER This matter comes before the Court on review of defendant Apex Hospitality LLLP's Motion to Dismiss Second  Amended Complaint, Motion for More Definite Statement, and Motion to Strike (Doc. #45) and Best Western  International, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint and Motion to Strike (Doc. #46) filed  on May 19, 2023. Plaintiff filed a Consolidated Response in Opposition (Doc. #53) on June 26, 2023. Both  defendants filed Replies. [*2]  (Docs. ##54, 55.) Plaintiff filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority (Doc. #55) on  August 8, 2023. I. On April 14, 2023, the Court granted in part defendants' motions to dismiss with leave to file an Amended  Complaint. A.D. v. Best W. Int'l, Inc., No. 2:22-CV-651-JES-NPM, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65972, 2023 WL 2955712  (M.D. Fla. Apr. 14, 2023). On May 5, 2023, plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (Doc. #44) and defendants  have now essentially renewed their motions to dismiss. Page 2 of 6 Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a Complaint must contain a ""short and plain statement of the claim  showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This obligation ""requires more than labels and  conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,  550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion  to dismiss, the Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most  favorable to plaintiff, Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal  conclusions without adequate factual support are entitled to no assumption of truth,"" Mamani v. Berzaín, 654 F.3d  1148, 1153 (11th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). Plaintiff's (second) amended complaint is brought pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act  (TVPRA). As previously stated, The TVPRA is a criminal statute that also provides a civil remedy to victims of sex trafficking. Section 1591(a)  of the Act imposes criminal liability [*3]  for certain sex trafficking: (a) Whoever knowingly-- (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the  United States, recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains, patronizes, or  solicits by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture which has engaged in  an act described in violation of paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting the violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless disregard  of the fact, that means of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion described in subsection (e)(2), or any  combination of such means will be used to cause the person to engage in a commercial sex act, or that the  person has not attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act, shall be  punished as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C.A. § 1591(a). In addition to a criminal punishment, the TVPRA provides the following civil remedy: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this chapter may bring a civil action against the perpetrator (or  whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a venture [*4]   which that person knew or should have known has engaged in an act in violation of this chapter) in an  appropriate district court of the United States and may recover damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Thus, the TVRPA authorizes a victim of sex trafficking to bring a direct civil claim against the perpetrator of the  trafficking and a ""beneficiary"" civil claim against ""whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving  anything of value from participation in a venture which that person knew or should have known has engaged in  an act in violation of [the TVPRA]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). To state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA, Plaintiff must plausibly allege that the defendant ""(1) knowingly benefited (2) from participating in a  venture; (3) that venture violated the TVPRA as to [A.D.]; and (4) [Defendants] knew or should have known that  the venture violated the TVPRA as to [A.D.]."" Doe v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 726 (11th Cir. 2021). A.D. v. Best W. Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65972, [WL] at *1-2. The Court will consider each of the elements  as applied to the amended pleading. II. The operative amended complaint alleges the following: Defendant Best Western knows and has known for years  that sex trafficking and prostitution occur at their branded hotel locations. Defendant Apex also knows and [*5]  has  known for years of both occurring specifically at the Best Western Fort Myers Inn and Suites (BW Ft. Myers Hotel).  (Doc. #44, ¶¶ 2-3.) This action for damages is brought by the Plaintiff, identified by her initials A.D., a survivor of  sex trafficking under the TVPRA. (Id. at ¶ 12.) 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150376, *2 Page 3 of 6 ""With knowledge of the problem, and as a direct and proximate result of Defendants' multiple failures and refusals  to act, mandate, establish, execute, and/or modify their anti-trafficking efforts at the BW Ft. Myers Hotel, A.D. was  continuously sex trafficked, sexually exploited, and victimized repeatedly at the BW Ft. Myers Hotel."" (Id. at ¶ 17.)  Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel operating venture and knowingly benefited from this venture  through room rentals, profits, third party fees, and the value of the ""good will"" of the Best Western® brand. The  venture knew or should have known that they were profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking of A.D.,  in violation of the TVPRA."" (Id. at ¶ 18.) Plaintiff further alleges that Best Western and Apex participated in a hotel operating venture that included staff at  the BW Ft. Myers Hotel. Apex owns the BW Ft. Myers [*6]  Hotel pursuant to a membership agreement entered into  with Best Western. Plaintiff alleges an agency relationship through Best Western's exercise of ongoing and  systemic right to control over BW Ft. Myers Hotel. (Id. at ¶¶ 29-32.) Best Western makes decisions that directly  impact the operations and maintenance of BW Ft. Myers Hotel. (Id. at ¶ 40.) Apex directly offered public lodging  services at the BW Ft. Myers Hotel where A.D. was trafficked for sex. (Id. at ¶ 56.) During at least 2010 to 2012, emails were exchanged by employees of Best Western that related to sex trafficking  in hotels, and Apex held meetings through trade organizations on the issue. (Id. at ¶¶ 64-65.) Best Western had  actual and/or constructive knowledge of sex trafficking, including A.D.'s sex trafficking and victimization, at BW Ft.  Myers Hotel and it failed to ""implement and enforce any of its own policy or policies and protect Plaintiff A.D. from  being sex trafficked"", and failed to take action to prevent trafficking. (Id. at ¶ 69.) ""Defendants and their employees and staff consistently rented rooms to A.D. and her traffickers despite obvious red  flags and indicators of sex trafficking and suspicious activity, [*7]  thereby participating in a venture that knew or  should have known violated the TVPRA."" (Id., ¶ 106.) No one at the corporate level used surveillance and security  to prevent the sex trafficking of A.D. from occurring at the BW Ft. Myers Hotel. (Id., ¶ 110.) Apex employees and staff openly observed signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. Apex received revenue and  a percentage was provided to Best Western. (Id., ¶ 118.) Through Best Western's relationship with the staff at the  BW Ft. Myers Hotel, it benefited or received royalty payments, licensing fees, membership fees and dues,  reservation fees, and percentages of the gross room revenue. (Id., ¶ 119.) Plaintiff alleges that defendants benefit  from the steady stream of income that sex traffickers bring to their hotel brands and from their reputation for privacy,  discretion, and the facilitation of commercial sex. (Id., ¶¶ 130-131.) Plaintiff alleges that defendants maintained their  deficiencies and knowingly benefited by maximizing profits by reducing the cost of training employees on how to  spot human trafficking. (Id., ¶ 133.) III. As previously stated, plaintiff must sufficiently plead that a defendant knowingly benefited from [*8]  participating in  a venture, that the venture violated the TVPRA, and that defendants knew or should have known that the venture  violated the TVPRA. A. Knowingly Benefited To satisfy the first element of a TVPRA beneficiary claim, plaintiff must allege that defendant ""knew it was receiving  some value from participating in the alleged venture."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. As the Eleventh Circuit  stated, ""Knowingly benefits"" means ""an awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of mind in which  a person has no substantial doubt about the existence of a fact."" Knowledge, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed.  2019). And Section 1595(a) explains that a defendant may benefit ""financially or by receiving anything of  value."" Accordingly, a plaintiff like the Does must allege that the defendant knew it was receiving some value  from participating in the alleged venture. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150376, *5 Page 4 of 6 Id. at 723-24. In the absence of a more stringent statutory pleading requirement, knowledge ""may be alleged  generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Alleging a ""continuous business relationship"" is sufficient to show a knowing  benefit. G.G. v. Salesforce.Com, Inc., No. 22-2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *16 (7th  Cir. Aug. 3, 2023). The Court previously found this element could be satisfied at this stage of the proceedings. A.D.  v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68586, [WL] at *6. B. Participation in Venture - Franchisor Plaintiff must allege that the [*9]  benefits received by Best Western were from ""participation in a venture"" which  defendants knew or should have known has engaged in an act in violation of the TVPRA. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). The  Eleventh Circuit rejected the statutory definition of ""participation in a venture"" found in the criminal provision, §  1591(e)(4), which defined ""participation in a venture"" as ""knowingly assisting, supporting or facilitating a violation of  subsection (a)(1)."" Instead, the Eleventh Circuit held that ""participation in a venture"" in the civil context requires that  plaintiff allege that the franchisor ""took part in a common undertaking or enterprise involving risk and potential  profit."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel operating venture and knowingly benefited from this venture  through room rentals, profits, third party fees, and the value of the ""good will"" of the Best Western® brand. The  venture knew or should have known that they were profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking of A.D.,  in violation of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #44, ¶ 18.) Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel operating  venture"" in connection with BW Ft. Myers Hotel for potential profit. (Id. at ¶ 59.) Plaintiff alleges [*10]  that Best  Western had actual and/or constructive knowledge of sex trafficking, including A.D.'s sex trafficking and  victimization, at BW Ft. Myers Hotel and it ""failed to implement and enforce any of its own policy or policies and  protect Plaintiff A.D. from being sex trafficked"", failed to take action to prevent trafficking so that it could continue to  profit, and failed to address the open and obvious presence of human trafficking on hotel properties. (Id. at ¶ 69.)  Best Western is alleged to have demonstrated actual and/or constructive knowledge of the ""rampant culture of sex  trafficking"" at their properties around the country, including through news stories and online reviews. (Id. at ¶¶ 71- 72.) These additional facts in the Second Amended Complaint do not remedy the problem in the original pleading as to  Best Western. ""[A]s the Eleventh Circuit has acknowledged, the alleged venture can be a 'commercial venture' like  running or expanding a business. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22-2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023  WL 4944015, at *6 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023) (citing Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 727 (emphasis added)). However,  as before, ""[t]he 'participation' in the sex trafficking venture is essentially that the franchisor and the hotel operator  did not fight hard enough to keep these traffickers from using their hotel. [*11]  The Complaint acknowledges that  Defendants opposed sex traffickers, but fault defendants for taking ineffective steps to curtail the traffickers. This  hardly sounds like participating in a venture."" A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68586, [WL] at  *7. The Court finds that Best Western must be dismissed because the Second Amended Complaint does not  sufficiently plead that it participated in a sex trafficking venture beyond participation in shared revenue as part of its  normal role as a franchisor. See A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., No. 2:22-CV-648-JES-NPM, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  68586, 2023 WL 3004547, at *4 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 19, 2023) (collecting cases). C. Participation in Venture - Franchisee ""In order to plead Defendants participated in a venture, Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court could  reasonably infer the hotels 'could be said to have a tacit agreement' with the trafficker. Plaintiff need not show that  defendants had actual knowledge of the participation in the sex-trafficking venture."" Doe v. Rickey Patel, LLC, No.  0:20-60683-WPD-CIV, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 30, 2020) (citation  omitted). In other words, plaintiff can show a ""continuous business relationship"" to show participation. J.G. v.  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150376, *8 Page 5 of 6 Northbrook Indus., Inc., 619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1235 (N.D. Ga. 2022); S. Y. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 519  F. Supp. 3d 1069, 1081 (M.D. Fla. 2021). As to Apex, the 'participation' is based upon the relationship between the traffickers and the hotel. The fact that  Trafficker 2 spent all day loitering around the parking lot without consequences and that a ""procession of men"" who  were not registered [*12]  guests were openly going into a room support participation in the venture. (Id. at ¶¶ 88,  90.) ""Defendants and their employees and staff consistently rented rooms to A.D. and her traffickers despite  obvious red flags and indicators of sex trafficking and suspicious activity, thereby participating in a venture that  knew or should have known violated the TVPRA."" (Id. at ¶ 106.) These facts at least plausibly infer that employees  of Apex were participating in an enterprise involving risk and knowingly benefiting from the risk. Red Roof Inns, Inc.,  21 F.4th at 725 (citing Ricchio v. McLean, 853 F.3d 553, 556-58 (1st Cir. 2017) (agreeing with First Circuit that an  operator's association with traffickers to serve a business objective establishes participation in a venture with a sex  trafficker). D. Knowledge This element requires the plaintiff to allege that the defendant had either actual or constructive knowledge that the  venture violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff. Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Knowledge requires an awareness or  understanding of a fact or circumstance, while constructive knowledge is knowledge that one should have 'using  reasonable care or diligence'. Id. (citing Black's Law Dictionary). The 'red flags' supporting knowledge include payments in cash, large amounts of used condoms and bodily [*13]   fluids on the sheets and towels, A.D.'s physical appearance, excessive requests for sheets and cleaning services,  the personal relationship between the front desk employees, manager, and A.D.'s traffickers, and the direct  employee encounters with A.D. and her traffickers inside BW Ft. Myers Hotel. (Doc. #44, ¶ 111.) Apex employees  and staff openly observed signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. Instead, Apex profited from the rooms rented  by her traffickers or at the direction of her traffickers. (Id. at ¶ 118.) Plaintiff alleges a continuous business venture.  (Id. at ¶ 121.) The facts supporting something other than simple observations are: (1) ""The personal relationship  between the front desk employees, manager, and A.D.'s traffickers;"" and (2) ""The direct employee encounters with  A.D. and her traffickers inside BW Ft. Myers Hotel."" (Id. at ¶ 111.) In terms of constructive knowledge, reviews  specific to BW Ft. Myers reflect comments about the absence of security, ""shady people hanging out in the parking  lot"", and ""at midnight there were woman screaming and ppl partying in the parking lot and the front desk didn't even  hear it. Ridiculous."" (Id. at ¶ 72.) The Court finds these [*14]  facts are sufficient to plausibly allege knowledge at this stage of the proceedings. An  overt or direct act is not required. See, e.g., K.H. v. Riti, Inc., No. 1:22-CV-3404-MHC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  93374, 2023 WL 3644224, at *4 (N.D. Ga.

Best Western International, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint and Motion to  Strike (Doc. #46) is GRANTED as to the motion to dismiss, otherwise denied as moot, and defendant is  dismissed with prejudice.

"A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int_l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150380","OPINION AND ORDER This matter comes before the Court on review of defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss  Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (Doc. #56) filed on June 1, 2023, and R & M Real Estate Company, Inc.,  Robert Vocisano, and Mario Vocisano's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (Doc. #57) filed  on June 7, 2023. Plaintiff filed a Consolidated Response in Opposition (Doc. #62) on July 3, 2023. Both defendants  filed Replies. (Docs. ## 65, 66.) Plaintiff [*2]  filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority (Doc. #67) on August 8, 2023. I. On April 19, 2023, the Court granted in part defendants' motions to dismiss with leave to file an Amended  Complaint. A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., No. 2:22-CV-646-JES-NPM, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68588, 2023 WL  3004545, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 19, 2023). On May 10, 2023, plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (Doc. #50)  and defendants have now essentially renewed their motions to dismiss. Page 2 of 6 Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a Complaint must contain a ""short and plain statement of the claim  showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This obligation ""requires more than labels and  conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,  550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion  to dismiss, the Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take them in the light most  favorable to plaintiff, Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal  conclusions without adequate factual support are entitled to no assumption of truth,"" Mamani v. Berzaín, 654 F.3d  1148, 1153 (11th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). Plaintiff's (second) amended complaint is brought pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act  (TVPRA). As previously stated, The TVPRA is a criminal statute that also provides a civil remedy to victims of sex trafficking. Section 1591(a)  of the Act imposes criminal liability for certain sex trafficking: [*3]  (a) Whoever knowingly-- (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the  United States, recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains, patronizes, or  solicits by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture which has engaged in  an act described in violation of paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting the violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless disregard  of the fact, that means of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion described in subsection (e)(2), or any  combination of such means will be used to cause the person to engage in a commercial sex act, or that the  person has not attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act, shall be  punished as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C.A. § 1591(a). In addition to a criminal punishment, the TVPRA provides the following civil remedy: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this chapter may bring a civil action against the perpetrator (or  whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a venture which  that person knew or [*4]  should have known has engaged in an act in violation of this chapter) in an  appropriate district court of the United States and may recover damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Thus, the TVRPA authorizes a victim of sex trafficking to bring a direct civil claim against the perpetrator of the  trafficking and a ""beneficiary"" civil claim against ""whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving  anything of value from participation in a venture which that person knew or should have known has engaged in  an act in violation of [the TVPRA]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). To state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA, Plaintiff must plausibly allege that the defendant ""(1) knowingly benefited (2) from participating in a  venture; (3) that venture violated the TVPRA as to [A.D.]; and (4) [Defendants] knew or should have known that  the venture violated the TVPRA as to [A.D.].""

The Court will consider each of the  elements as applied to the amended pleading. II. The operative amended complaint alleges the following: Defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc. (Choice Hotels)  knows and has known for years that sex trafficking and prostitution occur at their branded hotel locations.  Defendants R&M Real [*5]  Estate Company, Inc., Robert Vocisano, and Mario Vocisano (R&M Real Estate  collectively) also know and have known for years of both occurring specifically at the Comfort Inn & Executive  Suites Naples (Comfort Inn). (Doc. #50, ¶¶ 2-3.) This action for damages is brought by the Plaintiff, identified by her  initials A.D., a survivor of sex trafficking under the TVPRA. (Id. at ¶ 12.) 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150380, *2 Page 3 of 6 ""With knowledge of the problem, and as a direct and proximate result of Defendants' multiple failures and refusals  to act, mandate, establish, execute, and/or modify their anti-trafficking efforts at the Comfort Inn hotel, A.D. was  continuously sex trafficked, sexually exploited, and victimized repeatedly at the Comfort Inn hotel."" (Id. at ¶ 18.)  Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel operating venture and knowingly benefited from this venture  through room rentals, profits, third party fees, and the value of the ""good will"" of the Choice® brand. The venture  knew or should have known that they were profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking of A.D., in  violation of the TVPRA."" (Id. at ¶ 19.) Plaintiff further alleges that Choice Hotels and R&M Real Estate participated in [*6]  a hotel operating venture that  included staff at the Comfort Inn. R&M Real Estate owns the Comfort Inn pursuant to a franchise agreement  entered into with Choice Hotels. Plaintiff alleges an agency relationship through Choice Hotels' ""exercise of ongoing  and systemic right of control over the Comfort Inn hotel."" (Id. at ¶¶ 29-32.) Choice Hotels makes decisions that  directly impact the operations and maintenance of their branded hotels, including the Comfort Inn. (Id. at ¶ 39.)  R&M Real Estate directly offered public lodging services at the Comfort Inn where A.D. was trafficked for sex. (Id. at  ¶ 49.) Defendants ""participated in a hotel operating venture in connection with the management and operating of  the Comfort Inn hotel involving risk and potential profit."" (Id. at ¶ 52.) During at least 2008 to 2012, emails were exchanged by employees of Choice Hotels that related to sex trafficking  in hotels, including the Comfort Inn. (Id. at ¶ 57.) Choice Hotels had actual and/or constructive knowledge of sex  trafficking, including A.D.'s sex trafficking and victimization, occurring on its branded property. (Id. at ¶ 63.) Choice  Hotels continued to permit and profit from male clientele who [*7]  rented hotel rooms to buy sex despite having  access to sex trafficking indicators. (Id. at ¶ 75.) In 2017, a reviewer described the Comfort Inn as having prostitutes  hanging out in the parking lot at night. (Id. at ¶ 79e.) In 2020, another reviewed the Comfort Inn noting that it was  known for drugs and prostitution and that the owner knows it means money ""coming into his degenerate  establishments."" (Id. at ¶ 79j.) Choice Hotels monitors customer reviews. (Id. at ¶ 81.) R&M Real Estate employees and staff openly observed signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. R&M Real  Estate received revenue and a percentage was provided to Choice Hotels. (Id. at ¶ 108.) Through Choice Hotels'  relationship with the staff at the Comfort Inn, it benefited or received royalty payments, licensing fees, membership  fees and dues, reservation fees, and percentages of the gross room revenue. (Id. at ¶ 109.) Through their  ""continuous business venture of renting hotel rooms"", R&M Real Estate knowingly benefited. (Id. at ¶ 111.) Plaintiff  alleges that defendants benefit from the steady stream of income that sex traffickers bring to their hotel brands and  from their reputation for privacy, discretion, and [*8]  the facilitation of commercial sex. (Id., ¶¶ 120-121.) III. As previously stated, plaintiff must sufficiently plead that a defendant knowingly benefited from participating in a  venture, that the venture violated the TVPRA, and that defendants knew or should have known that the venture  violated the TVPRA. A. Knowingly Benefited To satisfy the first element of a TVPRA beneficiary claim, plaintiff must allege that defendant ""knew it was receiving  some value from participating in the alleged venture."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. As the Eleventh Circuit  stated, ""Knowingly benefits"" means ""an awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of mind in which  a person has no substantial doubt about the existence of a fact."" Knowledge, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed.  2019). And Section 1595(a) explains that a defendant may benefit ""financially or by receiving anything of  value."" Accordingly, a plaintiff like the Does must allege that the defendant knew it was receiving some value  from participating in the alleged venture. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150380, *5 Page 4 of 6 Id. at 723-24. In the absence of a more stringent statutory pleading requirement, knowledge ""may be alleged  generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Alleging a ""continuous business relationship"" is sufficient to show a knowing  benefit. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22-2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *16 (7th  Cir. Aug. 3, 2023). The Court [*9]  previously found this element could be satisfied at this stage of the proceedings.  A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68588, [WL] at *3. B. Participation in Venture - Franchisor Plaintiff must allege that the benefits received by Choice Hotels were from ""participation in a venture"" which  defendants knew or should have known has engaged in an act in violation of the TVPRA. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). The  Eleventh Circuit rejected the statutory definition of ""participation in a venture"" found in the criminal provision, §  1591(e)(4), which defined ""participation in a venture"" as ""knowingly assisting, supporting or facilitating a violation of  subsection (a)(1)."" Instead, the Eleventh Circuit held that ""participation in a venture"" in the civil context requires that  plaintiff allege that the franchisor ""took part in a common undertaking or enterprise involving risk and potential  profit."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel operating venture and knowingly benefited from this venture  through room rentals, profits, third party fees, and the value of the ""good will"" of the Choice® brand. The venture  knew or should have known that they were profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking of A.D., in  violation of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #50, ¶ 19.) Plaintiff alleges that [*10]  defendants ""participated in a hotel operating  venture"" in connection with the Comfort Inn for potential profit. (Id. at ¶ 52.) Plaintiff alleges that Choice Hotels ""had  actual and/or constructive knowledge of sex trafficking, including A.D.'s sex trafficking and victimization,"" at its  branded property and it ""failed to implement and enforce any of its own policy or policies and protect Plaintiff A.D.  from being sex trafficked"", failed to take action to prevent trafficking so that it could continue to profit, and failed to  address the open and obvious presence of human trafficking on hotel properties. (Id. at ¶ 63.) Choice Hotels is  alleged to have demonstrated actual and/or constructive knowledge of the ""rampant culture of sex trafficking"" at  their properties around the country, including through news stories and online reviews. (Id. at ¶ 78.) These additional facts in the Second Amended Complaint do not remedy the problem in the original pleading as to  Choice Hotels. ""[A]s the Eleventh Circuit has acknowledged, the alleged venture can be a 'commercial venture' like  running or expanding a business. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22-2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023  WL 4944015, at *6 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023) (citing Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 727 (emphasis added)). However,  as before, ""[t]he 'participation' in the sex trafficking [*11]  venture is essentially that the franchisor and the hotel  operator did not fight hard enough to keep these traffickers from using their hotel. The Complaint acknowledges that  Defendants opposed sex traffickers, but fault defendants for taking ineffective steps to curtail the traffickers. This  hardly sounds like participating in a venture."" A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68588, [WL] at  *4. The Court finds that Choice Hotels must be dismissed because the Second Amended Complaint does not  sufficiently plead that it participated in a sex trafficking venture beyond participation in shared revenue as part of its  normal role as a franchisor. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 726-27 (""These allegations may suggest that the  franchisors financially benefitted from renting hotel rooms to the Does' sex traffickers. But they do nothing to show  that the franchisors participated in a common undertaking involving risk or profit that violated the TVPRA—i.e., the  alleged sex trafficking ventures.""). C. Participation in Venture - Franchisee ""In order to plead Defendants participated in a venture, Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court could  reasonably infer the hotels 'could be said to have a tacit agreement' with the trafficker. Plaintiff need not show that  defendants had actual [*12]  knowledge of the participation in the sex-trafficking venture."" Doe v. Rickey Patel, LLC,  No. 0:20-60683-WPD-CIV, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 30, 2020)  (citation omitted). In other words, plaintiff can show a ""continuous business relationship"" to show participation. J.G.  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150380, *8 Page 5 of 6 v. Northbrook Indus., Inc., 619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1235 (N.D. Ga. 2022); S.Y. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.,  519 F. Supp. 3d 1069, 1081 (M.D. Fla. 2021). As to R&M Real Estate, the 'participation' is based upon the relationship between the traffickers and the hotel.  ""Trafficker 2 created relationships with several employees at the Comfort Inn. Trafficker 2 utilized his relationships  with Comfort Inn employees, asking them to serve as lookouts and notify Trafficker 2 if police came to the hotel.""  (Doc. #50, ¶ 98.) Defendants knew or should have known that A.D. was being trafficked because A.D. and  Trafficker 2 were once arrested at the hotel, and hotel staff gave A.D. her cash deposit back in an envelope with her  name on it when she was released later that day. Trafficker 2 had a relationship with housekeeping staff to act as a  lookout and no the day of the arrest the housekeeping staff members alerted A.D. and Trafficker 2. Despite the  arrest, they were able to return to the hotel. Other red flags include excessive requests for sheets, a personal  relationship between staff and the trafficker, and direct employee encounters. (Id. at ¶ 101.) These facts at [*13]  least plausibly infer that employees of the Comfort Inn were participating in an enterprise  involving risk and knowingly benefiting from the risk. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 725 (citing Ricchio v. McLean,  853 F.3d 553, 556-58 (1st Cir. 2017) (agreeing with First Circuit that an operator's association with traffickers to  serve a business objective establishes participation in a venture with a sex trafficker). D. Knowledge This element requires the plaintiff to allege that the defendant had either actual or constructive knowledge that the  venture violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff. Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Knowledge requires an awareness or  understanding of a fact or circumstance, while constructive knowledge is knowledge that one should have 'using  reasonable care or diligence'. Id. (citing Black's Law Dictionary). The 'red flags' supporting knowledge include payments in cash, large amounts of used condoms and bodily fluids  on the sheets and towels, A.D.'s physical appearance, excessive requests for sheets and cleaning services, the  personal relationship with staff and A.D.'s trafficker, and the direct employee encounters with A.D. and her trafficker  inside the Comfort Inn. (Doc. #50, ¶ 101.) R&M Real Estate employees and staff openly observed signs of  trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. [*14]  The Court finds these facts are sufficient to plausibly allege knowledge at this stage of the proceedings. An overt or  direct act is not required, although direct acts were involved by employees in this case. See, e.g., K.H. v. Riti, Inc.,  No. 1:22-CV-3404-MHC, 2023 U.S. Dist.

Plaintiff filed  a Consolidated Response in Opposition (Doc. #56) on  July 3, 2023. Both defendants filed Replies. (Docs. ##  60, 61.) Plaintiff filed a Notice [*2]  of Supplemental  Authority (Doc. #62) on August 8, 2023. I. On April 19, 2023, the Court granted in part defendants'  motions to dismiss with leave to file an Amended  Complaint. A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., No. 2:22-CV- 648-JES-NPM, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68586, 2023 WL  3004547, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 19, 2023). On May 9,  2023, plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (Doc.  #46) and defendants have now essentially renewed  their motions to dismiss. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a  Complaint must contain a ""short and plain statement of  the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.""  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This obligation ""requires more  than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation  of the elements of a cause of action will not do."" Bell Atl.  Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955,  167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). In deciding a  Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court must accept  all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take  them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, Erickson v.  Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d  1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal conclusions without adequate  factual support are entitled to no assumption of truth,""  Mamani v. Berzaín, 654 F.3d 1148, 1153 (11th Cir.  2011) (citations omitted). Page 2 of 5 Plaintiff's (second) amended complaint is brought  pursuant  to  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act (TVPRA). As previously stated, The TVPRA is a criminal statute that also provides  a civil remedy to victims of sex trafficking. Section  1591(a) of the Act imposes criminal liability for  certain sex trafficking: (a) Whoever [*3]  knowingly-- (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or  within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction  of the United States, recruits, entices, harbors,  transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains,  patronizes, or solicits by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C.A. § 1591(a). In addition to a criminal  punishment, the TVPRA provides the following civil  remedy: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have [*4]  known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Thus, the TVRPA authorizes a victim of sex  trafficking to bring a direct civil claim against the  perpetrator of the trafficking and a ""beneficiary"" civil  claim  against  ""whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of [the TVPRA]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). To  state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA, Plaintiff must plausibly allege that the  defendant ""(1) knowingly benefited (2) from  participating in a venture; (3) that venture violated  the TVPRA as to [A.D.]; and (4) [Defendants] knew or should have known that  the venture violated the TVPRA as to [A.D.]."" Doe  v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 726 (11th Cir.  2021). A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  68586, [WL] at *2. The Court will consider each of the  elements as applied to the amended pleading. II. The operative amended complaint alleges the following:  Defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc. (Choice  Hotels) knows and has known for years that sex  trafficking and prostitution occur at their branded hotel  locations. Defendant Tampa Bay Hotels, LLC [*5]   (Tampa Bay) also knows and has known for years of  both occurring specifically at the Comfort Suites at  Fairgrounds Casino (Comfort Suites) located in Tampa,  Florida. (Doc. #46, ¶¶ 2-3.) This action for damages is  brought by the Plaintiff, identified by her initials A.D., a  survivor of sex trafficking under the TVPRA. (Id. at ¶  12.) ""With knowledge of the problem, and as a direct and  proximate result of Defendants' multiple failures and  refusals to act, mandate, establish, execute, and/or  modify their anti-trafficking efforts at the Comfort Suites  hotel, A.D. was continuously sex trafficked, sexually  exploited, and victimized repeatedly at the Comfort  Suites hotel."" (Id. at ¶ 18.) Plaintiff alleges that  defendants ""participated in a hotel operating venture  and knowingly benefited from this venture through room  rentals, profits, third party fees, and the value of the  ""good will"" of the Choice® brand. The venture knew or  should have known that they were profiting from sex  trafficking, including the sex trafficking of A.D., in  violation of the TVPRA."" (Id. at ¶ 19.) Plaintiff further alleges that Choice Hotels and Tampa  Bay participated in a hotel operating venture that  included staff at [*6]  the Comfort Suites. Tampa Bay  owns the Comfort Suites pursuant to a franchise  agreement entered into with Choice Hotels. Plaintiff  alleges an agency relationship through Choice Hotels'  ""exercise of ongoing and systemic right of control over  the Comfort Suites hotel."" (Id. at ¶¶ 29-32.) Choice  Hotels makes decisions that directly impact the  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150391, *2 Page 3 of 5 operations and maintenance of their branded hotels,  including the Comfort Suites. (Id. at ¶ 39.) Tampa Bay  directly offered public lodging services at the Comfort  Suites where A.D. was trafficked for sex. (Id. at ¶ 49.)  Defendants ""participated in a hotel operating venture in  connection with the management and operating of the  Comfort Suites hotel involving risk and potential profit.""  (Id. at ¶ 52.) During at least 2008 to 2012, emails were exchanged by  employees of Choice Hotels that related to sex  trafficking in hotels, including the Comfort Suites. (Id. at  ¶ 57.) Choice Hotels had actual and/or constructive  knowledge of sex trafficking, including A.D.'s sex  trafficking and victimization, occurring on its branded  property. (Id. at ¶ 63.) Choice Hotels continued to permit  and profit from male clientele who rented hotel rooms to  buy sex despite having [*7]  access to sex trafficking  indicators. (Id. at ¶ 75.) Defendants ""had actual or  constructive knowledge of law enforcement activity at  the Comfort Suites hotel reporting sexual battery, drug  dealing and other illicit activities occurring at the hotel.""  (Id. at ¶ 87.) Tampa Bay employees and staff openly observed signs  of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. Tampa Bay  received revenue and a percentage was provided to  Choice Hotels. (Id. at ¶ 104.) Through Choice Hotels'  relationship with the staff at the Comfort Suites, it  benefited or received royalty payments, licensing fees,  membership fees and dues, reservation fees, and  percentages of the gross room revenue. (Id. at ¶ 105.)  Through their ""continuous business venture of renting  hotel rooms"", Tampa Bay knowingly benefited. (Id. at ¶  107.) Plaintiff alleges that defendants benefit from the  steady stream of income that sex traffickers bring to  their hotel brands and from their reputation for privacy,  discretion, and the facilitation of commercial sex. (Id., ¶¶  116-117.) III. As previously stated, plaintiff must sufficiently plead that  a defendant knowingly benefited from participating in a  venture, that the venture violated the TVPRA, [*8]  and  that defendants knew or should have known that the  venture violated the TVPRA. A. Knowingly Benefited To satisfy the first element of a TVPRA beneficiary  claim, plaintiff must allege that defendant ""knew it was  receiving some value from participating in the alleged  venture."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. As the  Eleventh Circuit stated, ""Knowingly benefits"" means ""an awareness or  understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of  mind in which a person has no substantial doubt  about the existence of a fact."" Knowledge, Black's  Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). And Section  1595(a) explains that a defendant may benefit  ""financially or by receiving anything of value.""  Accordingly, a plaintiff like the Does must allege  that the defendant knew it was receiving some  value from participating in the alleged venture. Id. at 723-24. In the absence of a more stringent  statutory pleading requirement, knowledge ""may be  alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Alleging a  ""continuous business relationship"" is sufficient to show a  knowing benefit. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22- 2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015,  at *16 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023). The Court previously  found this element could be satisfied at this stage of the  proceedings. A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 68586, [WL] at *3. B. Participation in Venture - Franchisor Plaintiff must allege that the benefits received by Choice  Hotels were from ""participation in [*9]  a venture"" which  defendants knew or should have known has engaged in  an act in violation of the TVPRA. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a).  The Eleventh Circuit rejected the statutory definition of  ""participation in a venture"" found in the criminal  provision, § 1591(e)(4), which defined ""participation in a  venture""  as  ""knowingly  assisting,  supporting  or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)."" Instead, the  Eleventh Circuit held that ""participation in a venture"" in  the civil context requires that plaintiff allege that the  franchisor ""took part in a common undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit."" Red Roof  Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture and knowingly benefited from this  venture through room rentals, profits, third party fees,  and the value of the ""good will"" of the Choice® brand.  The venture knew or should have known that they were  profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking  of A.D., in violation of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #46, ¶ 19.)  Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture"" in connection with the Comfort Suites  for potential profit. (Id. at ¶ 52.) Plaintiff alleges that  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150391, *6 Page 4 of 5 Choice  Hotels  ""had  actual  and/or  constructive  knowledge of sex [*10]  trafficking, including A.D.'s sex  trafficking and victimization,"" at its branded property and  it ""failed to implement and enforce any of its own policy  or policies and protect Plaintiff A.D. from being sex  trafficked"", failed to take action to prevent trafficking so  that it could continue to profit, and failed to address the  open and obvious presence of human trafficking on  hotel properties. (Id. at ¶ 63.) Choice Hotels is alleged to  have  demonstrated  actual  and/or  constructive  knowledge of the ""rampant culture of sex trafficking"" at  their properties around the country, including through  news stories and online reviews. (Id. at ¶ 78.) These additional facts in the Second Amended  Complaint do not remedy the problem in the original  pleading as to Choice Hotels. ""[A]s the Eleventh Circuit  has acknowledged, the alleged venture can be a  'commercial venture' like running or expanding a  business. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22-2621,  2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *6  (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023) (citing Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21  F.4th at 727 (emphasis added)). However, as before,  ""[t]he 'participation' in the sex trafficking venture is  essentially that the franchisor and the hotel operator did  not fight hard enough to keep these traffickers from  using their hotel. The Complaint acknowledges that  Defendants opposed sex traffickers, [*11]  but fault  defendants for taking ineffective steps to curtail the  traffickers. This hardly sounds like participating in a  venture."" A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 68586, [WL] at *4. The Court finds that Choice Hotels must be dismissed  because the Second Amended Complaint does not  sufficiently plead that it participated in a sex trafficking  venture beyond participation in shared revenue as part  of its normal role as a franchisor. Red Roof Inns, Inc.,  21 F.4th at 726-27 (""These allegations may suggest that  the franchisors financially benefitted from renting hotel  rooms to the Does' sex traffickers. But they do nothing  to show that the franchisors participated in a common  undertaking involving risk or profit that violated the  TVPRA—i.e., the alleged sex trafficking ventures.""). C. Participation in Venture - Franchisee ""In order to plead Defendants participated in a venture,  Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court could  reasonably infer the hotels 'could be said to have a tacit  agreement' with the trafficker. Plaintiff need not show  that  defendants  had  actual  knowledge  of  the  participation in the sex-trafficking venture."" Doe v.  Rickey Patel, LLC, No. 0:20-60683-WPD-CIV, 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (S.D.  Fla. Sept. 30, 2020) (citation omitted). In other words,  plaintiff can show a ""continuous business relationship""  to show participation. J.G. v. Northbrook Indus., Inc.,  619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1235 (N.D. Ga. 2022); S.Y. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 519 F. Supp. 3d 1069,  1081 (M.D. Fla. 2021). As to Tampa Bay, the 'participation' [*12]  is based upon  the relationship between the traffickers and the hotel.  Trafficker 2 routinely instructed A.D. to rent multiple  rooms in her name using cash with one room facing the  parking lot to monitor when buyers would arrive. There  would be ""a parade of unregistered male guests coming  in and out of the hotel room at all times of day."" (Doc.  #46, ¶¶ 95-96.) ""The rooms were rented by night and  the next morning A.D. in her disheveled, drug induced  state, would go to the front desk and extend the stay.""  (Id. at ¶ 97a.) Other red flags include excessive  requests for sheets, a personal relationship between  staff and the trafficker, and direct employee encounters.  (Id. at ¶ 97j-l.) These facts at least plausibly infer that employees of the  Comfort Suites were participating in an enterprise  involving risk and knowingly benefiting from the risk.  Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 725 (citing Ricchio v.  McLean, 853 F.3d 553, 556-58 (1st Cir. 2017) (agreeing  with First Circuit that an operator's association with  traffickers to serve a business objective establishes  participation in a venture with a sex trafficker). D. Knowledge This element requires the plaintiff to allege that the  defendant had either actual or constructive knowledge  that the venture violated the TVPRA as to the  plaintiff. [*13]  Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725.  Knowledge requires an awareness or understanding of  a fact or circumstance, while constructive knowledge is  knowledge that one should have 'using reasonable care  or diligence'. Id. (citing Black's Law Dictionary). The 'red flags' supporting knowledge include payments  in cash, large amounts of used condoms and bodily  fluids on the sheets and towels, A.D.'s physical  appearance, excessive requests for sheets and cleaning  services, the personal relationship with staff and A.D.'s  trafficker, and the direct employee encounters with A.D.  and her trafficker inside the Comfort Suites. (Doc. #46, ¶  99.) Tampa Bay employees and staff openly observed  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150391, *9 Page 5 of 5 signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. (Id. at ¶ 104.) The Court finds these facts are sufficient to plausibly  allege knowledge at this stage of the proceedings. An  overt or direct act is not required. See, e.g., K.H. v. Riti,  Inc., No. 1:22-CV-3404-MHC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  93374, 2023 WL 3644224, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 17,  2023) (collecting cases of direct association between  hotel and trafficker); J.C. v.

Plaintiff's (second) amended complaint is brought  pursuant  to  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act (TVPRA). As previously stated, Page 2 of 5 The TVPRA is a criminal statute that also provides  a civil remedy to victims of sex trafficking. Section  1591(a) of the Act imposes criminal liability for  certain sex trafficking: (a) Whoever knowingly-- (1)  in  or  affecting  interstate  or  foreign  commerce, [*3]  or within the special maritime and  territorial jurisdiction of the United States, recruits,  entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains,  advertises, maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any  means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C.A. § 1591(a). In addition to a criminal  punishment, the TVPRA provides the following civil  remedy: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in [*4]  an appropriate  district court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a).

(Id. at ¶ 52.) During at least 2008 to 2012, emails were exchanged by  employees of Choice Hotels that related to sex  trafficking in hotels, including the Quality Inn. (Id. at ¶  57.) Choice Hotels had actual and/or constructive  knowledge of sex trafficking, including A.D.'s sex  trafficking and victimization, occurring on its branded  property. (Id. at ¶ 63.) Choice Hotels continued to permit  and profit from male clientele who rented hotel rooms to  buy sex despite having access to sex trafficking [*7]   indicators. (Id. at ¶ 75.) In 2018, a reviewer described  the Quality Inn as being in a seedy part of Naples, ""[d]id  not feel safe."" (Id. at ¶ 79k.) Choice Hotels monitors  customer reviews. (Id. at ¶ 81.) Defendants had ""actual  or, at a minimum, constructive knowledge that the rental  of rooms was for the purpose of sex trafficking A.D., in  violation of the TVPRA."" (Id. at ¶ 105.) R&M Real Estate staff openly observed signs of  trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. R&M Real Estate  received revenue and a percentage was provided to  Choice Hotels. (Id. at ¶ 106.) Through Choice Hotels'  relationship with the staff at the Quality Inn, it benefited  or  received  royalty  payments,  licensing  fees,  membership fees and dues, reservation fees, and  percentages of the gross room revenue. (Id. at ¶ 107.)  Through their ""continuous business venture of renting  hotel rooms"", R&M Real Estate knowingly benefited. (Id.  at ¶ 109.) Plaintiff alleges that defendants benefit from  the steady stream of income that sex traffickers bring to  their hotel brands and from their reputation for privacy,  discretion, and the facilitation of commercial sex. (Id., ¶¶  118-119.) III. As previously stated, plaintiff must sufficiently [*8]  plead  that a defendant knowingly benefited from participating  in a venture, that the venture violated the TVPRA, and  that defendants knew or should have known that the  venture violated the TVPRA. A. Knowingly Benefited To satisfy the first element of a TVPRA beneficiary  claim, plaintiff must allege that defendant ""knew it was  receiving some value from participating in the alleged  venture."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. As the  Eleventh Circuit stated, ""Knowingly benefits"" means ""an awareness or  understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of  mind in which a person has no substantial doubt  about the existence of a fact."" Knowledge, Black's  Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). And Section  1595(a) explains that a defendant may benefit  ""financially or by receiving anything of value.""  Accordingly, a plaintiff like the Does must allege  that the defendant knew it was receiving some  value from participating in the alleged venture. Id. at 723-24. In the absence of a more stringent  statutory pleading requirement, knowledge ""may be  alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Alleging a  ""continuous business relationship"" is sufficient to show a  knowing benefit. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22- 2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015,  at *16 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023). The Court previously  found this element could be satisfied at this stage of the  proceedings. A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 67832, [WL] at *3. B. Participation in [*9]  Venture - Franchisor Plaintiff must allege that the benefits received by Choice  Hotels were from ""participation in a venture"" which  defendants knew or should have known has engaged in  an act in violation of the TVPRA. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a).  The Eleventh Circuit rejected the statutory definition of  ""participation in a venture"" found in the criminal  provision, § 1591(e)(4), which defined ""participation in a  venture""  as  ""knowingly  assisting,  supporting  or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)."" Instead, the  Eleventh Circuit held that ""participation in a venture"" in  the civil context requires that plaintiff allege that the  franchisor ""took part in a common undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit."" Red Roof  Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture and knowingly benefited from this  venture through room rentals, profits, third party fees,  and the value of the ""good will"" of the Choice® brand.  The venture knew or should have known that they were  profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking  of A.D., in violation of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #47, ¶ 19.)  Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture"" in connection with the Quality Inn for  potential [*10]  profit. (Id. at ¶ 52.) Plaintiff alleges that  Choice  Hotels  ""had  actual  and/or  constructive  knowledge of sex trafficking, including A.D.'s sex  trafficking and victimization,"" at its branded property and  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150397, *6 Page 4 of 5 it ""failed to implement and enforce any of its own policy  or policies and protect Plaintiff A.D. from being sex  trafficked"", failed to take action to prevent trafficking so  that it could continue to profit, and failed to address the  open and obvious presence of human trafficking on  hotel properties. (Id. at ¶ 63.) Choice Hotels is alleged to  have  demonstrated  actual  and/or  constructive  knowledge of the ""rampant culture of sex trafficking"" at  their properties around the country, including through  news stories and online reviews. (Id. at ¶ 78.) These additional facts in the Second Amended  Complaint do not remedy the problem in the original  pleading as to Choice Hotels. ""[A]s the Eleventh Circuit  has acknowledged, the alleged venture can be a  'commercial venture' like running or expanding a  business. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22-2621,  2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *6  (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023) (citing Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21  F.4th at 727 (emphasis added)). However, as before,  ""[t]he 'participation' in the sex trafficking venture is  essentially that the franchisor and the hotel operator did  not fight hard enough to [*11]  keep these traffickers  from using their hotel. The Complaint acknowledges that  Defendants  opposed  sex  traffickers,  but  fault  defendants for taking ineffective steps to curtail the  traffickers. This hardly sounds like participating in a  venture."" A.D. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 67832, [WL] at *5. The Court finds that Choice Hotels must be dismissed  because the Second Amended Complaint does not  sufficiently plead that it participated in a sex trafficking  venture beyond participation in shared revenue as part  of its normal role as a franchisor. Red Roof Inns, Inc.,  21 F.4th at 726-27 (""These allegations may suggest that  the franchisors financially benefitted from renting hotel  rooms to the Does' sex traffickers. But they do nothing  to show that the franchisors participated in a common  undertaking involving risk or profit that violated the  TVPRA—i.e., the alleged sex trafficking ventures.""). C. Participation in Venture - Franchisee ""In order to plead Defendants participated in a venture,  Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court could  reasonably infer the hotels 'could be said to have a tacit  agreement' with the trafficker. Plaintiff need not show  that  defendants  had  actual  knowledge  of  the  participation in the sex-trafficking venture."" Doe v.  Rickey Patel, LLC, No. 0:20-60683-WPD-CIV, 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (S.D.  Fla. Sept. 30, 2020) (citation omitted). In other  words, [*12]  plaintiff can show a ""continuous business  relationship"" to show participation. J.G. v. Northbrook  Indus., Inc., 619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1235 (N.D. Ga.  2022); S.Y. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 519 F.  Supp. 3d 1069, 1081 (M.D. Fla. 2021). As to R&M Real Estate, the 'participation' is based upon  the personal relationship between staff and the  traffickers, and direct employee encounters with A.D.  and Trafficker 21 inside the Quality Inn. (Doc. #47, ¶¶  99, 107.) Trafficker 2 kept A.D. confined to her room  and the procession of men was open and obvious to  anyone working at the Quality Inn. (Id. at ¶ 97.)  Trafficker 2 gave the housekeeper $100 to keep quiet  about seeing a gun, $10,000 in cash, and drugs while  cleaning the room. (Id. at ¶ 99.) ""Through the R&M  Defendants and Choice's continuous business venture  of renting hotel rooms, which were used for trafficking  A.D. at the Quality Inn hotel, the R&M Defendants  knowingly benefited or received something of value from  activity that its facilitation of or participation in a venture  which it knew or should have known had violated the  TVPRA through the rental of rooms where A.D. was  trafficked."" (Id. at ¶ 109.) These facts at least plausibly infer that employees of the  Quality Inn were participating in an enterprise involving  risk and knowingly benefiting from the risk. Red Roof  Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 725 (citing Ricchio v. McLean, 853  F.3d 553, 556-58 (1st Cir. 2017) (agreeing with [*13]   First Circuit that an operator's association with  traffickers to serve a business objective establishes  participation in a venture with a sex trafficker). D. Knowledge This element requires the plaintiff to allege that the  defendant had either actual or constructive knowledge  that the venture violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff.  Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Knowledge requires an  awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance,  while constructive knowledge is knowledge that one  should have 'using reasonable care or diligence'. Id.  (citing Black's Law Dictionary). The 'red flags' supporting knowledge include payments  in cash, large amounts of used condoms and bodily  fluids on the sheets and towels, A.D.'s physical  appearance, excessive requests for sheets and cleaning  services, the personal relationship with staff and A.D.'s  trafficker, and the direct employee encounters with A.D.  and her trafficker inside the Quality Inn. (Doc. #47, ¶  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150397, *10 Page 5 of 5 99.) R&M Real Estate employees and staff openly  observed signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. (Id.  at ¶ 106.) The Court finds these facts are sufficient to plausibly  allege knowledge at this stage of the proceedings. An  overt or direct act is not required. See, e.g., [*14]  K.H.  v. Riti, Inc., No. 1:22-CV-3404-MHC, 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 93374, 2023 WL 3644224, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Apr.  17, 2023) (collecting cases of direct association  between hotel and trafficker); J.C. v. I Shri Khodiyar,  LLC, 624 F. Supp. 3d 1307, 1318 (N.D. Ga. 2022)  (Plaintiff claims that her daughter was forced to have  sex with Defendant's employees); J.G. v. Northbrook  Indus., Inc., 619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1239 (N.D. Ga.  2022) (employees acted as lookouts for Plaintiff's  traffickers). Accordingly, it is now ORDERED: 1. Defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc.'s  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended  Complaint (Doc. #53) is GRANTED and defendant  is dismissed with prejudice. 2. Defendant R & M Real Estate Company, Inc.,  Robert Vocisano, and Mario Vocisano's Motion to  Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint  (Doc. #54) is DENIED.

"A.D. v. Holistic Health Healing Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32258","OPINION AND ORDER This matter comes before the Court on review of  defendant's Amended Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's  Complaint or Motion to Strike (Doc. #15) filed on  December 8, 2022. Plaintiff filed a Response in  Opposition (Doc. #19) on December 31, 2022. I. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a  Complaint must contain a ""short and plain statement of  the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.""  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This obligation ""requires more  than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation  of the elements of a cause of action will not do."" Bell Atl.  Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955,  167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). To survive  dismissal, the factual allegations must be ""plausible""  and ""must be enough to raise a right to relief above the  speculative level."" Id. at 555. See also Edwards v. Prime  Inc., 602 F.3d 1276, 1291 (11th Cir. 2010). This requires  ""more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully- harmed-me accusation."" [*2]  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.  662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009)  (citations omitted). In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court  must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true  and take them in the light most favorable to plaintiff,  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167  L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal conclusions without  adequate factual support are entitled to no assumption  of truth,"" Mamani v. Berzaín, 654 F.3d 1148, 1153 (11th  Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). ""Threadbare recitals of the  elements of a cause of action, supported by mere  conclusory statements, do not suffice."" Iqbal, 556 U.S.  at 678. ""Factual allegations that are merely consistent  with a defendant's liability fall short of being facially  plausible."" Chaparro v. Carnival Corp., 693 F.3d 1333,  1337 (11th Cir. 2012) (citations omitted). Thus, the  Court engages in a two-step approach: ""When there are  well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume  their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly  give rise to an entitlement to relief."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at  679. II. Plaintiff filed the Complaint as a survivor of sex  trafficking pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) against Holistic Health  Healing, Inc. (Holistic) doing business as the Conty's  Motel. Plaintiff alleges that Holistic was involved with  staffing and operation of Conty's location in Naples,  Florida, and Holistic knowingly benefited or received  something of value from its facilitation [*3]  of or  participation in a venture that violated the TVPRA.  Holistic owns and operates the property and manages  Page 2 of 3 the business known as Conty's Motel. Plaintiff was allegedly trafficked in the same room at  Conty's for 10 to 14 days where she was forced to  perform sex acts. When plaintiff checked out, the  employee would check the room and would see the  used condoms, excessive amounts of dirty linens, and  plaintiff being handed an envelope with cash. Plaintiff  alleges defendant profited from the sex trafficking by  leasing a room to her trafficker and receiving a steady  stream of income. In Count One, plaintiff alleges that defendant had a  ""statutory obligation not to benefit financially from a  venture"" that violates the TVPRA and that defendant  ""breached this duty by participating in a venture which  facilitated the harboring and providing of A.D. for the  purposes of commercial sex induced by force, fraud, or  coercion, by their acts, omissions, and commissions.""  (Doc. #1, ¶ 53.) Plaintiff alleges that defendant has  financially benefited by keeping operating costs low,  maintaining loyalty of customers seeking to participate  in the sex trade, and from payments for rooms. (Id., ¶  54.) III. The TVPRA [*4]  is a criminal statute that also provides  a civil remedy to victims of sex trafficking. Section 1591  of the Act imposes criminal liability for sex trafficking,  while section 1595 provides the following civil remedy: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Thus, a sex-trafficking victim may  not only sue a sex-trafficking perpetrator for civil liability  through a private right of action but may also seek to  hold liable ""whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by  receiving anything of value from participation in a  venture which that person knew or should have known  has engaged in an act in violation of [the TVPRA]."" Id. To state a claim under a section 1595(a) beneficiary  theory, Plaintiff must allege facts which permit the Court  to plausibly infer that the defendant ""(1) knowingly  benefited (2) from participating in a venture; (3) that  venture [*5]  violated the TVPRA as to [A.D.]; and (4)  [Defendants] knew or should have known that the  venture violated the TVPRA as to [A.D.]."" Doe v. Red  Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 723 (11th Cir. 2021).  Accordingly, Section 1595(a) requires factual allegations  which permit the Court to plausibly infer that defendant  should have known that Plaintiff was being forced or  coerced to commit commercial sex acts against her will.  See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a), 1595(a). 1. Knowingly Benefited ""'Knowingly  benefits'  means  'an  awareness  or  understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of mind  in which a person has no substantial doubt about the  existence of a fact.' Knowledge, Black's Law Dictionary  (11th ed. 2019). And Section 1595(a) explains that a  defendant may benefit 'financially or by receiving  anything of value.' Accordingly, a plaintiff like [A.D.]  must allege that the defendant knew it was receiving  some value from participating in the alleged venture.""  Doe #1 v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 723-24  (11th Cir. 2021). Plaintiff generically alleges ""Defendant profited from the  sex trafficking of A.D. and knowingly or negligently  aided, enabled, and facilitated the sex trafficking of  A.D."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 38.) Plaintiff alleges that ""Defendant  profited from the sex trafficking of A.D. and knowingly or  negligently aided and participated with A.D.'s trafficker  with his criminal activity."" [*6]  (Id., ¶ 42.) Plaintiff further  alleges: 44. The Defendant all financially benefited from the  sex trafficking of A.D., and other victims like her,  and developed and maintained business models  that attract and foster the commercial sex market  for traffickers and buyers alike. 45. Defendant benefit from the steady stream of  income that sex traffickers bring to their hotel. 46. Defendant financially benefit from their ongoing  reputation for privacy, discretion, and the facilitation  of commercial sex. (Id., ¶¶ 44-46.) The Court finds that plaintiff has  generically alleged a profit, the same profit received  from all room rentals, but no facts are stated as to  Holistic's actual knowledge of sex trafficking on the  premises. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32258, *3 Page 3 of 3 2. Participation in a Venture ""The ordinary meaning of ""venture"" is an undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit"" and ""[t]he  ordinary meaning of participate or participation is to take  part in or share with others in common or in an  association."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Plaintiff alleges that defendant ""actively participated in  this illegal endeavor by knowingly or negligently  providing lodging in which to harbor A.D. while he was  trafficking her."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 41.) This is the only [*7]   allegation of active participation, and no allegations are  made that defendant did so with, or an association with,  the traffickers for a common goal of sex trafficking or to  profit from sex trafficking. The only factual allegation of  a direct interaction is an employee witnessing plaintiff  being handed an envelope. (Doc. #1, ¶ 36.) 3. Knew or Should Have Known Count One alleges that plaintiff is a victim of sex  trafficking within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a),  and that defendant knew or should have known not to  benefit from a venture engaged in violations of 18  U.S.C. § 1591(a). Under Section 1591(a), whoever  knowingly  ""recruits,  entices,  harbors,  transports,  provides, obtains, advertises, maintains, patronizes, or  solicits"" ""by any means a person"" or benefits ""from  participation in a venture which has engaged"" in such  acts knowing that ""means of force, threats of force,  fraud, coercion"" ""will be used to cause the person to  engage in a commercial sex act"" shall be punished. 18  U.S.C. § 1591(a). ""But observing something is not the  same as participating in it."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at  727. Other than observing ""well-known red flags"" such as  payments in cash, a continuous procession of men  entering and leaving A.D.'s room, there are no  allegations that defendant participated in [*8]  a violation  of the TVPRA. In paragraphs 37f and 37g, plaintiff  alleges a ""personal relationship between various hotel  staff and A.D.'s trafficker"" and ""direct employee  encounters with A.D. and her trafficker inside the  Conty's Motel Naples."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 37.) This is the only  reference with no supporting facts as to how, how often,  or when these alleged encounters occurred. IV. Defendant also seeks to strike the allegations in  paragraph one of the Complaint as immaterial and  unsupported. The Court agrees. See A.D. v. Cavalier  Mergersub LP, No. 2:22-CV-095-JES-NPM, 2022 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 169985, 2022 WL 4357989, at *2 (M.D. Fla.  Sept. 20, 2022) (citing Doe v.

Accordingly, it is now ORDERED: Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint or  Motion to Strike (Doc. #15) is GRANTED. The motion to  dismiss is granted and the Complaint is dismissed  without prejudice to filing an Amended Complaint  within FOURTEEN (14) DAYS of this Opinion and  Order.

Ct. 1955,  167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). In deciding a  Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court must accept  all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take  them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, Erickson v.  Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d  1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal conclusions without adequate  factual support are entitled to no assumption of truth,""  Mamani v. Berzaín, 654 F.3d 1148, 1153 (11th Cir.  2011) (citations omitted). Plaintiff's (second) amended complaint is brought  pursuant  to  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act (TVPRA). As previously stated, The TVPRA is a criminal statute that also provides  a civil remedy to victims of sex trafficking. Section  1591(a) of the Act imposes criminal liability for  certain sex trafficking: a) Whoever knowingly-- (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or  within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction  of the [*3]  United States, recruits, entices, harbors,  transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains,  Page 2 of 5 patronizes, or solicits by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C.A. § 1591(a). In addition to a criminal  punishment, the TVPRA provides the following civil  remedy: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover [*4]   damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Thus, the TVRPA authorizes a victim of sex  trafficking to bring a direct civil claim against the  perpetrator of the trafficking and a ""beneficiary"" civil  claim  against  ""whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of [the TVPRA]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). To  state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA, Plaintiff must plausibly allege that the  defendant ""(1) knowingly benefited (2) from  participating in a venture; (3) that venture violated  the TVPRA as to [A.D.]; and (4) [Defendants] knew  or should have known that the venture violated the  TVPRA as to [A.D.]."" Doe v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21  F.4th 714, 726 (11th Cir. 2021). A.D. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 22023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67834,  [WL] at *2. The Court will consider each of the elements  as applied to the amended pleading. II. The operative amended complaint alleges the following:  Defendant Marriott International, Inc. (Marriott) knows  and has known for years that sex trafficking and  prostitution occur at their branded hotel locations.  Defendant CHM Naples II Hotel Partners LLC's (CHM  Naples) also knows and has known for years of both  occurring specifically at the SpringHill Suites (SpringHill)  by Marriott [*5]  in Naples, Florida. (Doc. #39, ¶¶ 2-3.)  This action for damages is brought by the Plaintiff,  identified by her initials A.D., a survivor of sex trafficking  under the TVPRA. (Id. at ¶ 12.) A.D. was trafficked for  commercial sex at SpringHill by Trafficker 2 through  force, fraud, and coercion. (Id. at ¶ 16.) ""With knowledge of the problem, and as a direct and  proximate result of Defendants' multiple failures and  refusals to act, mandate, establish, execute, and/or  modify their anti-trafficking efforts at the SpringHill hotel,  A.D. was continuously sex trafficked, sexually exploited,  and victimized repeatedly at the SpringHill hotel."" (Id. at  ¶ 18.) Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a  hotel operating venture and knowingly benefited from  this venture through room rentals, profits, third party  fees, and the value of the ""good will"" of the Marriott®  brand. The venture knew or should have known that  they were profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex  trafficking of A.D., in violation of the TVPRA."" (Id. at ¶  19.) Plaintiff further alleges that Marriott participated in a  hotel operating venture that included staff at the  SpringHill.  CHM  Naples  owns  the  SpringHill  pursuant [*6]  to a franchise agreement entered into  with Marriott. Plaintiff alleges an agency relationship  through Marriott's ""exercise of ongoing and systemic  right of control over SpringHill hotel."" (Id. at ¶¶ 29-32.)  Marriott makes decisions that directly impact the  operations and maintenance of their branded hotels,  including the SpringHill. (Id. at ¶ 39.) CHM Naples  directly offered public lodging services at the SpringHill  where A.D. was trafficked for sex. (Id. at ¶ 49.)  Defendants ""participated in a hotel operating venture in  connection with the management and operating of the  SpringHill hotel involving risk and potential profit."" (Id. at  ¶ 52.) During at least 2008 to 2012, emails were exchanged by  employees of Marriott that related to sex trafficking in  hotels, including CHM Naples' hotel. (Id. at ¶ 57.)  Marriott had actual and/or constructive knowledge of  sex trafficking, including A.D.'s sex trafficking and  Page 3 of 5 victimization, occurring on its branded property. (Id. at ¶  60.) Despite having access to sex trafficking indicators,  Marriott continues to permit and profit from male  clientele who rented hotel rooms to buy sex, including  those who bought Plaintiff. (Id. at ¶ 72.) CHM Naples employees [*7]  and staff openly observed  signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. CHM Naples  received revenue and a percentage was provided to  Marriott. (Id. at ¶ 104.) Through Marriott's relationship  with the staff at the SpringHill, it benefited or received  royalty payments, licensing fees, franchise fees and  dues, reservation fees, and percentages of the gross  room revenue. (Id. at ¶ 105.) Through their ""continuous  business venture of renting hotel rooms"", CHM Naples  knowingly benefited. (Id. at ¶ 107.) Plaintiff alleges that  defendants benefit from the steady stream of income  that sex traffickers bring to their hotel brands and from  their reputation for privacy, discretion, and the  facilitation of commercial sex. (Id., ¶¶ 116-117.) III. As previously stated, plaintiff must sufficiently plead that  a defendant knowingly benefited from participating in a  venture, that the venture violated the TVPRA, and that  defendants knew or should have known that the venture  violated the TVPRA. A. Knowingly Benefited To satisfy the first element of a TVPRA beneficiary  claim, plaintiff must allege that defendant ""knew it was  receiving some value from participating in the alleged  venture."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. As the  Eleventh [*8]  Circuit stated, ""Knowingly benefits"" means ""an awareness or  understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of  mind in which a person has no substantial doubt  about the existence of a fact."" Knowledge, Black's  Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). And Section  1595(a) explains that a defendant may benefit  ""financially or by receiving anything of value.""  Accordingly, a plaintiff like the Does must allege  that the defendant knew it was receiving some  value from participating in the alleged venture. Id. at 723-24. In the absence of a more stringent  statutory pleading requirement, knowledge ""may be  alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Alleging a  ""continuous business relationship"" is sufficient to show a  knowing benefit. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22- 2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015,  at *16 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023). The Court previously  found this element could be satisfied at this stage of the  proceedings. A.D. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 67834, [WL] at *3. B. Participation in Venture - Franchisor Plaintiff must allege that the benefits received by  Marriott were from ""participation in a venture"" which  defendants knew or should have known has engaged in  an act in violation of the TVPRA. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a).  The Eleventh Circuit rejected the statutory definition of  ""participation in a venture"" found in the criminal  provision, § 1591(e)(4), which defined ""participation in a  venture"" as ""knowingly assisting, supporting [*9]  or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)."" Instead, the  Eleventh Circuit held that ""participation in a venture"" in  the civil context requires that plaintiff allege that the  franchisor ""took part in a common undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit."" Red Roof  Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture and knowingly benefited from this  venture through room rentals, profits, third party fees,  and the value of the ""good will"" of the Marriott® brand.  The venture knew or should have known that they were  profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking  of A.D., in violation of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #39, ¶ 19.)  Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture"" in connection with the SpringHill for  potential profit. (Id. at ¶ 52.) Plaintiff alleges that Marriott  ""had actual and/or constructive knowledge of sex  trafficking,  including  A.D.'s  sex  trafficking  and  victimization,"" at its branded property and it ""failed to  implement and enforce any of its own policy or policies  and protect Plaintiff A.D. from being sex trafficked"" and  failed to take action to prevent trafficking so that it could  continue to profit. (Id. at [*10]  ¶ 60.) Plaintiff alleges that  Marriott knew or should have known that SpringHill was  an ""area known for high incidence of crime and prone to  sex trafficking activity on and around the hotel  premises."" (Id. at ¶ 60f.) Marriott is alleged to have  demonstrated actual and/or constructive knowledge of  the ""rampant culture of sex trafficking"" at their properties  around the country, including through news stories and  online reviews. (Id. at ¶ 75.) These additional facts in the Second Amended  Complaint do not remedy the problem in the original  Page 4 of 5 pleading as to Marriott. ""[A]s the Eleventh Circuit has  acknowledged,  the  alleged  venture  can  be  a  'commercial venture' like running or expanding a  business. G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., No. 22-2621,  2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *6  (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023) (citing Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21  F.4th at 727 (emphasis added)). However, as before,  ""[t]he 'participation' in the sex trafficking venture is  essentially that the franchisor and the hotel operator did  not fight hard enough to keep these traffickers from  using their hotel. The Complaint acknowledges that  Defendants  opposed  sex  traffickers,  but  fault  defendants for taking ineffective steps to curtail the  traffickers. This hardly sounds like participating in a  venture."" A.D. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 67834, [WL] at *4. The Court finds that Marriott must be dismissed  because the Second [*11]  Amended Complaint does  not sufficiently plead that it participated in a sex  trafficking venture beyond participation in shared  revenue as part of its normal role as a franchisor. Red  Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 726-27 (""These allegations  may suggest that the franchisors financially benefitted  from renting hotel rooms to the Does' sex traffickers. But  they do nothing to show that the franchisors participated  in a common undertaking involving risk or profit that  violated the TVPRA—i.e., the alleged sex trafficking  ventures.""). C. Participation in Venture - Franchisee ""In order to plead Defendants participated in a venture,  Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court could  reasonably infer the hotels 'could be said to have a tacit  agreement' with the trafficker. Plaintiff need not show  that  defendants  had  actual  knowledge  of  the  participation in the sex-trafficking venture."" Doe v.  Rickey Patel, LLC, No. 0:20-60683-WPD-CIV, 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (S.D.  Fla. Sept. 30, 2020) (citation omitted). In other words,  plaintiff can show a ""continuous business relationship""  to show participation. J.G. v. Northbrook Indus., Inc.,  619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1235 (N.D. Ga. 2022); S.Y. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 519 F. Supp. 3d 1069,  1081 (M.D. Fla. 2021). Plaintiff alleges that ""Defendants"" knew or should have  known that A.D. was being trafficked based on red flags  such as A.D. checking in and paying for one night at a  time. Trafficker 2 held a loud party that ran late with  visibly [*12]   underage  attendees  and  despite  complaints, hotel staff did not break it up. (Doc. #39, ¶  97.) Other red flags include excessive requests for  sheets, a personal relationship between staff and the  trafficker, and direct employee encounters at the  Fairfield. (Id.) These facts at least plausibly infer that employees of the  SpringHill were participating in an enterprise involving  risk and knowingly benefiting from the risk. Red Roof  Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 725 (citing Ricchio v. McLean, 853  F.3d 553, 556-58 (1st Cir. 2017) (agreeing with First  Circuit that an operator's association with traffickers to  serve a business objective establishes participation in a  venture with a sex trafficker). D. Knowledge This element requires the plaintiff to allege that the  defendant had either actual or constructive knowledge  that the venture violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff.  Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Knowledge requires an  awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance,  while constructive knowledge is knowledge that one  should have 'using reasonable care or diligence'. Id.  (citing Black's Law Dictionary). The 'red flags' supporting knowledge include payments  in cash, large amounts of used condoms and bodily  fluids on the sheets and towels, A.D.'s physical  appearance,  excessive  requests  for  sheets  and  cleaning [*13]  services, the personal relationship with  staff and A.D.'s trafficker, and the direct employee  encounters with A.D. and her trafficker inside the  SpringHill. (Doc. #39, ¶ 97.) CHM Naples employees  and staff openly observed signs of trafficking and did not  aid plaintiff. (Id. at ¶ 104.) CHM Naples directly  benefited financially from room rentals for rooms in  which plaintiff was trafficked. (Id. at ¶ 112.) The Court finds these facts are sufficient to plausibly  allege knowledge at this stage of the proceedings. An  overt or direct act is not required. See, e.g., K.H. v. Riti,  Inc., No. 1:22-CV-3404-MHC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  93374, 2023 WL 3644224, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 17,  2023) (collecting cases of direct association between  hotel and trafficker); J.C. v.

Supp. 3d 1228, 1239 (N.D. Ga. 2022)  (employees acted as lookouts for Plaintiff's traffickers). Accordingly, it is hereby Page 5 of 5 ORDERED: 1. Defendant Marriott International, Inc.'s Motion to  Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint  (Doc. #41) is GRANTED and defendant is  dismissed with prejudice. 2. Defendant CHM Naples II Hotel Partners, LLC's  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended  Complaint (Doc. #42) is DENIED.

"A.D. v. Marriott Int_l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150394","OPINION AND ORDER This matter comes before the Court on review of  defendant Marriott International, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss  Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (Doc. #41) filed  on May 23, 2023, and formerly named defendant CHMB  Florida Hotel Manager, LLC now identified as  defendant CHM Naples II Hotel Partners LLC's Motion  to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (Doc.     #42) filed on the same day. Plaintiff filed a Consolidated  Response in Opposition (Doc. #45) on June 20, 2023.  Both defendants filed Replies. (Docs. ## 51, 53.)  Plaintiff filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority (Doc.  #55) on [*2]  August 8, 2023. I. On April 19, 2023, the Court granted defendants'  motions to dismiss with leave to file an Amended  Complaint. A.D. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., No. 2:22-CV-644- JES-NPM, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68592, 2023 WL  3004549, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 19, 2023). On May 10,  2023, plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (Doc.  #39) and defendants have now essentially renewed  their motions to dismiss. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a  Complaint must contain a ""short and plain statement of  the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.""  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This obligation ""requires more  than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation  of the elements of a cause of action will not do."" Bell Atl.  Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955,  167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). In deciding a  Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court must accept  all factual allegations in a complaint as true and take  them in the light most favorable to plaintiff, Erickson v.  Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d  1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal conclusions without adequate  factual support are entitled to no assumption of truth,""  Mamani v. Berzaín, 654 F.3d 1148, 1153 (11th Cir.  2011) (citations omitted). Plaintiff's (second) amended complaint is brought  pursuant  to  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act (TVPRA). As previously stated, The TVPRA is a criminal statute that also provides  a civil remedy to victims of sex trafficking. Section  1591(a) of the Act imposes criminal liability for  certain sex trafficking: (a) Whoever knowingly-- Page 2 of 5 (1) in or affecting interstate or [*3]  foreign  commerce, or within the special maritime and  territorial jurisdiction of the United States, recruits,  entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains,  advertises, maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any  means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C.A. § 1591(a). In addition to a criminal  punishment, the TVPRA provides the following civil  remedy: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of [*4]  this chapter) in an appropriate  district court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Thus, the TVRPA authorizes a victim of sex  trafficking to bring a direct civil claim against the  perpetrator of the trafficking and a ""beneficiary"" civil  claim  against  ""whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of [the TVPRA]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). To  state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA, Plaintiff must plausibly allege that the  defendant ""(1) knowingly benefited (2) from  participating in a venture; (3) that venture violated  the TVPRA as to [A.D.]; and (4) [Defendants] knew  or should have known that the venture violated the  TVPRA as to [A.D.]."" Doe v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21  F.4th 714, 726 (11th Cir. 2021). A.D. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68592,  [WL] at *2. The Court will consider each of the elements  as applied to the amended pleading. II. The operative amended complaint alleges the following:  Defendant Marriott International, Inc. (Marriott) knows  and has known for years that sex trafficking and  prostitution occur at their branded hotel locations.  Defendant CHM Naples II Hotel Partners LLC's (CHM  Naples) also knows and has known for [*5]  years of  both occurring specifically at the Fairfield Inn & Suites  Naples by Marriott (Fairfield) in Naples, Florida. (Doc.  #39, ¶¶ 2-3.) This action for damages is brought by the  Plaintiff, identified by her initials A.D., a survivor of sex  trafficking under the TVPRA. (Id. at ¶ 12.) A.D. was  trafficked for commercial sex at Fairfield by Trafficker 2  through force, fraud, and coercion. (Id. at ¶ 16.) ""With knowledge of the problem, and as a direct and  proximate result of Defendants' multiple failures and  refusals to act, mandate, establish, execute, and/or  modify their anti-trafficking efforts at the Fairfield hotel,  A.D. was continuously sex trafficked, sexually exploited,  and victimized repeatedly at the Fairfield hotel."" (Id. at ¶  18.) Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a  hotel operating venture and knowingly benefited from  this venture through room rentals, profits, third party  fees, and the value of the ""good will"" of the Marriott®  brand. The venture knew or should have known that  they were profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex  trafficking of A.D., in violation of the TVPRA."" (Id. at ¶  19.) Plaintiff further alleges that Marriott participated in a  hotel [*6]  operating venture that included staff at the  Fairfield. CHM Naples owns the Fairfield Inn & Suites  pursuant to a franchise agreement entered into with  Marriott. Plaintiff alleges an agency relationship through  Marriott's ""exercise of ongoing and systemic right of  control over Fairfield hotel."" (Id. at ¶¶ 29-32.) Marriott  makes decisions that directly impact the operations and  maintenance of their branded hotels, including the  Fairfield. (Id. at ¶ 39.) CHM Naples directly offered  public lodging services at the Fairfield where A.D. was  trafficked for sex. (Id. at ¶ 49.) Defendants ""participated  in a hotel operating venture in connection with the  management and operating of the Fairfield involving risk  and potential profit."" (Id. at ¶ 52.) During at least 2008 to 2012, emails were exchanged by  employees of Marriott that related to sex trafficking in  Page 3 of 5 hotels, including Fairfield. (Id. at ¶ 57.) Marriott had  actual and/or constructive knowledge of sex trafficking,  including A.D.'s sex trafficking and victimization,  occurring on its branded property. (Id. at ¶ 60.) Despite  having access to sex trafficking indicators, Marriott  continues to permit and profit from male clientele who  rented hotel [*7]  rooms to buy sex, including those who  bought Plaintiff. (Id. at ¶ 72.) CHM Naples employees and staff openly observed  signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. CHM Naples  received revenue and a percentage was provided to  Marriott. (Id. at ¶ 102.) Through Marriott's relationship  with the staff at the Fairfield, it benefited or received  royalty payments, licensing fees, franchise fees and  dues, reservation fees, and percentages of the gross  room revenue. (Id. at ¶ 103.) Through their ""continuous  business venture of renting hotel rooms"", CHM Naples  knowingly benefited. (Id. at ¶ 105.) Plaintiff alleges that  defendants benefit from the steady stream of income  that sex traffickers bring to their hotel brands and from  their reputation for privacy, discretion, and the  facilitation of commercial sex. (Id., ¶¶ 114-115.) III. As previously stated, plaintiff must sufficiently plead that  a defendant knowingly benefited from participating in a  venture, that the venture violated the TVPRA, and that  defendants knew or should have known that the venture  violated the TVPRA. A. Knowingly Benefited To satisfy the first element of a TVPRA beneficiary  claim, plaintiff must allege that defendant ""knew [*8]  it  was receiving some value from participating in the  alleged venture."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. As the  Eleventh Circuit stated, ""Knowingly benefits"" means ""an awareness or  understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of  mind in which a person has no substantial doubt  about the existence of a fact."" Knowledge, Black's  Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). And Section  1595(a) explains that a defendant may benefit  ""financially or by receiving anything of value.""  Accordingly, a plaintiff like the Does must allege  that the defendant knew it was receiving some  value from participating in the alleged venture. Id. at 723-24. In the absence of a more stringent  statutory pleading requirement, knowledge ""may be  alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Alleging a  ""continuous business relationship"" is sufficient to show a  knowing benefit. G.G. v. Salesforce.Com, Inc., No. 22- 2621, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015,  at *16 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023). The Court previously  found this element could be satisfied at this stage of the  proceedings. A.D. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 68592, [WL] at *3. B. Participation in Venture - Franchisor Plaintiff must allege that the benefits received by  Marriott were from ""participation in a venture"" which  defendants knew or should have known has engaged in  an act in violation of the TVPRA. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a).  The Eleventh Circuit rejected the statutory definition of  ""participation in a venture"" found in the criminal [*9]   provision, § 1591(e)(4), which defined ""participation in a  venture""  as  ""knowingly  assisting,  supporting  or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)."" Instead, the  Eleventh Circuit held that ""participation in a venture"" in  the civil context requires that plaintiff allege that the  franchisor ""took part in a common undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit."" Red Roof  Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture and knowingly benefited from this  venture through room rentals, profits, third party fees,  and the value of the ""good will"" of the Marriott® brand.  The venture knew or should have known that they were  profiting from sex trafficking, including the sex trafficking  of A.D., in violation of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #39, ¶ 19.)  Plaintiff alleges that defendants ""participated in a hotel  operating venture"" in connection with the Fairfield for  potential profit. (Id. at ¶ 52.) Plaintiff alleges that Marriott  ""had actual and/or constructive knowledge of sex  trafficking,  including  A.D.'s  sex  trafficking  and  victimization,"" at its branded property and it ""failed to  implement and enforce any of its own policy or policies  and protect Plaintiff A.D. from being sex trafficked""  and [*10]  failed to take action to prevent trafficking so  that it could continue to profit. (Id. at ¶ 60.) Plaintiff  alleges that Marriott knew or should have known that  the Fairfield hotel was an ""area known for high  incidence of crime and prone to sex trafficking activity  on and around the hotel premises."" (Id. at ¶ 60f.)  Marriott is alleged to have demonstrated actual and/or  constructive knowledge of the ""rampant culture of sex  trafficking"" at their properties around the country,  including through news stories and online reviews. (Id.  Page 4 of 5 at ¶ 75.) These additional facts in the Second Amended  Complaint do not remedy the problem in the original  pleading as to Marriott. ""[A]s the Eleventh Circuit has  acknowledged,  the  alleged  venture  can  be  a  'commercial venture' like running or expanding a  business. G.G. v. Salesforce.Com, Inc., No. 22-2621,  2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *6  (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023) (citing Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21  F.4th at 727 (emphasis added)). However, as before,  ""[t]he 'participation' in the sex trafficking venture is  essentially that the franchisor and the hotel operator did  not fight hard enough to keep these traffickers from  using their hotel. The Complaint acknowledges that  Defendants  opposed  sex  traffickers,  but  fault  defendants for taking ineffective steps to curtail the  traffickers. This hardly sounds [*11]  like participating in  a venture."" A.D. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 68592, [WL] at *4. The Court finds that Marriott must be dismissed  because the Second Amended Complaint does not  sufficiently plead that it participated in a sex trafficking  venture beyond participation in shared revenue as part  of its normal role as a franchisor. Red Roof Inns, Inc.,  21 F.4th at 726-27 (""These allegations may suggest that  the franchisors financially benefitted from renting hotel  rooms to the Does' sex traffickers. But they do nothing  to show that the franchisors participated in a common  undertaking involving risk or profit that violated the  TVPRA—i.e., the alleged sex trafficking ventures.""). C. Participation in Venture - Franchisee ""In order to plead Defendants participated in a venture,  Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court could  reasonably infer the hotels 'could be said to have a tacit  agreement' with the trafficker. Plaintiff need not show  that  defendants  had  actual  knowledge  of  the  participation in the sex-trafficking venture."" Doe v.  Rickey Patel, LLC, No. 0:20-60683-WPD-CIV, 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (S.D.  Fla. Sept. 30, 2020) (citation omitted). In other words,  plaintiff can show a ""continuous business relationship""  to show participation. J.G. v. Northbrook Indus., Inc.,  619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1235 (N.D. Ga. 2022); S.Y. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 519 F. Supp. 3d 1069,  1081 (M.D. Fla. 2021). Plaintiff alleges that ""Defendants"" knew or should have  known that A.D. was being trafficked based on red flags  such as A.D. checking [*12]  in and paying for one night  at a time. A.D. would approach the front desk in a  drugged state and would ask for an extension of another  night. (Doc. #39, ¶ 95.) Other red flags include  excessive requests for sheets, a personal relationship  between staff and the trafficker, and direct employee  encounters at the Fairfield. (Id.) These facts at least plausibly infer that employees of the  Fairfield were participating in an enterprise involving risk  and knowingly benefiting from the risk. Red Roof Inns,  Inc., 21 F.4th at 725 (citing Ricchio v. McLean, 853 F.3d  553, 556-58 (1st Cir. 2017) (agreeing with First Circuit  that an operator's association with traffickers to serve a  business objective establishes participation in a venture  with a sex trafficker). D. Knowledge This element requires the plaintiff to allege that the  defendant had either actual or constructive knowledge  that the venture violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff.  Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Knowledge requires an  awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance,  while constructive knowledge is knowledge that one  should have 'using reasonable care or diligence'. Id.  (citing Black's Law Dictionary). The 'red flags' supporting knowledge include payments  in cash, large amounts of used condoms and bodily  fluids on the sheets and towels, A.D.'s [*13]  physical  appearance, excessive requests for sheets and cleaning  services, the personal relationship with staff and A.D.'s  trafficker, and the direct employee encounters with A.D.  and her trafficker inside the Farfield. (Doc. #39, ¶ 95.)  CHM Naples employees and staff openly observed  signs of trafficking and did not aid plaintiff. (Id. at ¶ 102.)  CHM Naples directly benefited financially from room  rentals for rooms in which plaintiff was trafficked. (Id. at  ¶ 110.) The Court finds these facts are sufficient to plausibly  allege knowledge at this stage of the proceedings. An  overt or direct act is not required. See, e.g., K.H. v. Riti,  Inc., No. 1:22-CV-3404-MHC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  93374, 2023 WL 3644224, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Apr. 17,  2023) (collecting cases of direct association between  hotel and trafficker); J.C. v. I Shri Khodiyar, LLC, 624 F.  Supp. 3d 1307, 1318 (N.D. Ga. 2022) (Plaintiff claims  that her daughter was forced to have sex with  Defendant's employees); J.G. v. Northbrook Indus., Inc.,  619 F. Supp. 3d 1228, 1239 (N.D. Ga. 2022)  (employees acted as lookouts for Plaintiff's traffickers). Page 5 of 5 Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED: 1.

"A.R. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 227436","OPINION & ORDER This matter is before this Court on Defendant Wyndham  Hotels & Resorts, Inc.'s (hereinafter ""Wyndham"") Motion  to Dismiss. (ECF No. 30). For the following reasons,  Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is hereby DENIED. I. BACKGROUND Plaintiff, A.R., was trafficked for sex and held captive by  means of ""violence, threats, [*2]  induced dependence  on illegal substances, and induced dependance for  ""food, transportation, shelter, and clothing"" beginning at  twenty years old from 2009 through 2015. (ECF No. 1 at  ¶¶ 33-34). She alleges that this trafficking took place at  a Super 8 and Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham in  Columbus, Ohio. (Id., ¶ 38). Plaintiff now seeks to hold  Defendant liable under the civil liability beneficiary  theory  of  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act (""TVPRA""), 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a).  (Id., ¶ 116). Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Wyndham  knew or should have known A.R. was trafficked on its  properties and had a statutory obligation not to benefit  financially from the venture. (Id., ¶¶ 23, 53-54, 117). As  a result, A.R. argues that she suffered ""substantial  physical and psychological injuries."" (Id., ¶ 119). A.R. argues that Defendant ""hewed to a common policy  of harboring known and suspected human traffickers in  exchange for financial benefit"" and ""actively ignoring  signs of ongoing human trafficking."" (Id., ¶¶ 52-53).  Plaintiff alleges the hotel staff at Wyndham's franchises  should have recognized obvious signs of her trafficking  in their hotels which included: (1) unusually large  numbers of male guests asking for A.R. at the front  desk; (2) constant foot [*3]  traffic to A.R.'s room by  ""johns"" who routinely entered the hotels as nonpaying  guests and left within hours of arrival; (3) at least one of  A.R.'s traffickers regularly requesting that hotel staff  notify him when A.R. attempted to leave the hotels; (4)  excessive requests for towels and linens; (5) unusually  large numbers of used condoms in the garbage bins; (6)  cash payment for rooms; and (7) obvious signs of illegal  drug use. (Id. at ¶¶ 47-49). A.R. further alleges that she  called the front desk of the Super 8 for help when her  trafficker and a ""john"" got into a fight and a hotel  employee arrived to break up the fight. (Id., ¶ 44). A.R.  attempted to flee the hotel during the altercation, but her  trafficker caught her and forcibly returned her to the  hotel without staff interference. (Id.). Finally, A.R.  maintains that Defendant has long been on notice of  repeated incidences of sex trafficking at their hotel  Page 2 of 11 locations but fails to provide examples of sex trafficking  events at the Hawthorn Suites at issue in this action.  (Id., ¶ 75). A.R.'s Complaint initially brought a conspiracy claim  against all Defendants. (Id., ¶ 121). Defendants G6  Hospitality, LLC, the Ohio Hotel and Lodging [*4]   Association (""OHLA), and the American Hotel and  Lodging  Association  (""AHLA"")  were  voluntarily  dismissed from this action between January and June  2022. (ECF Nos. 23, 42, 51). Plaintiff and Defendant  Wyndham stipulated to dismissal of the conspiracy  claim (ECF No. 46) in April 2022, and this Court granted  an order dismissing the claim. (ECF No. 47). Therefore,  the TVPRA claim is the only remaining allegation at  issue with Defendant in this Motion to Dismiss. II. STANDARD OF REVIEW This Court may dismiss a cause of action under Federal  Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for ""failure to state a  claim upon which relief can be granted."" Such a motion  ""is a test of the plaintiff's cause of action as stated in the  complaint, not a challenge to the plaintiff's factual  allegations."" Golden v. City of Columbus, 404 F. 3d 950,  958-59 (6th Cir. 2005). This Court must construe the  complaint in the light most favorable to the non-moving  party. Total Benefits Planning Agency, Inc. v. Anthem  Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 552 F. 3d 430, 434 (6th Cir.  2008). If more than one inference may be drawn from  an allegation, this Court must resolve the conflict in  favor of the plaintiff. Mayer v. Mylod, 988 F. 2d 635, 638  (6th Cir. 1993). This Court cannot dismiss a complaint  for failure to state a claim ""unless it appears beyond  doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in  support of his claim which would entitle him to relief."" Id.  This Court, however, is not required [*5]  to accept as  true mere legal conclusions unsupported by factual  allegations. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.  Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). Although liberal, Rule 12(b)(6) requires more than bare  assertions of legal conclusions. Allard v. Weitzman, 991  F.2d 1236, 1240 (6th Cir. 1993) (citation omitted).  Generally, a complaint must contain a ""short and plain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). A complaint's  factual allegations ""must be enough to raise a right to  relief above the speculative level."" Bell Atl. Corp. v.  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L.  Ed. 2d 929 (2007). It must contain ""enough facts to state  a claim to relief that is plausible on its face."" Id. at 570.  A claim is plausible when it contains ""factual content  that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference  that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.""  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Finally, the Complaint should be  read as a whole, even if a specific alleged fact read in  isolation appears meaningless. Ricchio v. McLean, 853  F. 3d 553, 557 (1st Cir. 2017). III. ANALYSIS A. Direct Civil Liability Under the TVPRA § 1595 This Court has undertaken extensive analysis of the  issue of civil liability of hotel defendants in sex trafficking  cases under the TVPRA in other cases with many  factual similarities to this one. See M.A. v. Wyndham  Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959 (S.D. Ohio  2019); H.H. v. G6 Hospitality, LLC, No. 2:19-cv-755,  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152 (S.D.  Ohio Dec. 6, 2019); Doe S.W. v. Lorain-Elyria Motel,  Inc., No. 2:10-cv-1194, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961,  2020 WL 1244192 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 16, 2020); A.C. v.  Red Roof, Inc., No. 2:19-cv-4965, 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 106012, 2020 WL 3256261 (S.D. Ohio Jun. 16,  2020). Like the Plaintiffs in the other related cases, A.R.  has sued under the TVPRA. The TVPRA has two provisions relevant to this case.  First, the TVPRA [*6]  provides for criminal penalties set  forth in 18 U.S.C. § 1591: (a) Whoever knowingly— (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, . .  . recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides,  obtains,  advertises,  maintains,  patronizes,  or  solicits by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting  the violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in  reckless disregard of the fact, that means of  force,  threats  of  force,  fraud,  coercion  described  in  subsection  (e)(2),  or  any  combination of such means will be used to  cause the person to engage in a commercial  sex act, or that the person has not attained the  age of 18 years and will be caused to engage  in a commercial sex act, shall be punished as  provided in subsection (b). Page 3 of 11 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Secondly, and central to Plaintiff's  claim, is the standard for civil liability under the TVPRA  set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 1595: An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should [*7]  have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). This Court held in M.A. and H.H. that § 1595(a) can be  a standalone claim, and civil defendants need not have  committed the underlying criminal sex trafficking offense  under § 1591. M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 964; H.H., 2019  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152 at *2 (citing  Cong.  Research  Serv.,  R40190,  The  William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-457): Criminal  Law Provisions, at 16 (Jan. 29, 2009) (the amendments  to the TVPRA ""create[ ] civil liability both for those who  face criminal liability for their profiteering and those who  do not."")); Plaintiff A v. Schair, No. 2:11-cv-00145-WCO,  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 197819, 2014 WL 12495639, at  *3 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 9, 2014) (explaining that the 2008  amendments broadened the parties who could be sued  for trafficking violations from only the perpetrator)). This  Court likewise finds that A.R.'s allegation that she is a  victim of trafficking under § 1591 is enough to plead  sufficiently that she is ""a victim of this chapter"" pursuant  to § 1595(a) in order to survive a motion to dismiss.  (ECF No. 1, ¶ 11). This Court analyzes Plaintiff's direct civil liability claim  under the ""beneficiary theory"" of § 1595(a), which  requires: (1) the person or entity must ""knowingly  benefit[], [*8]  financially or by receiving anything of  value""; (2) from participating in a venture; (3) that the  ""person knew or should have known has engaged in an  act in violation of this chapter."" § 1595(a). A plaintiff may  satisfy these elements by showing that ""defendant's  own acts, omissions, and state of mind establish each  element."" J.L. v. Best W. Int'l, Inc., 521 F. Supp. 3d  1048, 1060 (D. Colo. 2021). This Court will assess  these factors in a different order than provided in the  statute to allow for a more logical progression of legal  analysis. 1. Knowing benefit This Court begins with an analysis of whether A.R. has  sufficiently alleged that Defendant ""knowingly benefited""  financially from her sex traffickers' sex trafficking  venture. The first element merely requires that  Defendant knowingly receives a financial benefit, not  that the perpetrator have actual knowledge of the sex  trafficking venture. A.C., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106012,  2020 WL 3256261, at *4. As this Court found in M.A.  and H.H., ""the rental of a room constitutes a financial  benefit from a relationship with the trafficker sufficient to  meet this element of the § 1595(a) standard."" M.A., 425  F. Supp. 3d at 965; H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  211090, 2019 WL 6682152 at *2. See also J.L., 521 F.  Supp. 3d at 1061 (concluding that allegations that a  hotel defendant received a percentage of room revenue  where trafficking occurred, was sufficient to meet the  knowingly benefited element under [*9]  18 U.S.C. §  1595(a)); Gilbert v. U.S. Olympic Comm., 423 F. Supp.  3d 1112, 1137 (D. Colo. 2019) (finding the forced labor  provision of § 1589(b) does not ""require[ ] the party to  benefit from the [forced] labor or services for liability to  attach""). A.R. alleges that Defendant rented rooms to  her traffickers and benefited financially. (ECF No. 1, ¶  118). Therefore, Plaintiff pleads allegations sufficient to  meet this element of the § 1595(a) standard. 2. Knew or should have known the venture was  engaged in trafficking A defendant cannot be liable under 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a)  unless it ""knew or should have known"" that the venture  was engaged in sex trafficking. Defendants need not  have actual knowledge of trafficking crimes for liability to  attach, as the language of § 1595(a) demonstrates that  constructive knowledge is sufficient. M.A., 425 F. Supp.  3d at 970 (citing Jean-Charles v. Perlitz, 937 F. Supp.  2d 276, 288-89 (D. Conn. 2013)). This Court has  previously held that notice of ""the prevalence of sex  trafficking generally at their hotels,"" the failure ""to take  adequate steps to train staff in order to prevent its  occurrence,"" and signs that ""should have alerted staff to  [Plaintiff's]  situation""  are  sufficient  to  meet  the  constructive knowledge requirement. Id. at 968. Defendant Wyndham argues that A.R.'s Complaint only  alleges that Wyndham ""could have known"" not ""knew or  should  have  known""  that  sex  trafficking  was  ongoing [*10]  at the Super 8 and Hawthorn Suites in  Columbus. (ECF No. 30 at 10). It alleges that its  franchisor/franchisee  relationship  with  the  hotels  Page 4 of 11 removes it from liability because its connection to hotel  staff is too attenuated to conclude that Defendant had  constructive knowledge of A.R.'s abuse. (ECF No. 36 at  15). Even if Defendant had more control over hotel staff,  it maintains that constructive knowledge under § 1595  requires something more than a generalized awareness  ""that sex trafficking sometimes occurred on their  franchisees' properties."" (Id. at 15-16 (citing S.J. v.  Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 473 F. Supp. 3d 147, 154  (E.D.N.Y.  2020)).  To  adopt  Plaintiff's  proposed  interpretation of the TVPRA, maintains Defendant,  would result in ""any industry whose goods and services  are sometimes misused by criminal traffickers . . .  deemed to have constructive knowledge of any specific  instance of sex trafficking."" (ECF No. 49 at 8).  Defendant argues that Plaintiff must allege that  Wyndham, as a franchisor, had knowledge of ""a specific  trafficking venture"" to be held liable under the TVPRA.  (Id. at 9). Plaintiff points to this Court's previous opinions to argue  that ""failure to combat a known problem in one's  operations can rise to the level of negligence sufficient  to establish [*11]  constructive knowledge as required  under § 1595 of the TVPRA."" (ECF No. 48 at 8 (citing  M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 968)). Plaintiff asserts that she  pled sufficient facts to allege plausibly that hotel  employees at these locations would have been aware of  many red flags and instances of violence that pointed  toward ongoing sex trafficking at their hotels. (Id. at 9).  Even though Defendant was on notice of ongoing sex  trafficking, Plaintiff maintains, Defendant continued to  rent rooms and profit from trafficking while failing to  prevent its occurrence. (Id. at 10). As set forth in several of this Court's previous decisions,  this Court is guided by two cases that represent  opposite ends of the spectrum of the ""knew or should  have known"" prong of the TVPRA. In Ricchio v.  McLean, the plaintiff's allegations contained fairly strong  evidence that the hotel owner and the trafficker were  working together, and that the hotel owner intended to  profit from the trafficking scheme. The allegations  included a ""high-five"" while discussing ""getting this thing  going again,"" a past business relationship between the  trafficker and hotel owner, and allegations that one of  the hotel owners had gone to the victim's room and ""had  shown indifference to Ricchio's obvious [*12]  physical  deterioration."" Ricchio, 853 F. 3d at 555. Ricchio alleged  that while ""in plain daylight view of the front office of the  motel,"" her trafficker ""kick[ed] her and force[d] her back  toward the rented quarters when she had tried to  escape."" Id. The Court concluded that the defendants  ""acted, at least, in reckless disregard"" of the nature of  the venture for purposes of § 1589 and § 1595. Id. at  557. On the other end of the spectrum is Hillary Lawson v.  Howard Rubin, where plaintiffs sued Blue Icarus, the  owner of a condo that it leased to Howard Rubin who  was procuring women then sexually assaulting and  abusing them at that location. No. 1:17-cv-6404 (BMC),  2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71582, 2018 WL 2012869, at *2  (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 29, 2018). The court found the plaintiff's  allegations of one police visit after a fight ensued and  one ambulance sent to the residence in six years  insufficient to hold Blue Icarus liable under § 1595. The  Court reasoned that even if Blue Icarus would have  done further investigation following the incidents, it  would not have uncovered to any more information  about the alleged trafficking. Lawson, 2018 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 71582, 2018 WL 2012869, at **13-14. A.R.'s allegations do not rise to the level of obviousness  present in Ricchio. First, Plaintiff argues that there were  a number of red flags apparent to hotel staff at both  hotels: (1) cash payments for rooms; (2) excessive  requests [*13]  for new linens and towels; (3) nonpaying  ""johns"" asking for A.R. and regularly going into and out  of her room; and (4) requests by her traffickers of staff  to notify them when A.R. attempted to leave the hotels.  (ECF Nos. 1, ¶¶ 47-49). Regarding the Super 8 in which  A.R. alleges she was trafficked, A.R. argues that she  once had to call hotel staff for help when her trafficker  and a ""john"" who had purchased her for sexual activity  got into a fight. (Id., ¶ 44). After hotel staff arrived at her  room, A.R. fled, but was later apprehended by her  trafficker and forced back to the hotel. (Id.). Plaintiff  makes no specific allegations about hotel staff's  awareness of her trafficking at the Hawthorn Suites. This Court finds A.R.'s allegations against both hotels  insufficient to establish actual knowledge. She alleges  that hotel staff were called to her room to break up a  fight between her trafficker and a ""john,"" but she does  not allege facts to demonstrate that the hotel employee  who arrived was aware of the arrangement between the  parties. As previously stated, she does not allege  specific facts about the Hawthorn Suites at all. This Court finds, however, that Defendant had  constructive knowledge [*14]  of the trafficking occurring  at their hotels because they ""should have known"" about  the nature of the venture under the beneficiary theory's  negligence standard. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). A.R. alleges  that Defendant franchisors was on notice about the  Page 5 of 11 prevalence of sex trafficking at its hotels yet continued  to rent rooms to traffickers and failed to take adequate  steps to train staff in order to prevent its occurrence.  (ECF Nos. 1, ¶¶ 42-49, 52; 48 at 10). She also alleges  facts specific to her own sex trafficking, including a  number of signs she alleges should have alerted staff to  her situation. (ECF No. 1, ¶ 49). As such, Plaintiff  argues that Defendant's failure to act resulted in a  ""common policy of actively ignoring signs of ongoing  human trafficking."" (Id., ¶ 53). Even though Defendant maintains that the individual  hotel employee's actual or constructive knowledge of  trafficking is insufficient to impute knowledge on  Defendant as a franchisor (ECF Nos. 30 at 10-11; 49 at  8), Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to pass muster  under the plausibility standard of a 12(b)(6) motion to  dismiss because she alleges that the franchisor itself  had constructive knowledge of the problem. Several  courts have [*15]  found failure to implement policies  sufficient to combat a known problem in one's  operations can rise to the level of willful blindness or  negligence. See Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth,  524 U.S. 742, 758-59, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed. 2d  633 (1998) (holding where a ""supervisor's sexual  harassment is outside the scope of employment  because the conduct was for personal motives,"" an  employer can still ""be liable . . . where its own  negligence is a cause of the harassment"" because it  ""knew or should have known about the conduct and  failed to stop it""); Brown v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 603 F.  Supp. 2d 73, 81 (D.D.C. Mar. 26, 2009) (finding that  complaint stated sufficient allegations under § 1983,  based on willful blindness, where defendants knew that  a supervisor at a correctional facility raped his  employee, sexual harassment at the facility ""was not an  isolated incident,"" and defendants failed ""to implement  and effectuate the appropriate policies . . . to remedy  and/or prevent the discriminatory conduct, sexual abuse  and sexual harassment and rape""). Here A.R. alleged  that Defendant was on notice about the prevalence of  sex trafficking at its hotels and failed to take steps to  train staff to prevent its occurrence. Therefore, this  Court finds that A.R.'s Complaint sufficiently alleges  negligence under § 1595 for purposes of surviving this  Motion to Dismiss. 3. Participation [*16]  in a venture This Court has held that participation in a venture under  § 1595 does not require actual knowledge of trafficking  crimes but requires ""at least a showing of a continuous  business relationship between the trafficker and the  hotels such that it would appear that the trafficker and  the hotels have established a pattern of conduct or  could be said to have a tacit agreement."" M.A., 425 F.  Supp. 3d at 970 (citing Jean-Charles v. Perlitz, 937 F.  Supp. 2d at 288-89); see also Ricchio, 853 F.3d at 555  (finding sufficient allegations that, among other things,  the trafficker and hotel owner had prior dealings); Doe  S.W., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192,  at *6-7 (finding allegations that defendant hotels  repeatedly rented rooms to individuals they should have  known were traffickers based on the totality of the  circumstances, were sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6)  motion); H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL  6682152, at *4 (same); A.C., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  106012, 2020 WL 3256261, at *6 (same). Further,  participation in a venture under the TVPRA does not  require an ""overt act."" See e.g., J.L., 521 F. Supp. 3d at  1062; E.S. v. Best W. Int'l Inc., 510 F. Supp. 3d 420,  427 (N.D. Tex. 2021); M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 968-69;  S.J., 473 F. Supp. 3d at 153-54; Doe S.W., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192, *6; J.C. v.  Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99252,  2020 WL 3035794, at *1 n. 1 (N.D. Cal. June 5, 2020). This Court must decide whether Plaintiff alleged  sufficient facts to demonstrate Defendant's conduct  constituted ""participation in venture"" under § 1595(a).  A.R. alleges that her traffickers had a sex trafficking  venture. The question is whether the Defendant  participated in a commercial venture related to A.R.'s  trafficking  by:  (1)  ""own[ing],  supervis[ing],  and  operat[ing]"" [*17]  the Super 8 and Hawthorn Suites; (2)  receiving 10% of the hotels' gross revenue; (3)  implementing brand standards; (4) giving hotels access  to Wyndham's brand programs and reservation system;  (5) and promulgating the ""policies, procedures, and  standards governing the hiring, training, retention, and  advancement of on-the-ground employees."" (ECF Nos.  1, ¶¶ 56-67; 48 at 11). First, Defendant Wyndham counters that the hotels are  subject to franchise agreements meaning it ""does not  own, operate, manage, or supervise the facilities,"" nor  was Defendant present at either hotel during the period  Plaintiff alleges her trafficking occurred. (ECF No. 30 at  7). Defendant argues that the Complaint has not  established ""a continuous business relationship, . . .  pattern of conduct, or a tacit agreement between""  Wyndham and A.R.'s traffickers. (Id. at 8). In fact,  Defendant contends, the Complaint does not involve  allegations that Wyndham ""hired anyone involved in sex  trafficking, that it witnessed any sex trafficking, or that it  Page 6 of 11 interfered with any efforts to stop sex trafficking."" (Id.).  Even if Plaintiff had made those allegations, Defendant  maintains that franchise relationships simply provide  intellectual [*18]  property to hotel operators and is not  evidence of ""the association-in-fact"" necessary to  establish the existence of a TVPRA ""venture."" (ECF No.  49 at 6-7 (citing Cisneros v. Petland, Inc., 972 F.3d  1204, 1212 (11th Cir. 2020)). Defendant relies on Eleventh Circuit's recent decision in  Doe #1 v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., in which the Court held  that ""participation in a common venture"" under 18  U.S.C. § 1595's beneficiary theory should be defined,  based on its common definition as ""an undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit."" (ECF No.  30 (citing 21 F. 4th 714, 724 (11th Cir. 2021)). In Doe  #1, Plaintiffs alleged that defendant hotel franchisors  participated in ""sex trafficking ventures."" Id. at 726. The  Complaint included allegations that: (1) defendants  licensed their brand to franchisees who paid royalties to  the defendants and other fees based on a percentage of  their room revenue; (2) defendants received a  percentage of the revenue generated from the rooms in  which trafficking occurred; (3) defendants ""owned,  managed, supervised, operated, oversaw, controlled the  operation of, and/or were inextricably connected to the  renting of rooms"" at these hotels; (4) defendant  franchisors investigated incidents of trafficking at the  individual hotels and controlled training related to  spotting trafficking; [*19]  and (5) read online reviews  mentioning prostitution and crime occurring generally at  the hotels where plaintiffs were trafficked. Id. While the  court acknowledged that these allegations suggested  that the franchisor defendants benefitted financially from  renting rooms to traffickers, they did not rise to the level  of showing that ""the franchisors participated in a  common undertaking involving risk or profit that violated  the TVPRA."" Id. at 726-27. On appeal, Plaintiffs  changed their theory and argued instead that ""the  franchisors participated in commercial ventures to  operate hotels and that those hotel ventures violated the  [TVPRA]."" Id. at 727. Because Plaintiffs did not reserve  this theory for appeal and because they repeatedly  referred to ""sex trafficking ventures"" in their pleadings,  the court declined to address Plaintiffs' new ""commercial  venture"" theory. Id. The Eleventh Circuit's decision is not controlling here.  Doe #1 does not apply to the facts at hand. The court  distinguished the ""sex trafficking ventures"" at issue in  Doe #1 from the plaintiff's ""commercial venture""  argument raised on appeal and chose not to address  the plaintiff's commercial venture theory in that case. Id.  at 727. Here, A.R. alleges [*20]  that Defendant  ""participated in a commercial business venture under §  1595[] by receiving royalties from Plaintiff's traffickers  renting rooms at their branded locations,"" and through  their expansive control of other hotel policies and  operations, not that Defendant participated in the sex  trafficking ventures itself. (ECF Nos. 1, ¶¶56-67; 48 at  13). Defendant Wyndham's argument (ECF No. 58 at 6)  that Plaintiff alleged that Defendant participated in  ""trafficking ventures"" (ECF No. 1, ¶ 95) and ""sex  ventures"" (Id., ¶ 131) is misstated because both  references appear in the Complaint under the context of  Plaintiff's original conspiracy claim, which has since  been dismissed. (ECF No. 47). A claim is plausible when it contains ""factual content  that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference  that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.""  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Despite the parties' differing  allegations about Defendant's operational role in the  local hotels, it is not the role of this Court to resolve  factual disputes at this stage of the litigation. M.L. v.  Craigslist Inc., No. C19-6153 BHS-TLF, 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 166836, 2020 WL 6434845, at *6 (W.D. Wash.  Apr. 17, 2020), report and recommendation adopted,  No. C19-6153 BHS-TLF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166334,  2020 WL 5494903 (W.D. Wash. Sept. 11, 2020).  Construing these allegations in favor of the Plaintiff, as  required  at  this  stage,  this  Court  finds  that  Plaintiff's [*21]  allegations that Defendant substantially  oversaw operations and promulgated policies for  franchisee  hotels  meet  §  1595's  definition  of  ""participation in a venture. Here, Defendant was  involved in a business venture with the franchisee  hotels, and both groups benefitted by renting rooms to  traffickers despite having constructive knowledge of  ongoing trafficking based on the totality of the  circumstances. Because Plaintiff's allegations meet the three-pronged  requirement of 18 U.S.C. § 1595, Plaintiff has  sufficiently stated a claim that Defendant is directly,  civilly liable under the TVPRA. See M.A. 425 F. Supp.  3d at 971-72 (denying motion to dismiss of hotel parent  company  defendants  where  plaintiff  pled  that  defendants controlled employee training, room pricing,  provided online booking platform, and conducted  inspections). B. Joint and Several Liability Plaintiff argues that all Defendants are jointly and  Page 7 of 11 severally liable for her damages under the TVPRA.  (ECF No. 1, ¶ 30). Defendant Wyndham does not  appear to respond to this argument. Therefore, this  Court will consider Defendant to have conceded this  point. C. Vicarious Liability A plaintiff can also satisfy the elements of § 1595's  beneficiary theory by imputing ""to the defendant the  acts, [*22]  omissions, and state of mind of an agent of  the defendant"" through indirect or vicarious liability. J.L.,  521 F. Supp. 3d at 1060. Although Plaintiff argues it is  unnecessary to establish a theory of indirect liability as  she has pled sufficient facts to establish Defendant's  direct liability under the TVPRA, Plaintiff maintains that  she sufficiently alleged that Defendant exerts a  significant amount of control over the franchised  locations under an agency and joint employer theory.  (ECF No. 48 at 13). Specifically, she alleges that  Defendant controls the ""business, operations, training,  management,  supervision,  administration,  and  procedures"" of the local hotels and engages in profit  sharing. (Id. at 14 (citing ECF No. 1, ¶¶ 56-67)). The TVPRA, however, does not address the issue of  indirect or vicarious liability; therefore, federal district  courts who have adjudicated this issue must apply  common law to fill in the gaps. Norfolk Redevelopment  and Hous. Auth. v. Chesapeake and Potomac Tel. Co.  of Va., 464 U.S. 30, 35-36, 104 S. Ct. 304, 78 L. Ed. 2d  29 (1983) (explaining that the traditional rules of  statutory construction advise that statutes are presumed  not to disturb the common law ""unless the language of  the statute [is] clear and explicit for this purpose.""); see  also In re Nicole Gas Prod., Ltd., 581 B.R. 843, 850  (B.A.P. 6th Cir. 2018), aff'd sub nom. Nicole Gas Prod.,  Ltd., 916 F.3d 566 (6th Cir. 2019) (explaining that  statutes are presumed to embrace the [*23]  common  law extant at their enactment). In the past, this Court,  and other district courts, have applied the state common  law of vicarious liability when addressing indirect liability  arguments under the TVPRA. M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at  971 (applying Ohio agency law); see also A.B., 455 F.  Supp. 3d at 194-95 (applying Pennsylvania agency law);  S.J., 473 F. Supp. 3d at 158-59 (applying New York  agency law). Since this Court's ruling in 2019, another  district court chose to apply the federal common law of  vicarious liability in a TVPRA case. A.B., 484 F. Supp.  3d at 939-40 (citing Ninth Circuit cases where the court  applied the federal common law of agency where the  federal statute did not otherwise provide direction). Although it has yet to rule on whether the federal or  state common law of vicarious liability should be applied  under the TVPRA, when analyzing the few cases in  which federal statutes do not provide direction on  vicarious liability arguments, the Sixth Circuit has  applied the federal common law of vicarious liability.  See e.g., Marr v. Rife, 503 F.2d 735 (6th Cir. 1974)  (explaining that in determining the extent of liability of  the owner of a real estate agency for violations of Fair  Housing Act by his agent, court should apply federal law  and should not be restricted by respondeat superior law  or law of vicarious liability of the various states); [*24]   Imhoff Invest., L.L.C. v. Alfoccino, Inc., 792 F. 3d 627,  635 (6th Cir. 2015) (explaining that a seller may be held  vicariously liable in an action alleging violation of the  Telephone Consumer Protection Act (""TCPA"") under  federal common law principles of agency) but cf.  Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. Findlay Indus., Inc., et  al., 902 F.3d 597, 611 (6th Cir. 2018) (deciding to apply  state common law to an ERISA contract dispute  regarding successor liability because a federal court  may take direction from ""the law of the state in which it  sits"" so long as the standard used ""best comports with  the interests served by ERISA's regulatory scheme,"" but  explaining that ""as a general matter, the court must look  to the federal common law and should draw guidance  from state common law only when federal common law  does not provide an established standard""). As set forth more fully below, the defining characteristics  of agency and joint employer status are nearly identical  under federal common law and Ohio common law. In  M.A., a similar, previous sex trafficking case alleging  violations of the TVPRA, this Court applied the Ohio  common law of vicarious liability. M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d.  at 971-72. This decision stemmed from the fact that the  limited references to the federal common law of  vicarious liability drew directly from Ohio common law  and Restatements. Even if the Sixth Circuit were to rule  that federal common law should be applied [*25]  to  vicarious liability arguments under the TVPRA, it would  not change this Court's following analysis because there  is little to no substantive difference between federal and  Ohio common law standards for agency and joint  employer vicarious liability. Therefore, a review of the  present matter under both federal and state common  law results in the same outcome. Because the Sixth  Circuit has not (nor has any other federal circuit) had the  opportunity to address whether the federal common law  or state common law of vicarious liability should be  applied to the TVPRA, for thoroughness, this Court will  analyze the current matter under both legal theories to  determine whether Plaintiff meets the pleading standard  Page 8 of 11 for vicarious liability under the TVPRA. 1. Agency and Vicarious Liability Defendant  Wyndham  argues  that  a  franchisor's  obligations to a franchisee under the Lanham Act, which  ""require[] supervision of trademark licensees"" is meant  to ""ensure the integrity of the registered trademarks, not  create a federal law of agency."" (ECF Nos. 30 at 18-19  (citing Oberlin v. Marlin Am. Corp., 596 F. 2d 1322,  1327-28 (7th Cir. 1979); 49 at 11-12). Defendant  explains that ""[a]lthough franchise agreements typically  impose detailed requirements on the franchisee's  operations [*26]  [], the existence of these contractual  requirements does not mean that franchisors have a  role in managing the day-to-day operations of their  franchisees."" (ECF No. 49 at 12) (quoting Kerl v. Dennis  Rasmussen, Inc., 2004 WI 86, 273 Wis. 2d 106, 682  N.W.2d 328, 338 (Wis. 2004)). Defendant cites several  recent court cases that dismissed agency theories  advanced under the TVPRA against hotel brand  franchisors. (Id. (citing H.G. v. Inter-Continental Hotels  Corp., 489 F. Supp. 3d 697, 708 (E.D. Mich. 2020)  (dismissing TVPRA claim based on agency because the  plaintiff ""failed to plausibly allege"" that the franchisor  defendants  had  ""'day-to-day'  control""  over  and  franchised hotels); S.J. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 473  F. Supp. 3d 147, 156 (E.D.N.Y. 2020) (dismissing the  TVPRA claim based on agency because the plaintiff's  allegations, ""even if proven true, would fail to sufficiently  demonstrate that the franchisor defendants exercised []  complete control over the day-to-day operations of the  franchisee's business"")). To the extent the federal system, and more specifically  the Sixth Circuit, have created a common law of agency  liability, the courts generally turn to widely accepted  definitions of agency in building the federal common law  in this space. In Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, the  Supreme Court defined the central principle of agency  law within the employment context: ""[a] master is  subject to liability for the torts [*27]  of his servants  committed  while  acting  in  the  scope  of  their  employment."" 524 U.S. 742, 755-56, 118 S. Ct. 2257,  141 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1998) (quoting Restatement  (Second) of Agency § 219(1)). The Court explained that  ""[a]n employer may be liable for both negligent and  intentional torts committed by an employee within the  scope of his or her employment,"" but in some  circumstances, agency principles ""impose liability on  employers even where employees commit torts outside  the scope of employment."" Id. at 756, 758. It is a long-standing principle of law in Ohio that ""[a]  principal is chargeable with the knowledge of, or notice  to, his agent that is received by the agent in the due  course of the agent's employment and is related to the  matters within the agent's authority."" Liggett v.  Chesapeake Energy Corp., 591 F. App'x 305, 309 (6th  Cir. 2014) (citing State ex rel. Nicodemus v. Indust.  Comm'n, 5 Ohio St. 3d 58, 5 Ohio B. 115, 448 N.E.2d  1360, 1362 (Ohio 1983)). In determining whether there  is an agency relationship, the question is how much the  agent ""retained control, or the right to control, the mode  and manner of doing the work contracted for."" Beddia v.  Goodin, 957 F.2d 254, 257 (6th Cir. 1992) (quoting  Councell v. Douglas, 163 Ohio St. 292, 126 N.E.2d 597,  599 (Ohio 1955)). Further, the right of control or control  retained over the agent is directed ""toward the  attainment of an objective"" which the principal seeks.  Gen. Acquisition, Inc. v. GenCorp Inc., 766 F. Supp.  1460, 1469 (S.D. Ohio 1990) (citing Hanson v. Kynast,  24 Ohio St. 3d 171, 24 Ohio B. 403, 494 N.E.2d. 1091,  1094 (1986)). It is also well established that ""[t]he  principal's right of control need not extend to every  aspect of the alleged principal and agent's association.""  Id. Agency theories [*28]  are also applicable to the  franchisor/franchisee relationship. Under Ohio law, ""a  franchisor may be vicariously liable for a franchisee's  tortious conduct under a theory of apparent agency.""  Bricker v. R & A Pizza, Inc., 804 F. Supp.2d 615, 623  (S.D. Ohio 2011). To determine whether ""a principal- agent relationship exists, courts consider the same  factors 'as in the absence of a franchisor-franchisee  relationship.'"" Id. (citing Taylor v. Checkrite, Ltd., 627 F.  Supp. 415, 416 (S.D. Ohio 1986)). Plaintiff sufficiently details what aspects of the individual  hotel locations Defendant Wyndham controls. As  previously summarized, Plaintiff alleges an agency  relationship was created between the individual hotels  and franchisor Defendant through Defendant's control of  brand quality standards; use and placement of  franchisor's name; local hotel's reservation systems,  brand loyalty programs, and websites; and employment  policies and procedures. (ECF Nos. 1 ¶¶ 56-67; 48 at  14). The fact that Defendant is in a franchise  relationship with the respective, local hotels does not  bar application of agency theory. This Court, construing  the facts in favor of Plaintiff, finds that these allegations  sufficiently establish that Defendant's control over the  local hotels is directed towards attaining more revenue  and commercial success, which [*29]  is the objective  Defendant Wyndham, as principal, seeks. See Gen  Page 9 of 11 Acquisition, Inc., 766 F. Supp. at 1469. This meets the  definitions of agency liability under both federal and  Ohio common law. Therefore, they are sufficient to meet  the pleading standards of Rule 8. Defendant Wyndham also argues that the Complaint  lacks allegations sufficient to support a claim that their  hotel franchisees violated the TVPRA, such that their  actions can be imputed to Defendant as franchisor.  (ECF No. 49 at 13 (citing C.C. v. H.K. Group of Co.,  Inc., No. 1:21-cv-1345-TCB, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  29213, 2022 WL 467813, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 9, 20221)  (dismissing TVPRA claim against franchisee hotel  operator because Plaintiff did not allege interaction  between  defendants  and  traffickers  sufficient  to  establish a common undertaking)); ECF No. 30 at 20). Notably, Defendant Wyndham is correct that for an  agency theory of vicarious liability to apply to it, the hotel  franchisees themselves must have committed a wrong  to be imputed on Defendant. The three-pronged test  established by 18 U.S.C. § 1595 and used by this Court  to assess Defendant's direct liability is applicable to the  hotel franchisees as well. First, A.R. alleges that the  franchisees rented rooms to traffickers and financially  benefited from their trafficking ventures, therefore  satisfying the first prong. (ECF No. 1, ¶¶ 52, 117-18).  Second, [*30]  Plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to  establish that staff at Wyndham's Super 8 and Hawthorn  Suites had, at a minimum, constructive knowledge of  trafficking, through a series of red flags such as  requests for A.R.'s room by nonpaying guests,  excessive requests for clean room supplies, cash  payments for rooms, and that A.R.'s traffickers asked  hotel staff to notify them when she left the hotel. (ECF  No. 1, ¶¶ 47-49). Therefore, the second prong of the  beneficiary theory is satisfied. Third, Plaintiff has alleged  sufficient facts—that Wyndham's franchisee hotels,  along with Defendant, benefited financially from renting  rooms to traffickers and should have known trafficking  was  going  on  based  on  the  totality  of  the  circumstance—to  meet  §  1595's  definition  of  participation in a venture in a commercial setting that  profited from A.R.'s sex trafficking. (ECF No. 48 at 10- 12). 2. Joint Employer Status Plaintiff alleges that under federal labor regulations,  Defendant is ""considered joint employer[] of the  employees at [its] locations at which Plaintiff was  trafficked."" (ECF No. 1, ¶ 64). Defendant responds that  the joint employer doctrine is an ""employment law  concept that has been invoked in the [*31]  franchise  context to give franchisee employees grounds for suing  franchisors under certain narrow circumstances."" (ECF  No. 30 at 17). It maintains that the ""joint employer""  doctrine, however, is not applicable here because it is  ""not a basis for imputing liability to third parties from a  franchisee to a franchisor."" (Id. (citing Bricker, 804 F.  Supp. 2d at 621-22) (explaining that under the joint  employer doctrine ""an employee . . . may impose liability  for violations of employment law on the constructive  employer, on the theory that this other entity is the  employee's joint employer."")). Regardless, Defendant  argues Plaintiff lacks ""well-pled"" facts to even show  Wyndham is a joint employer of the Super 8 and  Hawthorn Suites staff. (Id. at 18). Most courts have recognized that the employer control  theory and the agency theory are ""essentially the  same."" Satterfield v. Tennessee, 295 F.3d 611, 618 n.6  (6th Cir. 2002); see also Ries v. Ohio State Univ. Med.  Ctr., 2013-Ohio-4545, ¶ 21, 137 Ohio St. 3d 151, 156,  998 N.E.2d 461, 466 (Ohio 2013) (explaining that when  defining the scope of employment in a joint employment  setting, the ""concept generally denotes an agency  relationship""). At the federal level, whether two  employers are a joint employer often turns on how much  control one exercises over the other. See e.g., Int'l  Longshoremen's Ass'n, AFL-CIO, Local Union No. 1937  v. Norfolk Southern Corp., 927 F.2d 900, 902 (6th Cir.  1991) (articulating test for joint employer status under  the NLRA as ""the interrelation [*32]  of operations  between  the  companies,  common  management,  centralized control of labor relations, and common  ownership.""); Sanford v. Main Street Baptist Church  Manor, Inc., 327 F. App'x 587, 594 (6th Cir. 2009)  (adopting the following test for Title VII joint employer  status: ""(1) the extent of the employer's control and  supervision over the worker, including directions on  scheduling and performance of work; (2) the kind of  occupation and nature of skill required, including  whether skills are obtained in the work place; (3)  responsibility for the costs of operation, such as  equipment, supplies, fees, licenses, workplace, and  maintenance of operations; (4) method and form of  payment and benefits; and (5) length of job commitment  and/or expectations.""). The Ohio courts similarly weigh  the following factors when determining whether an entity  has sufficient control over another to be considered a  joint employer: ""(1) interrelations of operation, (2)  common management, (3) centralized control of labor  relations, and (4) common ownership and financial  control."" Wittenbrook v. Elecs. Recycling Servs., Inc.,  Page 10 of 11 2018-Ohio-208, ¶ 28, 104 N.E.3d 876, 882-83 (Ohio Ct.  App. 7th 2018). Plaintiff  alleges  on  information  and  belief,  that  Defendant exercises ""significant control over the  employment decisions of [its] hotel locations,"" which  includes  promulgating  ""policies,  procedures,  and  standards governing [*33]  the hiring, training, retention,  and advancement of on-the-ground employees and  setting their rates of pay."" (ECF No. 1, ¶¶ 61-62).  Relevant here, Plaintiff maintains that Defendant  ""promulgate[s] policies relating to training employees to  recognize and respond to human trafficking, and the  Hotel Defendants determine whether or not such  training shall be mandatory."" (Id., ¶ 65). These  pleadings allege that Defendant had significant control  over hotel franchisee employees because it set the  standards by which the hotel employees are expected to  operate on a daily basis. These allegations meet the  requirements to plead joint employment under both  federal and Ohio state common law because they  demonstrate the Defendant's oversight and control was  intimately interwoven with the procedures governing  daily hotel operations and employment policies.  Therefore, A.R. has pled sufficient facts particular to  Wyndham to meet Rule 8 notice requirements for  purposes of surviving this Motion to Dismiss. D. Group Pleading Defendant argues that the Complaint impermissibly  ""offers general allegations about 'consistent red flags'  and adherence to 'a common policy of harboring known  and suspected human traffickers [*34]  in exchange for  financial benefit' without any attempt to tie any particular  allegations to any particular hotel."" (ECF No. 30 at 7).  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 requires a complaint  contain a ""short and plain statement of the claim  showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed. R.  Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The complaint must ""give the defendant  fair notice of what the... claim is and the grounds upon  which it rests."" Bell Atlantic Corp., 550 U.S. at 545  (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S. Ct.  99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957)). The impermissibility or  permissibility of ""group pleading"" is most common in  cases alleging corporate fraud where it is more difficult  for plaintiffs to meet the requirements set out in Federal  Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)—that is, ""a party must state  with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or  mistake."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Within the fraud context,  other courts have concluded that general pleadings are  permissible even where there are multiple defendants  so long as the ""grouping"" does not resemble a  ""monolith."" See City of Morristown v. AT&T Corp., 206  F. Supp. 3d 1321, 1338-39 (citing Fondren v. Schmidt,  626 F. Supp. 892, 898 (D. Nev. 1986) (recognizing that  in cases involving multiple defendants, a plaintiff should  allege the role of each of them, but also noting that  ""group conduct may be pleaded"" when ""a category of  defendants is allegedly responsible for a continuing  course of conduct"")). Fraud carries a heightened pleading standard under  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) that is not  applicable [*35]  to Plaintiff's allegations because she  does not plead fraud here. Our sister district's analysis  of fraud-related group pleadings, however, is instructive  in this case where the pleading burden is lower. Plaintiff  initially brought the TVPRA claim against corporate  hotel entities and associations claiming they were  responsible for the continuation of A.R.'s trafficking in  hotels they owned or were associated with in Columbus.  (ECF No. 1, ¶ 115-19). A.R. alleges that not only was  Defendant generally aware of ongoing trafficking in their  hotels but also alleges specific facts about signs of her  own trafficking in the Columbus hotels that would have  made Defendant constructively aware of her situation.  (Id., ¶¶ 44-49). Again, Plaintiff's allegations about  incidents of abuse at Wyndham's Super 8 hotel are  specific to that location. (Id., ¶ 44). A.R. does not have  to meet a heightened pleading standard, yet she does  here. This Court is satisfied that Plaintiff sufficiently pled  that all Defendants were responsible ""for a continuing  course of conduct,"" even though Defendant Wyndham is  currently the only defendant remaining. Fondren, 626 F.  Supp. at 898; (ECF Nos. 23, 42, 51). To the extent the  allegations are attributable [*36]  to prior defendants  instead of Wyndham, that conclusion will become  apparent through the discovery process. City of  Morristown, 206 F. Supp. at 1339. Further, Plaintiff does state allegations specific to at  least one of Wyndham's hotels: employees at the Super  8 broke up a fight between A.R.'s trafficker and a ""john""  when she called them for help. (ECF No. 1, ¶ 44).  Paragraph 47 alleges that at least one of ""A.R.'s  traffickers regularly requested that hotel staff notify him  should A.R. attempt to leave the hotels' premises."" (Id.,  ¶ 47). Finally, Plaintiff asserts that Wyndham maintained  ""policies and procedures that they knew or should have  known incentivized their employees to ignore obvious  signs of human trafficking, and even rent rooms to  known or suspected human traffickers, while they  continued to profit from sex trafficking."" (Id., ¶ 54). While  Plaintiff made some of these same allegations against  Page 11 of 11 the other defendants, this is not a situation where  ""[p]laintiff simply incorporated all of his previous  allegations by reference, set forth a list of the  defendants he intended to include in each count, and  then pled a series of legal conclusions."" Ingris v.  Borough of Caldwell, No. 14-855 (ES), 2015 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 74255, 2015 WL 3613499, at *8 (D.N.J. Jun. 9,  2015). Plaintiff named Wyndham in her Complaint and  made allegations specific [*37]  to its failure to prevent  her sex trafficking. Therefore, A.R. has pled sufficient  facts particular to Wyndham to meet Rule 8 notice  requirements for purposes of surviving this Motion to  Dismiss.",1

Nos. 146 (""LRep.""), 144 (""HRep.""), 149 (""GJoinRep."");  147 (""IJoinRep.""), 157 (""VJoinRep.""), 148 (""MRep.""),  145 (""CRep."")). Having read and considered the papers  filed in support of and in opposition to the motions, the  Court rules as follows. BACKGROUND Between 2012 and 2016, plaintiff B.J. was ""trafficked for  commercial sex and suffered severe physical [*4]  and  emotional abuse under duress"" at five California hotels:  (1) Studio 6 Concord (""Studio 6""), (2) San Ramon  Marriott, (3) Residence Inn Pleasant Hill — Concord  (""Residence  Inn  Concord""),  (4)  Clarion  Hotel  Concord/Walnut Creek (""Clarion Hotel""), and (5) the  Hilton Concord (collectively, ""the hotels""). (See SAC ¶¶  5, 7.) Studio 6 is operated by defendant Concord Inn  and Suites LP (""Concord Inn""), a franchisee of  defendant G6 Hospitality, LLC (""G6""). (See SAC ¶ 12.)  The San Ramon Marriott is owned and operated by  defendant Marriott International, Inc. (""Marriott""). (See  SAC ¶ 14.) The Residence Inn Concord is operated by  defendant Residence Inn by Marriott LLC (""Residence  Inn""), a franchisee of Marriott. (See SAC ¶ 15.) The  Clarion Hotel is operated by defendant Leisure Hotel  Group LLC (""Leisure""), a franchisee of defendant  Choice Hotels International, Inc. (""Choice""). (See SAC ¶  17.) The Hilton Concord is operated by defendant VWI  Concord LLC (""VWI""), a franchisee of defendant Hilton  Domestic Operating Company, Inc. (""Hilton""), and is  managed by defendant Interstate Hotels and Resorts,  Inc. (""Interstate""). (See SAC ¶¶ 19, 20.)                    ""B.J. met her trafficker through Facebook[,]"" (see SAC  ¶ [*5]  39), and, the trafficker, ""[u]nder the guise of  seeking a romantic partnership,"" promised B.J. ""shelter,  support, and a better life."" (See SAC ¶ 39.) In particular,  after ""learn[ing] [B.J.] had been trafficked as a minor and  was in the process of being evicted from her home,""  B.J.'s trafficker ""preyed on her vulnerable position and  coerced B.J. to meet him so he could help take care of  her and her kids while they fought the eviction."" (See  SAC ¶ 40.) ""What followed were years of physical,  sexual, and psychological abuse designed to control  B.J. and prevent her escape from sexual servitude  carried out at the hotels owned, operated, supervised,  and/or branded by defendants."" (See SAC ¶ 40.) ""B.J.'s  trafficker imposed a strict and cruel 'quota' system,""  whereby ""he forced B.J. to be sold to enough buyers  that she earned his stated daily minimum which varied  from day to day."" (See SAC ¶ 41.) If B.J. failed to meet  the daily quota, ""it rolled over to the next day,"" and she  ""was not allowed to leave the hotel rooms in which she  was trafficked for any reason, including to see and look  after her children and feed herself[.]"" (See SAC ¶ 41.) B.J. alleges defendants ""ignore[d] the open and  obvious [*6]  signs and presence of commercial sex  trafficking on their properties and in the hotels[,]""  including signs of B.J.'s trafficking (see SAC ¶ 3), took  no action to ensure B.J.'s safety (see SAC ¶¶ 51, 60,  62, 67, 70, 72, 78, 82, 86, 88, 90), and instead ""profited  from the sex trafficking of B.J. and knowingly or  negligently aided and engaged with her trafficker in his  sex trafficking venture"" by ""renting rooms to B.J.'s  traffickers"" that defendants ""kn[ew], or should have  known, that [the traffickers] were using . . . to harbor sex  trafficking victims, physically assault them, and subject  them to repeated exploitation as they [were] forced into  sexual servitude"" (see SAC ¶¶ 338-39). Based on the above allegations, B.J. asserts as against  each defendant causes of action under, respectively,  the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act  (""TVPRA""), 18 U.S.C. § 1595, and the California  Trafficking Victims Protection Act (""CVPTA""), Cal. Civ.  Code § 52.5. LEGAL STANDARD     Page 3 of 10 Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of  Civil Procedure ""can be based on the lack of a  cognizable legal theory or the absence of sufficient facts  alleged under a cognizable legal theory."" See Balistreri  v. Pacifica Police Dep't, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir.  1990). Rule 8(a)(2), however, ""requires only 'a short and  plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief.'"" See Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,  550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929  (2007) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). Consequently,  ""a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to  dismiss does not need detailed [*7]  factual allegations.""  See id. Nonetheless, ""a plaintiff's obligation to provide  the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more  than . . . a formulaic recitation of the elements of a  cause of action."" See id. (internal quotation, citation, and  alteration omitted). In analyzing a motion to dismiss, a district court must  accept as true all material allegations in the complaint  and construe them in the light most favorable to the  nonmoving party. See NL Indus., Inc. v. Kaplan, 792  F.2d 896, 898 (9th Cir. 1986). ""To survive a motion to  dismiss,"" however, ""a complaint must contain sufficient  factual material, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to  relief that is plausible on its face.'"" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556  U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868  (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). ""Factual  allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief  above the speculative level,"" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555,  and courts ""are not bound to accept as true a legal  conclusion couched as a factual allegation,"" see Iqbal,  556 U.S. at 678 (internal quotation and citation omitted). DISCUSSION By the instant motions, defendants seek an order  dismissing the above-titled action in its entirety, on the  asserted ground that B.J. has not stated a claim for  relief against them under either the TVPRA or the  CVPTA. A. CVTPA At the outset, plaintiff, in each of her oppositions to the  instant motions, [*8]  ""concedes"" the CVTPA claim  should be dismissed as against all moving and joining  defendants. (See LOpp. at 1 n.1, HOpp. at 1 n.2, VOpp.  at 1 n.2, MOpp. at 1 n.1, COpp. at 1 n.1.) Accordingly,  the Court turns to the question of whether B.J. has  stated a claim under the TVPRA. B. TVPRA The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act  ""creat[es] criminal offenses for forced labor and sex  trafficking[,]"" see J.C. v. Choice Hotels Intl.' Inc., 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at *3 (N.D.  Cal. Oct. 28, 2020); see also 18 U.S.C. § 1591, and, in  addition to the criminal prohibition, ""provides sex- trafficking victims with a civil cause of action,"" see Doe  #1 v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 723 (9th Cir.  2021), against both the perpetrator of the trafficking and  those who benefit therefrom, as follows: An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. See § 1595(a). To state a § 1595(a) claim under a beneficiary theory, a  plaintiff must allege facts plausibly establishing that the  defendant(s)  ""(1)  knowingly  benefitted  (2)  from  participation in a venture (3) that they knew or should  have known has engaged in trafficking the plaintiff."" See  J.M. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  190054, 2022 WL 10626493, at *2 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 18,  2022) (internal quotation and citation omitted). ""A                         Page 4 of 10 plaintiff may satisfy these elements in one of two ways.""  See H.G. v. Inter-Continental Hotels Corp., 489 F. Supp.  3d 697, 704 (E.D. Mich. 2020). Specifically, such  plaintiff may ""show that the defendant's own acts,  omissions, and state of mind establish each element[,]""  i.e., that such defendant is directly liable under the  statute, or ""impute to the defendant the acts, omissions,  and state of mind of the agent of the defendant[,]"" i.e.,  that the defendant is indirectly, or vicariously, [*10]   liable under the statute. See id. Here, B.J. advances both direct and vicarious theories  of liability under § 1595. In particular, she advances a  direct theory of liability against Marriott and the  Franchisee defendants, and vicarious theories of liability  against the Franchisor Defendants. Defendants contend  B.J. fails to allege sufficient facts to support the  elements of a TVPRA claim under any theory. The  Court first turns to B.J.'s direct beneficiary liability  claims. a. Direct Beneficiary Liability Claims Although the SAC contains allegations purporting to  establish the direct liability of every moving and joining  defendant as a beneficiary of B.J.'s trafficking, B.J., in  her oppositions to the Franchisor Defendants' motions  to dismiss, concedes her direct liability claims as to  Hilton, G6, and Choice (see HOpp. at 12:9-12, COpp. at  7:2-5) and also concedes her direct liability claim  against Marriott to the extent it acted as a franchisor of  the Residence Inn Concord (see MOpp. at 8:1-2). B.J.  maintains her direct liability claim against Marriott with  respect to the trafficking that allegedly occurred at the  San Ramon Marriott, however, because, according to  B.J., the San Ramon Marriott [*11]  was ""owned,  managed, and operated by the national corporation,  Marriott  International  .  .  .  [u]nlike  the  franchisor/franchisee relationship seen in other hotel  operations in this case[.]"" (See MOpp. at 9:26-27; see  also MOpp. at 8:1-2, SAC ¶ 56.) The Court considers  below B.J.'s remaining direct liability claims, namely,  said claim against Marriott and her claims against the  Franchisee Defendants.      1. Knowingly Benefit ""The 'knowingly benefit' element of section 1595 merely  requires that [the] [d]efendant knowingly receive a  financial benefit[,] and the rental of a room (or [the  defendant's] receipt of royalties for that rental)  constitutes a financial benefit from a relationship with  the trafficker sufficient to meet this element."" J.C., 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at *4  (internal quotation and citation omitted). Here, B.J. alleges, Marriott ""receives a percentage of  the gross room revenue for the money generated by the  operations of all Marriott hotels, including a percentage  of the rate charged for the rooms in which [B.J.] was  trafficked at the San Ramon Marriott[.]"" (See SAC ¶ 13- v; see also SAC ¶¶ 14-iv, 226, 338, 340.) B.J. makes  essentially the same allegations as to each of the  Franchisee defendants. (See SAC ¶¶ 15 iv-v, [*12]  17  iv-v, 19 vi-vii, 20 vi-vii.) The Court finds B.J.'s  allegations, at the motion to dismiss stage, sufficient to  satisfy this element. 2. Participation in a Venture ""The phrase 'participation in a venture' requires that the  [plaintiff] allege that [the defendants] took part in a  common undertaking or enterprise involving risk and  potential profit."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725; see  also J.M., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190054, 2022 WL  10626493, at *4 (same). Although plaintiffs are ""not  required to allege an overt act in furtherance of or actual  knowledge of a sex trafficking venture in order to  sufficiently plead [a] section 1595 civil liability claim[,]""  see B.M. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *3 (N.D. Cal.  July 30, 2020), they must, at the very least, ""connect the  dots between [the] alleged sex trafficking and [the]  defendants[,]"" see 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, [WL]  at *5, e.g., by a ""showing of a continuous business  relationship between the trafficker and the defendant  such that it would appear that the trafficker and the  defendant have established a pattern of conduct or  could be said to have a tacit agreement[,]"" see J.B. v.  G6 Hospitality, LLC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213,  2020 WL 4901196, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 20, 2020)  (internal quotation, citation, and alteration omitted); see  also, e.g., Ricchio v. McLean, 853 F.3d 553, 555 (1st  Cir. 2017) (finding participation sufficiently pled where  plaintiff alleged trafficker ""had prior commercial dealings  with [defendants], which the parties wished to reinstate  for profit""). Page 5 of 10 Here, B.J. alleges [*13]  Marriott and the Franchisee  Defendants each took part in a ""sex trafficking venture""  (see SAC ¶¶ 13(viii), 14(v), 15(vi), 17(vi), 19(viii),  20(viii)) or a ""venture which it [k]new or should have  known to engage in sex trafficking"" (see SAC ¶¶  13(vii)(I), 14(iii), 15(v), 17(v), 19(vii), 20(vii)). The  question thus presented is whether B.J. has plausibly  alleged that Marriott and the Franchisee Defendants  ""took part in the common undertaking of sex trafficking  with hotel employees, management, owners, and sex  traffickers."" See Red Roof, 21 F.4th at 726. The Court  finds B.J. has failed to do so. At the outset, the Court finds unpersuasive B.J.'s  attempt to frame the ""ventures"" in which Marriott and the  Franchisee  Defendants  allegedly  participated  as  ""general"" ventures, as opposed to ""sex trafficking""  ventures. (See MOpp. at 7:21-23, LOpp. at 6:16-19,  HOpp. at 8:15-18, VOpp. 7:12-15.) Although B.J., in her  oppositions, asserts said defendants each ""participated  in a general venture because they partook in a common  undertaking or enterprise . . . involving risk and potential  profit"" (see MOpp. at 7:23-24, LOpp. at 6:17-19, HOpp.  at 8:16-18, VOpp. at 7:13-15), namely, the management  and operation of the hotel properties [*14]  at which B.J.  was allegedly trafficked, such argument is at odds with  the SAC, which refers only to ""sex trafficking venture[s]""  (see, e.g., SAC ¶¶ 13(viii), 14(v), 15(vi), 17(vi), 19(viii),  20(viii)) or ventures defendants ""[k]new or should have  known to engage in sex trafficking"" (see e.g., SAC ¶¶  13(vi)(i), 13(vii)(i), 14(iii), 15(v), 17(v), 19(vii), 20(vii)). It  is well settled that B.J. may not amend the SAC through  her briefs. See Dang V. Samsung Elecs. Co., 2018 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 245196, 2018 WL 11348883, at *7 (N.D.  Cal. July 2, 2018) (holding ""it is axiomatic that the  complaint may not be amended by the briefs in  opposition to a motion to dismiss"" (internal quotation  and citation omitted)). Moreover, even if the Court were  to accept the ""general venture"" assertion articulated for  the first time in B.J.'s oppositions, such assertion would  not suffice to plead a violation of the TVPRA. See Red  Roof, 21 F.4th 725 (holding ""the third element of the  [plaintiff's] claim is that the venture in which the  defendant participated and from which it knowingly  benefited must have violated the TVPRA as to the  plaintiff""). Next, the Court finds B.J. has failed to plausibly  establish either Marriott's or the Franchisee Defendants'  participation in a sex trafficking venture. In that regard,  B.J. alleges hotel staff affirmatively [*15]  enabled her  trafficking by taking the following actions: housekeeping  staff at the at the San Ramon Marriott ""acknowledged  and aided [her] trafficking by providing additional  supplies to her trafficker"" (see SAC ¶ 61); front desk  staff at the Residence Inn Concord ""readily complied""  with her trafficker's request for an extra room key ""so he  could enter the room B.J. had locked him out o[f]"" (see  SAC ¶ 71); housekeeping staff at the Clarion Inn ""aided  B.J.'s trafficking by providing an inordinate amount of  supplies, including linens, sheets, and cleaning agents""  (see SAC ¶ 79); and front desk staff at Hilton Concord  ""informed the trafficker of B.J.'s location when she  attempted to hide from him and seek refuge from the  hotel"" (see SAC ¶ 89). Even assuming the conduct of  the above-referenced hotel staff could be imputed to  Marriott and the Franchisee Defendants as operators of  their respective hotel properties, such allegations do not  suggest hotel employees engaged in conduct outside  the scope of their ordinary responsibilities, let alone any  kind of ""tacit agreement"" with B.J.'s trafficker to engage  in the alleged sex trafficking venture. See J.B., 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213, 2020 WL 4901196, at *9. Under such circumstances, the Court [*16]  finds B.J.  has not plausibly alleged the ""participation in a venture""  element of her TVPRA claim. 3. Knew or Should Have Known the Venture was  Engaged in Trafficking To establish the knowledge element of her TVPRA  claim, B.J. need only assert facts supporting defendants'  constructive knowledge of the sex trafficking venture in  which it allegedly participated, i.e., that defendants  ""rented rooms to people they knew or should have  known were engaging in sex trafficking."" See B.M., 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214 at *5. The  Court finds B.J. has failed to make such a showing. B.J. alleges Marriott and the Franchisee Defendants  ignored various ""open and obvious signs"" of commercial  sex trafficking at their hotel properties (see, e.g., SAC  ¶¶ 3, 37), and, in support thereof, points to instances  wherein her trafficker abused her, or otherwise exhibited  evidence of her trafficking in public areas of defendants'  hotel properties (see, e.g., SAC ¶¶ 68, 74, 70, 72  (alleging B.J.'s trafficker, during stays at Residence Inn  Concord, ""collected payments from B.J.'s buyers in . . .  public areas""; ""repeatedly and conspicuously [stood]      Page 6 of 10 outside of B.J.'s window and filmed while she was  forced to perform commercial sex acts with buyers"";  ""knock[ed] [*17]  and hammer[ed] on the door for hours  on end demanding to be let in""; and, on one occasion,  ""dragged B.J. through the hotel, spat in her face, and  assaulted B.J. while she screamed""); ¶¶ 81-82 (alleging  B.J.'s trafficker, during stays at Clarion Hotel, ""often  physically attacked her in public areas of the hotel[,]""  which  assaults  were  ""coupled  with  degrading  commentary and criticism for not meeting her 'quota' of  buyers that day or meeting it too quickly[,]"" and, when  B.J. escaped her room, ""chased her in [hotel] public  space""); ¶ 90 (during stay at Hilton Concord, ""B.J.'s  trafficker grabbed B.J. . . . in the public common area of  the [hotel]"" in a manner that ""left visible, hand-shaped  bruises on B.J.'s arms"")). B.J. does not, however,  allege any hotel employees witnessed the above- described episodes, and, absent allegations to that  effect, fails to plausibly establish defendants ""should  have known"" of B.J.'s trafficking. See B.M., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214 at *5. Although the SAC does contain allegations that hotel  employees witnessed other events, those allegations,  as set forth below, likewise are insufficient to establish  defendants' actual or constructive knowledge of  trafficking. B.J. alleges, for example, that, ""[o]n [*18]  more than  one occasion, the San Ramon Marriott housekeeping  staff observed B.J.'s buyers violently attack her"" (see  SAC ¶ 62) and ""[o]n another occasion . . . witnessed a  buyer swiftly depart B.J.'s room in a state of complete  undress"" (see SAC ¶ 63); that ""housekeeping staff at  the Clarion Hotel . . . entered B.J.'s room while she was  being sold or preparing to be sold for commercial sex""  (see SAC ¶ 80); and that ""Hilton Concord's hotel  staff observed . . . B.J. being escorted into and out of  rooms by as many as eight buyers in any given day""  (see SAC ¶ 87). Such allegations, however, are equally  consistent with criminal conduct other than sex  trafficking, e.g., prostitution.          Where alleged conduct has ""two possible explanations,  only one of which can be true and only one of which  results in liability . . . [s]omething more is needed, such  as facts tending to exclude the possibility that the  alternative explanation is true."" See Petzschke v.  Century Aluminum Co. (In re Century Aluminum Co.  Sec. Litig.), 729 F.3d 1104, 1108 (9th Cir. 2013); see  also, e.g., J.B., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213, 2020 WL  4901196, at *11 (noting ""allegations that [TVPRA] victim  sought help and was seen by [hotel] employees with  physical injuries or other facts suggesting coercion allow  courts to infer that . . . hotel employees should have  known that human trafficking was [*19]  occurring, as  opposed to other criminal conduct""). Here, the  requisite  ""something  more""  is  missing,  and,  consequently, the Court finds B.J. has not plausibly  established Marriott's or the Franchisee Defendants'  actual or constructive knowledge of their participation in  a TVPRA-violating venture. Accordingly, B.J.'s direct TVPRA claims against Marriott  and the Franchisee Defendants are subject to dismissal. b. Vicarious Liability B.J. seeks to hold the Franchisor Defendants vicariously  liable for their franchisees' alleged violations of § 1595  under both actual and apparent agency theories. As to  Marriott, Choice, and Hilton, these claims necessarily  fail because, as set forth above, B.J. has failed to state  a claim for direct liability against their respective  franchisees. As discussed below, however, the Court  will afford B.J. leave to amend, and, in light thereof, the  Court next addresses the Franchisor Defendants'  arguments that they cannot be held vicariously liable                  Page 7 of 10 under the TVPRA for the conduct of their franchisees. At the outset, the Court finds unpersuasive the  contention by two of the Franchisor Defendants,  namely, Marriott and Choice, that, ""[b]ecause there is no  language in the TVPRA [*20]  extending secondary or  vicarious liability in this context, [B.J.'s] attempts to imply  vicarious liability . . . should be rejected."" (See CMot. At  14:24-26; see also MMot. at 17:28-18:5.) ""Although the  TVPRA does not explicitly address the issue of vicarious  liability, statutes are presumed not to disturb the  common law, unless the language of the statute is clear  and explicit for this purpose[,]"" see J.M., 2022 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 190054, 2022 WL 10626493, at *5 (internal  quotation and citation omitted), and where, as here, the  ""federal statute does not provide direction, the Ninth  Circuit has applied the federal common law of agency[,]""  specifically, ""agency principles from the Restatement  (Third) of Agency[,]"" see id.; see also, e.g., J.C., 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at *8  (rejecting argument that TVPRA does not provide for  agency liability; noting TVPRA's ""silen[ce] on the issue  of indirect liability . . . suggests that the federal common  law of agency should apply"" (internal quotation and  citation omitted)); A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide Holdings,  Inc., 484 F.Supp.3d 921, 939 (D. Or. 2020) (examining  ""vicarious liability [under the TVPRA] as a question of  federal common law""). The Court next addresses the Franchisor Defendants'  contention that B.J. has not pled facts showing an actual  or apparent agency relationship between the Franchisor  Defendants and their franchisees. i. Actual Agency [*21]  Relationship An  actual  agency  relationship  requires  ""(1)  a  manifestation by the principal that the agent shall act for  him; (2) that the agent has accepted the undertaking;  and (3) that there is an understanding between the  parties that the principal is to be in control of the  undertaking."" See Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Hynix  Semiconductor, Inc., 622 F. Supp. 2d 890, 899 (N.D.  Cal. 2009) (citing Restatement (Third) of Agency § 1.01  (2006)). When determining whether a principal has  sufficient authority to control the actions of an agent,  such that the principal may be held vicariously liable for  the agent's actions, the Ninth Circuit considers the  following non-exhaustive list of factors: 1) the control exerted by the employer, 2) whether  the one employed is engaged in a distinct  occupation, 3) whether the work is normally done  under the supervision of an employer, 4) the skill  required, 5) whether the employer supplies tools  and instrumentalities, 6) the length of time  employed, 7) whether payment is by time or by the  job, 8) whether the work is in the regular business  of the employer, 9) the subjective intent of the  parties, and 10) whether the employer is or is not in  business. See U.S. v. Bonds, 608 F.3d 495, 504 (9th Cir. 2010);  see also Restatement (Third) of Agency § 7.07 cmt. f  (identifying factors useful in evaluating whether principal  exercises sufficient control over agent's work to  establish [*22]  vicarious liability); Jones v. Royal Admin  Servs., Inc., 887 F.3d 443, 450 (9th Cir. 2018) (holding  ""the extent of control exercised by the principal is the  essential ingredient"" (internal quotations, citation, and  alteration omitted)). ""While a franchisor-franchisee relationship does not  necessarily create an agency relationship . . . a  franchisor may be held liable for a franchisee's actions if  the franchisor controls the franchisee's day-to-day  operations."" J.M., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190054, 2022  WL 10626493, at *5 (finding allegations in complaint  sufficient to show agency relationship where plaintiff  ""allege[d] defendants exercised control over the day-to- day operations of the hotels by hosting online bookings,  setting hotel employee wages, making employment  decisions for the hotels, providing standardized training  methods for hotel employees, and fixing hotel room rent  prices""). In particular, courts focus on the franchisor's  control over the ""instrumentality, the conduct, or the  specific aspect of the franchisee's business that caused  the alleged injury."" See Patterson v. Domino's Pizza,  LLC, 60 Cal. 4th 474, 498-499, 177 Cal. Rptr. 3d 539,  333 P.3d 723 (2014) (internal quotations and citations  omitted) (holding franchisor could not be held vicariously  liable for sexual harassment of franchisee employee  where franchisor lacked ""day-to-day authority over  matters  such  as  hiring,  firing,  direction,  supervision, [*23]  and discipline of the [harassing]  employee"" (internal quotation and citation omitted)). Here,  B.J.  alleges,  the  Franchisor  Defendants  ""exercise[] control over [their respective franchisees]  with respect to many issues regarding the day-to-day  operation of the property, but also specifically with  regard to the [franchisee's] policy on human trafficking""  (see SAC ¶¶ 257, 278, 299, 318), and, in support  thereof, states: [t]he agency relationship [between Franchisor  Page 8 of 10 Defendants and their respective franchisees] was  created through [Franchisor Defendants'] exercise  of an ongoing and systematic right of control over  [their] franchised hotels, beyond that which is  necessary  to  maintain  brand  standards,  by  [Franchisor Defendants'] operations, including the  means and methods of how [their] hotels conducted  business through one or more of the following  actions: (i) hosting online bookings on [their]  domain[s]; (ii) requiring [franchisee] hotels to use  [franchisors'] customer rewards program[s]; (iii)  setting employee wages; (iv) making employment  decisions; (v) advertising for employment; (vi)  sharing profits; (vii) standardized training methods  for employees; (viii) building and maintaining  . [*24]  . . facilit[ies] in a manner specified by the  owner; (ix) standardized or strict rules of operation;  (x) regular inspection of the facility and operation by  owner; (xi) fixing prices; or (xii) developing uniform  and consistent policies regarding the prevention of  commercial sex trafficking at brand properties,  including a risk management process to identify,  prevent, and mitigate risks for commercial sex  trafficking; and (xiii) other actions that deprive  [franchisee] hotels of independence in business  operations"" (see SAC ¶ 266; see also SAC ¶¶ 287, 306, 329). B.J.'s  ""use of the modifier 'one or more[,]'"" however, ""strips  these allegations of any force."" See H.G., 489  F.Supp.3d at 708; see also L.H. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 604  F. Supp. 3d 1346, 1362 (S.D. Fla. 2022) (same). ""While  [B.J.] lists [thirteen] ways [the Franchisor] Defendants  may exercise control,"" she ""does not say which one"" or  more of the listed forms of control the Franchisor  Defendants allegedly use, see H.G., 489 F.Supp.3d at  708 (emphases in original), and, consequently, her  allegations are ""far too uncertain and vague to plausibly  establish that [the Franchisor] Defendants controlled the  franchisees' operations to such an extent that the  franchisees were [Franchisor] Defendants' agents[,]""  see id. Similarly uncertain is the following allegation: [*25]  [The Franchisor Defendants} may exercise or could  have exercised control over [their franchisees] by:  (i) distributing information to assist employees in  identifying human trafficking; (ii) providing a  process for escalating human trafficking concerns  within the organization; (iii) requiring employees to  attend training related to human trafficking; (iv)  providing new hire orientation on human rights and  corporate responsibility; (v) providing training and  education to the local hotel through webinars,  seminars, conferences, and online portals; (vi)  developing and holding ongoing training sessions  on human trafficking; or (vii) providing checklists,  escalation protocols and information to property  management  staff;  or  tracking  performance  indicators and key metrics on human trafficking  prevention. (See SAC ¶ 265; see also SAC ¶¶ 286, 305, 325.) B.J.'s  use of ""may exercise"" or ""could have exercised"" control  again provides no meaningful description of any  Franchisor  Defendant's  involvement  in  the  daily  operations of its franchisee. Next, B.J.'s conclusory allegations that each Franchisor  Defendant ""controls the training, procedures, and  policies for its brand hotels"" (see [*26]  SAC ¶¶ 11(ii),  13(ii), 16(ii), 18(ii)) and requires franchises to comply  with its brand standards (see SAC ¶¶ 11(iii), 13(iii),  16(iii), 18(iii)) are, absent factual support, unavailing,  see Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. To the extent B.J. has  provided more detail, however (see SAC ¶¶ 284, 304,  327 (alleging franchisees are required to provide  specified services and products)), those allegations  ""tend[] to show that the franchisors' involvement was  limited to uniformity and standardization of the brand[,]""  see S.J. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 473 F. Supp. 3d  147, 156 (E.D.N.Y. 2020), which has been found  insufficient to establish the requisite degree of control  for an agency relationship. See id.; see also Cislaw v.  Southland Corp., 4 Cal.App.4th 1284, 1295, 6 Cal. Rptr.  2d 386 (1992) (holding ""[a] franchisor must be permitted  to retain such control as is necessary to protect and  maintain its trademark, trade name and good will,  without the risk of creating an agency relationship with                 Page 9 of 10 its franchisees""). Lastly, B.J.'s allegation that the Franchisor Defendants  may ""kick delinquent hotels out of [their] system[s]"" (see  SAC ¶¶ 272, 293, 312, 332) does not establish an  agency relationship, as ""[t]he right to terminate a  franchise agreement should the franchisee not follow  mandatory procedures is generally insufficient to  establish the requisite control[,]"" [*27]  see Nat'l Gear &  Piston, Inc. v. Cummins Power Sys., LLC, 975 F. Supp.  2d 392, 410 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (internal quotation and  citation omitted); see also, e.g., Taggart v. Rutledge,  657 F. Supp. 1420, 1440 (D. Mont. 1987), aff'd, 852  F.2d 1290 (9th Cir. 1988) (distinguishing franchisor's  ""right to terminate . . . franchise agreement if it  disapproves of [franchisee's] practices"" from ""evidence .  . . to support . . . claims that [franchisor] has any control  over [franchisee's] operations""); Cain v. Shell Oil Co.,  994 F. Supp. 2d 1251, 1255 (N.D. Fla. 2014) (holding  franchisor's ""right to terminate the agreement . . . in no  way  establishes  a  right  to  control  the  store's  operations""); In re Motor Fuel Temperature Sales  Practices Litig., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60879, 2012 WL  1536161, at *5 (D. Kan. Apr. 30, 2012) (holding ""rights  such as the right to enforce standards [and] the right to  terminate the agreement for failure to meet standards . .  . does not amount to sufficient control"" (internal  quotation and citation omitted)). Accordingly, to the extent B.J.'s claim against the  Franchisor Defendants is based on actual agency, such  claim is subject to dismissal. ii. Apparent Agency Relationship ""To establish liability based on apparent agency, plaintiff  must show manifestations by the [d]efendants led her to  believe that the hotels were agents of the respective               [d]efendants, and that [p]laintiff relied on that belief  when engaging with the hotels."" See A.B., 484  F.Supp.3d at 941 (citing Restatement (Third) of Agency  § 2.03 (2006)). Here, although B.J. alleges the  Franchisor Defendants hold out their franchisees to the  public [*28]  as possessing authority to act on their  behalf (see SAC ¶¶ 267, 288, 307, 330), B.J. has not  alleged she relied on any representation made by the  Franchisor Defendants. Moreover, as Marriott points  out, ""the factual core of the entire SAC—that criminals  trafficked B.J. in various hotels against her will—is  incompatible with the notion that B.J. somehow relied""  on the Franchisor Defendants' representations. (See  MRep. at 12:26-28 (internal quotation omitted)); see  also A.B., 484 F.Supp.3d at 942 (finding plaintiff ""failed  to allege the elements of apparent authority"" where  ""[p]laintiff's claim [was] premised on the notion that she  was taken to the hotels against her will to be sex  trafficked""). Accordingly, to the extent B.J.'s claim against the  Franchisor Defendants is predicated on apparent  agency, such claim is subject to dismissal.",1
B.M. v. Wyndham Hotels,"ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN  PART DEFENDANTS WYNDHAM HOTELS &  RESORTS, INC.'S AND CHOICE HOTELS  INTERNATIONAL, INC.'S MOTIONS TO DISMISS  WITH LEAVE TO AMEND; DENYING CHOICE [*2]   HOTELS INTERNATIONAL, INC.'S MOTION TO  STRIKE; ALLOWING PLAINTIFF TO PROCEED WITH  A PSEUDONYM; SETTING CASE MANAGEMENT  CONFERENCE ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2020 AT 10:00  A.M. Plaintiff B.M. is a survivor of sex trafficking. She brings  this action against three hotel chains alleging violation of  Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act  (""TVPRA"") for profiting from her sex trafficking. Before the Court are two motions: (1) Defendant  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.'s (""Wyndham"") Motion  to Dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  12(b)(6) at ECF 32 and (2) Defendant Choice Hotels  International, Inc.'s (""Choice"") Motion to Dismiss under  Rule 12(b)(6) and Motion to Strike under Rule 12(f) at  ECF 49. The Court heard oral arguments on July 9,  2020. For the reasons stated below, the Court GRANTS  IN PART and DENIES IN PART both Motions to  Dismiss WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. Choice's Motion to  Strike is DENIED. I. BACKGROUND Unless otherwise noted, the following factual allegations  are drawn from the Complaint, ECF 1 (""Compl.""). Defendant Wyndham is ""one of the largest hotel brands  Page 2 of 11 in the world with nearly 9,000 branded properties in  more than eighty (80) countries."" Compl. ¶ 10. Super 8®  by Wyndham (""Super 8"") is a Wyndham ""brand  property."" Id. ¶ 10(b). Defendant [*3]  Choice is another  large worldwide hotel brand. Id. ¶ 11. Clarion Inn is a  Choice ""brand property."" Id. ¶ 11(a). Defendant G6  Hospitality, LLC (""G6"") is ""one of the largest motel  brands in the world."" Id. ¶ 12. Motel 6 South (""Motel 6"")  is a G6 ""brand property."" Id. ¶ 12(a). Plaintiff B.M. was trafficked for commercial sex as  minor at hotels in Santa Clara County, California,  including Super 8, Clarion Inn, and Motel 6. Compl. ¶¶  4, 6. B.M. was first subjugated to sex trafficking in  2014 at Defendants' hotels when she was sixteen years  old. Compl. ¶ 67. For two years, B.M.'s traffickers rented  two adjoining rooms at a Super 8 hotel and Clarion Inn.  Id. ¶ 68. B.M. and other girls were forced to perform  commercial sex acts with ten to fifteen men a day. Id. A  procession of adult men would enter B.M.'s room, stay  for 15 minutes to an hour on average, and then leave.  Id. ¶ 71. The adult men arriving at B.M.'s room were  ""typically middle-aged men of a variety of races,"" and  none of them ""appeared to be age-appropriate  contemporaries of the minor Plaintiff."" Id. ¶ 72. None of  her visitors acted ""as though they were a guardian or  relative"" of B.M. Id. B.M. alleges that Defendants knew  or should [*4]  have known that B.M. was being sex  trafficked due to: (1) large amounts of used condoms,  empty lube bottles, and other sex related items in the  hotel room; (2) payments for the rooms in cash; (3)  B.M.'s physical appearance (malnourished, bruised, and  beaten); (4) a continuous procession of older men  entering and leaving B.M.'s room; and (5) excessive  requests for sheets, cleaning supplies, and room  service. Id. ¶ 74. B.M. brings this action pursuant to the TVPRA against  Defendants Wyndham, Choice, and G6 (together,  ""Defendants""). Compl. ¶¶ 2, 8. B.M. alleges that all  Defendants knowingly benefited from facilitating the sex  trafficking venture in which B.M. was victimized in  violation of the TVPRA. Id. ¶¶ 5, 8. As to Wyndham specifically, B.M. alleges that Wyndham  was on notice of repeated incidences of sex trafficking  occurring on its Super 8 branded properties. Id. ¶ 64 (a)- (d). According to Plaintiff, Wyndham failed to implement  its  anti-trafficking  policies  to  prevent  related  misconducts and continues to profit from the business  trafficking brings. Id. ¶ 64(f). The Complaint cites  multiple news reports and online reviews (for example  on www.tripadvisor.com) to allege Wyndham had  actual [*5]  or constructive knowledge of the sex  trafficking occurrences at its Super 8 branded hotels  throughout the country, and argues that Wyndham's  knowledge facilitated the sex trafficking of B.M. Id. ¶  64(n). B.M. further contends that Wyndham was in an  agency relationship with the Super 8 hotels through its  ""exercise of an ongoing and systematic right of control  over Super 8® hotels,"" including how the hotels  conducted daily business. Id. ¶ 64(k). Wyndham also  ""held out Super 8 branded hotels to the public as  possessing authority to act on its behalf."" Id. ¶ 64(l). Similarly, with regard to Choice, B.M. alleges that  Defendant Choice had constructive knowledge of sex  trafficking occurring on its branded hotel properties.  Compl. ¶ 65(c). According to Plaintiff, Choice knew or  should have known that Clarion Inn hotels where  Plaintiff was trafficked ""were in areas known for high  incidences of crime and prone to sex trafficking activity  on and around the hotel premises, including when  Plaintiff was trafficked."" Id. ¶ 65(d). Choice allegedly  failed to implement policies to protect B.M. from being  trafficked and continues to profit from the business sex  trafficking brings. Id. ¶ 65(a). B.M. alleges [*6]  that  Clarion Inn employees threatened to eject B.M. and her  traffickers, but never took further action. Id. ¶ 69.  Despite the threats, B.M. and other victims continued to  be trafficked on the premises. Id. B.M. also cites news  reports and online reviews on www.facebook.com to  allege Choice's actual or constructive knowledge of the  sex trafficking occurrences at its Clarion Inn hotels  throughout the country and argues that Choice's  knowledge facilitated the sex trafficking of B.M. Id. ¶  65(j). As to the relationship between Choice and the  Clarion Inn, B.M. contends that the two were in an  agency relationship through Choice's ""exercise of an  ongoing and systematic right of control over Clarion  Inn® hotels,"" including how Clarion Inn hotels conducted  daily business. Id. ¶ 65(g). Choice also ""held out Clarion  Inn® branded hotels to the public as possessing  authority to act on its behalf."" Id. ¶ 65(h). On January 29, 2020, B.M. filed this lawsuit against all  Defendants. Compl. On March 25, 2020, Wyndham filed  a motion to dismiss. Wyndham's Motion to Dismiss  Complaint Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (""Wyndham  Motion""), ECF 32. B.M. filed an opposition, and  Wyndham replied. ECF 59; ECF 62. On April 10, 2020,  Choice [*7]  filed a motion to dismiss and motion to  strike. Choice's Motion to Dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6),  Motion to Strike under Rule 12(f) (""Choice Motion""),  ECF 49. B.M. filed an opposition, and Choice replied.  ECF 58; ECF 60.

Motion to Dismiss ""A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil  Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon  which relief can be granted 'tests the legal sufficiency of  a claim.'"" Conservation Force v. Salazar, 646 F.3d  1240, 1241-42 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Navarro v. Block,  250 F.3d 729, 732 (9th Cir. 2001)). When determining  whether a claim has been stated, the Court accepts as  true all well-pled factual allegations and construes them  in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Reese v. BP  Exploration (Alaska) Inc., 643 F.3d 681, 690 (9th Cir.  2011). However, the Court need not ""accept as true  allegations that contradict matters properly subject to  judicial  notice""  or  ""allegations  that  are  merely  conclusory,  unwarranted  deductions  of  fact,  or  unreasonable inferences."" In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig.,  536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation  marks and citations omitted). While a complaint need  not contain detailed factual allegations, it ""must contain  sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a  claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'"" Ashcroft v.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d  868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.  544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). A  claim is facially plausible when it ""allows the court to  draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is  liable [*8]  for the misconduct alleged."" Id. On a motion  to dismiss, the Court's review is limited to the face of the  complaint and matters judicially noticeable. MGIC  Indem. Corp. v. Weisman, 803 F.2d 500, 504 (9th Cir.  1986); N. Star Int'l v. Ariz. Corp. Comm'n, 720 F.2d 578,  581 (9th Cir. 1983). In deciding whether to grant leave to amend, the Court  must consider the factors set forth by the Supreme  Court in Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9  L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962), and discussed at length by the  Ninth Circuit in Eminence Capital, LLC v. Aspeon, Inc.,  316 F.3d 1048 (9th Cir. 2009). A district court ordinarily  must grant leave to amend unless one or more of the  Foman factors is present: (1) undue delay, (2) bad faith  or dilatory motive, (3) repeated failure to cure  deficiencies by amendment, (4) undue prejudice to the  opposing party, or (5) futility of amendment. Eminence  Capital, 316 F.3d at 1052. ""[I]t is the consideration of  prejudice to the opposing party that carries the greatest  weight."" Id. However, a strong showing with respect to  one of the other factors may warrant denial of leave to  amend. Id. 2. TVPRA B.M. brings this action under Trafficking Victims  Protection Reauthorization Act (""TVPRA""). The TVPRA  has two provisions relevant to this case providing (1)  criminal penalties and (2) civil liability. The TVPRA provides for criminal penalties as set forth  in 18 U.S.C. § 1591: (a) Whoever knowingly— (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, ...  recruits, entices, harbors, transports, [*9]  provides,  obtains,  advertises,  maintains,  patronizes,  or  solicits by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting  the violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in  reckless disregard of the fact, that means of  force,  threats  of  force,  fraud,  coercion  described  in  subsection  (e)(2),  or  any  combination of such means will be used to  cause the person to engage in a commercial  sex act, or that the person has not attained the  age of 18 years and will be caused to engage  in a commercial sex act, shall be punished as  provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Section 1591 defines ""participation  in a venture"" as ""knowingly assisting, supporting, or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1),"" § 1591(e)(4),  and defines ""venture"" as ""any group of two or more  individuals associated in fact, whether or not a legal  entity,"" § 1591(e)(6). In Afyare, the Sixth Circuit agreed  with a district court that a defendant must ""actually  participate and commit some 'overt act' that furthers"" the  criminal ""aspect of the venture"" and that the TVPRA ""did  not criminalize"" any lesser conduct. U.S. v. Afyare, 632  Fed. App'x 272, 286 (6th Cir. 2016). Thus, Afyare court  required the prosecution ""to prove that [*10]  the  defendant actually participated in a sex-trafficking  venture."" Id. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *7 Page 4 of 11 TVPRA's civil liabilities are set forth under U.S.C. §  1595: An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). B.M. sues under 18 U.S.C § 1595. As a threshold matter, the Court addresses the parties'  dispute as to whether the ""participation in a venture""  definition from the criminal liability section of the  TVPRA, section 1591(e)(4), applies to the civil liability  section 1595 and concludes that it does not. The Court  agrees with the statutory construction analysis in M.A. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959,  969 (S.D. Ohio 2019), adopted by Judge Orrick in J.C.  v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., No. 20-CV-00155-WHO,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99252, 2020 WL 3035794, at *1,  n. 1 (N.D. Cal. June 5, 2020) that applying the  ""participation in a venture"" definition from the criminal  liability section of the TVPRA to the civil liability section  of the TVPRA, ""would void the 'should have known'  language in the civil remedy"" and ""[t]his violates the  'cardinal [*11]  principle of statutory construction that a  statute ought, upon the whole, to be construed so that, if  it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall  be superfluous, void, or insignificant."" J.C. v. Choice  Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99252, 2020 WL  3035794, at *1, n. 1 (quoting M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels &  Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 969). Accordingly,  B.M. is not required to allege an overt act in furtherance  of or actual knowledge of a sex trafficking venture in  order to sufficiently plead her section 1595 civil liability  claim. See A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., No. CV 19-5770,  455 F. Supp. 3d 171, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70644,  2020 WL 1939678, at *13 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 22, 2020)  (declining to apply the ""participation in a venture""  element from the criminal offense defined by Congress  in section 1591 to a claim or civil remedy). B. Discussion Wyndham and Choice argue that the Complaint's  allegations are insufficient for either direct or vicarious  liability. For the reasons discussed below, the Court  finds that the Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to  make a plausible claim for direct liability and grants  leave to amend for that theory. The Court is satisfied,  however, that Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts that when  taken as true, establish a plausible claim for an agency  theory of liability. 1. Plaintiff's Direct Liability Theory To state a claim under a section 1595(a) beneficiary  theory, B.M. must allege facts from which the Court can  reasonably [*12]  infer that Wyndham and Choice (1)  ""knowingly benefit[ted] financially or by receiving  anything of value""; (2) from participation in a venture; (3)  they ""knew or should have known has engaged in"" sex  trafficking. Wyndham and Choice argue that Plaintiff  fails to allege facts to support the three elements. The  Court recognizes that Wyndham and Choice are  unrelated companies and that Plaintiff must separately  allege facts against each defendant to support her  claims. Where the Court discusses the allegations  against both Defendants, it is based on the Court's  consideration of separate allegations similar in nature  and similar arguments proffered by each Defendant in  their motions. Combining the analysis of the issues is  solely for the purpose of brevity. There is no confusion  by the Court that Plaintiff must separately plead and  prove her case against Choice and Wyndham. a. Knowing financial benefit Wyndham and Choice challenge Plaintiff's allegations  that they knowingly benefited from her trafficking. See  Wyndham Motion at 6-7; Choice Motion at 10-12. They  argue that the ""'benefit' must derive directly from, and be  knowingly received in exchange for, participating in a  sex-trafficking venture."" [*13]  Wyndham Motion at 6.  According to Wyndham and Choice, receiving royalties  from independently owned and operated hotels is not  enough. Id. at 6-7. The Court disagrees. Wyndham and  Choice's  interpretation  of  the  statute  reads  a  requirement for ""actual knowledge"" of criminal sex  trafficking into the civil statute, reading out the ""should  have known"" language. The ""knowingly benefit"" element  of section 1595 ""merely requires that Defendant  knowingly receive a financial benefit"" and the rental of a  room (or Wyndham and Choice's receipt of royalties for  that rental) constitutes a financial benefit from a  relationship with the trafficker sufficient to meet this  element. H.H. v. G6 Hosp., LLC, No. 2:19-CV-755, 2019  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *2 (S.D.  Ohio Dec. 6, 2019). Here, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants received financial  benefits and other incidentals from continuously renting  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *10 Page 5 of 11 rooms to her traffickers. See Compl. ¶¶ 2, 10(h), 11(h),  82, 85. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants directly  benefited from the trafficking of Plaintiff on each  occasion they received payment for rooms that she was  being kept in at the Defendants' branded properties.  See id. ¶ 90. Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to meet  the ""knowingly benefitted"" element of a civil claim under  section 1595 of the [*14]  TVPRA at the motion to  dismiss stage. b. Participation in venture Having found that ""participation in venture"" under  section 1595 of the TVPRA does not require an ""overt  act"" of participation in the sex trafficking itself, the  Court must then examine whether Plaintiff has alleged  sufficient facts for a plausible claim that Wyndham and  Choice ""participated in a venture."" The Court finds that Plaintiff's direct liability theory  against Wyndham and Choice is insufficiently pled as to  the ""participation in venture"" element because the  Complaint fails to connect the dots between Plaintiff's  alleged sex trafficking and these Defendants. Plaintiff's  theory is that Defendants participated in a venture ""by  participating in, and facilitating, the harboring and  providing of B.M. for the purposes of commercial sex  induced by force, fraud, or coercion, by their acts,  omissions, and commissions."" Compl. ¶ 89. Plaintiff  argues that she alleges facts showing that Wyndham  and Choice ""participated in a venture"" because their  branded hotels (Super 8 and Clarion Inn) rented rooms  to people they knew or should have known were  engaged in sex trafficking. See Opp'n to Wyndham at  12 (citing Compl. ¶¶ 62-64), ECF 59. Plaintiff [*15]   further alleges — and the Court accepts as true at this  stage — that B.M. showed visible signs of being sex  trafficked (e.g., visible injuries and consistent foot  traffic from older men to her room) when she was at  one Super 8 and one Clarion Inn facility in San Jose,  California. Compl. ¶¶ 71-72, 74. In addition, Plaintiff  alleges that Clarion Inn employees threatened to eject  Plaintiff B.M. and her traffickers, but never took further  action. Id. ¶ 69. According to Plaintiff, Wyndham (the  ultimate parent company of the franchisor of the Super 8  hotel brand ) and Choice (the franchisor of the Clarion        Inn hotels ) were generally aware that acts of sex  trafficking take place in their franchisee hotels around  the United States. Id. ¶¶ 64, 65. While these allegation might be sufficient to state a  plausible claim against the specific hotels where Plaintiff  was trafficked (who Plaintiff has not sued), they do not  make a plausible claim that Wyndham and Choice  directly participated in a venture that trafficked B.M. at  the specific facilities she alleges her traffickers used. In  other words, the Complaint is devoid of any facts linking  these Defendants (Wyndham and [*16]  Choice) to  the sex trafficking of this Plaintiff (B.M.), and thus  fails to make a plausible claim for Wyndham's and  Choice's direct ""participation in venture"". c. Knew or should have known the venture was  engaged in trafficking While Defendants need not have actual knowledge of  the sex trafficking in order to have participated in the  sex trafficking venture for civil liability under the  TVPRA, Plaintiff must allege facts to support that  Wyndham and Choice, at the very least, rented rooms  to people they should have known were engaging in her  sex trafficking. And she has failed to do so here.  Plaintiff alleges the following facts, specific to her  trafficking: • ""For two years, Plaintiff's traffickers rented two  adjoining rooms at the Super 8 and Clarion Inn.  Plaintiff was one of several other girls that were  being simultaneously trafficked in these two  rooms. Each girl, including minor Plaintiff B.M.,  would be forced to perform commercial sex acts  with ten to fifteen men a day."" Compl. ¶ 68. • ""Clarion Inn employees threatened to eject                         2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *13 Page 6 of 11 Plaintiff B.M. and her traffickers, but never took  further action. Despite these threats, Plaintiff B.M.  and  several  other  victims  continued  to  be  trafficked [*17]  on the premises."" Compl. ¶ 69. • ""Day after day, a procession of adult men would  enter minor Plaintiff B.M.'s room, stay for 15  minutes to an hour on average, and then leave.""  Compl. ¶ 71. • ""The adult men arriving at the Plaintiff's room were  typically middle-aged men of a variety of races —  none of whom appeared to be age-appropriate  contemporaries of the minor Plaintiff. None of these  visitors acted in any manner as though they were a  guardian or relative of the minor Plaintiff."" Compl. ¶  72. Further, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants ""knew  or should have known that Plaintiff B.M. was being  trafficked for sex"" due to the following red flags: • large amounts of used condoms, empty lube  bottles, and other sex-related items in the hotel  room; • payments for the rooms in cash; • Plaintiff's physical appearance (malnourished,  bruised, beaten); • a continuous procession of older men entering  and leaving minor Plaintiff B.M.'s room; • excessive requests for sheets, cleaning supplies,  room service; and • the personal relationship between the front desk  employees and Plaintiff's traffickers. Compl. ¶ 74. But all these allegations support a theory  that  the  staff  at  the  franchisee  hotels  where  Plaintiff [*18]  was trafficked knew or should have  known about her trafficking. The Complaint fails to  allege facts as to how Wyndham (the ultimate parent  company of the franchisor) and Choice (the franchisor)  knew or should have known Plaintiff was being  trafficked. To support her direct liability theory, Plaintiff  must allege facts showing these Defendants knew or  should have known of her trafficking — and she fails to  do so in her Complaint. 2. Plaintiff's Agency Liability Theory Wyndham and Choice argue that Plaintiff's allegations  of vicarious liability are ""conclusory"" and should be  dismissed. Wyndham Motion at 9-10; see also Choice  Motion at 14- 17. The Court disagrees. Under California  law, ""a franchisee may be deemed to be the agent of  the franchisor."" Kuchta v. Allied Builders Corp., 21 Cal.  App. 3d 541, 547, 98 Cal. Rptr. 588 (Ct. App. 1971).  ""The general rule is that, if a franchise agreement gives  the franchisor the right of complete or substantial control  over the franchisee, an agency relationship exists.""  Walker v. Pac. Pride Servs., Inc., 341 F. App'x 350, 351  (9th Cir. 2009) (citing Kuchta, 21 Cal. App. 3d at 547). The Court is satisfied that Plaintiff has alleged sufficient  facts to establish a plausible claim for an agency  relationship between the franchisees and Wyndham and  Choice. For example, Plaintiff alleges that Wyndham  exercises ""ongoing and systemic right of control [*19]   over Super 8® hotels"" by a variety of actions including  ""setting  employee  wages,""  ""making  employee  decisions,"" and ""standardized training methods for  employees."" Compl. ¶ 64(k); id ¶ 65(g) (same  allegations as to Choice and Clarion Inn). While Plaintiff  might  ultimately  not  succeed  in  proving  these  allegations, they are enough to get her past the motion  to dismiss. Similarly, Plaintiff's allegations that Wyndham and  Choice are liable as joint employers of the franchisee  hotel employees survive the motion to dismiss. The joint  employer  doctrine  recognizes  that  ""even  where  business entities are separate, if they share control of  the terms or conditions of an individual's employment,  both companies can qualify as employers."" Johnson v.  Serenity Transp., Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8404,  2016 WL 270952, at *10 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 22, 2016). The  Ninth Circuit has adopted a four-part ""economic reality""  test  to  determine  when  the  employer-employee  relationship exists. See Bonnette v. California Health &  Welfare Agency, 704 F.2d 1465, 1470 (9th Cir. 1983).  These factors include whether the employer: ""(1) had  the power to hire and fire the employees, (2) supervised  and controlled employee work schedules or conditions  of employment, (3) determined the rate and method of  payment, and (4) maintained employment records."" Id.  Plaintiff alleges that Wyndham and Choice had control  over the hotels [*20]  where was trafficked by, for  example,  advertising  for  employment;  making  employment  decisions;  setting  employee  wages;  standardized  or  strict  rules  of  operation;  and  standardized training methods for employees. Compl. ¶  64(k); id ¶ 65(g). These alleged facts state a plausible  claim for joint employment. To be clear, the Court does not read section 1595 of  TVPRA  requiring  hotels  or  their  franchisors  to  affirmatively stop sex trafficking. See A.B. v. Marriott  Int'l, Inc., CV 19-5770, 455 F. Supp. 3d 171, 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 70644, 2020 WL 1939678, at *8 (E.D. Pa.  Apr. 22, 2020) (""We do not read the Act as requiring  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *16 Page 7 of 11 hotels (and other businesses or professions possibly  earning money from trafficking) to affirmatively stop the  trafficking.""). But the Court finds that Plaintiff has  alleged sufficient facts to support a plausible claim that  Wyndham and Choice received financial benefits from a  venture they vicariously participate in (through their  franchisees) that the franchisees should have known  was engaged in sex trafficking of B.M. in violation of  section 1595. Choice and Wyndham argue that ""[t]here is no case law  that supports the idea that a simple agency relationship  [...] is sufficient to create liability under the TVPRA.""  Choice Motion at 14; see also Wyndham Reply at 6, n.5,  ECF 62. The Court disagrees. [*21]  For example, in  A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., Judge Kearney held: We agree A.B. does not plead facts after two  attempts allowing us to reasonably infer Marriott  knew of sex trafficking victimizing her. But A.B.  sufficiently pleads specific facts from which we can  reasonably infer Marriott, under an actual agency  theory subject to discovery, knowingly benefitted  from participating in a venture which it should have  known engaged in her trafficking. This is all  Congress requires a victim to plead. A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70644,  2020 WL 1939678, at *1. Wyndham acknowledges this  holding but disagrees with it. See Wyndham Reply at 6  n. 2 (""The court in A.B. denied a motion to dismiss by a  hotel franchisor on the narrow grounds that the  complaint alleged an agency relationship between the  franchisor and independent third-party franchisees.  A.B., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70644, 2020 WL 1939678,  at *19. The TVPRA, however, does not provide for  secondary liability.""). Neither Wyndham nor Choice has  provided any authority to support the assertion or  explain why the well-established agency liability is  inapplicable to TVPRA claims. See M.A. v. Wyndham  Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 972 (denying  motion to dismiss allegations of vicarious liability under  agency theory for a TVPRA civil claim). 3. Shotgun Pleading Wyndham and Choice contend that the Complaint [*22]   is an impermissible ""shotgun"" pleading. Wyndham  Motion at 3-4; Choice Motion at 4-6. Shotgun pleadings  are pleadings that overwhelm defendants with an  unclear mass of allegations and make it difficult or  impossible for defendants to make informed responses  to the plaintiff's allegations."" Sollberger v. Wachovia  Sec., LLC, No. SACV 09-0766AGANX, 2010 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 66233, 2010 WL 2674456, at *4 (C.D. Cal. June  30, 2010). The Court is not persuaded that the  Complaint in this case is a shotgun pleading. Although the Complaint contains many allegations that  seem to relate to the hospitality industry in general, it  also includes numerous factual allegations specific to  each Defendant. See e.g., Complaint ¶¶ 64 (allegations  specific to Wyndham); 65 (allegations specific to  Choice). Plaintiff identifies the specific hotel locations  where she was allegedly trafficked and ties those  locations to each Defendant. See Compl. ¶¶ 10; 11.  While Plaintiff's allegations regarding her experience at  each hotel is not a model for specificity, she does allege  facts as to each Defendant. See e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 68  (""For two years, Plaintiff's traffickers rented two  adjoining rooms at the Super 8 and Clarion Inn. Plaintiff  was one of several other girls that were being  simultaneously [*23]  trafficked in these two rooms."");  69 (""Clarion Inn employees threatened to eject Plaintiff  B.M. and her traffickers, but never took further action."").  Thus, the Complaint cannot be fairly categorized as an  ""everyone did everything"" pleading. Destfino v. Reiswig,  630 F.3d 952, 958 (9th Cir. 2011). Choice argues that  ""Plaintiff incorporates every prior allegation into her  claim."" But ""a complaint does not employ impermissible  shotgun pleading just because it re-alleges by reference  all of the factual paragraphs preceding the claims for  relief."" Espinosa v. Bluemercury, Inc., No. 16-CV-07202- JST, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41885, 2017 WL 1079553,  at *5 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 22, 2017). As noted at the Hearing, the Court is concerned that  B.M.'s allegations against the three Defendants are  factually independent because the Defendants (all  independent public companies) are not alleged to have  any connection with each other — other than the fact  that B.M was allegedly trafficked in three separate  franchisee hotels related to each Defendant. The Court  also recognizes the practical issues raised by Choice.  For example, Plaintiff fails to allege when she visited  each location at issue, how frequently she visited, and  for what period of time. See Choice Motion at 6. But the  Court is not persuaded that these concerns warrant a  dismissal of [*24]  the entire Complaint as ""shotgun  pleading"", but instead can be resolved through case  management conferences and discovery motions. That  said, because the Court is granting Plaintiff leave to  amend her Complaint, she is instructed to add as many  details as possible about her stays at each location. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *20 Page 8 of 11 III. CHOICE'S MOTION TO STRIKE Choice moves to strike paragraphs 20 to 61 in the  Complaint  because  they  contain  ""salacious  and  impertinent details[.]"" Choice Motion at 6. Choice  contends that the allegations are not related to the facts  in controversy and will only serve to prejudice Choice  and confuse the issues. Id. B.M. responds that the  challenged paragraphs contain contextual and factual  allegations and provide support as to Choice's  constructive notice of the sex trafficking issues on its  properties. Opp'n to Choice at 20-21, ECF 58. B.M. also  contends that Choice fails to prove that it is prejudiced  by the factual allegations. Id. The Court finds that the  challenged paragraphs provide relevant background  information for B.M.'s claims against Defendants, as  uncomfortable as that may be for Choice, and thus,  DENIES Choice's Motion to Strike. A. Legal Standard Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12(f) permits a  court to ""strike [*25]  from a pleading an insufficient  defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or  scandalous matter."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). A matter is  impertinent if it consists of statements that do not  pertain to and are not necessary to the issues in  question. Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty, 984 F.2d 1524, 1527  (9th Cir.1993), rev'd on other grounds, 510 U.S. 517,  114 S. Ct. 1023, 127 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1994).  ""Scandalous"" under Rule 12(f) ""generally refers to any  allegation that unnecessarily reflects on the moral  character of an individual or states anything in repulsive  language that detracts from the dignity of the court.""  Gallegos v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of San  Francisco, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74207, 2016 WL  3162203, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Jun. 7, 2016) (citations  omitted). ""Scandalous"" has also been defined as  allegations that cast a ""cruelly derogatory light"" on  someone. Holmes v. Elec. Document Processing, Inc.,  966 F. Supp. 2d 925, 938 (N.D. Cal. 2013) (citations  omitted). Motions to strike are generally disfavored and ""should  not be granted unless the matter to be stricken clearly  could have no possible bearing on the subject of the  litigation."" Platte Anchor Bolt, Inc. v. IHI, Inc., 352  F.Supp.2d  1048,  1057  (N.D.Cal.2004)  (citations  omitted). A court should not strike allegations supplying  background or historical material unless it is unduly  prejudicial to the opponent. See LeDuc v. Ky. Cent. Life  Ins. Co., 814 F.Supp. 820, 830 (N.D.Cal.1992). Indeed,  if there is any doubt whether the challenged matter  might bear on an issue in the litigation, the motion to  strike should be denied, and assessment of the  sufficiency of the allegations left for adjudication on the  merits. Rees v. PNC Bank, N.A., 308 F.R.D. 266, 271  (N.D. Cal. 2015). A court should [*26]  view the pleading  in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Id.  Whether to grant a motion to strike lies within the sound  discretion of the district court. Id. B. Discussion While many of the challenged paragraphs are not  directly relevant to B.M.'s claims against Defendants,  they nonetheless supply information regarding the  general issue of sex trafficking and the role of the  hospitality industry. See Compl. ¶¶ 20-61. Viewing the  pleading in the light most favorable to B.M., some of the  paragraphs Choice seeks to strike provide background  information as to Choice's general policy in dealing with  sex trade and its constructive knowledge about such  issues. See e.g., id. ¶¶ 52-53. The background  information is therefore related to the claims against  Choice and helps with a fuller understanding of the  Complaint as a whole. See Sec. & Exch. Comm. v.  Strong Inv. Mgmt., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 232678, 2018  WL 8731559, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 9, 2018) (denying  motion to strike because the challenged allegations  provide some historical background and context to the  claims at issue and they give a full understanding when  read with the complaint as a whole). Moreover, the  challenged paragraphs are not unduly prejudicial to  Choice. Even though the background information may  portray Choice in an unfavorable [*27]  way, Choice will  have opportunities to challenge the allegations by  evidence at a later stage in the proceedings. See Kaiser  Found. Hosp. v. Cal. Nurses Ass'n, 2012 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 16563, 2012 WL 440634, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Feb.  10, 2012) (denying motion to strike even though the  background information portrayed the defendant in an  unfavorable light because defendants would have  opportunities to challenge the allegations as the case  proceeds). Choice also claims that paragraphs 20 to 61 should be  stricken because they are impertinent and scandalous.  Choice Motion at 6. The Court disagrees. As discussed  above, the challenged paragraphs are not impertinent  because they provide relevant background information.  Moreover,  the  challenged  allegations  are  not  scandalous because they do not go into ""salacious"" or  ""needless details."" See Compl. ¶¶ 20-61; Gallegos,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *24 Page 9 of 11 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74207, 2016 WL 3162203, at *3  (holding that the challenged allegations regarding  defendant's long history of sexually harassing conducts  were not scandalous within the meaning of Rule 12(f)  because they did not go into ""salacious"" or ""needless  details"" even though the topic is naturally sensitive and  unseemly). Although the allegations in paragraphs 20- 61 of the Complaint might portray Defendants in an  unfavorable way, they do not rise to the level of being  ""cruelly derogatory."" See Holmes, 966 F. Supp. 2d at  938 (holding that [*28]  the allegations were not  scandalous because they did not rise to the level of  casing the defendant in a ""cruelly derogatory light"").  Therefore, Choice's Motion to Strike is DENIED. IV. B.M.'S USE OF PSEUDONYM In her Complaint, B.M. requests that the Court grant a  protective order and permit her to proceed under a  pseudonym. Compl. ¶ 9(b). B.M. agrees to reveal her  identity to Defendants for the limited purposes of  investigating her claims once the parties have entered  into a protective order. Id. ¶ 9(f). B.M. seeks redactions  of her personal identifying information from the public  docket and assurances that Defendants will not use or  publish her identity in a manner that will compromise her  personal life or future employment prospects. Id. In its motion, Choice argues that B.M. is not entitled to  proceed anonymously in court proceedings because  she has not demonstrated sufficient grounds for her  request and has not filed a motion for a protective order  and leave to proceed anonymously in this Court. Choice  Motion at 18-19. Nevertheless, Defendants do not  oppose B.M. proceeding by pseudonym for purposes of  pre-trial public filings only. Joint Case Management  Statement at 9; ECF 71. In [*29]  her opposition, B.M.  contends that pseudonym status is warranted due to the  sensitive nature of the issues and the risk of harm to her  as a victim of sex trafficking. Opp'n to Choice at 22. In  addition, prejudice to Choice can be reduced as B.M.  will agree to reveal her identity to Choice, and the public  interest will not be threatened because the bulk of the  case will still be on public record. Id. at 22-23. The Court  permits B.M.'s use of pseudonym in this case because  her need for anonymity outweighs the risk of prejudice  to Choice at the current stage and the public interest in  knowing her identity. A. Legal Standard Rule 10(a) commands that the title of every complaint  ""include the names of all the parties."" Fed. R. Civ. P.  10(a). However, the Ninth Circuit allows parties to use  pseudonyms  under  special  circumstances  where  nondisclosure of the party's identity is necessary to  protect a person from harassment, injury, ridicule or  personal embarrassment. Does I through XXIII v.  Advanced Textile, 214 F.3d 1058, 1067-68 (9th Cir.  2000) (citations omitted). A court must balance the need  for anonymity against the risk of prejudice to the  opposing party and the public's interest in knowing the  party's identity. Jane Roes 1-2 v. SFBSC Mgmt., LLC,  77 F. Supp. 3d 990, 993 (N.D. Cal. 2015); Does I  through XXIII, 214 F.3d at 1068. Applying the balancing  test, courts have permitted [*30]  plaintiffs to use  pseudonyms in three situations: (1) when identification  creates a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm; (2)  when anonymity is necessary to preserve privacy in a  matter of sensitive and highly personal nature; and (3)  when the anonymous party is compelled to admit his or  her intention to engage in illegal conduct. Jane Roes 1- 2, 77 F. Supp. 3d at 993 (citing Does I through XXIII,  214 F.3d at 1068). And the Court must determine the precise prejudice at  each stage of the proceedings to the opposing party,  and whether proceedings may be structured so as to  mitigate that prejudice. Does I through XXIII, 214 F.3d at  1068. Finally, the Court must decide whether the  public's interest in the case would be best served by  requiring that the litigants reveal their identities. Id. at  1069. In cases where plaintiff has demonstrated a need  for anonymity, the district court should use its powers to  manage pretrial proceedings under Rule 16(b) and to  issue protective orders limiting disclosure of the party's  name under Rule 26(c) ""to preserve the party's  anonymity to the greatest extent possible without  prejudicing the opposing party's ability to litigate the  case."" Id.; Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b); Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c). B. Discussion The Court permits B.M. to use a pseudonym because  B.M.'s need for anonymity outweighs [*31]  the risk of  prejudice to Defendants at the current stage of this case  and the public interest in knowing the B.M.'s identity.  First, B.M.'s need for anonymity weighs heavily in favor  of granting such permission. B.M. is a victim of sex  trafficking, she was trafficked when she was a minor,  and this case involves the disclosure of sensitive and  highly personal information. See Compl. ¶ 9(d); Opp'n to  Choice at 22. The Court finds it necessary to protect  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, *27 Page 10 of 11 B.M.'s privacy in this case. See Doe v. Penzato, No.  CV10-5154 MEJ, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51681, 2011  WL 1833007, at *5 (N.D. Cal. May 13, 2011) (granting  the plaintiff's petition to proceed anonymously where  she alleged she was a victim of human trafficking,  forced labor, and sexual battery); Doe v. Kuo Huei Lee,  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20686, 2014 WL 630936, at * 2  (N.D. Cal. Feb. 18, 2014) (""[B]ecause being taken  advantage of in a sexual manner as a minor is of a  highly sensitive and personal nature, cases of involving  such an issue have often been found to allow for the  use of a fictitious name.""). On the other hand, there is a low risk of prejudice to  Defendants at the current stage, and the public interest  is better served if B.M. is allowed to proceed  anonymously. Prejudice to Defendants is minimal  because B.M. will agree to reveal her identity for  purposes [*32]  of investigating her claims. See Opp'n to  Choice at 24; Compl. ¶ 9(f). In addition, the public  interest in knowing the parties' identities is not  threatened where, as here, there is nothing about the  Plaintiff's identity which makes it ""critical to the working  of justice"" and the basic facts of the case will be on  public record. See Jane Roes 1-2, 77 F. Supp. 3d at  997 (holding that the public interest is not threatened  because there was nothing important about the plaintiff's  identity alone and the facts of the case would be on  public record). Indeed, allowing victims of sexual assault  to proceed anonymously serves strong public interest  because other victims will not be deterred from reporting  such crimes. See Heineke v. Santa Clara Univ., No. 17- CV-05285-LHK, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201163, 2017  WL 6026248, at *23 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 5, 2017) (holding  that the public interest is served in allowing an alleged  victim of sexual harassment to be sued under  pseudonym to avoid deterring other victims from coming  forward). Therefore, B.M. is permitted to proceed  anonymously  because  her  need  for  anonymity  outweighs the risk of prejudice to Defendants and the  public interest in knowing her identity. Choice also argues that B.M. has not filed a motion for  protective  order  and  leave  to  proceed  anonymously [*33]  in this Court. However, the Ninth  Circuit does not require a plaintiff to obtain leave to  proceed anonymously before filing an anonymous  pleading. Doe v. Penzato, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51681,  2011 WL 1833007, at *4 (""Although some Circuits  require plaintiffs to obtain leave of the court before filing  an anonymous pleading, the Ninth Circuit does not."");  see also Doe v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of Am., 164 F.  Supp. 3d 1140, 1144 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (holding that a  plaintiff is not required to obtain leave to proceed  anonymously before filing an anonymous pleading  because any attempt to proceed anonymously would be  pointless if a plaintiff had to use his or her real name  first). B.M. properly requested permission to proceed  anonymously in the Complaint, and the Court hereby  grants her request. See Compl. ¶ 9. In addition, the Court recognizes that it is required to  determine the precise prejudice at each stage of the  proceedings to the opposing party. Does I through XXIII,  214 F.3d at 1068. The Court notes that Defendants do  not oppose B.M.'s use of pseudonym for purposes of  pre-trial  public  filing  at  this  time.  Joint  Case  Management Statement at 9. The dispute at the current  stage is therefore resolved, and any discovery issues (if  presented at all) are matters for another day. V. ORDER For the foregoing reasons: (1) Wyndham's Motion to Dismiss at ECF 32 is  GRANTED [*34]  IN PART WITH LEAVE TO  AMEND as to Plaintiff's direct liability theory and  DENIED IN PART as to Plaintiff's agency liability  theory. (2) Choice's Motion to Dismiss at ECF 49 is  GRANTED IN PART WITH LEAVE TO AMEND as  to Plaintiff's direct liability theory and DENIED IN  PART as to Plaintiff's agency liability theory. (3) Choice's Motion to Strike at ECF 49 is DENIED. (4) Plaintiff may continue to use a pseudonym in  her public filings. Any amended complaint must be filed within 30 days of  this Order. Plaintiff may only amend her claims and shall  not add new claims or new parties without leave of  Court. The Court requests that the chambers copy of  any amended complaint be a redlined version, in color.  Wyndham and Choice must respond to the amended  complaint no later than 30 days from its filing. If  Wyndham and Choice move to dismiss Plaintiff's  amended complaint, they must share the allowed page  limits (25, 25, 15) as set out by the Court's Standing  Order Re Civil Cases. A further case management  conference is hereby set on Friday, September 18,  2020 at 10:00 a.m. IT IS SO ORDERED. Dated: July 30, 2020 2020 U.S. Dist.

Background [*2]  Bacon alleges that various John Does, Derrik Marshall  (his federal probation officer), and Judicial Supervision Services (JSS, a  private contractor that collects urine samples for probation services) violated his rights  under the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United  States Constitution. In particular, Bacon alleges that Marshall held a grudge against him  because of his involvement in a prior lawsuit that made it more difficult for the  government to protect the identity of its cooperators.2 According to Bacon, Marshall said  Page 2 of 4 that he would make sure Bacon had a ""difficult time"" and ""would not be fair with  [Bacon]."" R. 51 (capitalization standardized). Bacon further alleges that  Marshall caused him to become homeless and then had him arrested because  he was homeless. He also alleges that Marshall fabricated probation violations as  pretext for Bacon's arrest and lied to a magistrate judge about Bacon's conduct so that  Bacon would remain 2This allegation is presumably related to proceedings in  which Bacon sought to unseal the supplement to his  plea agreement because it stated that he had not  cooperated with the government. See United States v.  Bacon, 950 F.3d 1286, 1290 (10th Cir. 2020). The  district court refused to unseal the supplement, citing a  local rule requiring all plea supplements be [*3]  sealed  to create ""uniformity,"" ostensibly to protect the identity of  cooperators. Id. (quoting R. vol. 1, 45). On appeal, we  vacated and remanded the district court's decision after  concluding that it plainly erred by ignoring the common- law presumption of access to judicial records and failing  to make case-specific findings to support sealing. Id. at  1293, 1297. 2 Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 3 incarcerated. In addition, Bacon alleges that JSS, with  Marshall's approval, committed ""a form of sexual assault  and a form of rape"" when it forced him to remove his  clothing before providing a urine sample. Id. at 53  (capitalization standardized). A magistrate judge screened Bacon's in forma pauperis  (IFP) complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B) and  recommended dismissing it sua sponte for failure to  state a claim. The magistrate judge determined that  because Bacon alleged defendants acted under color of  federal law, not state law, his claims were properly  brought under Bivens, not § 1983. And the magistrate  judge further recommended dismissing those Bivens  claims because (1) Bacon's allegations that Marshall  committed perjury to revoke Bacon's supervised release  constituted a new Bivens context [*4]  not previously  recognized by the Supreme Court and (2) Bacon's  ability to bring suit against Marshall under the Federal  Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. § 2674, and the  ""potential interference with the important work of  supervising officers"" counseled against extending the  Bivens remedy. R. 128. The magistrate judge also  concluded that Bacon's Bivens claims against JSS-a  private entity acting under color of federal law-was  precluded by Supreme Court precedent declining to  extend the Bivens remedy to actions against private  federal contractors. See Corr. Servs. Corp. v.Malesko,  534 U.S. 61, 66 (2001). The district court adopted the magistrate judge's report  and recommendation in its entirety over Bacon's  objections. And it later denied Bacon's reconsideration  motion, reiterating that Bacon could not rely on § 1983  to sue JSS or any individual 3 Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 4 defendants because he alleged no facts to support the  proposition that defendants had acted under color of  state law. The district court also noted Bacon failed to  state a claim under the FTCA because he had not  presented his claims to the appropriate federal agency  first. Bacon appeals. Analysis ""We review de novo the district court's decision to  dismiss an IFP complaint under [*5]  28 U.S.C. §  1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim."" Kay v.  Bemis, 500 F.3d 1214, 1217 (10th Cir. 2007). ""In  determining whether a dismissal is proper, we must  accept the allegations of the complaint as true and  construe  those  allegations,  and  any  reasonable  inferences that might be drawn from them, in the light  most favorable to the plaintiff."" Gaines v. Stenseng, 292  F.3d 1222, 1224 (10th Cir. 2002). ""Dismissal of a pro se  complaint for failure to state a claim is proper only  where it is obvious that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the  facts he has alleged and it would be futile to give him an  opportunity to amend."" Curley v. Perry, 246 F.3d 1278,  1281 (10th Cir. 2001) (quoting Perkins v. Kan. Dep't of  Corrs., 165 F.3d 803, 806 (10th Cir. 1999)). On appeal, Bacon asserts simply that he should be able  to sue Marshall and JSS, but he does nothing to  develop that position. At best, he seeks to incorporate  Page 3 of 4 by reference the arguments he raised below, which we  do not permit. See Fed. R. App. P. 28.3(B) (stating that  ""[i]ncorporating by reference portions of lower court or  agency briefs or pleadings is disapproved and does not  satisfy"" our briefing 4 Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 5 requirements). Bacon has therefore waived any  challenge to most of the district court's rulings, including  that his § 1983 claims fail for lack of state action and  that his Bivens claim against JSS is barred by binding  Supreme Court precedent. [*6]  SeeUnited States v.  Fisher, 805 F.3d 982, 990-91 (10th Cir. 2015) (finding  argumentswaived  through  inadequate  appellate  briefing). The only argument even passingly developed  in Bacon's brief is his position that the district court erred  in holding that the FTCA provided an alternative remedy  counseling against extending Bivens to his claims  against Marshall, so this is the only argument we will  consider here. In Bivens, the Supreme Court recognized a cause of  action against federal officials for alleged Fourth  Amendment violations. See Egbert v. Boule, 596 U.S.  482, 490 (2022). And ""[o]ver the following decade, the  Court twice again fashioned new causes of action under  the Constitution-first, for a former congressional staffer's  Fifth Amendment sex-discrimination claim; and second,  for a federal prisoner's inadequate-care claim under the  Eighth Amendment."" Id. at 490-91 (citations omitted).  However, ""[s]ince these cases, the Court has not  implied  additional  causes  of  action  under  the  Constitution."" Id. at 491. The Supreme Court has instructed that when faced with  Bivens claims, lower courts should engage in a two-step  inquiry, as the district court did here. The first question  is whether the case presents a new context in that it is  ""'meaningful[ly]' different from the three cases in which  the Court has implied a damages action."" Id. at 492  (alteration in original) [*7]  (quoting Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582  U.S. 120, 139 (2017)). ""Second, if a claim arises in a  new context, a Bivens remedy is unavailable if there 5 Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 6 are 'special factors' indicating that the [j]udiciary is at  least arguably less equipped than Congress to 'weigh  the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to  proceed.'"" Id. (quoting Ziglar, 582 U.S. at 136).  Moreover, the Supreme Court has explained ""those  [two] steps often resolve to a single question: whether  there is any reason to think that Congress might be  better equipped to create a damages remedy."" Id. Here, the district court concluded that Bacon's  allegations that Marshall committed perjury to revoke  Bacon's supervised release were ""different in a  meaningful way from previous Bivens cases"" because  he did not allege unreasonable search and seizure, sex  discrimination, or deliberate indifference to medical  needs. R. 128; see also Ziglar, 582 U.S. at 139. Bacon  does not purport to challenge the conclusion that this is  a new Bivens context, and other circuits have held as  much in similar circumstances. See Xi v. Haugen, 68  F.4th 824, 834 (3d Cir. 2023) (finding new context  where plaintiff ""allege[d] that federal agents made false  statements and material omissions of exculpatory  evidence [*8]  that led the [g]overnment to investigate,  arrest, and prosecute him""); Cantú v. Moody, 933 F.3d  414, 423 (5th Cir. 2019) (finding new context where  plaintiff alleged that officers ""falsified affidavits""). Given  Bacon's waiver of this issue and this persuasive circuit  authority, we agree with the district court that this is a  new Bivens context. As to special factors counseling hesitation before  expanding Bivens to this new context, we recently  observed that ""expanding Bivens is not just 'a  disfavored judicial activity,' it is an action that is  impermissible in virtually all circumstances."" 6 Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 7 Silva v. United States, 45 F.4th 1134, 1140 (10th Cir.  2022) (quotingZiglar, 582 U.S. at 135). A court will not  expand Bivens if ""Congress is better positioned to  create remedies in the"" new context at hand or if ""the  [g]overnment already has provided alternative remedies  that protect plaintiffs."" Id. at 1141. Here, the district court  found that both special factors applied, reasoning that  Congress was better equipped to create remedies in  this context because of the ""potential interference with  the important work of supervising officers"" and that the  FTCA provided an alternative remedy. Page 4 of 4 On appeal, Bacon purports to challenge only the latter  ruling. But even if we were [*9]  to agree with him that  the FTCA is not an alternative remedy counseling  against extending Bivens, that would not be reason  enough to reverse. The district court's concern about  Congress being better suited to create a remedy to  avoid interfering with the work of probation officers is  sufficient, standing alone, to counsel against expanding  Bivens. See Silva, 45 F.4th at 1141; Carvajal v. United  States, No. 20-CV-567, 2021 WL 2814883, at *4-5 (N.D.  Tex. May 11, 2021) (unpublished) (""Supervision-based  Bivens claims like this . . . could possibly interfere with  the difficult responsibilities of probation officers.""), report  and recommendationadopted, 2021 WL 2808966 (N.D.  Tex. July 6, 2021) (unpublished). And Bacon waived  any argument to the contrary by not making one in his  brief. So we conclude that this case, like ""virtually all""  new Bivens contexts, is not appropriate for extending  the Bivens remedy. Silva, 45 F.4th at 1140. We  accordingly affirm the district court's dismissal order. 7 Appellate Case: 23-4071 Document: 010110964588  Date Filed: 12/07/2023 Page: 8 As a final matter, we grant Bacon's motion to proceed  IFP on appeal and deny his motion asking for an order  directing his prison to provide him with certain legal  documents.",1
C.S. v. Choice Hotels,"OPINION AND ORDER This matter comes before the Court on review of  defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc.'s Motion to  Dismiss Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint with  Prejudice (Doc. #20) filed on October 8, 2020, and  defendant Robert Vocisano's Motion to Dismiss with  Prejudice  Plaintiff's  Complaint  and  Incorporated  Memorandum of Law (Doc. #22) filed [*2]  on October  13, 2020. Plaintiff filed an Opposition (Doc. #37) and a  Memorandum in Opposition (Doc. #38) on November 5,  2020, to which the defendants each filed a Reply (Doc.  #44; Doc. #45) on November 19, 2020. For the reasons  set forth below, the motions are denied. I. The origins of this case began on October 30, 2019,  when plaintiff and another alleged victim of sex  trafficking filed a case in the Circuit Court of the  Twentieth Judicial Circuit in and for Collier County,  Florida. See S.Y. et al v. Naples Hotel Co. et al, Case  No. 2:20-cv-118 (Doc. #1, p. 3). On December 31, 2019,  the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint which  asserted ten claims against over forty defendants. Id. at  (Doc. #1, pp. 2-4). The case was removed to federal  court in February 2020. Id. at (Doc. #1). On April 15,  2020, the plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint.  Id. at (Doc. #85). On August 5, 2020, the undersigned  denied various motions to dismiss, but determined  severance of the parties was appropriate. S.Y. v. Naples  Page 2 of 15 Hotel Co., 476 F. Supp. 3d 1251, 1258-59 (M.D. Fla.  2020). Following the Court's severance order, plaintiff  and the other alleged victim filed nearly thirty new  actions against various defendants, including this case. The Complaint (Doc. #1) in this case [*3]  was filed on  August 19, 2020, and alleges that plaintiff C.S., a  resident of Collier County, Florida, was a victim of  continuous sex trafficking at a certain Quality Inn &  Suites Golf Resort (the Quality Inn Hotel) in Naples,  Florida between 2014 and February 2016. (Id. ¶¶ 2, 13,  22-24.) The Complaint alleges that during this time  period the Quality Inn Hotel was owned and operated by  defendant Robert Vocisano (Vocisano) as a franchisee  of defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc. (Choice).  (Id. ¶¶ 25-28, 44-45, 50.) The Complaint alleges the following six claims: (1)  violation  of  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), 18 U.S.C. §  1595; (2) violation of the Florida RICO statute, §  772.104, Florida Statutes; (3) premise liability; (4)  negligent hiring, supervision, and retention; (5) negligent  rescue; and (6) aiding and abetting, harboring,  confining, coercion, and criminal enterprise. (Id. pp. 33- 49.) Counts One through Four are asserted against  each defendant, while Counts Five and Six are asserted  against Vocisano. (Id.) II. The motions to dismiss raise numerous arguments as to  why the Complaint as whole, and each individual claim,  should be dismissed. The Court will address each of  these arguments in turn. A. Shotgun Pleading The Complaint identifies the defendants [*4]  collectively  as the ""Quality Inn Defendants."" (Doc. #1, p. 1  introductory paragraph.) Both motions argue that  because the Complaint groups them together, it should  be dismissed as a shotgun pleading. (Doc. #20, pp. 12- 13; Doc. #22, p. 5.) One way in which a complaint may constitute an      impermissible shotgun pleading is if it ""assert[s] multiple  claims against multiple defendants without specifying  which of the defendants are responsible for which acts  or omissions, or which of the defendants the claim is  brought against."" Weiland v. Palm Beach Cty. Sheriff's  Office, 792 F.3d 1313, 1323 (11th Cir. 2015); see also  Barmapov v. Amuial, 986 F.3d 1321, 1324-25 (11th Cir.  2021). Such a pleading fails ""to give the defendants  adequate notice of the claims against them and the  grounds upon which each claim rests,"" Weiland, 792  F.3d at 1323, and violates the requirement that a  plaintiff provide ""a short and plain statement of the  claim,"" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The Complaint does indeed repeatedly refer to the  defendants collectively as the ""Quality Inn Defendants.""  The failure to specify a particular defendant is not fatal,  however, when ""[t]he complaint can be fairly read to  aver that all defendants are responsible for the alleged  conduct."" Kyle K. v. Chapman, 208 F.3d 940, 944 (11th  Cir. 2000). The Complaint typically (but not always)  alleges that ""each and every"" such defendant was  involved in the activity described in the particular [*5]   paragraph of the Complaint. A fair reading of the  Complaint is that each of these defendants was involved  in the identified conduct attributed to the ""Quality Inn  Defendants."" While defendants may disagree that such  allegations are accurate, that dispute is for another day.  The group allegations do not fail to state a claim, Auto.  Alignment & Body Serv., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co., 953 F.3d 707, 732-33 (11th Cir. 2020), and the  Complaint does not constitute a shotgun pleading. B. Failure to State a Claim                      2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *2 Page 3 of 15 The motions argue certain claims should be dismissed  due to plaintiff's failure to state a claim upon which relief  may be granted. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2)  requires that a complaint contain a ""short and plain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This obligation  ""requires more than labels and conclusions, and a  formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action  will not do."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,  555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation  omitted). To survive dismissal, the factual allegations  must be ""plausible"" and ""must be enough to raise a right  to relief above the speculative level."" Id. at 555; see also  Edwards v. Prime Inc., 602 F.3d 1276, 1291 (11th Cir.  2010). This requires ""more than an unadorned, the- defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation."" Ashcroft  v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed.  2d 868 (2009) (citations omitted). In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court  must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as [*6]   true and take them in the light most favorable to the  plaintiff, Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct.  2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal  conclusions without adequate factual support are  entitled to no assumption of truth,"" Mamani v. Berzaín,  654 F.3d 1148, 1153 (11th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted).  ""Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of  action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do  not suffice."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Factual allegations  that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability fall  short of being facially plausible. Chaparro v. Carnival  Corp., 693 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir. 2012) (citations  omitted). Thus, the Court engages in a two-step  approach: ""When there are well-pleaded factual  allegations, a court should assume their veracity and  then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an  entitlement to relief."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. (1) Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization  Act Both motions challenge the one federal claim, the  alleged violation of the TVPRA set forth in Count One.  (Doc. #20, pp. 14-28; Doc. #22, pp. 6-12.) The TVPRA  provides a civil remedy to victims of certain types of  human trafficking. The civil remedy portion of the Act  provides: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation [*7]  in a venture which that person  knew or should have known has engaged in an act  in violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). The phrase ""a violation of this  chapter"" refers to Chapter 77 of Title 18 of the United  States Code. The only violation of Chapter 77 relevant  to this case is contained in 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a), which  provides in relevant part: (a) Whoever knowingly - (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign  commerce . . . recruits, entices, harbors,  transports,  provides,  obtains,  advertises,  maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any means  a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything  of value, from participation in a venture which  has engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as [*8]  provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). To state a section 1595(a) claim in  this case, plaintiff must plausibly allege that she was a  victim of a criminal offense under section 1591(a), and  then must plausibly allege that defendant (1)""knowingly  benefit[ted] financially or by receiving anything of value,""  (2) from participation in a venture, (3) which defendant  ""knew or should have known has engaged in"" sex  trafficking under section 1591(a). S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d  at 1255-56 (citing A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 455 F. Supp.  3d 171, 181 (E.D. Pa. 2020)). (a) Plausible Allegations Re: § 1591 Violation Choice first argues that plaintiff fails to allege an  underlying section 1591 violation by failing ""to set out  any  facts  describing  any  criminal  investigation,  indictment, prosecution, or conviction."" (Doc. #20, p.  15.) The Complaint alleges: 84. From approximately 2014 through February  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *5 Page 4 of 15 2016, Plaintiff C.S. was recruited to, enticed to,  solicited to, held at, harbored as captive at and/or  transported to various hotels in Naples, Florida by  her sex traffickers to engage in commercial sex  acts at these hotels on a regular, consistent and/or  repeated basis, from approximately 2014 to  February 2016, Plaintiff C.S. was trafficked by  Gregory Hines (aka Bowlegs), Keith Lewis and  others at the Quality Inn Hotel. (Doc. #1, ¶ 84.) There is no requirement that the sex  trafficker have been [*9]  convicted criminally to support  a civil claim against defendants for knowingly financially  benefitting from the sex trafficking, and Choice  provides no legal support for this argument. Choice also argues that plaintiff has not alleged  coercion giving rise to an underlying violation of section  1591, asserting that plaintiff was free to meet the ""John""  in the lobby, and she could walk the hallways without  confinement. (Doc. #20, pp. 16-17.) For purposes of § 1591, ""coercion"" is defined as (1)  ""threats of serious harm to or physical restraint  against any person;"" (2) ""any scheme, plan, or  pattern intended to cause a person to believe that  failure to perform an act would result in serious  harm to or physical restraint against any person""; or  (3) ""the abuse or threatened abuse of law or the  legal process."" Id. § 1591(e)(2). ""Serious harm,"" in  turn, is ""any harm, whether physical or nonphysical,  including psychological, financial, or reputational  harm, that is sufficiently serious, under all the  surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable  person of the same background and in the same  circumstances to perform or to continue performing  commercial sexual activity in order to avoid  incurring that harm."" Id. § 1591(e)(4). United States v. Williams, 714 F. App'x 917, 918 (11th  Cir. 2017). The allegations [*10]  in the Complaint are  more than conclusory with regard to the threats of  serious harm or physical restraint, and do not only  allege sexual abuse and prostitution. (Doc. #20, pp. 16- 17.) Some of the relevant allegations are as follows: 58. At all material times, each and every Quality Inn       Defendant,  as  owners,  operators,  managers,  supervisors, controllers and/or entities otherwise  responsible for hotels, including the Quality Inn  Hotel, knew or should have known that traffickers  were harboring, raping and assaulting victims at  their hotels, including the Quality Inn Hotel, and  were forcing them to engage in ""in call"" services,  wherein buyers (""Johns"") would come to the hotels  solely to purchase sex from these victims, as well  as ""out call"" services, wherein the buyer would rent  a hotel room and the trafficker would deliver the  victim to the buyer's room to complete the sordid  transaction. . . . 69. Each and every Quality Inn Defendant,  individually and by and through their actual or  apparent agents, servants, franchisees, employees  and/or staff, were aware of and/or should have  been aware of a number of warning signs at their  hotels, including the Quality Inn Hotel, that  indicated the presence [*11]  of human trafficking,  including but not limited to: a. persons showing signs of malnourishment,  poor  hygiene,  fatigue,  sleep  deprivation,  untreated illness, injuries, and/or unusual  behavior; b. persons lacking freedom of movement or  being constantly monitored; c.  persons  having  no  control  over  or  possession of money or ID; d. persons dressing inappropriately for their  age or having lower quality clothing compared  to others in their party; e. persons requesting room or housekeeping  services (additional towels, new linens, etc.),  but denying hotel staff entry into the room; f. the presence of multiple computers, cell  phones, pagers, credit card swipers, or other  technology in the room; g. persons extending stay with few or no  personal possessions in the room; h. excessive amounts of sex paraphernalia in  rooms (condoms, lubricant, lotion); i. the same person reserving multiple rooms; j. a room being rented hourly, less than a day,  or for an atypical extended stay; k. attempts of persons to sell items to or beg  from patrons or staff; l. cars in the parking lot regularly parked  backward, so the license plates are not visible; m. loitering and solicitation of male patrons; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *8 Page 5 of 15 n. individuals waiting at a [*12]  table or bar  and then being picked up by a male (trafficker  or customer); o. persons asking staff or patrons for food or  money; and p. persons taking cash or receipts left on  tables. . . . 135. Plaintiff C.S. was a hotel guest at the Quality  Inn  Hotel  and  Plaintiff  was  seriously  and  permanently injured as a direct result of each and  every Quality Inn Defendants' acts and omissions,  in that each and every Quality Inn Defendant  permitted, harbored and facilitated illegal sex  trafficking ventures to take place at the Quality Inn  Hotel whereby the Plaintiff C.S. was routinely and  continuously abused, battered, falsely imprisoned,  raped, beaten, starved, forcibly injected with drugs  and enslaved. 136. More specifically, at all material times, in  the quest for profits, the acts and omissions of  each  and  every  Quality  Inn  Defendant  regarding the Quality Inn Hotel caused the  Plaintiff to suffer: a. Forced labor; b. Forced confinement without safe means  of escape; c. Assault and fear; d. Sickness, dizziness and headaches; e. Cuts, lacerations, abrasions and other  physical harm; f. Mental anguish, humiliation, exploitation,  degradation and mental distress; g. Suffocation, battery and rape; h. Shock, fright [*13]  and post-traumatic  stress; i. Overdose and drug-induced dangers (the  Plaintiff suffered drug overdoses, drug-induced  actions which caused harm to themselves [sic],  physical deformities and scarfing [sic] from  actions of the ""Johns"" and drug usage); and j. Invasion of privacy and wrongful entry of  ""Johns."" (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 58, 69, 135-36.) The allegations are not  ""simply a regurgitation of the statutes' wording woven  together with conclusory statements and a generous  use of 'and/or.'"" Kelsey v. Goldstar Est. Buyers Corp.,  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37361, 2014 WL 1155253, at *6  (D. Or. Mar. 21, 2014). The motion will be denied as  plaintiff has stated plausible facts in support of a section  1591 violation. (b) ""Participation"" in a ""Venture"" The defendants argue that the Complaint lacks well-pled  allegations that it participated in a ""venture,"" as required  by section 1595(a). (Doc. #20, p. 23; Doc. #22, pp. 6-9.)  Drawing on the definition of ""venture"" used in the  criminal portion of the statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(6) ,  Vocisano asserts that a ""venture"" requires two or more  individuals ""associated in fact."" (Doc. #22, p. 6.)  Borrowing  from  the  federal  RICO  definition  of  ""enterprise,"" the defendants argue that ""associated in  fact"" requires that persons must operate as a  ""continuing unit that functions with a common purpose.""  (Doc. #20, p. 23; Doc. #22, pp. [*14]  6-7.) Vocisano  continues that in the context of a TVPRA claim against a  hotel operator, the Complaint must ""at least"" allege a  ""continuous business relationship between the trafficker  and the hotels such that it would appear that the  trafficker and the hotels have established a pattern of  conduct or could be said to have a tacit agreement.""  (Doc. #22, p. 7) (citing M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels &  Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959, 970 (S.D. Ohio  2019)); see also Doe v. Rickey Patel, LLC, 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (S.D. Fla.  Sept. 30, 2020) (""In order to plead Defendants  participated in a venture, Plaintiff must allege facts from  which the Court could reasonably infer the hotels could  be said to have a tacit agreement with the trafficker.""  (marks  omitted)).  Vocisano  concludes  that  ""a  commercial transaction,"" such as the rental of a hotel  room, ""does not give rise to a reasonable inference that  the participants in such a transaction shared any  common purpose or otherwise 'associated in fact.'""  (Doc. #22, p. 7.) Similarly, Choice asserts that plaintiff  has failed to allege it associated in fact with the non- party traffickers. (Doc. #20, p. 23.) Here, the Complaint alleges the defendants participated  in a venture ""by engaging in a pattern of acts and  omissions that were intended to support, facilitate,  harbor, and otherwise further the traffickers' [*15]  sale  and victimization of the Plaintiff C.S. for commercial  sexual exploitation by repeatedly renting rooms at  Quality Inn Hotel to people"" the defendants ""knew or  should have known were engaged in sex trafficking.""  (Doc. #1, ¶ 159.) The Complaint also alleges why the     2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *11 Page 6 of 15 defendants should have been on notice of the sex  trafficking and how it failed to prevent it. (Id. at ¶¶ 4-16,  56-83, 117.) The Court finds the allegations in the  Complaint sufficient to allege participation in a venture  under section 1595(a). See Doe, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (""The Court finds it  sufficient  for  Plaintiff  to  plead  that  Defendants  participated in a venture by renting rooms to individuals  that knew or should have known were involved in a sex- trafficking  venture,  including  the  sex-trafficking  victim.""); M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 971 (""This Court finds  Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to show Defendants  'participated in a venture' under § 1595 by alleging that  Defendants rented rooms to people it knew or should  have known where [sic] engaged in sex trafficking.""). Choice and Vocisano also argue that ""participation"" in a  venture requires an allegation of an overt act in  furtherance of the venture, and that failure to prevent  sex trafficking is insufficient. (Doc. #20, pp. 18- 19; [*16]  Doc. #22, pp. 7-8.) The Court is not  convinced. S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1256 (""In the  absence of any controlling authority, the Court  concludes  that  actual  'participation  in  the  sex  trafficking act itself' is not required to state a claim  under section 1595. Accordingly, plaintiffs' failure to  allege such actual participation is not fatal to its section  1595 claim under the TVPRA.""). The defendants have  not identified any controlling authority to the contrary. (c) Knowingly Benefited From Participating in  Venture The motions next argue that the Complaint insufficiently  alleges the defendants knowingly benefitted from  participating in a venture that committed TVPRA crimes,  with knowledge of the causal relationship. (Doc. #20,  pp. 17-23; Doc. #22, p. 9.) Vocisano argues that the  allegation that he benefited generally from the operation  of the hotel is insufficient for TVPRA liability. (Doc. #22,  p. 9.) The Complaint alleges the defendants knowingly  benefited from the sex trafficking of plaintiff ""by  receiving payment for the rooms rented for Plaintiff C.S.  and her traffickers at the Quality Inn Hotel,"" and by  receiving ""other financial benefits in the form of food and      beverage sales and ATM fees from those persons who  were engaging in sex [*17]  trafficking."" (Doc. #1, ¶  157.) As to Choice, as franchisor, the Complaint alleges  it ""received a significant franchise fee and continuous  royalties on the Quality Inn Hotel's gross revenue,"" while  also exercising ""ongoing and systematic control over  operations at the Quality Inn Hotel."" (Id. ¶¶ 44, 114.)  The Court finds such allegations sufficient to satisfy the  ""knowingly benefitted"" element. S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at  1257; Doe S.W. v. Lorain-Elyria Motel, Inc., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192, at *5 (S.D. Ohio  Mar. 16, 2020); H.H. v. G6 Hosp., LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *2 (S.D. Ohio  Dec. 6, 2019); M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 965. (d) Knew or Should Have Known that Venture was  Committing Sex Trafficking Crimes Both motions argue the Complaint fails to plausibly  allege the defendants knew or should have known that  the ""venture"" was engaging in sex-trafficking crimes,  i.e., that the defendants knew or should have known  that an adult plaintiff was caused to engage in  commercial sex by force, threats of force, fraud, or  coercion. (Doc. #20, pp. 23-26; Doc. #22, pp. 10-12.)  Choice argues that ""[a]t most,"" the Plaintiff's allegations  speak to constructive knowledge of Choice's general  knowledge that prostitution and sex trafficking occurs  around the world at all hotels,"" but not the sex  trafficking of plaintiff. (Doc. #20, p. 25.) Similarly,  Vocisano  argues  the  Complaint  lacks  plausible  allegations that it ""knew or should [*18]  have known"" of  any venture that trafficked plaintiff. (Doc. #22, p. 12.) The Court disagrees with this argument. First of all,  ""knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind  may be alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b); see Sun  Life Assurance Co. of Can. v. Imperial Premium Fin.,  LLC, 904 F.3d 1197, 1215 (11th Cir. 2018). Pleading  ""generally"" is not without limits, and a complaint must  still comply with ""the less rigid—though still operative— strictures of Rule 8."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 686-87. The  Complaint clearly satisfies this notice pleading standard. Plaintiff has alleged that the following was ""routine  conduct taking place at the Quality Inn Hotel as a result  of the human sex trafficking enterprise"": a. Plaintiff's sex traffickers frequently rented rooms  at the hotel close to each other; b. Plaintiff's sex traffickers paid cash for the rooms  at the Quality Inn Hotel where the Plaintiff engaged  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *15 Page 7 of 15 in commercial sex acts; c. Plaintiff's sex traffickers booked extended stays  at the Quality Inn Hotel for themselves and for the  Plaintiff on a routine basis and on a rotating basis  frequently throughout the year; d. Plaintiff and her sex traffickers would have few or  no luggage or personal possessions for these  extended stays; e. Plaintiff was confined in the rooms at the Quality  Inn Hotel for long periods of time; f. Plaintiff's rooms [*19]  and her sex traffickers'  rooms consistently displayed ""Do Not Disturb"" signs  on the doors to the room where the Plaintiff was  engaged in commercial sex acts; g. Men (""Johns"") frequently entered and left the  rooms at the Quality Inn Hotel where the Plaintiff  was engaged in illegal commercial sex acts at all  times of day and night; h. The staff and customers at the Quality Inn Hotel  that was owned, operated, managed, supervised,  controlled and/or otherwise held responsible by  each and every Quality Inn Defendant saw and/or  reported to the Quality Inn Hotel's respective  administration that the rooms where the Plaintiff  engaged in commercial sex acts were messy, and  contained sex and drug paraphernalia and had an  unclean smell; i. The rooms at the Quality Inn Hotel were often  stained with Plaintiff's blood and that of other  trafficking victims after they were beaten or  violently raped; j. Plaintiff's sex traffickers consistently refused  housekeeping  services  and  otherwise  would  prohibit staff from entering their rooms and the  Plaintiff's rooms; k. Plaintiff would frequently request clean towels  and linens; l. Plaintiff dressed in a sexually explicit manner and  would walk the hallways of the [*20]  Quality Inn  Hotel in inappropriate attire; m. Excessively loud noises would consistently  come from Plaintiff's rooms; n. During nighttime hours, Plaintiff and her ""Johns""  and drug clients would create noise in the public  area of the Quality Inn Hotel and, upon information  and belief, would be a disturbance to other guests  using the hotel for their intended purposes; o. Plaintiff would sleep during the day and the staff  members  of  the  Quality  Inn  Hotel  would  consistently see the Plaintiff wearing lounge or  sleep type clothing during the day; p. While at the hotel and at the hotel pool, the  Plaintiff displayed clear signs of physical abuse,  diminished personal hygiene, submissiveness and  inappropriate attire; and q. While at the Quality Inn Hotel, Plaintiff C.S. was  forced to earn money for her trafficker by openly  soliciting other hotel guests at the Quality Inn Hotel  bar. (Doc. #1, ¶ 98.) Further, the Complaint alleges the  defendants ""knew or should have known about the  nature of the sex trafficking venture at the Quality Inn  Hotel, including as they related to Plaintiff C.S."" due to  the following: a. Requests by the traffickers to rent rooms in the  tower to the left of the front entrance; [*21]  b. Cash payments for the rooms by the sex  traffickers; c. Refusal of housekeeping services by those  persons engaged in sex trafficking; d. Excessive used condoms located in the rooms  used for sex trafficking; e. Excessive requests for towels and linens in the  rooms used for sex trafficking; f. Hotel staff observing Plaintiff C.S. and her  traffickers in the hotel; g. Plaintiff C.S. being escorted by traffickers in and  around the hotel; h. Operation of sex trafficking ventures out of the  same hotel room for multiple days or weeks in  succession; i. Multiple men per day coming and going from the  same  rooms  without  luggage  or  personal  possessions; j. Knowledge of police and EMS activity at the  Quality Inn Hotel and at other locations near the  Quality Inn Hotel that was related to commercial  sex work; and k. Knowledge that Plaintiff C.S. and other sex  trafficking victims were forced by their traffickers to  solicit other hotel guests at the bar on the Quality  Inn Hotel's premises. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *18 Page 8 of 15 (Id. ¶ 158.) The  Court  finds  these  allegations  sufficient  to  reasonably infer the defendants knew or should have  known of the sex trafficking venture. S.Y., 476 F.  Supp. 3d at 1257; A.B., 455 F. Supp. 3d at 193-94; Doe  S.W., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192,  at *5-6; H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL  6682152, at *3; M.A., 425 F. Supp 3d at 967-68. (e) Vicarious Liability Finally, Choice argues the TVPRA claim should [*22]   be dismissed because ""[t]here is no vicarious liability  under the plain meaning of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #20, p.  26.) The Court disagrees. See S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at  1257-58 (finding plaintiff made sufficient allegations that  franchisor was vicariously liable under section 1595 of  the TVPRA to survive dismissal); see also J.C. v.  Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073,  2020 WL 6318707, at *10 (N.D. Ca. Oct. 28, 2020)  (finding plaintiff's vicarious liability claim had ""alleged  sufficient facts to support a plausible claim that  [defendants] received financial benefits from a venture  they vicariously participate in (through their franchisees)  that the franchises should have known was engaged in  sex trafficking.""). Choice also argues that even if it could be held  vicariously liable under the TVPRA, plaintiff's allegations  are insufficient to establish an agency relationship  between Choice and its franchisee. (Doc. #20, p. 27.)  Having reviewed the allegations at issue, the Court finds  them sufficient to create a plausible inference of an  agency relationship. ""It is well-established that a franchise relationship does  not by itself create an agency relationship between the  franchisor and franchisee."" Cain v. Shell Oil Co., 994 F.  Supp. 2d 1251, 1252 (N.D. Fla. 2014). However,  ""[f]ranchisors may well enter into an agency relationship  with a franchisee if, by contract or action or  representation, the franchisor [*23]  has directly or  apparently participated in some substantial way in  directing or managing acts of the franchisee, beyond the  mere fact of providing contractual franchise support  activities."" Mobil Oil Corp. v. Bransford, 648 So. 2d 119,  120 (Fla. 1995). Here, the Complaint alleges Choice was in an agency  relationship with Vocisano during the relevant time  period. (Doc. #1, ¶ 116.) The Complaint further asserts  that in a variety of ways Choice exercised control over  the means and methods of how Vocisano conducted  business, such as by profit sharing, standardized  training, standardized rules of operation, regular  inspection, and price fixing. (Id. at ¶ 115.) The Court  finds such allegations sufficient to support a plausible  inference of an agency relationship. See S.Y., 476 F.  Supp. 3d at 1258; A.B., 455 F. Supp. 3d at 195-97; Doe  S.W., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192,  at *7; H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL  6682152, at *6; M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 972. Because the allegations in the Complaint are sufficient  to state a claim under section 1595 of the TVPRA, the  Court denies the motions for dismissal pursuant to Rule  12(b)(6). (2) Florida RICO Violation Count Two of the Complaint asserts a claim against  both defendants under Florida's civil RICO statute,  section 772.104, Florida Statutes. (Doc. #1, ¶ 161.) To  state a claim under the statute, plaintiff must allege  plausible facts showing ""(1) conduct or participation in  an enterprise through (2) a pattern of [criminal] activity.""  Horace-Manasse v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 521 F.  App'x 782, 784 (11th Cir. 2013) (quoting Lugo v. State,                            2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *21 Page 9 of 15 845 So. 2d 74, 97 (Fla. 2003)). The defendants [*24]  argue that plaintiff lacks standing  because personal injuries cannot be remedied by RICO.  (Doc. #20, p. 28; Doc. #22, p. 16.) There is some  authority to suggest the Florida RICO statute, unlike the  federal equivalent, does not ""expressly limit recovery"" to  persons who have suffered injury to their business or  property, and that recovery for personal injuries may be  allowed. Berber v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 2018 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 234385, 2018 WL 10436236, at *3 (S.D.  Fla. May 24, 2018) (collecting cases). The motion will be  denied on this basis. Plaintiff's RICO claim is asserted under sections  772.104(1) and (2), which provide civil remedies for  violations of section 772.103, Florida Statutes. (Doc. #1,  ¶ 161.) Section 772.103 contains four subsections of  prohibited activities. § 772.103, Fla. Stat. Vocisano  argues that because plaintiff fails ""to specify the  particular subsection of Section 772.103 giving rise to a  Florida RICO claim,"" the claim is defective. (Doc. #22,  pp. 12-13.) Plaintiff fails to address this argument in her  response. See (Doc. #37.) This court has previously stated that a RICO claim's  failure to identify which subsection of section 772.103 is  implicated is sufficient to warrant dismissal. Lennon v.  Marriott Ownership Resorts, Inc., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  55004, 2019 WL 1440092, at *10 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 31,  2019); Signeo Int'l Ltd. v. Wade, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  203002, 2013 WL 12153590, at *6 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 1,  2013). However, the Court finds dismissal unnecessary  in this case because it is apparent which subsection  plaintiff is relying upon. Section 772.103(3) makes it  unlawful for any person associated with any enterprise  to conduct [*25]  or participate in such enterprise  through a pattern of criminal activity. In the Complaint,  plaintiff  alleges  the  defendants  ""conducted  or  participated in . . . the affairs of their respective RICO  Enterprises through a pattern of numerous acts of  racketeering activity . . . in violation of Fla. Stat. §  772.103."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 165.) Because this allegation  tracks the language of subsection three, the Court finds          it provides sufficient notice of the applicable provision.  Accordingly, the Court denies Vocisano's request for  dismissal on this basis. Each of the motions also argue plaintiff has insufficiently  pled the enterprise element of her claim. (Doc. #20, pp.  28-31; Doc. #22, pp. 13-15.) Florida's RICO statute  defines enterprise to include a ""group of individuals  associated in fact although not a legal entity."" §  772.102(3), Fla. Stat. ""[A]n association-in-fact enterprise  is simply a continuing unit that functions with a common  purpose."" Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 948,  129 S. Ct. 2237, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1265 (2009). To  sufficiently plead such an enterprise, ""a plaintiff must  allege that a group of persons shares three structural  features: (1) a purpose, (2) relationships among those  associated with the enterprise, and (3) longevity  sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the  enterprise's purpose."" [*26]  Cisneros v. Petland, Inc.,  972 F.3d 1204, 1211 (11th Cir. 2020) (marks and  citations omitted). ""The purpose prong contemplates 'a common purpose  of engaging in a course of conduct' among the  enterprise's alleged participants."" Cisneros, 972 F.3d at  1211 (quoting United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576,  583, 101 S. Ct. 2524, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1981)). ""An  abstract common purpose, such as a generally shared  interest in making money, will not suffice. Rather, where  the participants' ultimate purpose is to make money for  themselves, a RICO plaintiff must plausibly allege that  the participants shared the purpose of enriching  themselves through a particular criminal course of  conduct."" Id. (citations omitted). Here, the Complaint alleges the defendants ""associated  with each other and/or the Plaintiff C.S.'s sex traffickers  for the common purpose of profiting off an established  sex trafficking scheme."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 164.) Plaintiff  asserts  this  ""association-in-fact""  constitutes  an  ""enterprise"" under Florida's RICO statute, and that the  defendants conducted or participated in their enterprises  through a pattern of criminal activity, ""related by their  common purpose to profit off an institutionalized sex  trafficking scheme."" (Id. at ¶¶ 165-66.) The Court finds  these allegations sufficient to allege the defendants  ""shared the purpose of enriching themselves through  a [*27]  particular criminal course of conduct."" Cisneros,  972 F.3d at 1211; see also United States v. Church, 955  F.2d 688, 697-98 (11th Cir. 1992) (noting that ""an  association's devotion to 'making money from repeated  criminal activity' . . . demonstrates an enterprise's  'common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct'""  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *23 Page 10 of 15 (citations omitted)); Burgese v. Starwood Hotels &  Resorts Worldwide, Inc., 101 F. Supp. 3d 414, 424 (D.  N.J. 2015) (on motion to dismiss Florida RICO claim,  court found that ""Plaintiff's Amended Complaint can be  read to allege a 'common purpose' of furthering an  institutionalized prostitution scheme to increase profits  for the participants,"" and that ""[t]hese allegations,  though thin, are sufficient for purposes of this motion.""). Next, Vocisano argues plaintiff has failed to plead the  claim with the heightened level of specificity required for  RICO claims. (Doc. #22, pp. 15-16.) Plaintiff responds  that because the RICO claim is based on non-fraudulent  predicate acts, the heightened pleading requirement is  not applicable. (Doc. #37, p. 22.) The Court agrees with  plaintiff. While the Eleventh Circuit has described RICO claims  as ""essentially a certain breed of fraud claims"" that  ""must be pled with an increased level of specificity""  consistent with Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure, Arthur v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA, 569  F. App'x 669, 681 (11th Cir. 2014), such a standard  applies only when the RICO claim is based on fraud or  mistake, see D. Penguin Bros. Ltd. v. City Nat'l Bank,  587 F. App'x 663, 666 (2d Cir. 2014) (""In the RICO  context, [*28]  a plaintiff must plead predicate acts  sounding in fraud or mistake according to the  particularity requirement of Rule 9(b); for other elements  of a RICO claim—such as non-fraud predicate acts or . .  . the existence of an 'enterprise'—a plaintiff's complaint  need satisfy only the 'short and plain statement'  standard of Rule 8(a).""); Cardenas v. Toyota Motor  Corp., 418 F. Supp. 3d 1090, 1098 (S.D. Fla. 2019)  (""[B]ecause particularity pleading under Rule 9(b) is  limited to circumstances constituting fraud, the non- fraud elements of a RICO claim can be alleged under  Rule 8(a) standards."" (citations and marks omitted)). As  the predicate acts in plaintiff's RICO claim are not based  in fraud, the Court finds Rule 9 is not applicable. See  Magnifico v. Villanueva, 783 F. Supp. 2d 1217, 1229,  1229 n.9 (S.D. Fla. 2011) (in addressing RICO  allegations, court applied Rule 9(b) to ""fraud-related  predicate acts,"" such as mail, wire, and immigration  document fraud, and Rule 8 to ""non-fraud predicate  acts,"" such as human trafficking). Choice next argues the RICO claim fails to plausibly  allege plaintiff's harm was caused by Choice. (Doc.     #20, pp. 31-32.) Under the Florida RICO statute, a  plaintiff must demonstrate that their injuries were  proximately caused by the RICO violations. See Bortell  v. White Mountains Ins. Grp., Ltd., 2 So. 3d 1041, 1047  (Fla. 4th DCA 2009). ""A wrongful act is a proximate  cause if it is a substantive factor in the sequence of  responsible causation."" Green Leaf Nursery v. E.I.  DuPont De Nemours & Co., 341 F.3d 1292, 1307 (11th  Cir.  2003)  (marks  and [*29]   citation  omitted).  Furthermore, a plaintiff ""must show a 'direct relation  between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct  alleged.'"" Id. (quoting Holmes v. Sec. Inv'r Prot. Corp.,  503 U.S. 258, 268, 112 S. Ct. 1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532  (1992)). ""Indirect harm is insufficient to sustain a cause  of action under the RICO statutes."" Bortell, 2 So. 3d at  1047; see also O'Malley, 599 So. 2d at 1000 (""[I]ndirect  injuries, that is, injuries sustained not as a direct result  of predicate acts . . . will not allow recovery under  Florida RICO.""). Choice argues that plaintiff has not alleged a direct  relation between her injuries and Choice's purported  violation of the RICO statute, and that the conduct  responsible for plaintiff's alleged harm was the actions  of the traffickers and ""Johns."" (Doc. #20, pp. 31-32.)  Plaintiff responds that she has sufficiently pled  proximate cause and losses as a direct result of the sex  trafficking enterprise by alleging she ""was at the  Quality Inn as part of the sexual trafficking scheme and  her injuries were caused by and in furtherance of the  sexual trafficking scheme."" (Doc. #38, p. 34.) Having  reviewed the allegations in the Complaint, the Court  agrees with plaintiff. The Complaint alleges each of defendants ""was on  notice of repeated incidences of sex trafficking  occurring on their hotel premises,"" [*30]  and yet ""failed  to take the necessary actions to prevent sex trafficking  from taking place."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 60.) The Complaint also  alleges numerous ways in which the defendants could  have identified and prevented the sex trafficking from  occurring. (Id. at ¶¶ 62-77.) Finally, the Complaint  alleges the ""acts and omissions of the Quality Inn  Defendants served to support, facilitate, harbor, and  otherwise further the traffickers' sale and victimization""  of plaintiff ""for commercial sexual exploitation by  repeatedly renting rooms to people they knew or should  have known were engaged in sex trafficking."" (Id. at ¶  128.) ""[B]y knowingly, or with reckless disregard,  repeatedly allowing sex trafficking to occur on their  premises between 2014 and 2016,"" the defendants'  ""acts have yielded consistent results and caused  economic, physical, and psychological injuries"" to  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *27 Page 11 of 15 plaintiff. (Id. at ¶¶ 167, 170.) The Court finds these allegations sufficient to plead a  ""direct relation between the injury asserted and the  injurious conduct alleged,"" Holmes, 503 U.S. at 268,  and  therefore  the  Complaint  adequately  pleads  proximate cause. See Burgese, 101 F. Supp. 3d at 422  (finding allegations of physical injury and mental  anguish ""cognizable under the Florida RICO [*31]  Act""  and sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss); cf. Berber,  2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 234385, 2018 WL 10436236, at  *5 (""Because Plaintiffs' asserted injuries arise from a set  of actions entirely distinct form [sic] the alleged  predicate RICO violations, proximate cause is lacking as  a matter of law.""). Accordingly, the Court finds the Complaint's Florida  RICO claim sufficiently plead and therefore will deny the  motions to dismiss the claim. (3) Premise Liability Count Three of the Complaint asserts a claim of  premise liability against each defendant. (Doc. #1, ¶  176.) A premise liability claim is a form of negligence  action. ""The elements for negligence are duty, breach,  harm, and proximate cause; the additional elements for  a claim of premises liability include the defendant's  possession or control of the premises and notice of the  dangerous condition."" Lisanti v. City of Port Richey, 787  So. 2d 36, 37 (Fla. 2d DCA 2001). Plaintiff alleges the  defendants owed her a variety of duties, that they  breached these duties, and that as a direct and  proximate result, she suffered bodily injury. (Doc. #1, ¶¶  180-94.) Plaintiff also alleges the defendants had actual  or constructive knowledge of sex trafficking occurring  on the premises, that they knew or should have known  the risk of such criminal conduct taking place  would [*32]  be unreasonably high without appropriate  precautions, and that they had actual or constructive  knowledge of the dangerous conditions plaintiff was in.  (Id. at ¶¶ 185-87.)        (a) Statute of Limitations The motions argue the premise liability claim should be  dismissed because it is barred by the relevant statute of  limitations. (Doc. #20, p. 33; Doc. #22, p. 17.) Under  Florida law, the statute of limitations for negligence  claims is four years. § 95.11(3)(a), Fla. Stat. A statute of limitations bar is ""an affirmative defense,  and . . . plaintiff[s] [are] not required to negate an  affirmative defense in [their] complaint."" La Grasta v.  First Union Sec., Inc., 358 F.3d 840, 845 (11th Cir.  2004) (citation omitted). ""A dismissal for failure to state  a claim on statute of limitations grounds is appropriate  only if it is apparent from the face of the complaint that  the claim is time-barred."" United States ex rel. Hunt v.  Cochise Consultancy, Inc., 887 F.3d 1081, 1085 (11th  Cir. 2018) (marks and citation omitted). Plaintiff alleges the sex trafficking occurred at the  Quality Inn Hotel ""from approximately 2014 and  continuing through approximately February of 2016.""  (Doc. #1, ¶ 13.) Both defendants argue that because  plaintiff did not file her lawsuit until December 2019, her  premise liability claim is at least partially time barred.  (Doc. #20, p. 33; Doc. #22, p. 17.) ""Under Florida law, [*33]  the statute of limitations  begins to run when the cause of action accrues.""  Carnival Corp. v. Rolls-Royce PLC, 2009 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 107141, 2009 WL 3861482, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Nov.  17, 2009) (citing § 95.031, Fla. Stat.). ""A cause of action  accrues when the last element constituting the cause of  action occurs."" § 95.031(1), Fla. Stat. ""Under the  continuing tort doctrine, the cause of action accrues  when the tortious conduct ceases."" Effs v. Sony Pictures  Home Entm't, Inc., 197 So. 3d 1243, 1244 (Fla. 3d DCA  2016) (emphasis and citation omitted). ""A continuing tort  is established by continual tortious acts, not by continual  harmful effects from an original, completed act."" Id. at  1245 (marks, emphasis, and citation omitted). Here, plaintiff alleges she was a repeat victim of sex  trafficking at the Quality Inn Hotel between 2014 and  February 2016. The Court finds such allegations  sufficient to invoke the continuing tort doctrine. See Nat'l  Sourcing, Inc. v. Bracciale, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  199436, 2018 WL 6172430, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 26,  2018) (finding allegation that a defendant's actions  ""continued to this day"" inferred continuous tortious  conduct, thereby making it plausible for the plaintiffs to  assert the continuing tort doctrine as a basis to toll the  statute of limitations). Accordingly, the Court finds that  plaintiff's premise liability claim did not accrue until  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *30 Page 12 of 15 February 2016, and therefore she had until February  2020 to file a complaint asserting premises liability. (1) Choice Plaintiff  met  this  deadline  by  filing  her  First  Amended [*34]  Complaint against Choice on December  31, 2019. S.Y. et al v. Naples Hotel Co. et al, Case No.  2:20-cv-118 (Doc. #3). While the Court determined  severance of the parties was appropriate in the original  action, S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1259, and this  Complaint was filed in August 2020, it appears that the  December 2019 date is applicable for statute of  limitations purposes under the relation-back provisions  of Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Relation back is a legal fiction employed to salvage  claims that would otherwise be unjustly barred by a  limitations provision. See McCurdy v. United States,  264 U.S. 484, 487, 44 S.Ct. 345, 346, 68 L.Ed. 801  (1924); Moore v. Baker, 989 F.2d 1129, 1131 (11th  Cir. 1993). Under Rule 15, a claim in an amended  complaint relates back to the filing date of the  original complaint if it ""asserts a claim or defense  that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or  occurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in  the original pleading."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B).  When the facts in the original complaint do not put  the defendant ""on notice that the new claims of  negligence might be asserted,"" but the new claims  instead ""involve[ ] separate and distinct conduct,""  such that the plaintiff would have to prove  ""completely different facts"" than required to recover  on the claims in the original complaint, the new  claims do not relate back. Moore, 989 F.2d at 1132. Caron v. NCL (Bahamas), Ltd., 910 F.3d 1359, 1368  (11th Cir. 2018). Accordingly, since it is not apparent  from the [*35]  face of the Complaint that the claim is  time-barred, dismissal based upon the statute of  limitations affirmative defense is not appropriate. For the same reasons, the Court rejects the argument  that plaintiff's negligent hiring, supervision, and retention  claim against Choice is also barred by the four-year  statute of limitations. (Doc. #20, p. 33.) (2) Vocisano Vocisano was not named in the December 2019 First  Amended Complaint. Rather, it was first added as a  defendant in April 2020. S.Y. et al v. Naples Hotel Co. et  al, Case No. 2:20-cv-118 (Doc. #85.) Nonetheless, the  Court declines to dismiss based on the statute of  limitations. As noted, plaintiff is not required to negate  an affirmative defense in her complaint. La Grasta, 358  F.3d at 845. It is not apparent from the face of the  Complaint that the claim is time-barred because the  Court cannot determine that plaintiff's premise liability  claim does not relate back to the First Amended  Complaint or is not subject to statutory or equitable  tolling. Therefore, the motion to dismiss is denied at  this stage of the proceedings. To the extent Vocisano seeks dismissal of the other  negligent claims on the same grounds (Doc. #22, p. 17),  the Court's ruling [*36]  applies to those claims as  well. (b) Failure to State a Claim Both defendants argue the premise liability claim is  insufficiently pled. Choice argues the claim fails  because the Complaint does not plausibly allege that  Choice possessed or controlled the Quality Inn Hotel.  (Doc. #20, pp. 37-38.) The Court disagrees. As noted, a  premise liability claim requires a defendant possess or  control the premises at issue. Lisanti, 787 So. 2d at 37.  Here, the Complaint alleges the defendants were the  ""owners, operators, managers, supervisors, controllers  and innkeepers"" of the Quality Inn Hotel, and that  Choice exercised control over the means and methods  of how Vocisano conducted business at the hotel.                     2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *33 Page 13 of 15 (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 29, 115.) While Choice may dispute these  allegations, the Court must accept them as true at this  stage of the proceedings and finds them sufficient to  allege Choice had sufficient control of the Quality Inn  Hotel for premise liability purposes. Vocisano argues there could be no duty to protect  plaintiff from the criminal conduct of third parties  because such conduct was not foreseeable. (Doc. #22,  pp. 17-18.) The Court disagrees with this argument as  well. ""Under Florida law, a business [*37]  owes invitees a  duty to use due care to maintain its premises in a  reasonably safe condition. This includes the duty to  protect customers from criminal attacks that are  reasonably foreseeable."" Banosmoreno v. Walgreen  Co., 299 F. App'x 912, 913 (11th Cir. 2008) (citations  omitted). Foreseeability can be shown by two alternative  means. First, a plaintiff may demonstrate that a  proprietor knew or should have known of a  dangerous condition on his premises that was likely  to cause harm to a patron. Second, a plaintiff can  show that a proprietor knew or should have known  of the dangerous propensities of a particular patron. Id. (marks, citations, and footnote omitted). Such  knowledge must only be pled generally. Fed. R. Civ. P.  9(b). The Complaint contains sufficient allegations that sex  trafficking was occurring at the Quality Inn Hotel and  that the defendants knew or should have known of it.  (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 55-61, 99-109, 158.) The Complaint also  contains sufficient allegations to support a claim of an  agency relationship between Choice and Vocisano, and  any factual challenge to such a relationship is  premature. See Cain, 994 F. Supp. 2d at 1253; Mobil Oil                 Corp., 648 So. 2d at 120. Accordingly, the Court finds  the allegations in the Complaint are sufficient to satisfy  the notice pleading requirements. (4) Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and [*38]   Retention Count Four of the Complaint asserts a claim of negligent  hiring,  supervision,  and  retention  against  the  defendants. (Doc. #1, ¶ 195.) The motions seek  dismissal of the claim based on pleading deficiencies.  Both defendants first argue plaintiff has improperly  lumped multiple claims together. (Doc. #20, pp. 33-34;  Doc. #22, p. 18.) ""A party may set out 2 or more  statements of a claim or defense alternatively or  hypothetically, either in a single count or defense or in  separate ones. If a party makes alternative statements,  the pleading is sufficient if any one of them is sufficient.""  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(2). The Court finds that the claims  are properly set forth in a single count. To state a claim for negligent hiring, plaintiff must allege  facts showing that (1) the employer was required to make an  appropriate investigation of the employee and failed  to do so; (2) an appropriate investigation would  have revealed the unsuitability of the employee for  the particular duty to be performed or for  employment  in  general;  and  (3)  it  was  unreasonable for the employer to hire the employee  in light of the information he knew or should have  known. Groover v. Polk Cty. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs, 460 F. Supp.  3d 1242, 1251 (M.D. Fla. 2020) (quoting Malicki v. Doe,  814 So. 2d 347, 362 (Fla. 2002)). ""Different from  negligent hiring, '[n]egligent retention [*39]  occurs  when, during the course of employment, the employer  becomes aware or should have become aware of  problems with an employee that indicated his unfitness,  and the employer fails to take further action such as  investigating, discharge, or reassignment.'"" Id. (quoting  Degitz v. S. Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 996 F. Supp. 1451,  1461 (M.D. Fla. 1998)). ""Florida law also holds  employers liable for reasonably foreseeable damages  resulting from the negligent training of its employees  and agents."" Clary v. Armor Corr. Health Servs., Inc.,  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15633, 2014 WL 505126, at *4  (M.D. Fla. Feb. 7, 2014) (citing Lewis v. City of St.  Petersburg, 260 F.3d 1260, 1265 (11th Cir. 2001)). ""For  an employer to owe a plaintiff a duty, the plaintiff must  be in the zone of risk that was reasonably foreseeable  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *36 Page 14 of 15 to the employer."" Id. (citation omitted). Accordingly, to state a claim, the plaintiff must  allege facts that would establish a nexus between  the plaintiff and the tortfeasor's employment from  which a legal duty would flow from the defendant- employer to the plaintiff. The plaintiff must then  establish that the defendant-employer breached  that duty and that the breach caused him damage. Id. (citations omitted). The Complaint alleges each defendant was in control of  the  hiring,  instructing,  training,  supervising,  and  terminating of the hotel employees, and that each  defendant had a duty to make an appropriate  investigation of the employees. (Doc. #1, [*40]  ¶¶ 201- 02.) The Complaint further alleges that the defendants  knew or should have known that hotel employees were  ""allowing criminals to rent rooms for prostitution and  drug dealing,"" ""failing to either identify and/or report the  human sex trafficking and foreseeable harm"" of  plaintiff, and ""failing to refuse continued lodging services  to human sex traffickers."" (Id. at ¶¶ 204-06.) The  Complaint concludes that the defendants were negligent  in their hiring, employment, supervision, and termination  decisions regarding the employees, and that the sex  trafficking of plaintiff was a foreseeable and direct  result. (Id. at ¶¶ 207-11.) The Court finds these  allegations sufficient to state plausible claims for  negligent hiring, and negligent supervision/retention. Both motions further argue the claim should be  dismissed because the Complaint does not identify the  alleged employees at issue. (Doc. #20, pp. 34-35; Doc.  #22, p. 19.) The Complaint alleges ""[e]ach and every""  defendant ""was in control of the hiring"" of hotel  employees, and responsible for ""instructing, training and  supervising,"" yet employees failed ""to refuse continued  lodging services to human sex traffickers"" and failed ""to  either [*41]  identify and/or report the human sex  trafficking."" (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 201, 205-06.) The Court is  required to accept all factual allegations as true,  Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94, and ""[i]n adjudicating a motion  to dismiss, the district court may not resolve factual  disputes,"" Page v. Postmaster Gen. & Chief Exec.  Officer of U.S. Postal Serv., 493 F. App'x 994, 995 (11th  Cir. 2012). The Court finds that specific employees are  not required to be named. Accordingly, the Court  denies the request to dismiss the negligent hiring,     supervision, and retention claim. (5) Negligent Rescue Count Five of the Complaint asserts a claim of negligent  rescue against Vocisano. (Doc. #1, ¶ 212.) The  Complaint alleges Vocisano, as the owner and operator  of the Quality Inn Hotel, had a duty to keep the premises  safe and prevent foreseeable criminal activity, as well as  a duty ""to make safe a dangerous condition at the  Quality Inn Hotel and to rescue their [sic] hotel guests,  specifically Plaintiff C.S., from the peril they [sic]  created."" (Id. at ¶¶ 214, 217, 223.) The Complaint  alleges that by various acts and omissions, Vocisano  breached these duties and that the continuous sex  trafficking of plaintiff was the direct and foreseeable  result. (Id. at ¶¶ 219-21, 223-26, 228.) Vocisano argues  the negligent rescue claim should be dismissed  because [*42]  it is insufficiently pled. (Doc. #22, p. 20.) There is no common law duty to rescue a stranger.  Estate of Ferguson v. Mascara, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  157824, 2010 WL 11558195, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 7,  2010) (citing Bradberry v. Pinellas Cty., 789 F.2d 1513,  1516 (11th Cir. 1986)). ""A well-established exception to  this rule, however, provides that an innkeeper is 'under  an ordinary duty of care to [a guest] after he knows or  has reason to know the [guest] is ill or injured.'"" De La  Flor v. Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co., L.L.C., 2013 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 5403, 2013 WL 148401, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 14,  2013) (quoting L.A. Fitness, Int'l, LLC v. Mayer, 980 So.  2d 550, 557 (Fla. 4th DCA 2008)); see also Abramson v.  Ritz Carlton Hotel Co., LLC, 480 F. App'x 158, 161 (3d  Cir. 2012) (""Generally, there is no duty to affirmatively  assist an injured person unless a special relationship,  such as that between an innkeeper and its guests,  exists between the parties."" (citation omitted)). Vocisano argues that hotels only have a limited duty to  render aid to a guest it knew or should have known was  ill or injured, and that the Complaint contains no  plausible facts to suggest Vocisano knew plaintiff was in  need of aid. (Doc. #22, p. 20.) However, the Court finds  the Complaint contains sufficient allegations to satisfy  this requirement. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 99, 100, 224.) (6) Aiding and Abetting, Harboring, Confining,  Coercion and Criminal Enterprise Finally, Count Six of the Complaint asserts a claim of  aiding and abetting against Vocisano. (Doc. #1, ¶ 229.)  The Complaint accuses Vocisano of ""aiding and  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *39 Page 15 of 15 abetting  unlawful  activity  including  unlawful  confinement, [*43]  imprisonment, assault and battery  by [plaintiff's] sex traffickers and 'Johns.'"" (Id.) Vocisano  argues that the claim must be dismissed because it is  overly  vague,  fails  to  articulate  a  cognizable,  independent cause of action, and lacks well-pled factual  allegations. (Doc. #22, p. 21.) The Court disagrees. Florida courts have recognized aiding and abetting the  commission of a tort as a standalone claim. See Gilison  v. Flagler Bank, 303 So. 3d 999, 1002 (Fla. 4th DCA  2020) (aiding and abetting fraud); MP, LLC v. Sterling  Holding, LLC, 231 So. 3d 517, 527 (Fla. 3d DCA 2017)  (aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty). This Court  has previously listed the following elements that must be  alleged ""to state a claim for aiding and abetting a  common law tort"" under Florida law: ""(1) an underlying  violation on the part of the primary wrongdoer; (2)  knowledge of the underlying violation by the alleged  aider and abetter [sic]; and (3) the rendering of  substantial assistance in committing the wrongdoing by  the alleged aider and abettor."" Angell v. Allergan Sales,  LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142768, 2019 WL 3958262,  at *8 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 22, 2019); see also Lawrence v.  Bank of Am., N.A., 455 F. App'x 904, 906 (11th Cir.  2012) (applying the above elements to three Florida tort  claims). These cases demonstrate Florida recognizes a  common-law claim of aiding and abetting tortious  conduct. The  Court  finds  plaintiff's  allegations  are  not  impermissibly vague and, to the extent they allege  actual knowledge, are [*44]  sufficient to state a claim.  Therefore, the Court denies Vocisano's request for  dismissal. C. Anonymity Finally, Choice argues that plaintiff is not entitled to  proceed anonymously as a matter of right, and that  plaintiff must be required to file a formal motion to do so.  (Doc. #20, p. 39.) On February 24, 2021, plaintiff filed a  Motion to Proceed Anonymously and for Entry of a  Protective Order. (Doc. #57.) Therefore, this issue is  moot.          Accordingly, it is now ORDERED: 1. Defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc.'s  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Third Amended  Complaint With Prejudice (Doc. #20) is DENIED. 2. Defendant Robert Vocisano's Motion to Dismiss  With  Prejudice  Plaintiff's  Complaint  and  Incorporated Memorandum of Law (Doc. #22) is  DENIED. DONE AND ORDERED at Fort Myers, Florida, this 17th  day of May, 2021. /s/ John E. Steele JOHN E. STEELE SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92779, *42",1
C.S. v. Wyndham Hotels,"[*1291]  OPINION AND ORDER This matter comes before the Court on review of the  following three motions to dismiss: (1) defendant H.I.  Naples, LLC's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint,  Motion to Strike, and Incorporated Memorandum of Law  (Doc. #17), filed on September 22, 2020; (2) defendant  Hanuman of Naples, LLC's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's  Complaint, Motion to Strike, and  [*1292]  Memorandum  of Law in Support Thereof (Doc. #19), filed [**2]  on  October 2, 2020; and (3) defendant Wyndham Hotels &  Resorts, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint  (Doc. #26), filed on October 9, 2020. Plaintiff filed a  Memorandum in Opposition to each motion (Doc. #32;  Doc. #44; Doc. #43) on October 20th, November 4th,  and November 6, 2020. Defendant Wyndham Hotels &  Resorts, Inc. filed a Reply (Doc. #51) on November 30,  2020. For the reasons set forth below, the motions are  denied. I. The origins of this case began on October 30, 2019,  when plaintiff and another alleged victim of sex  trafficking filed a case in the Circuit Court of the  Twentieth Judicial Circuit in and for Collier County,  Florida. See S.Y. et al v. Naples Hotel Co. et al, Case  No. 2:20-cv-118 (Doc. #1, p. 3). On December 31, 2019,  the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint which  Page 2 of 14 asserted ten claims against over forty defendants. Id. at  (Doc. #1, pp. 2-4). The case was removed to federal  court in February 2020. Id. at (Doc. #1). On April 15,  2020, the plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint.  Id. at (Doc. #85). On August 5, 2020, the undersigned  denied various motions to dismiss, but determined  severance of the parties was appropriate. S.Y. v. Naples  Hotel Co., 476 F. Supp. 3d 1251, 1258-59 (M.D. Fla.  2020). Following the Court's severance [**3]  order,  plaintiff and the other alleged victim filed nearly thirty  new actions against various defendants, including this  case. The Complaint (Doc. #1) in this case was filed on  August 19, 2020, and alleges that plaintiff C.S., a  resident of Collier County, Florida, was a victim of  continuous sex trafficking at a certain Days Inn Hotel  in Naples, Florida (the Days Inn Hotel) between 2015  and February 2016. (Id. at ¶¶ 14, 23-25.) The Complaint  alleges that during this time period the Days Inn Hotel  was operated by various entities as franchisees of  defendant  Wyndham  Hotels  &  Resorts,  Inc.  (Wyndham). The Days Inn Hotel was operated by  defendant Hanuman of Naples, LLC (Hanuman) from an  unspecified date until 2015. (Id. at ¶¶ 26, 27.) In 2015,  Hanuman sold the Days Inn Hotel to defendant H.I.  Naples, LLC (H.I. Naples), which operated the hotel until  2016. (Id. at ¶¶ 27-28.) In 2016, H.I. Naples sold the  Days Inn Hotel to defendant Shree Siddhivinayak  Hospitality, LLC (Shree). (Id. at ¶ 28.) In 2019, Shree  sold the Days Inn Hotel to a non-party, who converted it  to a Holiday Inn Express and operated it as a franchisee  of defendant Holiday Hospitality Franchising, LLC. (Id.  at ¶ 34.) The Complaint [**4]  alleges the following six claims: (1)  violation  of  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), 18 U.S.C. §  1595; (2) violation of the Florida RICO statute, §  772.104, Florida Statutes; (3) premise liability; (4)  negligent hiring, supervision, and retention; (5) negligent  rescue; and (6) aiding and abetting, harboring,  confining, coercion, and criminal enterprise. (Id. pp. 35- 53.) Counts One through Four are asserted against  each defendant, while Counts Five and Six are asserted  against only Hanuman, Shree, and H.I. Naples. (Id.)       II. The H.I. Naples, Wyndham, and Hanuman motions  raise numerous arguments as  [*1293]  to why the  Complaint as whole, and each individual claim, should  be dismissed. The Court will address each of these  arguments in turn. A. Shotgun Pleading Hanuman and Wyndham both argue the Complaint  must be dismissed as a shotgun pleading. (Doc. #19,  pp. 4-6; Doc. #26, pp. 5-6.) The Complaint identifies  Wyndham,  Hanuman,  Shree,  and  H.I.  Naples  collectively as the ""Days Inn Defendants."" (Doc. #1, p. 1,  introductory paragraph.) Hanuman and Wyndham argue  that because the Complaint groups these four  defendants together, it should be dismissed as a  shotgun pleading. (Doc. #19, pp. 5-6; Doc. #26, pp. 5- 6.) One way in which a complaint may constitute an  impermissible shotgun [**5]  pleading is if it ""assert[s]  multiple claims against multiple defendants without  specifying which of the defendants are responsible for  which acts or omissions, or which of the defendants the  claim is brought against."" Weiland v. Palm Beach Cty.  Sheriff's Office, 792 F.3d 1313, 1323 (11th Cir. 2015);  see also Barmapov v. Amuial, 986 F.3d 1321, 2021 WL  359632, at *2 (11th Cir. 2021). Such a pleading fails ""to  give the defendants adequate notice of the claims  against them and the grounds upon which each claim  rests,"" Weiland, 792 F.3d at 1323, and violates the  requirement that a plaintiff provide ""a short and plain  statement of the claim,"" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The Complaint does indeed repeatedly refer to the four  defendants collectively as the ""Days Inn Defendants.""  See (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 2-3, 8, 18, 36, 46, 48, 72, 74, 96, 102,  109, 121, 128-29.) The failure to specify a particular  defendant is not fatal, however, when ""[t]he complaint  can be fairly read to aver that all defendants are  responsible for the alleged conduct."" Kyle K. v.  Chapman, 208 F.3d 940, 944 (11th Cir. 2000). The  Complaint typically (but not always) alleges that ""each  and every"" such defendant was involved in the activity      538 F. Supp. 3d 1284, *1292; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88323, **2 Page 3 of 14 described in the particular paragraph of the Complaint.  A fair reading of the Complaint is that each of these  defendants was involved in the identified conduct  attributed to the ""Days Inn Defendants."" While  defendants may disagree that such allegations [**6]  are  accurate, that dispute is for another day. The group  allegations do not fail to state a claim, Auto. Alignment &  Body Serv., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 953  F.3d 707, 732-33 (11th Cir. 2020), and the Complaint  does not constitute a shotgun pleading. B. Redundant and Immaterial Factual Allegations H.I. Naples and Hanuman argue that the Complaint is  ""replete with redundant and conclusory allegations"" that  each defendant ""knew or should have known of the  prevalence of sex trafficking at hotels and motels,  knew or should have known sex trafficking and other  illegal activities were occurring at its hotel, and failed to  take actions to prevent them from occurring so it could  earn a profit."" (Doc. #17, pp. 3-4; Doc. #19, pp. 6-7.) H.I.  Naples and Hanuman request the Court strike such  allegations, arguing they are redundant and immaterial,  constitute an impermissible attempt to ""puff"" the facts  against the defendants, and serve only to confuse the  issues and cause prejudice. (Id.) Pursuant to Rule 12(f), a party may move to strike ""any  redundant,  immaterial,   [*1294]   impertinent,  or  scandalous matter"" within the pleadings. The Court  enjoys broad discretion in determining whether to grant  or deny a motion to strike. Anchor Hocking Corp. v.  Jacksonville Elec. Auth., 419 F. Supp. 992, 1000 (M.D.  Fla. 1976). ""The purpose of a motion to strike is to clean  up the pleadings, streamline litigation, [**7]  and avoid  unnecessary forays into immaterial matters."" Hutchings  v. Fed. Ins. Co., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75334, 2008 WL  4186994, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 8, 2008) (marks and  citation omitted). It is not intended to ""procure the  dismissal of all or part of a complaint."" Id. A motion to  strike is a drastic remedy and is disfavored by the  courts. Schmidt v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 289 F.R.D.  357, 358 (M.D. Fla. 2012). Therefore, a motion to strike  should be granted only if ""the matter sought to be  omitted has no possible relationship to the controversy,  may confuse the issues, or otherwise prejudice a party.""  Id. It is accurate to say that the Complaint alleges that  defendants knew or should have known a great number  of  things.  Allegations  regarding  the  defendants'  knowledge of the prevalence of sex trafficking at hotels  in general and at their hotel in particular, and the failure  to prevent it, are relevant to the types of claims plaintiff  asserts. S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1259 n.5. The Court  does not find that the allegations identified by  defendants are overly redundant or unduly prejudicial,  and the ""drastic remedy"" of striking the allegations is not  justified.  Accordingly,  the  request  to  strike  the  allegations is denied. C. Failure to State a Claim Each defendant argues certain claims should be  dismissed due to plaintiff's failure to state a claim upon  which relief may be granted. (Doc. #17, [**8]  pp. 4-9;  Doc. #19, pp. 7-11; Doc. #26, pp. 6-24.) Federal Rule of  Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires that a complaint contain  a ""short and plain statement of the claim showing that  the pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  This obligation ""requires more than labels and  conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements  of a cause of action will not do."" Bell Atl. Corp. v.  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L.  Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). To survive  dismissal, the factual allegations must be ""plausible""  and ""must be enough to raise a right to relief above the  speculative level."" Id. at 555; see also Edwards v. Prime  Inc., 602 F.3d 1276, 1291 (11th Cir. 2010). This requires  ""more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully- harmed-me accusation."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,  678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009)  (citations omitted). In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court  must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true  and take them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197,  167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal conclusions  without adequate factual support are entitled to no  assumption of truth,"" Mamani v. Berzaín, 654 F.3d  1148, 1153 (11th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted).  ""Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of  action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do  not suffice."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Factual allegations  that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability fall  short of being facially plausible. Chaparro v. Carnival  Corp., 693 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir. 2012) (citations  omitted). Thus, the Court engages in a two-step  approach: ""When there [**9]  are well-pleaded factual  allegations, a court should assume their veracity and  then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an  entitlement to relief."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. 538 F. Supp. 3d 1284, *1293; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88323, **5 Page 4 of 14  [*1295]  (1) Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act Wyndham challenges the one federal claim, the alleged  violation of the TVPRA set forth in Count One. (Doc.  #26, p. 6.) The TVPRA provides a civil remedy to  victims of certain types of human trafficking. The civil  remedy portion of the Act provides: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). The phrase ""a violation of this  chapter"" refers to Chapter 77 of Title 18 of the United  States Code. The only violation of Chapter 77 relevant  to this case is contained in 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a), which  provides in relevant part: (a) Whoever knowingly - (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign  commerce . . . recruits, entices, harbors, [**10]   transports,  provides,  obtains,  advertises,  maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any means  a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything  of value, from participation in a venture which  has engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). To state a section 1595(a) claim in  this case, plaintiff must plausibly allege that she was a  victim of a criminal offense under section 1591(a), and  then must plausibly allege that defendant (1)""knowingly  benefit[ted] financially or by receiving anything of value,""  (2) from participation in a venture, (3) which defendant  ""knew or should have known has engaged in"" sex  trafficking under section 1591(a). S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d  at 1255-56 (citing A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 455 F. Supp.  3d 171, 181 (E.D. Pa. 2020)). Wyndham argues the Complaint's allegations are  insufficient to state a claim under section 1595(a),  asserting four pleading deficiencies. (Doc. #26, pp. 6- 16.)  [**11] (a) ""Participation"" in a ""Venture"" Wyndham first argues that the Complaint lacks well-pled  allegations that it participated in a ""venture,"" as required  by section 1595(a). (Doc. #26, p. 6-10.) Drawing on the  definition of ""venture"" used in the criminal portion of the  statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(6) , Wyndham asserts that  a ""venture"" requires two or more individuals ""associated  in fact."" (Id., pp. 6-8.) Borrowing from the federal RICO  definition of ""enterprise,"" Wyndham argues  [*1296]   that ""associated in fact"" requires that persons must  operate as a ""continuing unit that functions with a  common purpose."" (Id., p. 7.) Wyndham continues that  in the context of a TVPRA claim against a hotel  operator, the Complaint must ""at least"" allege a  ""continuous business relationship between the trafficker  and the hotels such that it would appear that the  trafficker and the hotels have established a pattern of  conduct or could be said to have a tacit agreement."" (Id.  p. 8) (quoting M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.,  425 F. Supp. 3d 959, 970 (S.D. Ohio 2019)); see also  Doe v. Rickey Patel, LLC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 30,  2020)(""In order to plead Defendants participated in a  venture, Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court  could reasonably infer the hotels could be said to have a  tacit agreement with the trafficker."" (marks omitted)).  Wyndham  concludes  that  ""[a]  commercial [**12]   relationship, such as a hotel owner renting a hotel room,  does not give rise to a reasonable inference that the  participants in such a relationship shared a common  purpose or otherwise 'associated in fact.'"" (Doc. #26, p.  8.)          538 F. Supp. 3d 1284, *1294; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88323, **9 Page 5 of 14 Here, the Complaint alleges Wyndham participated in a  venture ""by engaging in a pattern of acts and omissions  that were intended to support, facilitate, harbor, and  otherwise further the traffickers' sale and victimization of  the Plaintiff C.S. for commercial sexual exploitation by  repeatedly renting rooms at Days Inn Hotel to people""  Wyndham ""knew or should have known were engaged  in sex trafficking."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 171.) The Complaint  also alleges why Wyndham should have been on notice  of the sex trafficking and how it failed to prevent it. (Id.  ¶¶ 5-17, 64-92, 126.) The Court finds the allegations in  the Complaint sufficient to allege participation in a  venture under section 1595(a). See Doe, 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, at *5 (""The  Court finds it sufficient for Plaintiff to plead that  Defendants participated in a venture by renting rooms to  individuals that knew or should have known were  involved in a sex-trafficking venture, including the sex- trafficking victim.""); M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 971 (""This  Court finds Plaintiff has alleged sufficient [**13]  facts to  show Defendants 'participated in a venture' under §  1595 by alleging that Defendants rented rooms to  people it knew or should have known where [sic]  engaged in sex trafficking.""). Wyndham also argues that ""participation"" in a venture  requires an allegation of an overt act in furtherance of  the venture, and that failure to prevent sex trafficking is  not such an overt act. (Doc. #26, pp. 8-9.) The Court is  not convinced. S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1256 (""In the  absence of any controlling authority, the Court  concludes  that  actual  'participation  in  the  sex  trafficking act itself' is not required to state a claim  under section 1595. Accordingly, plaintiffs' failure to  allege such actual participation is not fatal to its section  1595 claim under the TVPRA.""). Wyndham has not  identified any controlling authority to the contrary. (b) Knowingly Benefited From Participating in  Venture Wyndham next argues that the Complaint insufficiently  alleges that it knowingly benefitted from participating in  a  venture  that  committed  TVPRA  crimes,  with  knowledge of the causal relationship. (Doc. #26, p. 10.)  Wyndham asserts that the allegation that it financially  benefited  [*1297]  from its relationship with the  franchisees because it received franchise fees is  insufficient, [**14]  since that money is not ""from"" any    act by Wyndham that could plausibly constitute  ""participation"" in a TVPRA ""venture"". (Id., pp. 10-11.) The Complaint alleges the defendants knowingly  benefited from the sex trafficking of plaintiff ""by  receiving payment for the rooms rented for Plaintiff C.S.  and her traffickers at the Days Inn Hotel,"" and by  receiving ""other financial benefits in the form of food and  beverage sales and ATM fees from those persons who  were engaging in sex trafficking."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 169.) As  to Wyndham as franchisor, the Complaint alleges it  ""received a significant franchise fee and continuous  royalties on the Days Inn Hotel's gross revenue,"" while  also exercising ""ongoing and systematic control over  operations at the Dyas Inn Hotel."" (Id. at ¶¶ 52, 123.)  The Court finds such allegations sufficient to satisfy the  ""knowingly benefitted"" element. S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at  1257; Doe S.W. v. Lorain-Elyria Motel, Inc., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192, at *5 (S.D. Ohio  Mar. 16, 2020); H.H. v. G6 Hosp., LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *2 (S.D. Ohio  Dec. 6, 2019); M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 965. (c) Knew or Should Have Known that Venture was  Committing Sex Trafficking Crimes Wyndham argues the Complaint fails to plausibly allege  that it knew or should have known that the ""venture""  was engaging in sex-trafficking crimes, i.e., that  Wyndham knew or should have known that an adult  plaintiff was caused to engage in [**15]  commercial sex  by force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion. (Doc. #26,  p. 11-13.) Rather, Wyndham argues, the Complaint only  alleges that the hotel staff did not interfere with plaintiff  and witnessed indicia of commercial sex activity. (Id., p.  11.) Wyndham argues that the allegations do not give  rise to a reasonable inference that it knew or should  have known about any commercial sex activity at the  Days Inn Hotel, let alone that it was forced activity. (Id.,  pp. 11-12.) The Court disagrees with this argument. First of all,  ""knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind  may be alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b); see Sun  Life Assurance Co. of Can. v. Imperial Premium Fin.,  LLC, 904 F.3d 1197, 1215 (11th Cir. 2018). Pleading  ""generally"" is not without limits, and a complaint must  still comply with ""the less rigid—though still operative— strictures of Rule 8."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 686-87. The  Complaint clearly satisfies this notice pleading standard. Plaintiff has alleged that the following was ""routine  conduct taking place at the Days Inn Hotel as a result of  538 F. Supp. 3d 1284, *1296; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88323, **12 Page 6 of 14 the human sex trafficking enterprise"": a. Plaintiff's sex traffickers frequently rented rooms  at the hotel close to each other; b. Plaintiffs' [sic] sex traffickers paid cash for the  rooms at the Days Inn Hotel where the Plaintiff  engaged in commercial sex acts; c. Plaintiff's [**16]  sex traffickers booked extended  stays at the Days Inn Hotel for themselves and for  the Plaintiff on a routine basis and on a rotating  basis frequently throughout the year; d. Plaintiff and her sex traffickers would have few or  no luggage or personal possessions for these  extended stays; e. Plaintiff was confined in the rooms at the Days  Inn Hotel for long periods of time; f. Plaintiff's rooms and her sex traffickers' rooms  consistently displayed  [*1298]  ""Do Not Disturb""  signs on the doors to the room where the Plaintiff  was engaged in commercial sex acts; g. Men (""Johns"") frequently entered and left the  rooms at the Days Inn Hotel where the Plaintiff was  engaged in illegal commercial sex acts at all times  of day and night; h. The staff and customers at the Days Inn Hotel  that was owned, operated, managed, supervised,  controlled and/or otherwise held responsible by  each and every Days Inn Defendant saw that the  rooms where the Plaintiff engaged in commercial  sex acts were messy, and contained sex and drug  paraphernalia and had an unclean smell; i. Plaintiff recalls at least one Days Inn Hotel  maintenance employee would frequent rooms  where sex trafficking victims were being held; j. Plaintiff C.S. [**17]  was often tortured and raped  in the Days Inn Hotel rooms on the Days Inn Hotel  property; k. The rooms at the Days Inn Hotel were filled with  evidence of sex trafficking and drug use; l. Plaintiff's sex traffickers consistently refused  housekeeping  services  and  otherwise  would  prohibit staff from entering their rooms and the  Plaintiff's rooms; m. Plaintiff would frequently request clean towels  and linens; n. Plaintiff dressed in a sexually explicit manner and  would walk the hallways of the Days Inn Defendant; o. Excessively loud noises would consistently come  from Plaintiff's rooms; p. During nighttime hours, Plaintiff and her ""Johns""  and drug clients would create noise at the Days Inn  Hotel and, upon information and belief, would be a  disturbance to other guests using the hotel for their  intended purposes; and q. While at the hotel, the Plaintiff displayed clear  signs of physical abuse, diminished personal  hygiene, submissiveness and inappropriate attire. (Doc. #1, ¶ 107.) Further, the Complaint alleges  Wyndham, along with the other defendants, ""knew or  should have known about the nature of the sex  trafficking venture at the Days Inn Hotel, including as  they related to Plaintiff C.S."" due [**18]  to the following: a. Requests by the traffickers to rent rooms near  exit doors; b. Cash payments for the rooms by the sex  traffickers; c. Refusal of housekeeping services by those  persons engaged in sex trafficking; d. Excessive used condoms located in the rooms  used for sex trafficking; e. Excessive requests for towels and linens in the  rooms used for sex trafficking; f. Hotel staff observing Plaintiff C.S. and her  traffickers in the hotel; g. Plaintiff C.S. being escorted by traffickers in and  around the hotel; h. Operation of sex trafficking ventures out of the  same hotel room for multiple days or weeks in  succession; i. Multiple men per day coming and going from the  same  rooms  without  luggage  or  personal  possessions; j. Hotel staff directly participating in the sex  trafficking of Plaintiff C.S.; and k. Knowledge of police and EMS activity at the  Days Inn Hotel and at other locations near the Days  Inn  [*1299]  Hotel that was related to commercial  sex work. (Id. ¶ 170.) The  Court  finds  these  allegations  sufficient  to  538 F. Supp. 3d 1284, *1297; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88323, **15 Page 7 of 14 reasonably infer the defendants knew or should have  known of the sex trafficking venture. S.Y., 476 F.  Supp. 3d at 1257; A.B., 455 F. Supp. 3d at 193-94; Doe  S.W., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192,  at *5-6; H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL  6682152, at *3; M.A., 425 F. Supp 3d at 967-68. (d) Vicarious Liability Finally, Wyndham suggests the TVPRA claim should be  dismissed because [**19]  ""[v]icarious liability is not  viable under the TVPRA"". (Doc. #26, p. 13.) The Court  disagrees. See S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1257-58  (finding  plaintiff  made  sufficient  allegations  that  franchisor was vicariously liable under section 1595 of  the TVPRA to survive dismissal); see also J.C. v.  Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073,  2020 WL 6318707, at *10 (N.D. Ca. Oct. 28, 2020)  (finding plaintiff's vicarious liability claim had ""alleged  sufficient facts to support a plausible claim that  [defendants] received financial benefits from a venture  they vicariously participate in (through their franchisees)  that the franchises should have known was engaged in  sex trafficking.""). Wyndham also argues that even if it could be held  vicariously liable under the TVPRA, plaintiff's allegations  ""do not give rise to a plausible inference of an agency  relationship"" between Wyndham and the franchisees.  (Doc. #26, p. 14.) Wyndham argues that because the  Landham Act requires some degree of supervision by a  franchisor, such supervision cannot be the basis for  liability. (Id., pp. 14-16.) The Court finds that the  allegations in the Complaint do create such a plausible  inference. ""It is well-established that a franchise relationship does  not by itself create an agency relationship between the  franchisor and franchisee."" Cain v. Shell Oil Co., 994 F.  Supp. 2d 1251, 1252 (N.D. Fla. 2014). However,  ""[f]ranchisors may well enter [**20]  into an agency  relationship with a franchisee if, by contract or action or  representation, the franchisor has directly or apparently  participated in some substantial way in directing or  managing acts of the franchisee, beyond the mere fact  of providing contractual franchise support activities.""  Mobil Oil Corp. v. Bransford, 648 So. 2d 119, 120 (Fla.  1995). Here, the Complaint alleges Wyndham was in an  agency relationship with H.I Naples, Hanuman, and  Shree during the relevant time period. (Doc. #1, ¶ 122.)  The Complaint further asserts that in a variety of ways  Wyndham exercised control over the means and  methods of how those defendants conducted business,  such as by profit sharing, standardized training,  standardized rules of operation, regular inspection, and  price fixing. (Id. at ¶ 124.) The Court finds such  allegations sufficient to support a plausible inference of  an agency relationship. See S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at  1258; A.B., 455 F. Supp. 3d at 195-97; Doe S.W., 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192, at *7; H.H.,  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at  *6; M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 972.  [*1300]  Because the allegations in the Complaint are  sufficient to state a claim under section 1595 of the  TVPRA, the Court denies Wyndham's motion for  dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). (2) Florida RICO Violation Count Two of the Complaint asserts a claim against all  defendants under Florida's civil RICO statute, section  772.104, Florida Statutes. (Doc. #1, p. 37.) To state a  claim under the statute, plaintiff must allege plausible  facts [**21]  showing ""(1) conduct or participation in an  enterprise through (2) a pattern of [criminal] activity.""  Horace-Manasse v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 521 F.                            538 F. Supp. 3d 1284, *1299; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88323, **18 Page 8 of 14 App'x 782, 784 (11th Cir. 2013) (quoting Lugo v. State,  845 So. 2d 74, 97 (Fla. 2003)).  Each of the motions argue plaintiff has insufficiently pled  the enterprise element of her claim. (Doc. #17, pp. 4-5;  Doc. #19, p. 7; Doc. #26, pp. 17-18.) Florida's RICO  statute defines enterprise to include a ""group of  individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.""  §  772.102(3),  Fla.  Stat.  ""[A]n  association-in-fact  enterprise is simply a continuing unit that functions with  a common purpose."" Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S.  938, 948, 129 S. Ct. 2237, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1265 (2009).  To sufficiently plead such an enterprise, ""a plaintiff must  allege that a group of persons shares three structural  features: (1) a purpose, (2) relationships among those  associated with the enterprise, and (3) longevity  sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the  enterprise's purpose."" Cisneros v. Petland, Inc., 972  F.3d 1204, 1211 (11th Cir. 2020) (marks and citations  omitted). The motions argue the Complaint fails to  sufficiently allege a ""common purpose"" among the  defendants. (Doc. #17, pp. 4-5; Doc. #19, p. 7; Doc.  #26, pp. 17-18.) ""The purpose prong contemplates 'a common purpose  of engaging in a course of conduct' among the  enterprise's alleged participants."" Cisneros, 972 F.3d at  1211 (quoting United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576,  583, 101 S. Ct. 2524, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1981)). ""An  abstract common purpose, such as a generally shared  interest [**22]  in making money, will not suffice. Rather,  where the participants' ultimate purpose is to make  money for themselves, a RICO plaintiff must plausibly  allege that the participants shared the purpose of  enriching themselves through a particular criminal  course of conduct."" Id. (citations omitted). Here, the Complaint alleges Wyndham, Hanuman,  Shree and H.I. Naples ""associated with each other  and/or the  [*1301]  Plaintiff C.S.'s sex traffickers for the  common purpose of profiting off an established sex  trafficking scheme."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 179.) Plaintiff asserts  this ""association-in-fact"" constitutes an ""enterprise""  under Florida's RICO statute, and that the defendants          conducted or participated in their enterprises through a  pattern of criminal activity, ""related by their common  purpose to profit off an institutionalized sex trafficking  scheme."" (Id. at ¶¶ 179-80.) The Court finds these  allegations sufficient to allege the defendants ""shared  the purpose of enriching themselves through a particular  criminal course of conduct."" Cisneros, 972 F.3d at 1211;  see also United States v. Church, 955 F.2d 688, 697-98  (11th Cir. 1992) (noting that ""an association's devotion  to 'making money from repeated criminal activity' . . .  demonstrates an enterprise's 'common purpose of  engaging in a course [**23]  of conduct'"" (citations  omitted)); Burgese v. Starwood Hotel & Resorts  Worldwide, Inc., 101 F. Supp. 3d 414, 424 (D. N.J.  2015) (on a motion to dismiss Florida RICO claim, the  court found that ""Plaintiff's Amended Complaint can be  read to allege a 'common purpose' of furthering an  institutionalized prostitution scheme to increase profits  for the participants,"" and that ""[t]hese allegations,  though thin, are sufficient for purposes of this motion.""). Each of the motions also argues the Complaint fails to  sufficiently plead the ""pattern of criminal activity""  element. (Doc. #17, p. 5; Doc. #19, pp. 7-8); Doc. #26,  pp. 18-19.) As previously stated, ""[i]n order to state a  civil cause of action under the Florida RICO Act, a  plaintiff must allege a pattern of criminal activity."" Arthur  v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA, 569 F. App'x 669, 682  (11th Cir. 2014) (citing §§ 772.103-104, Fla. Stat.). The  statute's definition of ""criminal activity"" provides ""that a  particular state law crime can serve as the predicate act  for a RICO claim if it is 'chargeable by indictment or  information' and falls within a series of specified  provisions."" Id. (citing § 772.102(1)(a), Fla. Stat.). ""In  order to establish a pattern of criminal activity, the  plaintiff must allege two or more criminal acts 'that have  the same or similar intents, results, accomplices,  victims, or methods of commission' that occurred within  a five-year time [**24]  span."" Id. at 680 (citing §  772.102(4), Fla. Stat.). As noted by Wyndham (Doc. #26, p. 19), plaintiff's  Florida RICO claim is predicated on the commission of  human trafficking crimes in violation of section 787.06,  Florida Statutes. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 181, 183); see also §  772.102(1)(a)15., Fla. Stat. (listing ""human trafficking""  under Chapter 787 among the types of ""criminal activity""  covered by the Florida RICO statute). This provision  provides various punishments for ""[a]ny person who  knowingly, or in reckless disregard of the facts, engages  in human trafficking, or attempts to engage in human  trafficking, or benefits financially by receiving anything  of value from participation in a venture that has  538 F. Supp. 3d 1284, *1300; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88323, **21 Page 9 of 14 subjected a person to human trafficking."" § 787.06(3),  Fla. Stat. Given the similarity between this language and  the TVPRA's civil liability provision, Wyndham argues  the Florida RICO claim fails ""for the same reasons that  Plaintiff failed to state a TVPRA claim."" (Doc. #26, p.  19.) The Court has, however, determined plaintiff's  TVPRA claim is sufficiently pled, and therefore rejects  Wyndham's argument as to the Florida RICO claim. H.I. Naples and Hanuman also argue the RICO claim  must be dismissed because the Complaint groups the  defendants together, and therefore it does not plausibly  allege the defendants [**25]  committed two or more  predicate acts. (Doc. #17, p. 5; Doc. #19, pp. 7-8.) The  Court disagrees.  [*1302]  The Complaint, which  contains the general dates in which each defendant  controlled the Days Inn Hotel, alleges sex trafficking  occurred ""repeatedly"" at the Days Inn Hotel between  2015 and February 2016, and provides examples of the  times in which plaintiff herself was trafficked at the  hotel. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 93, 99, 182.) Viewing the allegations  in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the Court finds this  sufficient to allege two or more predicate acts. Finally, H.I. Naples and Hanuman argue the Complaint  contains insufficient allegations regarding causation.  (Doc. #17, p. 5; Doc. #19, p. 8.) Under the Florida RICO  statute, a plaintiff must demonstrate that their injuries  were proximately caused by the RICO violations. See  Bortell v. White Mountains Ins. Grp., Ltd., 2 So. 3d  1041, 1047 (Fla. 4th DCA 2009). ""A wrongful act is a  proximate cause if it is a substantive factor in the  sequence of responsible causation."" Green Leaf  Nursery v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours & Co., 341 F.3d  1292, 1307 (11th Cir. 2003) (marks and citation  omitted). Furthermore, a plaintiff ""must show a 'direct  relation between the injury asserted and the injurious  conduct alleged.'"" Id. (quoting Holmes v. Sec. Inv'r Prot.  Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268, 112 S. Ct. 1311, 117 L. Ed.  2d 532 (1992)). ""Indirect harm is insufficient to sustain a  cause of action under the RICO statutes."" Bortell, 2 So.  3d at 1047; see also [**26]  O'Malley, 599 So. 2d at  1000 (""[I]ndirect injuries, that is, injuries sustained not as  a direct result of predicate acts . . . will not allow  recovery under Florida RICO.""). H.I. Naples and Hanuman assert that because they are  only ""accused of profiting from the sex trafficking  venture as passive participants,"" ""any alleged injuries  are not the direct result of predicate acts."" (Doc. #17, p.  5; Doc. #19, p. 8.) Plaintiff responds that she has  sufficiently pled proximate cause and consequential  damages by alleging she ""was at the Days Inn as part of  the sexual trafficking scheme and her injuries were  caused by and in furtherance of the sexual trafficking  scheme."" (Doc. #32, pp. 12-13; Doc. #44, p. 14.) Having  reviewed the allegations in the Complaint, the Court  agrees with plaintiff. The Complaint alleges each of the Days Inn Hotel  defendants ""was on notice of repeated incidents of sex  trafficking occurring on their hotel premises,"" and yet  ""failed to take the necessary actions to prevent sex  trafficking from taking place."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 69.) The  Complaint also alleges numerous ways in which these  defendants could have identified and prevented the sex  trafficking  from  occurring.  (Id.  at  ¶¶  71-86.)  Finally, [**27]  the Complaint alleges the ""acts and  omissions of the Days Inn Defendants served to  support, facilitate, harbor, and otherwise further the  traffickers' sale and victimization"" of plaintiff ""for  commercial sexual exploitation by repeatedly renting  rooms to people they knew or should have known were  engaged in sex trafficking."" (Id. at ¶ 137.) ""[B]y  knowingly, or with reckless disregard, repeatedly  allowing sex trafficking to occur on their premises  between 2015 and 2016,"" the defendants' ""acts have  yielded  consistent   [*1303]   results  and  caused  economic, physical, and psychological injuries"" to  plaintiff. (Id. at ¶¶ 182, 185.) The Court finds these allegations sufficient to plead a  ""direct relation between the injury asserted and the  injurious conduct alleged,"" Holmes, 503 U.S. at 268,  and  therefore  the  Complaint  adequately  pleads  proximate cause. See Burgese, 101 F. Supp. 3d at 422  (finding allegations of physical injury and mental  anguish ""cognizable under the Florida RICO Act"" and  sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss); cf. Berber,  2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 234385, 2018 WL 10436236, at  *5 (""Because Plaintiffs' asserted injuries arise from a set                538 F. Supp. 3d 1284, *1301; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88323, **24 Page 10 of 14 of actions entirely distinct form [sic] the alleged  predicate RICO violations, proximate cause is lacking as  a matter of law.""). (3) Premise Liability Count Three [**28]  of the Complaint asserts a claim of  premise liability against all the defendants. (Doc. #1, ¶  191.) A premise liability claim is a form of negligence  action. ""The elements for negligence are duty, breach,  harm, and proximate cause; the additional elements for  a claim of premises liability include the defendant's  possession or control of the premises and notice of the  dangerous condition."" Lisanti v. City of Port Richey, 787  So. 2d 36, 37 (Fla. 2d DCA 2001). Plaintiff alleges the  defendants owed her a variety of duties, that they  breached these duties, and that as a direct and  proximate result, she suffered bodily injury. (Doc. #1, ¶¶  198-212.) Plaintiff also alleges the defendants had  actual or constructive knowledge of sex trafficking  occurring on the premises, that they knew or should  have known the risk of such criminal conduct taking  place would be unreasonably high without appropriate  precautions, and that they had actual or constructive  knowledge of the dangerous conditions plaintiff was in.  (Id. at ¶¶ 203-05.) (a) Statute of Limitations The three motions argue the premise liability claim  should be dismissed because it is barred by the relevant  statute of limitations. (Doc. #17, p. 6; Doc. #19, pp. 8-9;  Doc. #26, p. 22.) Under Florida law, the [**29]  statute of  limitations for negligence claims is four years. §  95.11(3)(a), Fla. Stat. A statute of limitations bar is ""an affirmative defense,  and . . . plaintiff[s] [are] not required to negate an  affirmative defense in [their] complaint."" La Grasta v.  First Union Sec., Inc., 358 F.3d 840, 845 (11th Cir.  2004) (citation omitted). ""A dismissal for failure to state  a claim on statute of limitations grounds is appropriate  only if it is apparent from the face of the complaint that  the claim is time-barred."" United States ex rel. Hunt v.  Cochise Consultancy, Inc., 887 F.3d 1081, 1085 (11th  Cir. 2018) (marks and citation omitted). (1) Wyndham Plaintiff alleges the sex trafficking occurred at the Days  Inn Hotel ""from approximately 2015 through February  2016."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 93.) Wyndham argues that because  the Complaint was filed in August 2020, the premise  liability claim is time barred. (Doc. #26, p. 22.) ""Under Florida law, the statute of limitations begins to  run when the cause of action accrues."" Carnival Corp. v.  Rolls-Royce PLC, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107141, 2009  WL 3861482, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 17, 2009) (citing §  95.031, Fla. Stat.). ""A cause of action accrues when the  last element constituting the cause of action occurs."" §  95.031(1), Fla. Stat. ""Under the continuing tort doctrine,  the cause of action accrues when the tortious conduct  ceases."" Effs v. Sony Pictures [*1304]  Home Entm't,  Inc., 197 So. 3d 1243, 1244 (Fla. 3d DCA 2016)  (emphasis and citation omitted). ""A continuing tort is  established by continual tortious acts, not by continual  harmful effects from an original, completed act."" Id. at  1245 (marks, emphasis, [**30]  and citation omitted). Here, plaintiff alleges she was a repeat victim of sex  trafficking at the Days Inn Hotel between 2015 and  February 2016. The Court finds such allegations  sufficient to invoke the continuing tort doctrine. See Nat'l  Sourcing, Inc. v. Bracciale, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  199436 , 2018 WL 6172430, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 26,  2018) (finding allegation that a defendant's actions  ""continued to this day"" inferred continuous tortious  conduct, thereby making it plausible for the plaintiffs to  assert the continuing tort doctrine as a basis to toll the  statute of limitations). Accordingly, the Court finds that  plaintiff's premise liability claim did not accrue until  February 2016, and therefore she had until February  2020 to file a complaint asserting premises liability. Plaintiff met this deadline by filing her First Amended  Complaint against Wyndham on December 31, 2019.  S.Y. et al v. Naples Hotel Co. et al, Case No. 2:20-cv- 118 (Doc. #3). While the Court determined severance of  the parties was appropriate in the original action, S.Y.,  476 F. Supp. 3d at 1259, and this Complaint was filed in  August 2020, it appears that the December 2019 date is  applicable for statute of limitations purposes under the  relation-back provisions of Rule 15(c) of the Federal  Rules of Civil Procedure. Relation back is a legal fiction employed to salvage  claims that would otherwise be unjustly [**31]   barred by a limitations provision. See McCurdy v.  United States, 264 U.S. 484, 487, 44 S.Ct. 345,  346, 68 L.Ed. 801 (1924); Moore v. Baker, 989 F.2d  1129, 1131 (11th Cir. 1993). Under Rule 15, a claim  in an amended complaint relates back to the filing  date of the original complaint if it ""asserts a claim or  538 F. Supp. 3d 1284, *1303; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88323, **27 Page 11 of 14 defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction,  or occurrence set out—or attempted to be set out— in the original pleading."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B).  When the facts in the original complaint do not put  the defendant ""on notice that the new claims of  negligence might be asserted,"" but the new claims  instead ""involve[ ] separate and distinct conduct,""  such that the plaintiff would have to prove  ""completely different facts"" than required to recover  on the claims in the original complaint, the new  claims do not relate back. Moore, 989 F.2d at 1132. Caron v. NCL (Bahamas), Ltd., 910 F.3d 1359, 1368  (11th Cir. 2018). Accordingly, since it is not apparent  from the face of the Complaint that the claim is time- barred, dismissal based upon the statute of limitations  affirmative defense is not appropriate. For the same reasons, the Court rejects Wyndham's  arguments that plaintiff's negligent hiring, supervision,  and retention claim is also barred by the four-year  statute of limitations. (Doc. #26, p. 22.) (2) H.I. Naples and Hanuman H.I. Naples and Hanuman argue the premise liability  claim is barred because plaintiff did not bring her  claims [**32]  against them until April 2020. (Doc. #17,  p. 6; Doc. #19, pp. 8-9.) These two defendants were not  named in the December 2019 First Amended Complaint  to which a severance was granted. Instead of responding directly to the argument, plaintiff  requests the Court permit discovery to occur rather than  dismiss the claims. (Doc. #32, p. 18; Doc. #44, p. 19.)  Plaintiff suggests the claims may relate back to the  December 31, 2019 First Amended Complaint, the date  she first  [*1305]  identified the Days Inn Hotel and  named Wyndham as a defendant. (Doc. #32, pp. 16-18;  Doc. #44, pp. 17-19.) For example, plaintiff argues that  H.I Naples and Hanuman may have been notified by  Wyndham when the suit was originally filed pursuant to  the terms of the franchisor/franchisee agreements. See  Brown v. VCNA Prestige Concrete Prods., Inc., 2014  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43563, 2014 WL 1293266, at *2 (M.D.  Fla. Mar. 31, 2014) (stating that to find a complaint  relates back under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  when a plaintiff adds a formerly unnamed defendant,  ""the proper party must have received notice of the  action such that it will not be prejudiced.""). As noted, plaintiff is not required to negate an  affirmative defense in her complaint. La Grasta, 358  F.3d at 845. It is not apparent from the face of the  Complaint that the claim is time-barred because the  Court cannot [**33]  determine that plaintiff's premise  liability claim does not relate back to the First Amended  Complaint or is not subject to statutory or equitable  tolling. Therefore, the motion to dismiss is denied at  this stage of the proceedings. Plaintiff's request for  discovery is moot since discovery will be available in  due course. To the extent H.I. Naples and Hanuman seek dismissal  of the other negligent claims on the same grounds (Doc.  #17, pp. 6-7; Doc. #19, pp. 8-11), the Court's ruling  applies to those claims as well. (b) Failure to State a Claim Wyndham argues the premise liability claim is  insufficiently pled because it fails to allege (1) that  Wyndham possessed or controlled the Days Inn Hotel,  or (2) that Wyndham knew or should have known of a  dangerous condition or dangerous propensity. (Doc.  #26, pp. 19-20.) The Court finds that the Complaint  sufficiently alleges both. As noted, a premise liability claim requires a defendant  to possess or control the premises at issue. Lisanti, 787  So. 2d at 37. Here, plaintiff alleges Wyndham and other  defendants were the ""owners, operators, managers,  supervisors, controllers and innkeepers"" of the Days Inn  Hotel, and that Wyndham exercised control over the  means and [**34]  methods of how its franchisees  conducted business at the hotel. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 32, 124.)  While Wyndham may dispute these allegations, the  Court must accept them as true at this stage of the  proceedings and finds them sufficient to allege  Wyndham had sufficient control of the Days Inn Hotel  for premise liability purposes. Wyndham also suggests plaintiff's claim fails because it  insufficiently alleges Wyndham knew or should have  known either of a dangerous condition at the Days Inn  Hotel or a dangerous propensity of a particular patron.  (Doc. #26, pp. 20-21.) Such knowledge must only be  pled generally, Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b), and the allegations        538 F. Supp. 3d 1284, *1304; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88323, **31 Page 12 of 14 in the Complaint are sufficient to satisfy the notice  pleading requirements. ""Under Florida law, a business owes invitees a duty to  use due care to maintain its premises in a reasonably  safe condition. This includes the duty to protect  customers from criminal attacks that are reasonably  foreseeable."" Banosmoreno v. Walgreen Co., 299 F.  App'x 912, 913 (11th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted).  [*1306]  Foreseeability can be shown by two  alternative means. First, a plaintiff may demonstrate  that a proprietor knew or should have known of a  dangerous condition on his premises that was likely  to cause harm to a patron. Second, a plaintiff can  show that [**35]  a proprietor knew or should have  known of the dangerous propensities of a particular  patron. Id. (marks, citations, and footnote omitted). A franchisor such as Wyndham may enter into an  agency relationship with a franchisee under certain  circumstances. Mobil Oil Corp., 648 So. 2d at 120. The  Complaint contains sufficient allegations to support a  claim of an agency relationship between Wyndham and  its franchisees, and any factual challenge to such a  relationship is premature. Cain, 994 F. Supp. 2d at  1253. Furthermore, the Complaint contains sufficient  allegations that sex trafficking was occurring at the  Days Inn Hotel and that Wyndham knew or should have  known of it. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 64-70, 107-16, 170.)  Accordingly, the Court denies Wyndham's request to  dismiss the claim as insufficiently pled. (4) Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention Count Four of the Complaint asserts a claim of negligent  hiring,  supervision,  and  retention  against  each  defendant. (Doc. #1, ¶ 213.) ""To state a claim under  Florida law for negligent hiring, supervision and/or  retention, a plaintiff must establish that the employer  owed a legal duty to the plaintiff to exercise reasonable  care in hiring and retaining safe and competent  employees."" Clary v. Armor Corr. Health Servs., Inc.,  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15633, 2014 WL 505126, at *4  (M.D.  Fla.  Feb.  7,  2014)  (citations  omitted).  ""Florida [**36]  law also holds employers liable for  39reasonably foreseeable damages resulting from the  negligent training of its employees and agents."" Id.  (citing Lewis v. City of St. Petersburg, 260 F.3d 1260,  1265 (11th Cir. 2001)). ""For an employer to owe a  plaintiff a duty, the plaintiff must be in the zone of risk  that was reasonably foreseeable to the employer."" Id.  (citation omitted). Accordingly, to state a claim, the plaintiff must  allege facts that would establish a nexus between  the plaintiff and the tortfeasor's employment from  which a legal duty would flow from the defendant- employer to the plaintiff. The plaintiff must then  establish that the defendant-employer breached  that duty and that the breach caused him damage. Id. (citations omitted). The Complaint alleges each Days Inn Hotel defendant  was in control of the hiring, instructing, training,  supervising, and terminating of the hotel employees,  and that each defendant had a duty to make an  appropriate investigation of the employees. (Doc. #1, ¶¶  222-23.) The Complaint further alleges that the Days Inn  Hotel defendants knew or should have known that hotel  employees were ""allowing criminals to rent rooms for  prostitution and drug dealing,"" ""failing to either identify  and/or report the human sex trafficking [**37]  and  foreseeable harm"" of plaintiff, and ""failing to refuse  continued lodging services to human sex traffickers.""  (Id. ¶¶ at 225-27.) The Complaint concludes that the  Days Inn Hotel defendants were negligent in their hiring,  employment, supervision, and termination decisions  regarding the employees, and that the sex trafficking  of plaintiff was a foreseeable and direct result. (Id. at ¶¶  228-32.) Each of the three motions seeks dismissal of the  negligent hiring, supervision, and retention claim based  on pleading deficiencies. (Doc. #17, p. 7; Doc. #19, pp.  9-10; Doc. #26, pp. 21-22.) H.I. Naples argues that  because multiple defendants have  [*1307]  owned the  hotel on different dates, it cannot defend itself on this  claim ""[w]ithout factual allegations that specify which  employee(s) were negligently hired, and/or when they  were employed at the hotel and by which defendant.""  (Doc. #17, p. 7.) Similarly, Hanuman argues that  because the Complaint only makes ""[g]eneralized  references to employees of all defendants"" and not  specific allegations as to Hanuman employees, the  claim is insufficient. (Doc. #19, p. 10.) The Court  disagrees with both arguments. The Complaint contains the general dates during [**38]   which each defendant was in control of the Days Inn  Hotel, as well as the general dates during which plaintiff  was sexually trafficked at the hotel. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 25-28,  34.) The Complaint also contains sufficient allegations  regarding the hotel employees and how their actions  538 F. Supp. 3d 1284, *1305; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88323, **34 Page 13 of 14 resulted in the sex trafficking. (Id. at ¶¶ 11-12, 68, 75,  78, 120.) The Complaint does not require greater  specificity to avoid dismissal. Read as a whole, see  Rosky ex rel. Wellcare Health Plans, Inc. v. Farha, 2009  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107531, 2009 WL 3853592, at *2  (M.D. Fla. Mar. 30, 2009) (""The allegations of the  Complaint may not be parsed and read in isolation, but  must be read as a whole.""), the Complaint provides  sufficient information to give the defendants fair notice  of the nature of plaintiff's claim and the grounds upon  which it rests. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. Alternatively, Wyndham argues the claim should be  dismissed because (1) it ""lacks well-pled factual  allegations that Franchisees knew or should have  known of any unfit employees,"" and (2) the Complaint  does not plausibly allege that Wyndham hired or  employed any of the employees at issue. (Doc. #26, pp.  21-22.) The Court is not persuaded by either argument.  Regarding the former, the Complaint sufficiently alleges  facts suggesting sex trafficking was occurring at the  hotel, that the employees [**39]  failed to prevent it, and  that due to their control over the employees, each Days  Inn Hotel defendant knew or should have known of it.  (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 97-120, 219-27.) Regarding the latter, the  Court has determined the Complaint's allegations of an  agency relationship between Wyndham and the  franchisees are sufficient. Accordingly, the Court  denies the request to dismiss the negligent hiring,  supervision, and retention claim. (5) Negligent Rescue Count Five of the Complaint asserts a claim of negligent  rescue against Hanuman, Shree, and H.I. Naples. (Doc.  #1, ¶ 233.) The Complaint alleges these defendants, as  the owners and operators of the Days Inn Hotel, had a  duty to keep the premises safe and prevent foreseeable                criminal activity, as well as a duty ""to make safe a  dangerous condition at the Days Inn Hotel and to rescue  their hotel guests."" (Id. at ¶¶ 238, 241, 247.) The  Complaint alleges that by various acts and omissions,  the defendants breached these duties and that the  continuous sex trafficking of plaintiff was the direct and  foreseeable  [*1308]  result. (Id. at ¶¶ 243-45, 249-50,  252.) H.I. Naples and Hanuman each argue the  negligent rescue claim should be dismissed because it  is insufficiently [**40]  pled. (Doc. #17, p. 8; Doc. #19, p.  10.) There is no common law duty to rescue a stranger.  Estate of Ferguson v. Mascara, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  157824, 2010 WL 11558195, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 7,  2010) (citing Bradberry v. Pinellas Cty., 789 F.2d 1513,  1516 (11th Cir. 1986)). ""A well-established exception to  this rule, however, provides that an innkeeper is 'under  an ordinary duty of care to [a guest] after he knows or  has reason to know the [guest] is ill or injured."" De La  Flor v. Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co., L.L.C., 2013 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 5403, 2013 WL 148401, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 14,  2013) (quoting L.A. Fitness, Int'l, LLC v. Mayer, 980 So.  2d 550, 557 (Fla. 4th DCA 2008)); see also Abramson v.  Ritz Carlton Hotel Co., LLC, 480 F. App'x 158, 161 (3d  Cir. 2012) (""Generally, there is no duty to affirmatively  assist an injured person unless a special relationship,  such as that between an innkeeper and its guests,  exists between the parties."" (citation omitted)). H.I. Naples and Hanuman argue the negligent rescue  claim should be dismissed because it is insufficiently  pled under the ""rescue doctrine."" (Doc. #17, p. 8; Doc.  #19, p. 10.) Under Florida law, the rescue doctrine holds  a tortfeasor liable for injuries to a third party who is hurt  in attempting to rescue the direct victim of the tortfeasor.  Zivojinovich v. Barner, 525 F.3d 1059, 1070 (11th Cir.  2008) (citation omitted). ""The basic precept of this  doctrine 'is that the person who has created a situation  of peril for another will be held in law to have caused  peril not only to the victim, but also to his rescuer, and  thereby to have caused any injury suffered by the  rescuer in the rescue attempt.'"" Menendez v. W. Gables  Rehab. Hosp., LLC, 123 So. 3d 1178, 1181 (Fla. 3d  DCA 2013) (quoting N.H. Ins. Co. v. Oliver, 730 So. 2d  700, 702 (Fla. 4th DCA 1999)). As plaintiff correctly [**41]  argues in response (Doc.  #32, pp. 15-16; Doc. #44, pp. 16-17), the rescue  doctrine is not implicated by plaintiff's negligent rescue  claim. See Krajcsik v. Ramsey, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  143003, 2017 WL 3868560, at *2 n.4 (D. Md. Sept. 5,  2017) (""The rescue doctrine is related to, but separate  538 F. Supp. 3d 1284, *1307; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88323, **38 Page 14 of 14 from, the affirmative duty to rescue an imperiled party  that the courts impose on persons in some situations."").  Accordingly, because the rescue doctrine is not  applicable, H.I. Naples and Hanuman's request for  dismissal based on the doctrine is denied. (6) Aiding and Abetting, Harboring, Confining,  Coercion and Criminal Enterprise Finally, Count Six of the Complaint asserts a claim of  aiding and abetting against Hanuman, Shree, and H.I.  Naples. (Doc. #1, ¶ 253.) The Complaint accuses these  defendants of ""aiding and abetting unlawful activity  including unlawful confinement, imprisonment, assault  and battery by [plaintiff's] sex traffickers and 'Johns.'""  (Id.) H.I. Naples and Hanuman have moved to dismiss  the claim on the basis it is not a valid Florida cause of  action and is impermissibly vague. (Doc. #17, p. 8; Doc.  #19, p. 11.) Florida courts have recognized aiding and abetting the  commission of a tort as a standalone claim. See Gilison  v. Flagler Bank, 303 So. 3d 999, 1002 (Fla. 4th DCA  2020) (aiding and abetting fraud); MP, LLC v. Sterling  Holding, LLC, 231 So. 3d 517, 527 (Fla. 3d DCA 2017)  (aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary [**42]  duty).  This Court has previously listed the following elements  that must be alleged ""to state a claim for aiding and  abetting a common law tort"" under Florida law: ""(1) an  underlying violation on the part of the primary  wrongdoer; (2) knowledge of the underlying  [*1309]   violation by the alleged aider and abetter [sic]; and (3)  the rendering of substantial assistance in committing the  wrongdoing by the alleged aider and abettor."" Angell v.  Allergan Sales, LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142768,  2019 WL 3958262, at *8 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 22, 2019); see  also Lawrence v. Bank of Am., N.A., 455 F. App'x 904,  906 (11th Cir. 2012) (applying the above elements to  three Florida tort claims). These cases demonstrate  Florida recognizes a common-law claim of aiding and  abetting tortious conduct. The  Court  finds  plaintiff's  allegations  are  not  impermissibly vague and, to the extent they allege  actual knowledge , are sufficient to state a claim.  Accordingly, the Court denies H.I.

Steele JOHN E. STEELE SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  538 F. Supp. 3d 1284, *1308; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88323, **41",1
"C.T. v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233795","OPINION & ORDER This matter is before this Court on Plaintiff's [*3]  Motion  for Leave to Appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).  (ECF No. 162). For the following reasons, Plaintiff's  Motion is DENIED. In accord with this Court's February  16, 2021 Opinion and Order (ECF No. 127), this matter  is hereby TRANSFERRED to the Middle District of  Florida. I. BACKGROUND A. Factual Background Page 2 of 8 Plaintiff C.T. alleges she was trafficked for sex from  approximately 2008 to 2010 at Days Inn, Travelodge,  Best Western, La Quinta, and Red Roof Inn properties  in the Fort Myers, Florida area. (ECF No. 65, ¶ 143). At  the relevant time, these hotels were owned, supervised,  or and/or operated by Defendants Red Roof Inns, Inc.  (""Red Roof""), Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, Inc.  (""Wyndham""), Best Western International, Inc. (""BWI""),  La Quinta Holdings, Inc. (""LQH""), La Quinta Franchising,  LLC (""LQF""), and La Quinta Management, LLC (""LQM"").  (Id., ¶¶ 11-14) Plaintiff now seeks to hold these hotels  liable  under  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act (""TVPRA""), 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Plaintiff alleges that these hotel Defendants knew that  sex trafficking occurred frequently on their properties  and failed to prevent it, and that they knew or should  have known of C.T.'s trafficking. Plaintiff points to  behavior that she alleges hotel staff should have  recognized as signs of [*4]  her trafficking: physical  signs including physical deterioration, bruising, and lack  of eye contact, and common indicators of commercial  sex activity. (Id., ¶¶ 148-153). C.T. alleges that these  hotels and their parent companies did not take adequate  measures  to  prevent  human  trafficking  and  demonstrated ""actual and/or constructive knowledge of  the rampant culture of sex trafficking."" (Id., ¶¶ 135,  138(o), 139(l), 140(k), 141(l)). Plaintiff also argues that the Hotel Defendants have  been participating in an industry-wide conspiracy to  respond inadequately to sex trafficking. She alleges that  state and national trade associations, such as  Defendants Ohio Hotel Lodging Association (""OHLA"")  and American Hotel & Lodging Association (""AHLA""),  served as a forum for the alleged co-conspirators to  discuss efforts related to human trafficking and avoiding  compliance with federal trafficking laws. (Id., ¶¶ 55-56,  58). She also alleges that Defendants' employees  exchanged emails related to sex trafficking during the  relevant time period. (Id., ¶ 50). C.T. contends that the  collective failure of Defendants ""to articulate a policy,  process, or procedure that would measure the extent of  the trafficking [*5]  problem at their branded locations"" is  the result of the industry wide conspiracy. (Id., ¶ 62).  She maintains that the Hotel Defendants ""collectively  conspired and declined to implement policies that would  likely have the effect of reducing the billions of dollars in  sex trafficking profits."" (Id., ¶ 63). B. Procedural Background C.T. filed her Complaint against the Hotel Defendants  on December 8, 2019. (ECF No. 1). In early 2020, the  Hotel Defendants filed motions to dismiss the action.  (ECF Nos. 19, 23, 24, 51). C.T. then sought leave to file  an amended complaint, which the Magistrate Judge  granted. (ECF Nos. 54, 64). Plaintiff's Amended  Complaint added conspiracy allegations against the  Hotel Defendants and added OHLA and AHLA as  additional defendants. (ECF No. 65). Subsequently, the  Hotel Defendants and OHLA filed renewed motions to  dismiss the Amended Complaint and alternative Motions  to Transfer. (ECF Nos. 73, 79, 80, 103). On February 16, 2021, this Court issued its Opinion and  Order on the Motions to Dismiss, finding that it did not  have general or specific personal jurisdiction over BWI  and Wyndham, the out-of-state defendants, on the facts  alleged. (ECF No. 127 at 13). In reaching [*6]  its  holding on personal jurisdiction, this Court found that  C.T.  had  not  adequately  alleged  ""conspiracy  jurisdiction.""  (Id.  at  11-13).  Further,  this  Court  determined that the word ""extraterritorial"" in § 1596 of  the TVPRA, the provision Plaintiff argued provided  independent grounds for nationwide service of process  under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(1)(C), served  only to allow Plaintiff to bring suit for conduct occurring  outside the United States. (Id. at 7). Rather than dismiss  BWI and Wyndham as parties to the litigation, this Court  granted their motions to transfer venue to the Middle  District of Florida. (Id. at 13-15). That same day, C.T. filed a Notice of Intent to File for  Reconsideration and/or Motion for Leave to Amend the  Complaint (ECF No. 128), which she subsequently filed  on March 2, 2021 (ECF No. 129). Plaintiff specifically  sought clarification of this Court's previous opinion  insofar as it did not directly address Plaintiff's argument  that the TVPRA provides for nationwide service of  process. (ECF No. 134 at 12). This Court held in  abeyance the transfer of the case while it considered  Plaintiff's Motion. On July 1, 2021, this Court denied  Plaintiff's Motion for Clarification, Reconsideration,  and/or to Amend the Complaint [*7]  and transferred the  case to the Middle District of Florida. (ECF No. 134).  This Court disagreed with Plaintiff's argument that §  1595 of the TVPRA provided for nationwide service of  process, reasoning that such a reading directly  contradicted basic principles of statutory interpretation  because the provision actually provided for a grant of  subject-matter jurisdiction over potential perpetrators of  offenses committed extraterritorially already present in a  U.S. jurisdiction. (Id. at 18). Also, the construction of this  provision of the TVPRA was inapposite with the majority  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233795, *3 Page 3 of 8 of other federal statutes cited in which Congress  specifically provided for nationwide service of process.  (Id. at 20). The case was transferred to the Middle District of  Florida on July 1, 2021. (ECF No. 136). On July 14,  2021, Plaintiff filed a Petition for Interlocutory Appeal  concerning this Court's July 1, 2021 order. (ECF No.  149 at 3). Plaintiff filed a notice with the Middle District  of Florida that she had filed an appeal with the Sixth  Circuit (ECF No. 142), and that court stayed the matter  pending further order and notification that the appeal in  the Sixth Circuit was resolved. (ECF No. 143). On  August 3, 2021, C.T. filed [*8]  a motion for voluntary  dismissal of that appeal, which motion was granted by  the Sixth Circuit. See C.T. v. Red Roof Inns Inc. et al.,  No. 2:19-cv-5384, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132392, 2021  WL 2942483 (S.D. Ohio July 1, 2021), appeal  dismissed, No. 21-3635, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 30758,  2021 WL 4739619 (6th Cir. Aug. 4, 2021). On August 5,  2021, without informing the Middle District of Florida that  the appeal had been dismissed (ECF No. 156 at 4), C.T.  filed a Motion to Change Venue back to the Southern  District of Ohio to allow this Court to consider ""permitting  the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to review the  Nationwide Service of Process issue under the TVPRA.""  (ECF No. 149). On September 30, 2021, the Middle  District of Florida granted Plaintiff's motion to transfer  the case back to the Southern District of Ohio to allow  this Court to consider C.T.'s petition for interlocutory  appeal. (ECF No. 156). The case was transferred on  October 1, 2021. (ECF No. 157). On June 21, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Leave to  Appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) asking this  court to certify for appeal the following question:  ""Whether Section 1596 of the TVPRA authorizes  nationwide service of process."" (ECF No. 162).  Defendants BWI, Red Roof, and Wyndham responded  in opposition and Plaintiff replied. (ECF Nos. 165, 166,  167, 168). Therefore, this matter is ripe for review. II. STANDARD OF REVIEW Interlocutory appeals are generally disfavored [*9]  and  are reserved for ""exceptional cases."" In re City of  Memphis, 293 F.3d 345, 350 (6th Cir. 2002). As  ""[a]ttractive as it may be to refer difficult matters to a  higher court for advance decision, such a course of  action is contrary to our system of jurisprudence."" U.S.  ex rel. Elliott v. Brickman Group Ltd., LLC, 845 F. Supp.  2d 858, 863 (S.D. Ohio 2012) (quoting Alexander v.  Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co., 663 F. Supp. 2d 627,  639 (E.D. Tenn. 2009)). As the Sixth Circuit long has  held, the legislative history of § 1292(b) makes it ""quite  apparent"" that the statute should be ""sparingly applied,""  as it is ""not intended to open the floodgates to a vast  number of appeals from interlocutory orders in ordinary  litigation."" Kraus v. Board of County Comm'rs, 364 F.2d  919, 922 (6th Cir. 1966). A party seeking certification  ""has the burden of showing exceptional circumstances  exist warranting an interlocutory appeal."" Alexander v.  Provident Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 663 F. Supp. 2d 627, 639  (E.D. Tenn. Oct. 16, 2009). Under § 1292(b), this Court may certify an interlocutory  appeal only when three criteria are satisfied: (1) the  ""order involves a controlling question of law""; (2) ""there  is substantial ground for difference of opinion""; and (3)  ""an immediate appeal from the order may materially  advance the ultimate termination of litigation."" 28 U.S.C.  § 1292(b); Cook v. Erie Ins. Co., 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  51694, 2021 WL 1056626, at *2 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 19,  2021). If any of these factors is absent, the certification  cannot  issue.  Additionally,  ""doubts  regarding  appealability should be resolved in favor of finding that  the interlocutory order is not appealable."" In re Nat'l  Prescription Opiate Litig., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  113654, 2020 WL 3547011, at *1 (N.D. Ohio June 30,  2020) (internal quotation omitted). ""[E]ven where the statutory criteria [*10]  are met,"" the  Court still retains ""broad discretion to deny certification.""  In re Transdigm Grp., Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 1:17-cv-1677,  2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 241320, 2018 WL 11227556  (N.D. Ohio Jan. 30, 2018) (internal quotation omitted).  ""Ultimately, allowing certification of an interlocutory  appeal lies within the discretion of the district court.""  Lang v. Crocker Park, LLC, No. 1:09-cv-1412, 2011  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83451, 2011 WL 3297865, at *2 (N.D.  Ohio July 29, 2011) (citing Swint v. Chambers Cnty.  Comm'n, 514 U.S. 35, 47, 115 S. Ct. 1203, 131 L. Ed.  2d 60 (1995)). III. ANALYSIS Plaintiff petitions this Court for permission to ""appeal the  orders denying Plaintiff's Motion to Clarify on Motion to  Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction."" (ECF No. 162).  Specifically, C.T. certifies the following question for  appeal to the Sixth Circuit: Whether 18 U.S.C. § 1596 of the TVPRA  authorizes nationwide service of process and Sixth  Circuit precedent would allow the exercise of  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233795, *7 Page 4 of 8 personal jurisdiction when a federal statute allows  nationwide service of process, and such jurisdiction  does not offend constitutional Due Process. (Id. at 3). As detailed more fully below, Plaintiff's  argument fails to satisfy the three required criteria to  certify a legal question for interlocutory appeal under §  1292(b). A. Controlling Question of Law Movants first must show that their proposed issue for  appeal involves a controlling question of law. To be  controlling, ""an issue need not necessarily terminate an  action,"" but it must be one that ""could materially affect  the outcome of the litigation [*11]  in the district court."" In  re Baker & Getty Fin. Servs., Inc., 954 F. 2d 1169, 1172  n.8 (6th Cir. 1992) (internal quotations omitted). First, Plaintiff argues that this is a question of law  because it does not require factual analysis, but instead  ""interpretation of a federal statute and the scope it  imposes on TVPRA cases across the country."" (ECF  No. 162 at 6). Further, she maintains that the question is  controlling because it would materially affect the  outcome of the litigation in the district court. (Id. (citing  Zeneca Ltd. v. Mylan Pharms., 124 F. 3d 225 (Fed. Cir.  1997) (nonprecedential order) (permitting the appeal of  a certified question concerning district court jurisdiction  in infringement actions based on the filing of an  Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) with the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration under 35 U.S.C. §  271(e)(2)); In re Baker, 954 F. 2d at 1172 (permitting  appeal of a question on whether bankruptcy courts have  jurisdiction to conduct jury trials)). Defendants Red Roof and BWI respond that the legal  questions ""of the type envisioned in § 1292(b) . . .  generally does not include matters within the discretion  of the trial court."" (ECF Nos. 166 at 3 (citing  Montgomery City Bd. of City Comm'rs v. Cardinal  Health, No.18-OP-46326, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  174919, 2021 WL 4198171, at *1 (N.D. Ohio Sept. 15,  2021)); see also 165 at 2 (citing DRFP, LLC. v.  Republica Bolivariana De Venez., 945 F. Supp. 2d 890,  918 (S.D. Ohio 2013)). Further, Defendant BWI argues  that this Court's decision to decline to dismiss BWI and  Wyndham for lack of personal jurisdiction and to transfer  the matter to the Middle [*12]  District of Florida was  entirely unrelated to its analysis of whether the TVPRA  affords Plaintiff nationwide service of process. (ECF  Nos. 165 at 3). Because it is irrelevant to this Court's  ultimate decision, BWI maintains that it cannot be a  controlling question of law. (Id.). Defendants Red Roof  and Wyndham add that a ruling on this question would  not terminate this particular action because the case  can proceed in Florida, and this Court has indicated that  venue is proper there. (ECF Nos. 166 at 4; 167 at 3).  Plaintiff counters that Defendants are mistaken because  the whole basis for this Court's opinion (ECF No. 134)  was to determine the jurisdictional reach of the TVPRA.  (ECF No. 168 at 2). This controlling question, Plaintiff  maintains, could materially affect the outcome of the  litigation in the district court, which is sufficient to meet  the first prong of the interlocutory appeal test. (Id.). Although certification of questions for interlocutory  appeal is meant to occur sparingly, a movant simply  must show that resolution of the issue on appeal would  materially affect the outcome of the litigation in the  district court. In re Baker, 954 F. 2d at 1172 n. 8 (6th  Cir. 1992). Generally, federal courts have adopted the  position [*13]  that ""a question is controlling, even  though its disposition might not lead to reversal on  appeal, if interlocutory reversal might save time for the  district court, and time and expense for the litigants.""  Wright & Miller, § 3930 Criteria for Permissive Appeal,  16 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Juris. § 3930 (3d ed.) (citing  Sokaogon  Gaming  Enterprise  Corp.  v.  Tushie- Montgomery Associates, Inc., 86 F. 3d 656, 658-659  (7th Cir. 1996) (""A question of law may be deemed  'controlling' if its resolution is quite likely to affect the  further course of the litigation, even if not certain to do  so.""); Kuehner v. Dickinson & Co., 84 F. 3d 316, 318- 319 (9th Cir. 1996) (explaining that issues collateral to  the merits can be controlling questions if ""it could cause  the needless expense and delay of litigating an entire  case in a forum that has no power to decide the  matter"")); see also Winnett v. Caterpillar, Inc., 553 F. 3d  1000, 1008 (6th Cir. 2009) (acknowledging that the  circuit court's ruling could save the parties and the court  significant resources because to reverse the district  court would resolve the majority of claims at issue). It is well established that a question of law is controlling  if reversal of the district court's order would terminate  the action. See Bank of N.Y. Mellon v. Wolfe, 2:15-cv- 02662, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29490, 2016 WL 879999,  at *7 (Mar. 8, 2016) (finding that the question of whether  the bank was a creditor did not control the disposition of  the stay motion); Jackson Cnty v. Employees' Ret. Sys.  v. Ghosn, No. 3:18-CV-01368, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  109945, 2021 WL 2400302, at *3 (M.D. Tenn. June 11,  2021) (concluding that the district court's order  addressed a controlling question of law because the  Court would lack personal jurisdiction over one set of  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233795, *10 Page 5 of 8 Plaintiff's [*14]  claims if the circuit court decided  pendent personal jurisdiction did not apply); Phoenix  Process Equip. Co. v. Cap. Equip.& Trading Corp., 250  F. Supp. 3d 296, 304 (W.D. Ken. 2017) (explaining that  personal jurisdiction was a controlling question of law in  the matter because all claims against defendants would  be dismissed if no jurisdiction existed over them); cf. In  re Watson, 309 B.R. 652, 659 (1st Cir. BAP 2004) (""A  question of law controls the outcome of the underlying  case if no alternate theory exists on which the party  could succeed."") On the other hand, findings that a  question is not controlling are generally fact specific.  See e.g., In re Energy Conversion Devices, Inc., 638  B.R. 81, 90 (E.D. Mich. 2022) (explaining that although  standing is generally considered a controlling question  of law, the bankruptcy court did not find, as a matter of  law, that trusts have standing to pursue litigation after  termination of the trust, yet in the present matter, the  terms of the trust at issue gave the trust the authority  and responsibility to pursue adversary proceedings). The question for which Plaintiff seeks certification falls  somewhere on the middle of the aforementioned  spectrum of what does or does not constitute a  controlling question of law. A decision by the Sixth  Circuit that the TVPRA does provide nationwide service  of process would provide Plaintiff the necessary  personal jurisdiction to [*15]  maintain her claims against  Defendant Wyndham and BWI in the Southern District  of Ohio. This outcome weighs in favor of Plaintiff  because the claims against two of the defendants would  not be dismissed for want of personal jurisdiction. As  detailed more fully below, however, a favorable  appellate ruling for Plaintiff does not prevent this case  from being retransferred to Florida for the convenience  of the parties under 28 U.S.C. § 1406. A decision in  either direction, however, would not only not terminate  the action, but would only serve to prolong litigation.  While a ruling that the TVPRA provides for nationwide  service of process may have a large impact on litigation  nationwide, it is unlikely to impact substantively the  outcome of the present litigation which can continue in  another district court. This weighs against Plaintiff.  Because the issue of whether Plaintiff's question is a  controlling question of law is a close one and because  Plaintiff's Motion fails the other two required prongs to  achieve certification, however, this Court declines to find  in favor of either party. B. Substantial Grounds for Difference of Opinion Plaintiff alleges that the question of whether victims  trafficked across [*16]  numerous jurisdictions can file  their case in any federal court in the country is difficult,  novel, and one of first impression in this or any other  circuit. (ECF No. 162 at 7-8). Plaintiff argues that ""[i]n  the absence of guidance from the Sixth Circuit, adult  survivors of sex trafficking will not be able to bring their  case anywhere."" (ECF No. 168 at 3). Plaintiff alleges  that for survivors trafficked all over the country, they  would be required to file suit in each county and state  where they were trafficked which would be difficult and  impractical. (Id.). Additionally, Plaintiff maintains that  Congress intentionally wrote the TVPRA to be broad in  its legislative aims. (ECF No. 162 at 8). Because the  goals of the TVPRA represent a national priority, the  Plaintiff argues addressing this jurisdictional question is  important to avoiding multiple contradictory opinions.  (Id. at 9). Defendants counter that just because this Court  addressed an issue of first impression in its July 1, 2021  ruling (ECF No. 134) ""does nothing to demonstrate a  substantial ground for difference of opinion"" as to the  correctness of that ruling, especially where a movant's  interpretation of the statute contradicts [*17]  the plain  language of the statute's text. (ECF Nos. 165 at 4 (citing  U.S. v. Atlas Lederer Co., 174 F. Supp. 2d 666, 669  (S.D. Ohio 2001); 166 at 5; 167 at 5). Defendant Red  Roof cites this Court's prior opinion for the assertion that  Plaintiff's references to other federal statutes authorizing  nationwide service of process ""only underscore that the  TVPRA does not contain such a provision."" (ECF Nos.  166 at 5 (citing ECF No. 134 at 20-21); 167 at 6).  Therefore,  Defendants  conclude  that  this  Court  foreclosed the argument that ""a substantial difference of  opinion exists for statutory interpretation"" when it  concluded that ""Section 1596 of the TVPRA comports  with a plain, obvious, and rational meaning."" (ECF Nos.  165 at 4; 166 at 6). A difference of opinion is established where: ""(1) the  case is difficult and of first impression; (2) a difference of  opinion exists within the controlling circuit; or (3) the  circuits are split on the issue."" U.S. ex rel. Elliott, 845 F.  Supp. 2d at 866 (quoting In re Regions Morgan Keegan  ERISA Litig., 741 F. Supp. 2d 844, 849 (W.D. Tenn.  2010)). Plaintiff's argument fails to meet any of the three  required prongs. As this Court has previously articulated, whether the  TVPRA confers nationwide service of process is not a  difficult or complex issue but requires standard statutory  interpretation. (ECF No. 134 at 18-20). Section 1596 is  devoid of any reference to the concept of ""service  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233795, *13 Page 6 of 8 of [*18]  process"" let alone nationwide service of  process. (Id. at 18). The provision serves only to provide  court's jurisdiction over offenses in violation of the  TVPRA committed outside of the United States. (Id.).  Even 18 U.S.C. § 1595, which provides the procedural  rules for civil suits under the TVPRA, does not reference  service of process. This Court's interpretation of the  statutory provision at issue is ""in line with the Supreme  Court's maxim that 'the plain, obvious and rational  meaning of a statute is always to be preferred to any  curious, narrow, hidden sense that nothing but the  exigency of a hard case and the ingenuity and study of  an acute and powerful intellect would discover.'"" (ECF  No. 124 at 18-19 (quoting Chandler v. Roudebush, 425  U.S. 840, 848, 96 S. Ct. 1949, 48 L. Ed. 2d 416 (1976)).  Where nationwide service of process has been found to  have  been  authorized,  Congress  uses  plain,  unambiguous language in changing service of process  rules. See, e.g., Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt  Organizations (""RICO""), 18 U.S.C. § 1965(a) (service of  process for most RICO actions or 21 proceedings ""may  be served on any person in any judicial district in which  such person resides, is found, has an agent, or  transacts his affairs""); Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 22 (""Any  suit, action, or proceeding under the antitrust laws  against a corporation may be brought . . . in any district  wherein [*19]  it may be found or transacts business;  and all process in such cases may be served in the  district of which it is an inhabitant, or wherever it may be  found.""); Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. §  78aa (suits ""may be brought in any such district or in the  district wherein the defendant is found or is an  inhabitant or transacts business, and process in such  cases may be served in any other district of which the  defendant is an inhabitant or wherever the defendant  may be found""); Employee Retirement Income Security  Act of 1974 (""ERISA""), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(e)(2) (suits  ""may be brought in the district where the plan is  administered, where the breach took place, or where a  defendant resides or may be found, and process may  be served in any other district where a defendant  resides or may be found""); Children's Online Privacy  Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 6504(e)(2) (in civil actions,  process may be served ""in any district in which the  defendant (A) is an inhabitant; or (B) may be found"").  Unlike in the aforementioned examples, Congress  chose not to add similar language to § 1596 of the  TVPRA. Further, whether this question is an issue of first  impression does not have any bearing on how to apply  the rules of statutory interpretation. Novelty and difficulty  are not synonymous. Finally, there is no conflicting  authority on the issue within the Sixth Circuit or any  other federal circuit. Because [*20]  the weight of  authority favors a standard interpretation of this  provision as not providing for nationwide service of  process, there exist no substantial grounds for  difference of opinion, but instead points to a simple  conclusion of how § 1596 should be interpreted. C. Materially Advance Termination of the Litigation Plaintiff argues that an immediate appeal will save  judicial resources by keeping the case in Ohio because  this Court has experience litigating this issue as similar  TVPRA cases against hotel brands are currently  pending in this district. (ECF No. 162 at 10).  Additionally, Plaintiff maintains that immediate resolution  of this question by the Sixth Circuit would ""provide  greater certainty and predictability as to the boundaries  of the TVPRA for victims of sex trafficking to bring cases  across the country."" (Id. at 11; 168 at 4). Finally, Plaintiff  maintains that resolution of this issue will prevent future  litigation on jurisdictional questions. (ECF Nos. 162 at  11; 168 at 4). Defendant BWI counters Plaintiff's assertion that this  Court has experience in handling TVPRA litigation, by  citing to twenty-nine (29) pending cases over which  District Judge John E. Steel of the Middle [*21]  District  of Florida, who presided over this case upon its transfer  to Florida, currently presides. (ECF No. 165 at 5).  Therefore, Defendant BWI argues, the Middle District of  Florida is just as capable as this Court in advancing and  resolving this particular matter. (Id. at 6). Plaintiff  correctly counters, however, that the twenty-nine cases  represent only two total Plaintiffs who filed civil actions  under the TVPRA against each defendant separately.  (ECF No. 168 at 4 n. 1). Defendant BWI also argues  that a holding that the TVPRA affords nationwide  services of process ""would generate less certainty and  predictability,  as  it  would  effectively  decimate  jurisdictional boundaries."" (ECF No. 165 at 6). All defendants argue that an interlocutory appeal would  not advance the termination of this litigation but would  only serve to prolong the matter. (ECF Nos. 165 at 6-7;  166 at 6-7) Defendants reason that Plaintiff provides no  basis for the assertion that this Court could litigate the  matter more quickly than the Middle District of Florida.  (ECF No. 165 at 7; 166 at 6-7; 167 at 7). Even if Plaintiff  were to receive a favorable ruling on appeal, her case  would not terminate as Plaintiff could [*22]  continue the  litigation in Ohio or Florida, depending on this Court's  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233795, *17 Page 7 of 8 ruling upon remand. (Id.). An interlocutory appeal will ""materially advance litigation  if it will save 'substantial judicial resources and litigant  expense.'"" U.S. ex rel. Elliott, 845 F. Supp. 2d at 871  (quoting City of Memphis, 293 F. 3d at 350). As a result,  an interlocutory appeal is ""more appropriate early in the  proceedings, particularly in protracted and expensive  cases, where failure to resolve a question of law early in  the case could lead to the placement of an enormous  burden on the parties."" In re Regions, 741 F. Supp. 2d  at 849 (quoting Black & Decker, Inc. v. Smith, No. 07- 1201, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63054, 2008 WL 3850825,  at *10 (W.D. Tenn. Aug. 13, 2008). When litigation can  be conducted ""in substantially the same manner  regardless of [the court's] decision, the appeal cannot  be said to materially advance the ultimate termination of  the litigation."" In re City of Memphis, 293 F. 3d at 351  (quoting White v. Nix, 43 F. 3d 374, 377 (8th Cir. 1994)). The third factor—that an immediate appeal may  materially advance the termination of litigation—follows  from the second. Asking the Court of Appeals to weigh  in on an issue for which there is no substantial ground  for disagreement serves to prolong litigation, not to  shorten it. To grant Plaintiff's Motion would likely not act  to advance the termination of the litigation but result in  an extended litigation timeline. Regardless of Sixth  Circuit's ruling on the matter, Plaintiff's [*23]  claims  would remain to be litigated in the same manner as  before, whether in this Court or by the Middle District of  Florida. Therefore, an immediate appeal of this question  would not materially advance the ultimate termination of  the litigation. In fact, under the circumstances present  here, ""an interlocutory appeal is as likely to cause  material delay as it is to cause material advancement of  the termination of the litigation."" Waldon v. Cincinnati  Pub. Sch., 941 F. Supp. 2d 884, 892 (S.D. Ohio Apr. 24,  2013). Accordingly, the more efficient course is to move  the case forward by denying certification of this question  for interlocutory appeal. As Plaintiff has failed to meet any of the three prongs  required to certify a question for interlocutory appeal,  this Court DENIES Plaintiff's Motion. IV. VENUE TRANSFER This Court previously concluded that venue in the  Southern District of Ohio was improper because this  Court does not have personal jurisdiction over  Defendants BWI and Wyndham and Plaintiff's claim  does not meet any other requirements for proper venue  under 28 U.S.C. § 1391. (ECF No. 127 at 13-14).  Instead of dismissing the parties, however, this Court  found that venue transfer was the proper remedy. (Id. at  13). Additionally, this Court concluded that even though  venue in [*24]  the Southern District of Ohio was proper  for Defendant Red Roof, there was a strong interest in  litigating this case where the trafficking events occurred,  including access to evidence and witnesses located in  Florida. (Id. at 14). As a result, this Court concluded that  it would cause unnecessary inconvenience and expense  to both parties to litigate this case in Ohio. (Id. at 15).  This Court ordered that this matter be transferred to the  Middle District of Florida on February 16, 2021,  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1406 which allows ""[t]he district  court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in  the wrong division or district"" to ""dismiss or if it be in the  interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or  division in which it could have been brought."" (Id. at 14). It is well established that ""a transfer under section  1404(a) may not be granted when the district court does  not have personal jurisdiction over defendants."" Jackson  v. L&F Martin Landscape, 421 Fed. App'x 482, 483 (6th  Cir. 2009) (quoting Pittock v. Otis Elevator Co., 8 F. 3d  325, 329 (6th Cir. 1993)). Section 1406 and 28 U.S.C. §  1631—which states that when a court ""finds that there is  a want of jurisdiction,"" it ""shall, if it is in the interest of  justice, transfer such action . . . to any other court in  which the action . . . could have been brought""— however, provide this Court the necessary [*25]   jurisdiction to transfer this matter. See also Jackson,  421 Fed. App'x at 483 (explaining that 28 U.S.C. § 1631  expressly and specifically provides for the transfer of  cases in which the original court finds a ""want of  [personal] jurisdiction""). In evaluating a motion to  transfer venue, a court may consider factors such as  access to proof, witnesses' ability to attend trial,  enforceability  of  any  judgment  rendered,  and  ""prevent[ing] unnecessary waste of time, energy and  money and to protect witnesses and the public interest  against unnecessary inconvenience and expense."" MJR  Int'l, Inc. v. Am. Arbitration Ass'n, No. 2:06-cv-0937,  2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70436, 2007 WL 2781669, at *2  (S.D. Ohio Sept. 24, 2007) (citing Rowe v. Chrysler  Corp., 520 F. Supp 15 (E.D. Mich. 1981)). This Court's analysis of appropriate venue has not  changed. This Court lacks personal jurisdiction over  Defendants BWI and Wyndham because the Southern  District of Ohio lacks personal jurisdiction over both,  meaning venue is improper as neither can be deemed  to reside here. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c)—(d). Although  venue is proper over Defendant Red Roof in the  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 233795, *22 Page 8 of 8 Southern District of Ohio, there is a strong interest in  litigating the matter in Florida where C.T. was allegedly  trafficked and evidence and witnesses can be more  easily accessed. Because the Sixth Circuit has held  that, ""[t]he decision of whether to dismiss or transfer is  within the district court's sound discretion,"" this [*26]   Court again exercises its discretion to transfer this  matter to the Middle District of Florida. First of Mich.  Corp. v. Bramlet, 141 F. 3d 260, 262 (6th Cir. 1998).",1
"Carter v. Metlife Grp., Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217793","[*1] RULING  AND  ORDER  ON  DEFENDANT'S  MOTION TO PARTIALLY DISMISS AND MOTION TO STRIKE Sarala V. Nagala, United States District Judge. Plaintiff Renee Nadia Carter brought this employment  discrimination action in state court against her former  employer, Defendant MetLife Group, Inc., asserting  state law claims for discrimination based on disability,  sex,  and  pregnancy;  retaliation;  negligent  misrepresentation; and negligent infliction of emotional  distress. Defendant removed the case to federal court  and then filed the present motion to partially dismiss the  complaint, claiming that certain counts and allegations  fail to state plausible claims. In the same motion,  Defendant also seeks to strike certain paragraphs of the  complaint as immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous. For  the reasons described below, the Court GRANTS IN  PART and DENIES IN PART Defendant's motion.  Specifically, the Court dismisses the hostile work  environment theory espoused in Counts One and Two,  the negligent misrepresentation claim (Count Five), and  the negligent infliction of emotional distress claim (Count  Six), and finds that Plaintiff need not strike any  allegations from her complaint. I. FACTUAL & PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND [*2]  The complaint contains the following allegations, which  are accepted as true for the purpose of the present  motion to dismiss. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,  678 (2009). Plaintiff began her employment with Defendant on  September 27, 2021, in the position of Short Term  Disability Claims Specialist. Compl., ECF No. 1-5 ¶ 3.  That winter, in December of 2021, Plaintiff took leave  after contracting COVID-19. Id. ¶ 6. Around February 7,  2022, after returning to work, Plaintiff learned she was  pregnant. Plaintiff informed Defendant of her pregnancy,  and the fact that she would need to miss work on  occasion to attend medical appointments related to her  pregnancy. Id. ¶¶ 7-8. Plaintiff developed hyperemesis  gravidarum, a pregnancy-associated health condition  that can cause symptoms such as severe nausea,  vomiting, weight loss, dehydration, dizziness, and  lightheadedness. Id. ¶ 9. Defendant maintained ""Attendance and Punctuality  Policies,"" which defined scheduled and unscheduled  absences. Id. ¶ 27. Each unscheduled absence  constituted an Occurrence, and the accrual of six to  seven Occurrences would result in termination. Id. ¶¶  29-30. An unscheduled absence was an absence for  which an employee did not provide management at  least 24 [*3]  hours of advance notice, and that did not  Page 2 of 12 fall into a particular category of recognized absences,  such as Short-Term Disability Leave or Family and  Medical Leave. Id. ¶¶ 31, 28. Plaintiff's  morning  sickness  and  hyperemesis  gravidarum caused her to be sick throughout the day.  Id. ¶¶ 12, 14. Plaintiff was told by her former manager,  Keri Doyle, that she would need to make up time for  work missed due to appointments or illness. Id. ¶¶ 11,  14. On several occasions, Doyle told Plaintiff that she  ""might be terminated"" due to her use of allotted PTO for  pregnancy-related appointments and/or sickness. Id. ¶  15. When Plaintiff requested assistance with procuring  necessary accommodations in connection with her  pregnancy, Doyle told her to ""handle it online,"" without  further articulating the process. Id. ¶ 41. Even though Doyle and other supervisors were aware of  her pregnancy and pregnancy-related illness, Plaintiff  began to accrue Occurrences. See id. ¶¶ 16, 21, 20. On  March 29, 2022, 2 Plaintiff received a ""Written Warning"" from Defendant  regarding her Occurrences. Id. ¶ 20. On April 7, 2022,  Plaintiff received a ""Final Written Warning"" regarding her  Occurrences. Id. ¶ 24. On or about June 22, [*4]  2022,  after receiving a doctor's note advising her to stay out of  work for two days, an unidentified representative of  Defendant told Plaintiff that she could not take any more  time off from work. Id. ¶ 26. On June 30, 2022, Plaintiff was placed on emergency  PTO by her supervisor due to a particularly extreme  bout of vomiting. Id. ¶ 42. Later that same day, Doyle  called Plaintiff and told her that she was terminated. Id.  During the call, Doyle stated that it seemed ""like  [Plaintiff has] a lot of medical issues."" Id. ¶ 43. Additionally, while she was employed, Plaintiff was  never notified of her eligibility for leave under the  Connecticut Family and Medical Leave Act (""CTFMLA"").  Id. ¶¶ 17, 23, 34-38. In fact, Defendant incorrectly  informed her that she did not qualify for such leave  because of her tenure with the company, despite that  Connecticut law was amended in 2022 to afford people  with Plaintiff's level of tenure the right to such leave. Id.  ¶¶ 39, 75. Plaintiff filed an administrative complaint against  Defendant regarding these events with the Connecticut  Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities  (""CHRO"") and, after its investigation, received a release  of jurisdiction allowing [*5]  her to bring a civil action. Id.  ¶ 2. Thereafter, on April 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed the present  action against Defendant in Connecticut Superior Court,  claiming that Defendant violated the Connecticut Fair  Employment Practices Act (""CFEPA""), Conn. Gen. Stat.  § 46a-51 et seq, and asserting two common-law claims.  Specifically, Plaintiff asserts six counts: (1) disability  discrimination under the CFEPA; (2) sex discrimination  under the CFEPA; (3) pregnancy discrimination under  the CFEPA; (4) retaliation in violation of the CFEPA; (5)  common law negligent misrepresentation; and (6)  common law 3 negligent infliction of emotional distress. Defendant  subsequently removed the matter to federal court,  invoking this Court's diversity jurisdiction. ECF No. 1.  Defendant filed a partial answer to the complaint on  June 1, 2023. ECF No. 15. That same day, Defendant moved to partially dismiss  the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  12(b)(6). ECF No. 16. Specifically, Defendant moved to  dismiss: (1) the hostile work environment (""HWE"")  theories within Counts One and Two, ECF No. 1-5 ¶¶ 52  and 58, respectively, for failure to exhaust administrative  remedies; (2) the negligent misrepresentation claim in  its entirety, arguing that it is preempted by the CTFMLA,  Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 31-51kk etseq.; and (3) the  negligent infliction of emotional distress claim [*6]  in its  entirety, because it fails to state a claim upon which  relief can be granted. Defendant did not move to  dismiss any portion of Counts Three or Four. In addition,  under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f), Defendant  moved to strike certain paragraphs of Plaintiff's  complaint-paragraphs 17, 19, 22, 23, and 34 through  39-which relate to the alleged CTFMLA violations,  arguing these paragraphs are immaterial, impertinent, or  scandalous. 4 II. MOTION TO PARTIALLY DISMISS A. Legal Standard1 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a  defendant may move to dismiss a case or cause of  action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can  be granted. When determining whether a complaint  states a claim upon which relief can be granted, highly  Page 3 of 12 detailed allegations are not required, but the complaint  must ""contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true,  to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'""  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting BellAtl. Corp. v.  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). ""A claim has facial  plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that  allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that  the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged."" Id.  This  plausibility  standard  is  not  a  ""probability  requirement,"" but imposes a standard higher than ""a  sheer possibility that a defendant [*7]  has acted  unlawfully."" Id. In undertaking this analysis, the Court  must ""draw all reasonable inferences in [the plaintiff's]  favor, assume all well-pleaded factual allegations to be  true, and determine whether they plausibly give rise to  an entitlement to relief."" Faber v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,  648 F.3d 98, 104 (2d Cir. 2011) (internal quotation  marks and citation omitted). 1 Plaintiff argues that Defendant's motion to dismiss  must be construed as a motion for judgment on the  pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c)  because it was filed after Defendant filed its answer.  ECF No. 23 at 6; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c) .  Although Rule 12(b) does specify that a motion  asserting certain defenses ""must be made before  pleading,"" courts have declined to consider motions  made under Rule 12(b)(6) untimely where they were  filed essentially simultaneously with an answer. See,  e.g., Beary v. W. Publ'g Co., 763 F.2d 66, 68 (2d Cir.  1985) (rejecting as ""frivolous"" plaintiff's argument that  defendant waived its right to move to dismiss the  complaint or, in the alternative, move for summary  judgment by filing an answer where the filings were  simultaneous); see also Federal Practice and Procedure  (Wright & Miller) § 1361 Timing of Rule 12(b) Motions  (collecting cases). Here, according to the Court's  electronic filing system, the answer was filed twenty-one  minutes before the motion to partially [*8]  dismiss the  complaint and motion to strike. In addition, Defendant's  answer did not respond to most of the allegations it  seeks to dismiss and preserved its 12(b)(6) affirmative  defense. See ECF No. 15 at 9-10 (no responses to  paragraphs subject to motion to strike); id. at 17-20 (no  responses to common law claims); id. at 20 (preserving  12(b)(6) defense); but seeid. at 13, 14 (denying HWE  allegations subject to motion to dismiss). Thus, the  Court declines to consider the motion untimely and will  analyze Defendant's motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule  12(b)(6), not Rule 12(c). The Court further notes that its  decision on this procedural issue has no impact on its  decision on the overall motion, since, as Plaintiff  concedes, the standard under Rule 12(b)(6) is  ""identical"" to the standard under Rule 12(c). See Patel  v. Contemp.Classics of Beverly Hills, 259 F.3d 123, 126  (2d Cir. 2001). 5 However, the Court is not ""bound to accept conclusory  allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as  factual conclusions,"" Rolon v. Henneman, 517 F.3d 140,  149 (2d Cir. 2008), and ""a formulaic recitation of the  elements of a cause of action will not do,"" Iqbal, 556  U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).  Consequently, ""[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a  cause of action, supported by mere conclusory  statements, do not suffice."" Id. (citing Twombly, 550  U.S. at 555). Ultimately, ""[d]etermining whether a  complaint states a plausible claim for [*9]  relief will . . .  be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing  court to draw on its judicial experience and common  sense."" Id. at 679. A. CFEPA Counts One and Two: Hostile Work  Environment (""HWE"") Theory2 The Court first concludes that Plaintiff's current HWE  claims are not reasonably related to the claims in her  CHRO charge; therefore, these claims must be  dismissed because she failed to exhaust available  administrative remedies. Before filing a lawsuit under the CFEPA, an employee is  required to exhaust her claim by filing a charge with the  CHRO. Once the CHRO has completed its investigation,  it provides a release from jurisdiction, which allows the  employee to proceed to court. See Conn. Gen. Stat. §  46a-100. Under Connecticut law, proper exhaustion of  claims before the CHRO is a jurisdictional 2 Defendant moves to dismiss or strike only the hostile  work environment allegations within Counts One and  Two, ECF No. 1-5 ¶¶ 52, 58, not Counts One and Two  in their entirety. ECF No. 16-1 at 5. Plaintiff's opposition  addresses Defendant's substantive exhaustion-based  arguments for dismissal, but also briefly argues that  ""even if the court were to find that Plaintiff has not  exhausted administrative remedies with [*10]  regard to  her hostile work environment claim, there is no basis to  strike the paragraphs that the defendant requests be  stricken, as those allegations also merely provide further  factual foundation for Plaintiff's claims of discrimination  and retaliation."" ECF No. 23 at 13. Because the  disputed allegations are almost verbatim recitals of the  elements of a HWE cause of action, compare ECF No.  1-5 ¶¶ 52, 58 to Conn. Gen. Stat. § 46a-60(b)(8), the  Page 4 of 12 Court finds it appropriate to analyze them as an  independent claim/theory subject to Defendant's motion  to dismiss, rather than as ""factual foundation"" subject  only to the motion to strike standard. See Twombly, 550  U.S. at 555; see also Ware v. State, 118 Conn. App. 65,  78 n.4, 86-87 (2009) (considering whether plaintiff had  exhausted HWE ""claim"" that was not styled as a  separate cause of action but was ""in the context of  recognized causes of action""). As noted below, the  Court  denies Defendant's motion to strike  any  allegations from the complaint. 6 requirement-in other words, the court does not have  subject matter jurisdiction over the claim if it has not  been properly exhausted. See Ware, 118 Conn. App. at  81. In determining whether a claim that was not explicitly  brought before the CHRO has been nonetheless  properly exhausted, Connecticut courts apply the  Second Circuit's [*11]  ""reasonably related"" test. Id. at  82. Under this test, a subsequent claim is considered  reasonably related if it ""would fall within the reasonably  expected scope of a [CHRO] investigation of the  charges of discrimination."" See Soules v. Connecticut,  Dep't of Emergency Servs. & Pub. Prot., 882 F.3d 52,  57 (2d Cir. 2018) (internal citation omitted); Deravin v.  Kerik, 335 F.3d 195, 200-01 (2d Cir. 2003). A claim that  is reasonably related to one brought before the CHRO  will be allowed to proceed in federal court. This is  essentially an allowance for ""loose pleading"" of CHRO  charges, see Ware, 118 Conn. App. at 83, and it is the  ""substance of the charge and not its label"" that controls  the analysis, Mathirampuzha v. Potter, 548 F.3d 70, 76- 77 (2d Cir. 2008). Courts have considered which boxes  were checked on the CHRO charge as a relevant factor.  See, e.g., Orkneyv. Connecticut Tech. Sch. Sys., No.  CV075002649, 2011 WL 1031950, at *2 (Conn. Super.  Ct. Feb. 22, 2011). In order to establish a claim for hostile work  environment, a plaintiff must show that a workplace is  ""permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and  insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the  conditions of the victim's employment and create an  abusive working environment."" Rivera v. Rochester  Genesee Reg'l Transp. Auth., 743 F.3d 11, 20 (2d Cir.  2014) (internal citation omitted); see also O'Reggio v.  Comm'n on Hum. Rts. & Opportunities, 219 Conn. App.  1, 10, cert. denied, 346 Conn. 1028 (2023) (noting that  Connecticut courts consistently look to federal law and  Title VII when interpreting CFEPA claims). In assessing  whether a plaintiff has met this burden, courts examine  the alleged frequency, severity, [*12]  and 7 pervasiveness of the conduct. Rivera, 743 F.3d at 20.  ""Hostile environment claims are different in kind from  discrete acts,"" as ""[t]heir very nature involves repeated  conduct."" Nat'l R.R.Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536  U.S. 101, 115 (2002). Even alleging multiple discrete  instances of conduct is often not enough to raise the  specter of an HWE claim for purposes of administrative  exhaustion. See Holtz v. Rockefeller & Co., 258 F.3d  62, 74-75 (2d Cir. 2001) (incidents must be ""more than  episodic"" to be considered pervasive) (internal citation  omitted); Ray v. New York StateIns. Fund, No. 16 CIV.  2895 (NRB), 2018 WL 3475467, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. July 18,  2018) (six discrete instances over five-year period did  not raise HWE claim). Even liberally construing Plaintiff's CHRO charge, 3 the  Court finds that it does not raise anything akin to an  HWE claim. Although not dispositive, the Court notes  that Plaintiff, who was represented by her present  counsel before the CHRO, did not check the box for  ""harassed"" or ""sexually harassed,"" and did not write in  anything resembling HWE in the ""other"" section of the  charge form. ECF No. 16-2 at 2; see Orkney, 2011 WL  1031950, at *2. More importantly, the substance of the  charge and attached complaint includes no allegation  sufficient to put the CHRO on notice of any allegedly  frequent, severe, or pervasive conduct that might have  prompted it to investigate the workplace environment.  The complaint describes only several discrete [*13]   instances of alleged discrimination. The only allegation  that could potentially be construed as describing 3 In evaluating a motion to dismiss, the court may  consider documents external to the complaint without  converting the motion into one for summary judgment  where the external documents are incorporated by  reference into the complaint, are not incorporated by  reference but are otherwise ""integral"" to the complaint,  are ""matters of which judicial notice may be taken,"" or  are documents as to which the plaintiff had notice and  relied upon in framing the complaint. Chambers v. Time  Warner, Inc., 282 F. 3d 147, 153 (2d Cir. 2002) . The  Court finds that the CHRO charge is integral to the  complaint, insofar as Plaintiff references it in her  complaint as the foundation for her statement that she  has ""exhausted all administrative remedies."" See ECF  No. 1-5 ¶ 2. It is therefore proper to consider the CHRO  Page 5 of 12 charge attached to Defendant's motion (ECF No. 16-2).  See also Anderson v. Derby Bd. of Educ., 718 F. Supp.  2d 258, 272 n.33 (D. Conn. 2010) (taking judicial notice  of CHRO Complaint attached to defendant's motion to  dismiss in considering whether plaintiff had exhausted  his administrative remedies); id. at 265 (noting that, to  assess a jurisdictional requirement, affidavits and other  pleading  materials  may  be  considered  without  converting [*14]  a motion into one for summary  judgment). 8 pervasive conduct is the allegation that ""[o]n several  occasions"" Plaintiff was told that she might be  terminated ""in response to [her] attempted use of her  allotted PTO for pregnancy-related appointments and/or  sickness."" ECF No. 16-2 at 5 ¶ 12. Even assuming this  allegation  sets  forth  repeated  instances  of  discrimination, the Court cannot find that it alleges  anything like a work environment ""permeated with  discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is  sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of  the victim's employment and create an abusive working  environment."" See Rivera, 743 F.3d at 20. In sum, because Plaintiff's HWE theories in Counts One  and Two are not reasonably related to any claim raised  by her CHRO charge, the theory has not been properly  exhausted and must be dismissed from those counts. B. Count Five: Negligent Misrepresentation Next,  the  Court  holds  that  Plaintiff's  negligent  misrepresentation claim must be dismissed, as it is a  veiled attempt to bring a claim she is time-barred from  pursuing under the CTFMLA. To prevail on a cause of action for negligent  misrepresentation under Connecticut law, a plaintiff  must show ""(1) [*15]  that the defendant made a  misrepresentation of fact, (2) that the defendant knew or  should have known was false, and (3) that the plaintiff  reasonably relied on the misrepresentation, and (4)  suffered pecuniary harm as a result."" Coppola Const.  Co. v. HoffmanEnterprises Ltd. P'ship, 309 Conn. 342,  351-52 (2013) (internal citation omitted);see also  Corcoran v. G&E Real Est. Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 484 F.  Supp. 3d 43, 50 (D. Conn. 2020) (same). Here, the parties do not dispute that the false  misrepresentation Plaintiff will need to prove to satisfy  the first and second elements of her claim is that  Defendant misrepresented Plaintiff's eligibility under the  CTFMLA by incorrectly informing her that she was not  eligible for CTFMLA leave. See ECF No. 16-1 at 10;  ECF No. 23 at 14. It also appears to the Court that (1)  such a 9 misrepresentation would itself constitute a violation of  the CTFMLA 4; and (2) that the CTFMLA provides a  remedy for such a violation-to which Plaintiff would have  been entitled had she brought a claim under the  CTFMLA within the applicable statute of limitations. 5 The question for the Court therefore becomes whether  Plaintiff's common law negligent misrepresentation  claim is preempted by the CTFMLA, based on the facts  and circumstances present here. Because this presents  a question of state law in a diversity case, the Court is  obligated [*16]  to apply Connecticut law on this issue.  Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938).  However, neither the parties nor the Court have  identified a Connecticut state court decision dealing with  this precise issue. When Connecticut's law is uncertain  or ambiguous, this Court must predict how the  Connecticut Supreme Court would rule. Travelers Ins.  Co. v. 633 Third Assocs., 14 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir.  1994). The Court predicts that the Connecticut Supreme  Court  would  hold  that  Plaintiff's  negligent  misrepresentation claim is barred in this instance. The Connecticut Supreme Court has clearly held that  common law claims for wrongful termination in violation  of public policy are precluded when (1) the elements of  a statutory violation (the public policy) have not been  satisfied; or (2) the relevant statute provides a remedy. Burnham v. Karl & Gelb, P.C., 252 Conn. 153, 158  (2000). In so holding, Burnham emphasized 4Courts have held that misrepresentations regarding  eligibility for FMLA leave may constitute interference  under the FMLA, which is analogous to the CTFMLA.  See, e.g., Kanios v. UST, Inc., No. 3:03-cv-369 (DJS),  2005 WL3579161, at *10 (D. Conn. 2005) (""The basis  for Kanios's FMLA claim is that UST misrepresented the  amount of time she had available for federal FMLA  leave and thus interfered with Kanios's FMLA rights."");  see also Cendant Corp. v.Commissioner of Labor, 276  Conn. 16, 23, 27 (2005) (noting that the ""Connecticut  leave statute is our state analogue to FMLA,"" and  ""turn[ing] [*17]  to federal cases interpreting the relevant  FMLA provisions for guidance"" in interpreting CTFMLA).  Contrary to Plaintiff's assertion at oral argument, ""an  employee alleging a claim of interference under FMLA  Page 6 of 12 does not need to prove the employer's intent for liability  to attach to the employer."" Id. at 28, 31 (2005) (applying  this standard to the CTFMLA). 5Any claim Plaintiff may have had under the CTFMLA is  indisputably time-barred, see Conn. Gen. Stat. § 31- 51pp(e). Plaintiff concedes as much by her silence in  response to this issue. Plaintiff's point that she is entitled  to plead her negligent misrepresentation claim as an  alternative to a CTFMLA claim, while correct as a  general matter, is inapposite because Plaintiff does not  have a valid CTFMLA claim. See Campbell v. Town of  Plymouth, 74 Conn. App. 67, 76 (2002) (""The court,  therefore, did not prevent the plaintiff from pleading in  the alternative, but simply did not allow him to plead an  invalid alternative.""). 10 that claims for wrongful termination in violation of public  policy represent a ""narrow"" exception to Connecticut's  general policy that employers may engage in ""unfettered  termination of an at-will employment relationship."" Id. at  159 (citation omitted). Only when termination was  ""demonstrably  improper""  (in  violation  of  public  policy) [*18]   and  ""the  employee  was  otherwise  withoutremedy"" would the common law claim be  allowed. Id. (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).  The court held that the plaintiff, who claimed her  termination was a violation of the whistleblower statute,  could not bring a wrongful termination claim because  she could not show that her whistleblowing activity  actually met the elements of the whistleblower statute  and, even if it had, the whistleblower statute provided an  administrative remedy that was exclusive. Id. at 160-62.  In other words, the statutory remedy, not the common  law, provides the exclusive remedy for the wrongful  termination when a termination is in violation of public  policy-even though the whistleblower statute does not  have a provision providing that its remedy was the  exclusive remedy. Id. at 161-62. See Campbell, 74  Conn. App. at 75 (""[A]lthough admittedly § 31-51m also  contains  no  exclusivity  language,  Burnham,  as  previously stated, does provide adequate precedent  from this state's highest court that § 31-51m is an  exclusive remedy.""). Burnham's holding has been expanded to apply to other  statutes, thereby precluding other common law claims.  See, e.g., Pickering v. Aspen Dental Mgmt., Inc., 100  Conn. App. 793, 799 (2007) (jury duty statute provided  exclusive remedy for termination in violation of statute,  even where plaintiff [*19]  characterized his claim as  negligence per se, not wrongful termination); Powell  v.Greenwald Indus., Inc., No. CV095013578, 2010 WL  2383784, at *5 (Conn. Super. Ct. Apr. 29, 2010)  (recognizing split among Superior Court judges on the  issue, but holding that where a plaintiff relied  ""exclusively"" on violation of CFEPA for his claim of  breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair  dealing, CFEPA provides exclusive relief); Michalsky v.  Moffly Publications, 11 Inc., No. FSTCV196042420S, 2020 WL 5537003, at *6- *7 (Conn. Super. Ct. Aug. 13, 2020) (recognizing that  violations of statutes, including the CFEPA, were  ""insufficient bases"" to establish injury prong of negligent  supervision claim, but allowing negligent and reckless  supervision claim based on injuries that were not  compensable by statute); ECF No. 16-1 at 13- 14  (collecting cases). At least one Connecticut Superior  Court decision held that a wrongful termination claim  could not arise where the alleged termination was  wrongful because it was in violation of the CTFMLA and  FMLA. See Jarrett v. Cmty. Renewal Team, Inc., No.  CV020816341S, 2003 WL 1962835, at *4 (Conn. Super.  Ct. Apr. 3, 2003); see also Vera v.Waterbury Hosp., No.  3:10-CV-1417 WWE, 2010 WL 4736278, at *3 (D. Conn.  Nov. 16, 2010) (where plaintiff is ""able to assert all of his  claims"" through various statutes, including the FMLA,  wrongful termination claim was preempted). Defendant asks this Court to predict that the  Connecticut Supreme Court, if presented with this case,  would expand Burnham and its progeny to a new statute  (the CTFMLA) and a new common law [*20]  claim  (negligent misrepresentation) and hold that, because  the CTFMLA provides a remedy for Plaintiff to challenge  Defendant's conduct, the CTFMLA precludes Plaintiff's  claim for negligent misrepresentation. The Court  declines to do so, but nonetheless finds that Plaintiff  cannot pursue her negligent misrepresentation claim in  this instance. First, the Court notes that the CTFMLA, unlike the  statutes to which Burnham has been expanded, has an  express non-exclusivity provision. This provision states:  ""[t]he rights and remedies specified in this section are  cumulative and nonexclusive and are in addition to any  other rights or remedies afforded by contract or under  other provisions of law."" Conn. Gen. Stat. § 31-51pp(f).  As the parties point out, Connecticut courts have  discussed the relevance of an exclusivity provision in a  statute in the context of whether employment-related  Page 7 of 12 claims are preempted by 12 statutes. See, e.g., Campbell, 74 Conn. App. at 75; see  also DeOliveira v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 273 Conn. 487,  496 (2005). Neither the parties nor the Court, however,  have  identified  a  Connecticut  state  court  case  specifically analyzing this question in the context of any  statute-let alone the CTFMLA-that has an express non- exclusivity provision. The Court would thus ordinarily attempt to interpret  CTFMLA's  non-exclusivity [*21]   provision  using  traditional canons of statutory interpretation, as a  question of first impression. Such analysis begins with  the text of the statute itself. See Conn. Gen. Stat. § 1- 2z. While it is clear the CTFMLA's rights are  nonexclusive to other rights or remedies afforded by  contract, the parties' dispute centers on the meaning of  the phrase ""or under other provisions of law."" Defendant  argues that ""other provisions of law"" refers only to rights  granted by statutes, not by common law. In Defendant's  view, because the non-exclusivity provision means the  CTFMLA's rights are nonexclusive only to other rights  afforded by statute, and not to common law rights, the  non-exclusivity provision does not speak to the precise  situation at issue here, where Plaintiff is pursuing a  common law claim for negligent misrepresentation.  Thus, Defendant argues that the Court should treat the  CTFMLA like any other statute that does not have an  exclusivity provision, and analyze it according to  Burnham's logic. See ECF No. 16-1 at 20, 20 n.2.  Plaintiff, on the other hand, places great emphasis on  the existence of the non-exclusivity provision. At oral  argument, Plaintiff took the position that the phrase  ""other provisions of law"" [*22]  includes common law  and, even if it does not, the mere fact that a non- exclusivity provision was included in the CTFMLA at all  should caution against holding that the CTFMLA is  Plaintiff's exclusive remedy for addressing Defendant's  alleged conduct. Both parties' readings of the phrase ""provisions of law""  have some support. CompareCordero v. Univ. of Conn.  Health Ctr., 308 Conn. 215, 233 n.17 (2013) (as used in  another state 13 statute, the phrase ""irrespective of any other provision of  law"" is ""intended to address [relevant] statutes"");  Provision, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) (""A  clause in a statute, contract, or other legal instrument."");  Provided by law, Black's Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990)  (""This phrase when used in a constitution or statute  generally means prescribed or provided by some  statute.""); to Adesokan v. Town of Bloomfield, 347  Conn. 416, 440 (2023) (noting that savings clause in  statute which ""provide[s] that the terms of the statute  govern  'except  as  otherwise  provided  by  law,'  preserve[s] and incorporate[s] common-law exceptions  to municipal immunity"") (citation omitted) (cleaned up);  Poirier v. Papadopoulos, No. CV065001333S, 2007 WL  2245893, at *2 (Conn. Super. Ct. July 19, 2007) (finding  that statute that applies ""notwithstanding any other  provision of law"" ""preclude[d] liability under Connecticut  common law""); Ridgeway v. RoyalBank of Scotland  Grp., No. 3:11-CV-976 VLB, 2012 WL 1033532, at *18  (D. Conn. Mar. 27, 2012) (recognizing ambiguity in the  phrase ""provisions of law,"" but finding [*23]  that the  ""provision as a whole indicates that the CTFMLA is not  intended to function as an exclusive remedy""). Further,  the Connecticut Supreme Court has cautioned that ""[i]n  the absence of explicit language indicating that the  statute is the exclusive remedy,"" preemption of  common-law  causes  of  action  should  not  be  ""presume[d]."" Caciopoli v. Lebowitz, 309 Conn. 62, 72  (2013); see also Giametti v.Inspections, Inc., 76 Conn.  App. 352, 361 (2003) (noting that, where statute relating  to residential property purchases ""contain[ed] no  language to suggest that [it] was intended to provide the  exclusive remedy,"" it did not appear that ""legislature . . .  intend[ed] to preclude preexisting common-law actions  for negligent misrepresentation""). However, the Court need not determine for purposes of  this decision whether ""other provisions of law""  encompasses common law because, even assuming  arguendo that Plaintiff's reading is correct, the Court  nonetheless finds that Plaintiff's particular negligent 14 misrepresentation claim must be dismissed for an  independent reason. Plaintiff's claim, which rests  entirely on a violation of the CTFMLA, is an attempt to  use the label of negligent misrepresentation to bring a  time-barred CTFMLA claim. Because the claim depends  entirely on Plaintiff proving a CTFMLA [*24]  violation  she is not entitled to pursue, the claim fails. While  Plaintiff  attempts  to  cast  her  negligent  misrepresentation claim as somehow distinct from a  CTFMLA claim, she cannot prove elements of her  negligent misrepresentation claim without also proving  that Defendant violated the CTFMLA. The CTFMLA  Page 8 of 12 provides, in relevant part, that it is illegal for an  employer to ""interfere with, restrain or deny the exercise  of, or the attempt to exercise,"" any right provided under  the statute. Conn. Gen. Stat. § 31-51pp(a)(1). Under  Plaintiff's  theory  of  negligent  misrepresentation,  Defendant effectively interfered with her CTFMLA rights  by misrepresenting her eligibility to exercise them. See  Kanios, 2005 WL3579161, at *10 (advancing similar  theory under the FMLA). If the CTFMLA did not afford  her such rights, there would be no misrepresentation.  Put another way, there is no misrepresentation beyond  the alleged statutory violation. Both state and federal courts in Connecticut have held  that statutory violations cannot serve as the sole bases  for common law employment-related claims. See  Michalsky, 2020 WL 5537003, at *6 (violation of statutes  could not be used to ""satisfy the injury prong of a  negligent supervision claim""); Deguzman v. Kramer, No.  3-04-CV-2064 (JCH), 2005 WL 2030447, at *2 (D.  Conn. Aug. 23, 2005) (noting that a claim for negligent  supervision requires [*25]  an ""injury in tort,"" and ""[f]or  this court to allow a violation of [a federal employment  law statute] to satisfy the injury prong of [a negligent  supervision claim] would be to create a cause of action  under state law with no indication from either the  Connecticut legislature or courts that such a cause of  action is appropriate""); see also Powell, 2010 WL  2383784, at *5 (plaintiff could not bring breach of the 15 implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim  based ""exclusively on the public policy embodied in the  CFEPA""). The Court finds the rationale of these cases  persuasive, and likewise finds that Plaintiff cannot  sustain her common law cause of action based only on  an alleged violation of the CTFMLA. Even taking  Plaintiff's reading of the CTFMLA's non-exclusivity  provision, the Court cannot read it to expand the  availability of common law claims. The CTFMLA's clear, and relatively short, statute of  limitations period further persuades this Court that  employer liability should not be expanded to allow a  negligent misrepresentation claim based entirely on a  CTFMLA violation to proceed when it is brought outside  of that limitations period. See Conn. Gen. Stat. § 31- 51pp(e) (setting statute of limitations for CTFMLA claim  at  ""one  hundred [*26]   eighty  calendar  days"");  Thibodeau v. Design Grp. One Architects, LLC, 260  Conn. 691, 716 (2002) (noting that the common law is  ""powerless to abrogate"" statutory enactments, and the  two should ""be construed together as one consistent  and  harmonious  whole"")  (citation  omitted);  S.  Connecticut Gas Co. v. City of New Haven Hous. Auth.,  No. 27 97 11, 1991 WL 270372, at *1 (Conn. Super. Ct.  Dec. 5, 1991) (""The general rule is that where a statute  gives a right of action which did not exist at common  law, and fixes the time within which the right must be  enforced, the time fixed is a limitation or condition  attached to the right - it is a limitation of the liability itself  as created, and not of the remedy alone."") (quoting  Diamond Nat. Corp. v.Dwelle, 164 Conn. 540, 543  (1973)). Plaintiff cannot reincarnate her time-barred  CTFMLA claim in negligent misrepresentation form. Separately, Plaintiff's negligent misrepresentation claim  could also properly be characterized as a claim for  wrongful termination in violation of public policy, which  directly implicates Burnham and its progeny, and would  tend to preclude the claim. Plaintiff alleges that as a  result of Defendant's misrepresentation of her eligibility  under the CTFMLA, she did not 16 apply for benefits and ""as a result was terminated."" ECF  No. 1-5 ¶ 78. Plaintiff conceded at oral argument that  the harm from the negligent misrepresentation was the  termination  itself.  Substantively,  then,  this [*27]   appears to be a wrongful termination claim ""mask[ed]""  as a negligence claim, to which Burnham's rule of  statutory exclusivity would apply. See Pickering, 100  Conn. App. at 79 (analyzing negligence per se claim  based on termination in violation of statute as wrongful  termination claim); see also Medvey v. Oxford Health  Plans, 313 F. Supp. 2d 94, 98-99 (D. Conn. 2004)  (""conspiracy"" claim for denial of employment and  disability benefits was ""nothing more than a common  law claim of wrongful discharge""). For these reasons,  Plaintiff is precluded from pursuing her common law  negligent misrepresentation claim. The parties devote significant discussion to Ridgeway,  in which Judge Bryant allowed common law promissory  estoppel and negligent misrepresentation claims to  proceed in a case also alleging violations of the FMLA  and CTFMLA. Like this Court, Judge Bryant did not  decide whether the phrase ""provisions of law"" in the  CTFMLA's non-exclusivity provision ""was intended to  refer to other statutory schemes or common law,"" but  she noted, in allowing the common law claims to  proceed past a motion to dismiss, that the non- exclusivity provision ""as a whole indicates that the  CTFMLA is not intended to function as an exclusive  Page 9 of 12 remedy to aggrieved employees."" 2012 WL 1033532, at  *18. In light of the non-exclusivity provision and the  lack [*28]  of any cases precluding common law  promissory estoppel and negligent misrepresentation  claims, Judge Bryant allowed these claims to proceed.  Id. at *20. This Court is not bound by Ridgeway and, in any event,  Ridgeway is factually distinguishable from the present  case. First, there, the common law claims were based  on the employer's misrepresentations of its policies to  the plaintiff, which led to the plaintiff not coming back to  work on time from a surgery. The claims were not, as in  the present case, wholly dependent 17 on a misrepresentation of the plaintiff's rights under the  CTFMLA. Second, the plaintiff in Ridgeway was not wrongfully terminated in violation of  the CTFMLA. As Defendant points out, Ridgeway's  termination was rightful under the statute because his  leave had expired-but his employer had misled him  about its policy for calculating leave and how much  leave he had left. Here, by contrast, Plaintiff's claim is  essentially that she was wrongfully terminated, in  violationof  the  statute,  because  of  Defendant's  interference with her rights under the statute. Third, the  plaintiff in Ridgeway was not attempting to resurrect an  otherwise untimely CTFMLA claim by labeling it  something else, as his complaint expressly [*29]   included a CTFMLA claim (and a federal FMLA claim)  alongside his state common law claims. For these  reasons, neither Ridgeway's holding nor its analysis  dictates the outcome here. In sum, because Plaintiff's negligent misrepresentation  claim is coextensive with a time-barred CTFMLA claim,  Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's negligent  misrepresentation claim is granted. In granting this  motion, the Court emphasizes the narrowness of its  holding: it does not suggest that all common law claims  or all negligent misrepresentation claims would be  precluded by the CTFMLA. In this specific case,  however, given the particular nature of the negligent  misrepresentation claim, Plaintiff's sole and exclusive  remedy was a timely claim brought under the CTFMLA. C. Count Six: Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress Finally, the Court dismisses Plaintiff's negligent infliction  of emotional distress claim. Under Connecticut law, ""[t]o  prevail on a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress, the plaintiff must prove: '(1) the defendant's  conduct created an unreasonable risk of causing the  plaintiff emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's distress was  foreseeable; (3) the emotional distress [*30]  was  severe enough that it might result in illness or bodily  harm; and (4) the 18 defendant's conduct was the cause of the plaintiff's  distress.'"" Grasso v. Connecticut Hospice,Inc., 138  Conn. App. 759, 771 (2012) (internal citation omitted). In  the employment context, a negligent infliction of  emotional distress (""NIED"") claim arises only when it is  based on ""unreasonable conduct of the defendant in the  termination process""-it cannot arise out of conduct that  occurs in continued employment. Id. (citing Perodeau v.  Hartford, 259 Conn. 729, 750, 762- 63 (2002)). In  implementing this limitation on NIED claims, the  Perodeau court emphasized that the policy rationales in  favor of this limitation, such as enabling employers to  ensure productivity in the workplace and preventing a  flood of potentially spurious litigation, outweighed the  interest in allowing persons to be compensated for  emotional injuries ""when the employment relationship is  ongoing."" Perodeau, 259 Conn. at 758-60. The court  found that ""individuals in the workplace reasonably  should expect to experience some level of emotional  distress … as a result of conduct in the workplace,""  including from ""routine employment-related conduct …  such as disciplinary or investigatory action arising from  actual or alleged employee misconduct."" Id. at 757.  However, the ""societal costs of allowing claims"" [*31]   for this kind of quotidian workplace emotional distress  were ""unacceptably high,"" in the court's view. Id. at 762. Since Perodeau, courts have grappled with determining  exactly what the ""termination process"" or ""conduct  occurring  in  the  termination  of  employment""  encompasses. Id. at 763. Most courts applying the rule  in Perodeau to NIED claims brought by employees who  were actually terminated (rather than constructively  terminated 6) have considered the ""termination process""  to include the events immediately leading up to, and  immediately following, the termination of the 6 Many of the cases relied on by Defendant deal with  employees attempting to assert NIED claims in the  context  of  ongoing  employment,  constructive  termination, or resignation. See, e.g., Watson v.  Wheeler Clinic, Inc., No. 3:21-CV-0503 (MPS), 2022 WL  2916825 (D. Conn. July 25, 2022); Grande v. Hartford  Bd. of Educ., No. 19-CV-00184 (KAD), 2020 WL 70815  Page 10 of 12 (D. Conn. Jan. 7, 2020); Michaud v. Farmington Cmty.  Ins. Agency, No. CV010806951S, 2002 WL 31415478  (Conn. Super. Ct. Sept. 25, 2002). Understandably,  these cases interpret Perodeau to prohibit these sorts of  claims, since there is either no termination process, or  the termination is of indeterminable duration. Since  Plaintiff here was actually terminated by Defendant, the  Court finds these cases of limited relevance. 19 employee. See, e.g., Tomick v. United Parcel Serv.,  Inc., 511 F. Supp. 2d 235, 238 (D. Conn. 2007)  (considering two-day period from when employer first  threatened to fire employee until employee was fired the  next day as the ""termination process""); Davis v.  Manchester Health Ctr.,Inc., 88 Conn. App. 60, 72-73  (2005) (events [*32]  of the day leading up to  termination could be reasonably considered by jury in  evaluating NIED claim). They have by and large  declined to extend the ""termination process"" to events  weeks or months before the termination of employment. See Tracy v. New Milford Pub. Sch., 101 Conn. App.  560, 572 (2007) (disciplinary action taken one year prior  to discharge was not part of the termination process  where it was not ""connect[ed]"" to the discharge  process); Ferrari v. First & Last Tavern of Guilford, No.  NNHCV076001677S, 2009 WL 4852193, at *7 (Conn.  Super. Ct. Nov. 19, 2009) (""progression of events"" over  an ""eighty-seven day"" period was not part of the  termination); Dichello v. Marlin Firearms Co., No.  CV065002796, 2009 WL 2506329, at *3-*4 (Conn.  Super. Ct. July 9, 2009) (circumstances surrounding  decision to take medical leave six months before  termination were not part of the termination process). Here, the Court finds it appropriate to determine that, as  a matter of law, 7 the termination process encompasses  the events of June 30, 2022, which involved Plaintiff  being ""placed on emergency PTO by Doyle due to  particularly extreme bout of vomiting,"" and being  terminated later that same day. See ECF No. 1-5 ¶¶ 42,  43; id. ¶ 79 (incorporating these paragraphs by  reference into NIED claim). No case identified by  Defendant requires that the termination process is  limited only to a single moment in time, particularly  when the plaintiff puts forth allegations of events very  near [*33]  to the actual termination that could  reasonably be construed as part of the process. 7 The Court notes that at least one case, cited by  Plaintiff, declined to determine the scope of the  termination process because it concluded this was the  province of the fact-finder. See Noonan v. Miller Mem'l  Cmty. Home, Inc., 50 Conn. Supp. 367, 371-72 (Super.  Ct. 2007) . However, Noonan is not binding on this  Court, and the Court agrees with Defendant's reply that  it is against the weight of authority in this area. See ECF  No. 26 at 5 (collecting cases). 20 See, e.g., Dichello, 2009 WL 2506329, at *4  (considering contents of termination letter, and manner  in which it was sent or delivered, in assessing NIED  claim, while declining to consider events six months  earlier). On the other hand, the Court rejects Plaintiff's argument  that certain pre-termination events took place within the  ""termination process."" See ECF No. 23 at 9 (citing ECF  No. 1-5 ¶¶ 15, 20, 24). First, although Plaintiff alleges in  paragraph 15 of her complaint that she was told she  ""might"" be terminated if she missed work for pregnancy- related appointments, she does not provide any  specifics as to when she was told this; a finding that the  termination process extends to the unspecified dates of  those comments would therefore be unsupportable.  Moreover, [*34]  the written warnings Plaintiff received  on March 29, 2022, and April 7, 2022, for absences are  more akin to disciplinary incidents arising from her  alleged misconduct that fall short of actual termination,  even if they arguably contributed to her ultimate  termination. See Groth v. Grove Hill Med. Ctr.,P.C., No.  3:14-CV-01563 RNC, 2015 WL 4393020, at *8-*9 (D.  Conn. July 15, 2015) (citing Perodeau to find that written warning and investigation  preceding termination were best characterized as  disciplinary or investigatory actions arising from the  plaintiff's misconduct, rather than events that are part of  the termination process). A holding that the termination  process encompasses the events of June 30, 2022,  only, accords with Perodeau and its progeny. Once the termination process is delineated, the question  becomes whether the alleged conduct of the defendant  is sufficiently unreasonable to state a claim for NIED.  On this question, courts look to whether the termination  was  ""done  in  an  inconsiderate,  humiliating  or  embarrassing manner."" Corcoran v. G&E Real Est.  Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 484 F. Supp. 3d 43, 53 (D. Conn.  2020) (internal citation omitted). ""The mere termination  of employment, even where it is wrongful,"" is not  enough to sustain an NIED claim, since the ""mere act of  firing an employee, even if wrongfully Page 11 of 12 21 motivated, does not transgress the bounds of socially  tolerable behavior."" Parsons v. UnitedTechs. Corp.,  Sikorsky Aircraft Div., 243 Conn. 66, 88-89 (1997) [*35]   (internal citation omitted). Here, the Court finds that the allegations regarding  Defendant's conduct on June 30, 2022, do not rise to  the level necessary to state a claim for NIED. Initially,  Plaintiff does not argue that any events on June 30,  2022, were so unreasonable as to support a NIED  claim. Moreover, Plaintiff's allegations-that she was  ""placed on emergency PTO . . . due to [a] particularly  extreme bout of vomiting,"" terminated via phone call  later that day, and told during that phone call that she  had ""a lot of medical issues,"" ECF No. 1-5 ¶¶ 42-43-do  not transgress the bounds of socially tolerable behavior.  See Parsons, 243 Conn. at 89. Though Defendant may  have acted somewhat insensitively by firing Plaintiff the  day she was sent home for extreme pregnancy-related  vomiting, the Court cannot find that Defendant's conduct  was so unreasonable as to sustain an NIED claim, in  light of the standards Connecticut courts use to assess  the viability of such claims. Indeed, Plaintiff has not  alleged any particular emotional distress associated with  the timing of her termination. Additionally, Plaintiff has not alleged that she was forced  to choose between her health and her job, or that  Defendant interfered [*36]  with her efforts to pursue  health care on June 30, 2022. See,e.g., Davis, 88 Conn.  App. at 72-73 (jury could have reasonably found for the  plaintiff on an NIED claim where ""there was no real  alternative other than to sacrifice her job rather than  endanger her pregnancy""); Tomick, 511 F. Supp. 2d at  238-39 (denying motion to dismiss NIED claim where  ""superiors  restrict[ed]  [plaintiff's]  efforts  to  seek  treatment for a known back condition"" and instead  ""prevented him from leaving and threatened to terminate  him""). Plaintiff does not suggest that Defendant told her  on June 30, 2022, that she should work despite her  extreme vomiting, or suggested putting her health at risk  in any way that day. Doyle telling Plaintiff she had ""a lot  of 22 medical issues"" likewise is not inherently inconsiderate,  humiliating, embarrassing, or beyond ""the bounds of  socially tolerable behavior;"" especially when Plaintiff  herself makes clear that she didhave at least two  medical issues-her pregnancy-related condition and  COVID-19, see ECF No. 1-5 ¶¶ 6, 9-and alleges nothing  about Doyle's tone, or anything else about the statement  that might have made it more problematic in context. In sum, because this Court finds that Plaintiff's  complaint fails to allege that Defendant's [*37]  conduct  during the termination process was unreasonable,  Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's NIED claim is  granted.

Rule 12(f) provides, in  pertinent part, that ""[t]he court may strike from a  pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant,  immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter."" Fed. R.  Civ. P. 12(f). A party moving to strike ""bears a heavy  burden and must show that (1) no evidence in support  of the allegations would be admissible; (2) the  allegations have no bearing on the issues in the case;  and (3) permitting allegations to stand would result in  prejudice to the movant."" MC1 Healthcare, Inc.v. United  Health Grp., Inc., No. 3:17-CV-01909 (KAD), 2019 WL  2015949, at *11 (D. Conn. May 7, 2019) (internal  punctuation omitted) (quoting Walczak v. Pratt &  Whitney, No. 3:18-CV-0563 (VAB), 2019 WL 145526, at  *2 (D. Conn. Jan. 9, 2019)), reconsideration granted in  part, 2019 WL 3202965 (D. Conn. July 16, 2019). In  evaluating the relevance and admissibility 8 Plaintiff argues that Defendant's motion to strike is  time-barred since it was filed after Defendant filed its  answer. ECF No. 23 at 16; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f)  (the court may act on a motion to strike made ""before  responding to the pleading""). As with Plaintiff's  procedural argument against Defendant's motion to  dismiss, the Court declines to consider Defendant's  motion to strike untimely in light of the fact that it was  filed  twenty-one  minutes [*38]   after  Defendant's  answer, and will instead assess the motion on the  merits. See supra, note 1. This conclusion is further  bolstered by the fact that Defendant did not respond to  the paragraphs it moves to strike, see supra, note 1. 23 questions in the context of evaluating a 12(f) motion, the  court is mindful that ""[e]videntiary questions…should  especially be avoided at such a preliminary stage of the  Page 12 of 12 proceedings…[a]nd ordinarily neither a district court nor  an appellate court should decide to strike a portion of  the complaint on the grounds that the material could not  possibly be relevant on the sterile field of the pleadings  alone."" Lipsky v. Commonwealth United Corp., 551 F.2d  887, 893 (2d Cir. 1976). B. Discussion Defendant moves to strike all of the paragraphs in  Plaintiff's complaint that relate to and allege a violation  of CTFMLA. ECF No. 16-1 at 22. Without citation,  Plaintiff responds that the challenged paragraphs may  be relevant to her discrimination claims, since facts  which demonstrate a violation of the CTFMLA may tend  to provide a violation of the CFEPA. ECF No. 23 at 17- 18. Also without citation, Defendant replies that the  CFEPA does not require the same kinds of notices that  Defendant allegedly failed to provide under the  CTFMLA; therefore, [*39]  a violation of the CTFMLA is  irrelevant to the question of liability under the CFEPA.  See ECF No. 26 at 10-11. On this sparse record, the Court cannot conclude that  defendant has met its ""heavy burden"" under Rule 12(f).  See MC1, 2019 WL 2015949, at *11. Put simply,  Plaintiff's claims under the CFEPA require her to show  that she was discriminated against on the basis of a  protected characteristic, or retaliated against for  engaging in protected activity. See Conn. Gen. Stat. §§  46a-60(b)(1), (4), (7). Although the Court acknowledges  Defendant's contention that the CFEPA does not require  the same kind of notice as the CTFMLA, and that  Plaintiff has not brought a claim under the CTFMLA, the  Court is not prepared to conclude at this juncture,  without more of a showing, that allegations related to  potential violations of the CTFMLA are completely  irrelevant 24 to Plaintiff's other claims, or are unduly prejudicial to  Defendant. 9 Should this matter proceed to trial,  Defendant is free to revisit the question of admissibility  of evidence related to these allegations through a  motion in limine. Thus, Defendant's motion to strike certain paragraphs of  Plaintiff's complaint is denied.",1
"Commonwealth v. Appellant, 2023 Pa. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 3026","[*1] Appeal from the Judgment of Sentence Entered  March 2, 2022 In the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County  Criminal Division at No(s): CP-22-CR-0003352-2020  COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA : IN THE  SUPERIOR COURT OF   : PENNSYLVANIA   :   v. :   :   :   RICARDO R.

MEMORANDUM  BY  McCAFFERY,  J.:  FILED:  DECEMBER 7, 2023 In these consolidated matters,1 Ricardo Desouza  (Appellant) appeals nunc pro tunc from the March 2, 2022, judgments of  sentence, entered in the 1 The record reflects that Appellant filed a separate  notice of appeal at each docket number. Therefore, he  complied with Commonwealth v. Walker, 185 A.3d  969, 976 (Pa. 2018) (when a single order resolves  issues arising on (Footnote Continued Next Page) Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas, after a jury  convicted Appellant of sexual assault, terroristic threats, indecent assault, and  simple assault.2, 3 Page 2 of 11 Appellant's  convictions  stem  from  two  separate  incidents that both occurred on the evening of August 17, 2020. The trial court  imposed [*2]  an aggregate sentence of 114 to 228 months' incarceration. On  appeal, Appellant claims there  was  insufficient  evidence  supporting  his  convictions for sexual assault and indecent assault, the verdict was against the weight  of the evidence, and the trial court abused its discretion by imposing  consecutive sentences. Based on the following, we affirm. Statement of Facts As stated above, the underlying facts supporting  Appellant's convictions stem from two distinct events involving separate victims  that both took place more than one trial court docket, separate notices of  appeal must be filed for each case), overruled in part,  Commonwealth v. Young, 265 A.3d 462, 477 (Pa.  Dec. 2021) (reaffirming that Pa.R.A.P. 341 requires  separate notices of appeal when single order resolves  issues under more than one docket, but holding  Pa.R.A.P. 902 permits appellate court to consider  appellant's request to remediate error when notice of  appeal is timely filed); see also Pa.R.A.P. 902  (amended May 18, 2023). This Court consolidated these appeals sua sponte on  July 10, 2023. See Order, 7/10/23. 2 The record contains various spellings of Appellant's  first name as ""Richardo,"" ""Richard,"" and ""Ricardo."" The  last spelling was used in the trial transcripts and criminal  dockets; therefore, [*3]  we will utilize it in our  memorandum. 3 18 Pa.C.S. 3124.1, 2701(a)(1), 3126 (a)(1), and  2701(a)(1), respectively. on the evening of August 17, 2020. The trial court  summarized the circumstances concerning Appellant's assault of his first  victim, J.G., as follows: At trial, [J.G.] testified that on August 17, 2020,  Appellant came to pick her up and the two drove around  in Appellant's car. The two had an intimate relationship a year previous to  the two meeting up again. After driving around and  stopping to get an alcoholic beverage, the two got a  hotel room [at the Red Roof Inn. J.G.] believed the two  were going to eat pizza and watch a movie, and  Appellant specifically told her that 'he wasn't gonna try  anything.' Once in the room for a few hours, Appellant  asked [J.G.] several times to get into the shower with him. At  one point, . . . Appellant followed [J.G.] into the bathroom and  began to kiss her neck. She continued to deny his  advances and Appellant became annoyed and angry.  Appellant told [J.G.] that if she was not going to get  comfortable, he was going to leave. It was then that she  took her pants off and laid on the bed. Appellant asked if he could put his mouth on [J.G.'s]  vagina, to which she said no. However, Appellant  pushed her [*4]  panties down and put his mouth on her  vagina. [J.G.] tried to push Appellant's head away and he eventually stopped.  However, Appellant then took his penis out and beg[a]n trying to  force it into her vagina. [J.G.] testified that after  Appellant tried to force his penis into her vagina, and it  hurt, he then pushed his penis into her [anus]. Appellant  was on top of [J.G.] and his body weight held her down,  while she tossed and turned to avoid . . . contact, he forced his penis into her 'anal part.' [J.G.]  testified that the penetration lasted between [two] to  [three] minutes and on a scale of pain from [one] to 10,  was a 10. After Appellant removed his penis from  [J.G.'s] 'anal part' he attempted to put his penis in her  mouth; however, she pushed Appellant off of her sat up  and put her pants on. Trial Ct. Op. 5-6 (record citations omitted). At that point, J.G., attempted to leave and called her  cousin to pick her Page 3 of 11 up from the Red Roof Inn, but Appellant grabbed the  phone away from her. See Trial Ct. Op. at 6. Appellant then drove J.G. home.  Id. Later that night, J.G. was experiencing so much pain she went to the  hospital to be examined.4 Id.  There, she was interviewed by Detective Lee  Tarasi [*5]  of the Susquehanna Township Police Department. Id. J.G. stated that she  never consented to oral, vaginal, or anal sex with Appellant. Id. Shortly after the assault of J.G., Appellant asked his  second victim, C.L., to meet him at the Red Roof Inn in the same room he  had spent the earlier hours of the evening with J.G. Appellant and C.L.  shared an ""on again off again intimate relationship."" Trial Ct. Op. at 6. The trial  court described Appellant's assault of C.L. as follows: Appellant [asked C.L.] to meet up with him, which she  did. . . . When Appellant let [C.L.] into the room, she sat on the  edge of the bed and the two started talking. Appellant  became angry and he approached [C.L.] and ripped  shirt and bra off. Appellant also ripped a necklace off from [C.L.'s] neck  and began calling her names. Appellant told [C.L.] to  take her shorts off, which she did, and then pushed her  panties to the side and put his penis inside of her  vagina. [ ] Appellant then threw wooden hangers at  [C.L.] and punched her in the nose. She took pictures of  the injuries she sustained as the result of the hangers  hitting her and Appellant punching her in the nose. She  had injuries to her nose, eye, arms, hands and leg. [*6]   While [C.L.] was at the sink trying to address her  bleeding nose, Appellant walked up behind her and  inserted his penis into her again; however, when she  told him to stop, he did. [C.L.] testified that when she  met Appellant at the hotel that evening, it was not her  intent to have sex with him. 4 Jessica Martin, a forensic nurse examiner, performed  an examination of J.G. on August 18, 2020. See Trial  Ct. Op. at 7. Nurse Martain indicated that ""[w]hile [J.G.'s] physical examination did not reveal any  acute injuries to the vagina or anus, . . . that was not  uncommon in sexual assault cases."" Id. at 8 (record  citation omitted). [C.L.] left the hotel room in the morning and the two  exchanged conversations back and forth over the  following two weeks, including threats from Appellant.  She eventually received a text from Appellant accusing  her of going to the police regarding a sexual assault.  She explained that she had not contacted the police, but  about a week later, she reported the incident at the  hotel. Id. at 6-7 (record citations omitted). Detective Kevin Scott of the Susquehanna Township  Police Department testified and confirmed C.L. contacted the police  department on August 29, 2020. See [*7]  Trial Ct. Op. at 8. Given the amount of  time that had passed since the assault, Detective Scott did not recommend that  C.L. undergo an examination. Id. at 8-9. Procedural History On September 22, 2020, a criminal complaint at CP-22- CR-0003351- 2020 (Docket No. 3351) was filed charging Appellant  with two counts of sexual assault, one count of terroristic threats, two counts of  indecent assault, and one count of simple assault relating to the assault of  C.L. On that same day, a  criminal  complaint  at  CP-22-CR-0003352-2020  (Docket No. 3352) was filed charging Appellant with three counts of sexual assault  and one count of indecent assault, and one count of simple assault  relating to the assault of Page 4 of 11 J.G. The matter proceeded to a two-day jury trial, which  began on December 6, 2021. The jury heard testimony from both victims,  J.G. and C.L., Detectives Tarasi and Scott, and Nurse Martin. The jury convicted  Appellant of all charges the following day. On March 2, 2022, the trial court sentenced Appellant  as follows. At Docket No. 3351, the court imposed two  terms of 60 to 120 months' incarceration for both sexual  assault convictions, and four terms of three to 24 months' incarceration for the terrorist threats, [*8]   indecent assault, and simple assault convictions. All  Docket No. 3351-2020 sentences were imposed to run  concurrently with each other. At Docket No. 3352-2020,  the court imposed three terms of 54 to 108 months'  imprisonment for all three sexual assault convictions,  and a term of three to 24 months' imprisonment for the  indecent assault conviction. All Docket No. 3352-2020  sentences were imposed to run concurrently. The court  then ordered that both dockets be served consecutively,  which amounted to an aggregate term of 114 to 228  months' incarceration.5 On March 14, 2022, Appellant filed a post-sentence  motion at both dockets, which the trial court denied 16  days later. Appellant originally filed a timely notice of  appeal at Docket No. 3351, but it was withdrawn and  discontinued at the request of Appellant's counsel.6 5 Appellant was determined not to be a sexually violent  predator. 6 See Notice of Discontinuance of Action, 6/6/22.  On September 7, 2022, and October 20, 2022,  Appellant filed separate pro se petitions under the Post- Conviction Relief Act (PCRA)7 at each docket, and  counsel was appointed by court order. On October 10,  2022, Appellant filed an amended PCRA petition at  Docket [*9]  No. 3351, raising one issue regarding the  reinstatement of his post-sentence and direct appeal  rights due to a purported miscommunication with his trial  counsel. On January 19, 2023, the PCRA court entered  an amended order, appointing counsel also at Docket  No. 3352, noting the matters were consolidated, and  providing that ""[m]oving forward, the caption regarding  [Appellant]'s PCRA filings shall include both docket  numbers."" Amended Order, 1/19/23. An evidentiary  hearing was scheduled for March 7, 2023. However, on  February 28, 2023, the Commonwealth filed a  stipulation, indicating it would not object to the  reinstatement of Appellant's post-sentencing and direct  appeal rights. On March 2, 2023, the PCRA court  cancelled the evidentiary hearing and reinstated  Appellant's requested rights. 7 42 Pa.C.S. 9541-9546. On March 11, 2023, Appellant filed post-sentence  motions nunc protunc,8 which the trial court denied April  27, 2023. These timely notices of appeal followed.9, Issues Appellant presents the following issues for our review:  Whether the [t]rial [c]ourt erred as a matter of law  and/or abused its discretion in denying Appellant's  challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence presented at  trial to sustain [*10]  a conviction for sexual assault and  indecent assault? Whether the [t]rial [c]ourt erred as a  matter of law and/or abused its discretion in denying  Appellant's challenge to the weight of the evidence  regarding Appellant's conviction for sexual assault and  indecent assault? Whether the [t]rial [c]ourt erred as a  matter of law and/or abused its discretion in denying  Appellant's  request  for  reconsideration  and/or  modification of sentence to have the two dockets run  concurrent rather than consecutive, as set forth in  Appellant's [m]otion for [p]ost[-s]entence [r]elief? Appellant's Brief at 5.10 Analysis 8 In the motions, Appellant raised sufficiency, weight,  discretionary aspects of sentencing challenges. 9 The trial court directed Appellant to comply with  Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b). Appellant timely filed his concise  statement of errors complained of on appeal on June  12, 2023. The trial court issued its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a)  opinion on July 14, 2023. 10Based on the nature of Appellant's claims, we have  reordered them for ease of disposition. In his first issue on appeal, Appellant challenges the  Page 5 of 11 sufficiency of the evidence supporting both his sexual assault and  indecent assault convictions. See  Appellant's Brief at 15. Regarding his sexual [*11]   assault convictions, Appellant applies the same argument to both victims,  simply contending he did not engage in non-consensual intercourse. See id.  at 16-17. We review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence  by the following standard: As a general matter, our standard of review [for a  sufficiency claim] requires that we evaluate the record in  the light most favorable to the verdict winner giving the  prosecution the benefit of all reasonable inferences to  be drawn from the evidence. Evidence will be deemed  sufficient to support the verdict when it establishes each  material element of the crime charged and the  commission  thereof  by  the  accused  beyond  a  reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth  need not establish guilt to a mathematical certainty. Any  doubt about the defendant's guilt is to be resolved by  the fact finder unless the evidence is so weak and  inconclusive that, as a matter of law, no probability of  fact can be drawn from the combined circumstances. The Commonwealth may sustain its burden by means of  wholly circumstantial evidence. Accordingly, [t]he fact  that  the  evidence  establishing  a  defendant's  participating in a crime is circumstantial does not  preclude a conviction [*12]  where the evidence coupled  with the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom  overcomes the presumption of innocence. Significantly,  we may not substitute out judgment for that of the fact  finder; thus, so long as the evidence adduced, accepted  in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth,  demonstrates the respective elements of a defendant's  crimes beyond a reasonable doubt, the . . . convictions will be upheld. Commonwealth v. Windslowe, 158 A.3d 698, 708-09  (Pa. Super. 2017) (citation omitted). Pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. 3124.1, a defendant commits  the crime of sexual assault, a felony of the second  degree,  ""when  that  person  engages  in  sexual  intercourse or deviate sexual intercourse with a  complainant without the complainant's consent."" Sexual  intercourse is defined as follows: ""In addition to its  ordinary meaning, includes intercourse per os or per  anus, with some penetration however slight; emission is  not required."" 18 Pa.C.S.  3101. Deviate sexual intercourse is defined as: ""Sexual  intercourse per os or per anus between human beings. .  . . The term also includes penetration, however slight, of  the genitals or anus of another person with a foreign  object for any purpose other than good faith medical,  hygienic or law enforcement procedures."" Id. Consent [*13]  as a defense is defined, in relevant part,  under the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, as follows: ""The  consent of the victim to conduct charged to constitute an  offense or to the result thereof is a defense if such  consent negatives an element of the offense or  precludes the infliction of the harm or evil sought to be  prevented by the law defining the offense."" 18 Pa.C.S.  311. Moreover, ""[i]t is well established that resistance to  sexual assault is not required to sustain a conviction.""  Commonwealth v. Cramer, 195 A.3d 594, 602 (Pa.  Super. 2018) (citation & internal citation omitted). See  also 18 Pa.C.S. 3107 (resistance not required). Under  Pennsylvania law, even ""the uncorroborated testimony  of a sexual assault victim, if believed by the trier of fact,  is  sufficient  to  convict  a  defendant.""  Commonwealth v. Trippett, 932 A.2d 188, 201 (Pa.  Super. 2007) (citations omitted). As for the first victim, J.G., the trial testimony reveals the  following. J.G. testified that Appellant invited the victim  to the hotel room where J.G. believed the two were  going to ""chill"" and eat pizza. N.T., 12/6/21, at 109.  Appellant told her he was not going to try anything. Id.  Over the course of the evening, Appellant repeatedly  asked J.G. to get into the shower with him. Id. at 114. He followed J.G. into the bathroom [*14]  and  began to kiss her neck and try to pull her pants down.  Id. at 115. J.G. denied his advances and locked the  bathroom door behind her. Id. Once J.G. left the  bathroom, she took her pants off and laid them on the  bed. Id. at 116. Appellant asked if he could perform oral  sex on the victim, to which she said no, but despite her  refusals he pushed her panties down and put his mouth  on her vagina. Id. at 117-18. J.G. tried to push him away  and he eventually stopped. Id. Page 6 of 11 Appellant then tried to force his penis into J.G.'s vagina  and ultimately pushed his penis into her anus. Id. at  120. Appellant was on top of J.G. holding her down with  his bodyweight as he penetrated her for two to three  minutes while J.G. ""tossed and turned"" in excruciating pain trying to  avoid contact. Id. Lastly, Appellant attempted to put his penis in [J.G.'s]  mouth. Id. J.G. testified that she never consented to any kind of  sex with Appellant. N.T., 12/6/21, at 127-28. The  Commonwealth introduced text message exchanges  between Appellant and J.G. at trial, which corroborated  J.G.'s testimonial evidence. For example, after J.G. accused  Appellant of rape, Appellant responded ""Bitch bye you're weird."" N.T.  12/7/21, at 264-65. [*15]  He continued, ""Bitch I didn't fuck you. I gave you head you  was tryna put it in but you stop so I stop tf bitch you acting like I hold you  down what the fuck. Rape tho get that from my name you weird bitch. You  are ugly as fuck. How I rape you when I been already fuck smh you weird g  shit."" Id. at 265 (grammatical and spelling errors in original). Jessica Martin, the forensic nurse examiner who  performed the examination of J.G., testified that the fact that J.G.'s  physical examination did not reveal acute injuries was not uncommon in sexual  assault cases. N.T., 12/6/21, at 192-95. Detective Tarasi's testimony regarding her investigation  of the alleged assault also corroborated the events. See N.T., 12/7/21,  at 250-52. Her investigation included watching hotel surveillance video  of Appellant and J.G. entering their room and going through text exchanges  between the two discussing the incident. Id. at 254, 260-66. In finding there was sufficient evidence to support the  convictions, the trial court explained its rationale as follows: [J.G.] testified that in the hotel room on the evening of  August 17th Appellant performed oral sex on her and  penetrated her vagina and anus with his penis, without  her consent. [*16]  While she tried to avoid his  movements, Appellant's body weight on top of [J.G.] immobilized her. The text message exchange  between she and Appellant following the incident  corroborated the events of that evening. Trial Ct. Op. at 9. We  conclude  the  evidence  presented  by  the  Commonwealth was more than sufficient to support the  jury's guilty verdict on the charges of sexual assault in  connection with J.G. J.G's testimony, as well as the  corroborating evidence, established that even though  she repeatedly rejected his sexual advances, Appellant  forcibly engaged in sexual intercourse per os and anus  without J.G.'s consent. SeeTrippett, 932 A.2d at 201.  Accordingly, Appellant's convictions for sexual assault of J.G. are  supported by the evidence and all the elements of the  crime are met. SeeWindslowe, 158 A.3d at 708-09. As for the second victim, C.L., evidence adduced at trial  also demonstrated she also did not consent to sexual  intercourse. C.L. testified that she met Appellant at the  Red Roof Inn. N.T., 12/6/21, at 144. The two were  sitting and talking on the edge of the bed when  Appellant became angry because C.L. wanted to leave,  and he ripped her shirt and bra off. Id. at 146. Appellant  then ripped a necklace off from C.L.'s [*17]  neck and  called her names. Id. 147-48. Appellant told C.L. to remove her shorts and  pushed her panties to the side as he pushed his penis  inside of her vagina. Id. at 148-149. She testified she  did not remember exactly what she said to him, but that  she ""was just hesitant."" Id. at 148. Appellant punched  her in the nose and threw wooden hangers at her. Id. at  149-50. When C.L. was cleaning up her bloody nose at  Page 7 of 11 the bathroom sink, Appellant came up behind and  inserted his penis inside her again. Id. at 155. Although C.L. did not  immediately report the attack, she took pictures of the injuries she sustained  that night. Id. at 151. The pictures were admitted at trial and showed that she  had sustained injuries to her nose, eye, arms, hands, and leg. Id. at 152. C.L.  left the hotel room that morning and the two continued to be in contact for  the following two weeks. Id. at 158-59. Appellant threatened Appellant  viatext message, accusing her of going to the police to report on the  sexual assault. Id. at 163. C.L. reported the assault about a week later. Id. Detective Scott testified that the scene he processed on  August 18, 2020, corroborated the alleged assault C.L. reported on  August 30, 2020: Detective [*18]  Scott photographed the room and  described [it] as being in disarray, with broken hangers  in the room and sheets and towels thrown about. He  also described a pillow and other bed linens with what  appeared to be blood clusters on them. As Detective  Scott went through the contents of the trash can from  the room, he found broken hangers, a torn woman's  shirt and a torn gray bra. There was also a white  undershirt found in the trash can with blood on it, and a  towel that also has blood on it. There was also a white,  long-sleeve shirt, size extra-small, found in the trash  can. Trial Op. at 8. As mentioned above, it was not  recommended that C.L. undergo a physical examination given how much time  had passed since the assault. See N.T., 12/6/21, at 227. These circumstances sub judice are akin to those in  Cramer, supra. There, the victim went to the defendant's apartment  after meeting him in a bar. Cramer, 195 A.3d at 599. She was in the bathroom  when the defendant followed her in. Id. As the victim was washing her  hands, the defendant ""started penetrating her from behind."" Id. Appellant did not stop until the Victim ""turned around  and told him that she didn't want to do this again and  that I wasn't on the pill."" Appellant [*19]  then started  kissing her again. Appellant wanted to have oral sex  and the Victim ""went along with it . . . ."" She stopped  giving him oral sex and told him ""you don't want this. I  don't want this. This is going to end badly for both of  us."" She then left the bathroom. Id. (record citations omitted). The defendant was  convicted of sexual assault pursuant to Section 3124.1. Id. at 601. On appeal, the  defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, claiming that the incident  was consensual because the victim did not consent by physical  resistance. Id. A panel of this Court rejected that argument, concluding there was  sufficient evidence to support the conviction based on the trial court's findings,  which included that ""the jury obviously believed [the v]ictim's testimony that  she did not consent to the sexual contact when she characterized the  incident as rape."" Id. at 602 (citation omitted). See alsoCommonwealth v.  Andrulewicz, 911 A.2d 162, 166 (Pa. Super. 2006) (""the court[, sitting as fact- finder] was free to accept [the victim]'s characterization of what transpired  with [defendant], particularly her representation that [defendant] ""raped""  her, which connotes Page 8 of 11 a  lack  of  consent  to  the  act  committed."").  Similarly, [*20]  here, the jury clearly believed the evidence that even though C.L. did not  explicitly resist, she did not consent to sexual contact with Appellant based on  the fact that she characterized the incident as an assault when reporting  to police. N.T., 6/7/22, at 224. Moreover, the jury heard the contents of  certain text messages between the victim and Appellant,  in which she stated, ""You fuckin' and rapin' multiple  bitches then forcing your shit in me. . . . Regardless of  how our past is, this is fucked what you did to me."" Id. at  229 (grammatical and spelling errors in original). Based  on the totality of the circumstances, we conclude C.L.'s  testimony and evidence from the investigation, including Appellant's use of force, support Appellant's convictions  for sexual assault - Appellant penetrated C.L. per os  and anus and she did not consent to engaging in sexual  intercourse with Appellant. See Trippett, 932 A.2d at  201; Windslowe, 158 A.3d at 708-09. For the same reasons discussed above, Appellant  convictions for indecent assault are supported by the  evidence. Appellant argues that the evidence was not  sufficient to meet the elements of indecent assault  because Appellant ""did not cause"" either of his victims  ""to come into contact [*21]  with seminal fluid, urine, or  feces for the purpose of"" sexual arousal. See Appellant's Brief at 17-18. Pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. 3126(a)(1), a person is guilty of  indecent assault, in relevant part, if the person has indecent contact with the complainant,  causes the complainant to have indecent contact with  the person or intentionally causes the complainant to  come into contact with seminal fluid, urine or feces for  the purpose of arousing sexual desire in the person or  the complainant and: (1) the person does so without the complainant's  consent[.] Id. Indecent contact is defined as ""[a]ny touching of the  sexual or other intimate parts of the person for the  purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire, in any  person."" 18 Pa.C.S. 3101. Based on the testimony reviewed by the jury and  discussed above, we agree with the trial court that the  evidence supported the indecent assault convictions.  Contrary to his argument, the testimony established  Appellant engaged in indecent contact with both victims  for the purposes of arousing his own sexual desire and  he did so without their consent. Accordingly, Appellant's sufficiency arguments fail. In his next argument, Appellant contends the verdict  was against the weight of the evidence [*22]  presented  at trial.11 See Appellant's Brief at 19. Appellant asserts the testimony supports the notion that  the ""encounter[s]"" were ""consensual, and thus, not  sexual assault and indecent assault as convicted."" Id. at  19. Moreover, Appellant argues the fact that he and C.L.  had a previous relationship and continued to be involved  after the event belies his convictions. Id. at 19-20. The standard by which we review challenges to the  weight of the evidence is well-settled: The weight of the evidence is a matter exclusively for  the finder of fact, who is free to believe all, part, or none  of the evidence and to determine the credibility of the  witnesses. A new trial is 11 On March 11, 2023, Appellant properly preserved his  weight claim in his post-sentence motion nunc pro tunc  pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 607. not warranted because of a mere conflict in the  testimony and must have a stronger foundation than a  reassessment of the credibility of witnesses. Rather, the  role  of  the  trial  judge  is  to  determine  that  notwithstanding all the fact, certain facts are so clearly  of greater weight that to ignore them or to give them  equal weight with all the facts is to deny justice. On  appeal, our purview is extremely limited [*23]  and is  confined to whether the trial court abused its discretion  in finding that the jury verdict did not shock its  conscience. Thus, appellate review of a weight claim  consists of a review of the trial court's exercise of  discretion, not a review of the underlying question of  whether the verdict is against the weight of the  evidence. Commonwealth v. Williams, 255 A.3d 565, 580 (Pa.  Super. 2021) (citation Page 9 of 11 omitted). Here, the trial court found the verdict was not against  the weight of the evidence because the victims' ""credible testimony""  supporting their accounts of the attacks was sufficient to support the challenged  convictions. Trial Ct. Op. at 10. Upon our review, we find no abuse of discretion of the  trial court's ruling denying Appellant's weight of the evidence challenge.  Appellant fails to explain how the court abused its discretion in denying  his weight of the evidence claim. Rather, he asks us to reweigh certain  evidence concerning C.L. in his favor, which we are not permitted to do. See  Williams, 255 A.3d at 580. Thus, Appellant's weight claim fails. In his final challenge, Appellant argues his consecutive  sentences are excessive ""in light of the conduct at issue."" Appellant's  Brief at 14 (citation omitted). Specifically, Appellant asserts [*24]  the two  assaults should constitute one event given the proximity of time in which they  occurred, stating ""[t]he consecutive terms are based on events so close  together in time and so intertwined by the facts of each case, that they  constitute one event, rather than separate events."" Id. 14. Additionally, Appellant  notes his lack of criminal history prior to the time of trial as mitigating  circumstances. Id. For these reasons, Appellant claims a substantial question  was raised. Id. We disagree. Appellant's argument qualifies as a challenge to the  discretionary aspects of his sentence. See Commonwealth v.  Gonzalez-Dejusus, 994 A.2d 595 (Pa. Super. 2010) (claim involving the  imposition of consecutive sentences was excessive constituted discretionary  aspects of sentencing claim). It is well established that such a challenge does  not entitle an appellant to ""review as of right."" Commonwealth v.  Caldwell, 117 A.3d 763, 768 (Pa. Super. 2015) (en banc) (citation omitted). Rather, [b]efore this Court can address such a discretionary  challenge, an appellant must comply with the following  requirements: An appellant challenging the discretionary  aspects of his sentence must invoke this Court's  jurisdiction by [*25]  satisfying a four-part test: (1) whether appellant has filed a timely notice of appeal,  see Pa.R.A.P. 902 and 903; (2) whether the issue was  properly preserved at sentencing or in a motion to  reconsider and modify sentence, see Pa.R.Crim.P.  [720]; (3) whether appellant's brief has a fatal defect,  Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f); and (4) whether there is a substantial  question that the sentence appealed from is not  appropriate under the Sentencing Code. Id. Appellant properly preserved his claim in a timely filed  post-sentence motion nunc pro tunc before the trial court, and a timely  notice of appeal before this Court. Additionally, his brief includes the  requisite Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f) statement of reasons for allowance of appeal.  See Appellant's Brief at 14.12 We now must determine whether Appellant's  claim presents a Page 10 of 11 substantial question justifying our review. An appellant ""presents a substantial question when he  sets forth a plausible argument that the sentence violates a  provision of the sentencing code or is contrary to the fundamental norms of the  sentencing process."" Commonwealth v. Conte, 198 A.3d 1169, 1174 (Pa.  Super. 2018) (citation omitted). A court's exercise of discretion in imposing a sentence  concurrently or consecutively does not ordinarily raise a  substantial  question.  Rather,  the  imposition  of  consecutive [*26]  rather than concurrent sentences will  present a substantial question in only the most extreme  circumstances, such as where the aggregate sentence  is unduly harsh, considering the nature of the crimes  and the length of imprisonment. To make it clear, a defendant may raise a substantial  question where he receives consecutive sentences  within the guideline ranges if the case involves  circumstances where the application of the guidelines  would be clearly unreasonable, resulting in an excessive  sentence; however, 12 Appellant sets forth a Rule 2119(f) statement,but  does not include a separate section labeled such.  Nonetheless, ""we will not find that Appellant has not  waived his discretionary sentencing claim based upon  his lack of compliance with Rule 2119(f) as the  Commonwealth did not object to Appellant's failure to adhere to the appellate rules.""  Commonwealth v.Kurtz, 294 A.3d 509, 535 (Pa.  Super. 2023). a bald claim of excessiveness due to the consecutive  nature of a sentence will not raise a substantial  question. Commonwealth v. Caldwell, 117 A.3d 763, 769 (Pa.  Super. 2015) (citations & quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original). Generally,  ""[a]  challenge  to  the  imposition  of  consecutive rather than concurrent sentences does not present a substantial  question regarding the discretionary [*27]   aspects  of  sentence.""  Commonwealth v. Lloyd, 878 A.2d 867 (Pa. Super 2005). ""Thus, . . . the key to resolving the  preliminary substantial question inquiry is whether the decision to sentence  consecutively raises the aggregate sentence to, what appears upon its face to  be, an excessive level in light of the criminal conduct at issue in the case.""  Gonzalez-Dejusus, 994 A.2d at 598-99 (Pa. Super. 2010). Here, the trial court found the following: [I]n sentencing Appellant, [the trial court] noted that  while . . . Appellant had no prior record, nor was he deemed to be  a sexually violent predator, the violent nature of the  attacks on both women was a significant factor. [The  trial court] also cited the trauma to [J.G. that she]  continue[d] to experience . . . as a result of her assault.  Here, because it was within the [trial court]'s discretion  to run Appellant's sentences consecutive, and no  substantial question regarding the discretionary aspects  of the sentence have been raised, Appellant's argument  lacks merits. Trial Ct. Op. at 4. We are in agreement with the trial court that Appellant  did not raise a substantial question in light of his criminal conduct.  While the crimes may have happened in one night, Appellant [*28]  sexually  and violently assaulted two separate victims. He left one victim with significant  physical injuries following the attack while the other victim continued to suffer  emotionally months after the attack. Accordingly, we do  not find Appellant has raised a substantial question for  our review. SeeGonzalez-Dejusus, 994 A.2d 595 at  599 (concluding no substantial question raised by  imposition of consecutive sentences in light of criminal  Page 11 of 11 conduct, including ""a 'crime spree' [involving] an armed  robbery . . . a kidnapping . . . [and] a car theft."") (citation  omitted). Furthermore, to extent Appellant argues that the court  failed to consider his individual circumstances, having  neither a prior criminal record nor a history as a sexually  violent predator, these allegations also do not amount to  a substantial question. ""An appellant's contention that  the trial court did not adequately consider a mitigating  circumstance when imposing sentence does not raise a  substantial question sufficient to justify appellate review  of the merits of such claim."" Commonwealth v.  Ladamus, 896 A.2d 592, 595 (Pa. Super. 2006)  (citation omitted). See also Commonwealth v. Disalvo,  70 A.3d 900, 903 (Pa. Super 2013) (""[T]his Court has  held  on  numerous  occasions  that  a  claim  of  inadequate [*29]  consideration of mitigating factors  does not raise a substantial question for our review."").  Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Appellant has  failed to raise a substantial question that his sentence  was excessive. Consequently, we need not address his  final claim further.

After a careful review, we affirm. The relevant facts and procedural history are as follows:  Appellant, who Page 2 of 12 was fifty-one years [*2]  old, was arrested and charged  in connection with the sexual abuse of his eleven-year-old granddaughter (""the  victim""). Appellant proceeded to an arraignment on November 5, 2021, at  which time bail was set at 10% of $75,000.00. Appellant did not post bail  and remained incarcerated; however, he filed a motion seeking a bail  reduction. In response, the Commonwealth filed a motion to  increase Appellant's bail. Therein, the Commonwealth relevantly indicated: A review of [Appellant's] criminal history reveals that he  was charged and convicted between the years of 2001  and 2003 via the United States Military Criminal Justice  System of Indecent [Acts or] Liberties with a Child[.]  [Appellant's] criminal history also shows that he served  a term of confinement, was dishonorably discharged,  and required to register as a sex offender after release  as a result of these convictions. As a result of his  previous convictions and pursuant to 40 Pa.C.S.A.  9718.2, if [Appellant] is convicted of any one of the  counts charged in the present criminal Information, he  faces a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty-five  (25) years of total confinement. Commonwealth's Motion to Modify Bail, filed 1/20/22, at  2-3. 1 18 Pa.C.S.A. 3123(b), 3126(a)(7), and 6301(a)(1)(ii),  respectively. [*3]  2 18 Pa.C.S.A. 3126(a)(7). Thereafter, at the conclusion of Appellant's preliminary  hearing on January 12, 2022, the magisterial district justice held a  hearing on the issue of bail. During the hearing,  Appellant admitted he was charged with a crime while  he was in the military. N.T., 1/12/22, at 38. He  specifically testified he ""took a guilty plea to a sex offense regarding a minor  family member[.]""3 Id. at 39. On March 1, 2022, at lower court docket number 49- 2022, the Commonwealth filed an Information charging  Appellant with 319 crimes related to the sexual abuse of  the victim over a four-year period. On that same date, at  lower court docket number 50-2022, the Commonwealth  filed an Information charging Appellant with three crimes  related to the sexual abuse of the same victim at  Appellant's place of employment. The Commonwealth  provided notice of compulsory joinder of the two cases  pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure  582(B)(1). On May 24, 2022, the Commonwealth filed a motion for  a protective order to secure Appellant's prior criminal  military records. Therein, the Commonwealth noted that,  when Appellant was in the United States Army, he was  previously convicted of, inter alia, indecent acts or  liberties with a child by the United States [*4]  Military  criminal justice system. The Commonwealth 3 Although not pertinent to this appeal, we note the  magisterial district justice denied Appellant's request to  reduce bail, as well as denied the Commonwealth's  request to increase bail. noted it requested the official records related to  Appellant's prior criminal military court-martial; however,  the United States Army responded that it required a  protective order limiting disclosure by a signed judge  prior to releasing the certified criminal records. In its  motion, the Commonwealth specifically averred the  ""records will have bearing on the sentence imposed by  the trial court in the [instant] cases."" Commonwealth's  Motion For Protective Order, filed 5/24/22. On May 24,  2022, the trial court signed the protective order so that  the United States Army would release Appellant's  certified criminal military court-martial records to the  Commonwealth. On May 26, 2022, Appellant, who was represented by  counsel, proceeded to a hearing where he entered a  negotiated open guilty plea to the six charges set forth  supra. In exchange, the Commonwealth agreed to  nolpros all remaining charges.4 Relevantly, at the on- the-record  guilty  plea  hearing,  Appellant [*5]   acknowledged his plea agreement contained no  agreement as to his sentence.5N.T., 5/26/22, at 2. He  acknowledged his right to have a bench trial or a right to  a jury trial, and he confirmed his understanding that Page 3 of 12 4 Specifically, the Commonwealth agreed to nol pros all  remaining charges thirty-one days after sentencing  unless post-sentence motions or an appeal was filed in  which case the charges would be nol prossed thirty-one  days after the resolution of the matter. 5 Appellant agreed as part of the plea agreement that  he would complete a SORNA assessment with the  Sexual Offenders Assessment Board, and he would be  subject to SORNA's registration requirements. he was ""giving up"" that right by entering a guilty plea. Id.  at 3. Appellant indicated his attorney had been available to consult with  him and answered his questions. Id. He specifically acknowledged he was  satisfied with his attorney's representation. Id. Appellant confirmed he  was entering his guilty plea voluntarily and of his own free will, and no one  made any threats or promises beyond those in the written plea agreement.6  Id. On June 23, 2022, the Commonwealth filed notice of its  intent to seek the mandatory minimum sentence of 25 [*6]  years at  each of the six counts to which  Appellant  pled  guilty.  Specifically,  the  Commonwealth asserted it had received Appellant's certified military records, which  confirmed that Appellant has a prior conviction for indecent acts or liberties with a  child, dated June 5, 2003, from a United States Army General Court Martial.  The acts underlying 6 We note the oral guilty plea colloquy in this case was  brief. During the oral colloquy, the trial court noted  Appellant completed a written ""pleaders memorandum""  with the assistance of his counsel. N.T., 5/26/22, at 2. In  the ""pleaders memorandum,"" the charges to which  Appellant pled guilty are set forth. The ""pleaders  memorandum"" contains either ""n/a"" or a handwritten line  next to the area for ""mandatory minimum"" for each  crime. The written plea agreement, which is signed by the  Commonwealth, lists the charges to which Appellant  pled guilty, notes Appellant will be subject to SORNA,  notes the condition precedent for the Commonwealth to  nol pros the remaining charges, and indicates ""except  as expressly provided otherwise herein, there is no  other agreement as to sentence or any other matter."" Written Plea Agreement, filed 5/27/23. Appellant's military [*7]  conviction included Appellant  fondling an eleven-year-old victim's vaginal area and placing her hand on his  penis.7 On July 22, 2022, at both lower court docket numbers,  Appellant filed a counseled pre-sentence motion seeking to withdraw his  guilty pleas. Therein, Appellant relevantly averred that, on June 23, 2022, the  Commonwealth advised that it was seeking a mandatory 25-year  sentence on each of the six individual offenses to which Appellant pled guilty, and  Appellant was unaware of the mandatory minimums that would be associated  with his offenses when he pled guilty. Appellant averred the Commonwealth  would not be prejudiced if his pleas were withdrawn. On August 1, 2022, the Commonwealth filed a brief in  opposition to Appellant's pre-sentence motion to withdraw his guilty  pleas. Therein, the Commonwealth relevantly averred: Appellant cannot credibly claim that he was unaware of  applicable mandatory minimums. The Commonwealth  has repeatedly represented to [Appellant] through  counsel that a conviction for any Megan's Law offense  in the instant case would invoke a mandatory minimum  sentence of 25 years, which the Commonwealth  Page 4 of 12 intended to seek. Pursuant to applicable rules of  criminal procedure, [*8]  the Commonwealth gave  written notice of this intention after conviction/plea and  before sentencing. Finally, the Commonwealth asserts that it would be  prejudiced if [Appellant] is permitted to withdraw his  pleas. Withdrawal of said pleas will allow [Appellant] to  further prolong trial resulting in the memories and  recollection of the minor victim 7 The certified military records confirmed that Appellant  entered a guilty plea during the military court-martial,  and he was sentenced to twenty-one months in  confinement, as well as dishonorably discharged from  the military. and other witnesses fading. The Commonwealth would  be further prejudiced by said withdrawal as co- defendant, [Appellant's] son, Michael Shaulis, has pled  and has been sentenced pursuant to a closed  plea.[8]Michael Shaulis had previously indicated a  willingness to cooperate against [Appellant]. However,  Michael Shaulis was sentenced on June 6, 2022, with  the understanding that his cooperation would not be  necessary against [Appellant] since [Appellant] had pled  guilty days earlier. Having pled and been sentenced,  Michael Shaulis's credibility may be called into question  at the trial of his father, and Michael Shaulis may [*9]   lose willingness to cooperate since his case has been  disposed of and his sentence rendered. Had [Appellant]  not pled guilty, the Commonwealth would not have  pursued the sentencing of Michael Shaulis prior to the  trial of [Appellant]. Commonwealth's Brief, filed 8/1/22, at 2-3 (footnote  added). On August 22, 2022, the trial court held a hearing on  Appellant's pre- sentence motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. At the  hearing, defense counsel acknowledged that, prior to Appellant entering his guilty  pleas, he and the Assistant District Attorney had ""conversations with  regard to sentences."" N.T., 8/22/22, at 3. He confirmed the Assistant District  Attorney indicated ""there could possibly be mandatories as a result of a  conviction that [Appellant] had back in the Army many years prior."" Id.  However, defense counsel averred Appellant ""was not aware [when he  pled guilty] that he was receiving a mandatory."" Id. at 5. Defense counsel  indicated Appellant entered his guilty plea ""on the assumption that there  was no agreement…with regard to any mandatories that the Commonwealth was  seeking."" Id. 8  The  record  reveals  that,  with  Appellant's  encouragement, Michael Shaulis also sexually abused  the victim. As the [*10]  trial court noted, Appellant was  the ""orchestrator…the scheduler"" of the abuse. N.T.,  10/25/22, at 17. Defense counsel further indicated that, when he  informed Appellant of the Commonwealth's June 23, 2022, notice, Appellant  indicated ""it was not acceptable,"" so defense counsel filed a pre-sentence  motion to withdraw the guilty pleas. Id. at 4. Defense counsel informed the trial  court that ""quite frankly, [Appellant] does not want to withdraw his plea.  He would rather have the plea stand and have you sentence him without the  mandatories that he was advised of after."" Id. The Commonwealth, in response, noted Appellant's  argument at the hearing ""centered mostly on the fact that he doesn't  want the court to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years."" Id. at 6-7.  The Commonwealth Page 5 of 12 noted that, before Appellant entered his plea, the  Commonwealth informed Appellant that it was obtaining Appellant's criminal  military record to determine the applicability of the mandatory minimum  sentencing scheme in the case sub judice. Id. at 7. The Commonwealth  indicated: There were no representations prior to plea that the  Commonwealth would not seek the mandatory. And as  [defense counsel] told you, there was discussion [*11]   that the Commonwealth believed that the mandatory  may be applicable here. The [written] plea agreement, which is part of the record  in this case, indicates that there is no further agreement  as to sentence. There was no agreement that the  Commonwealth would or would not seek mandatories in  this case. Id. Additionally, the Commonwealth advised the trial court  that it would be substantially prejudiced if Appellant was permitted to  withdraw his guilty pleas. Specifically, the Commonwealth indicated: [Appellant] has to prove that the Commonwealth would  not be prejudiced by withdrawal of [his pleas in] this  case. The Commonwealth maintains the opposite. We  would, in fact, be prejudiced if the court were to allow  withdrawal here. The co-defendant, Michael Shaulis,  [who is Appellant's] son and the uncle of the victim here,  had indicated his willingness to cooperate against  [Appellant] to testify against him. [Michael Shaulis] pled  guilty, and we were waiting his sentencing pending  [Appellant's] decision to plead guilty. [Michael Shaulis] was sentenced on June 6, 2022[.]  [This was] [a]fter [Appellant] had entered a plea and with  the understanding that [Michael Shaulis's] cooperation  would not be [*12]  necessary against [Appellant]  because he had entered a plea. [The appellate courts] have indicated that the [trial] court  properly denied [a] defendant's motion to withdraw a  plea where a cooperating co-defendant had been pled  and sentenced prior to the [motion to] withdraw and  would therefore lack motivation to cooperate against the  defendant  at  issue.  For  that  reason,  [the  Commonwealth] believes that [the Commonwealth]  would also be severely prejudiced should the [trial] court  grant [Appellant's] motion to withdraw [in the instant  case]. Id. at 7-8. The trial court denied Appellant's pre-sentence motion  orally on the record.9 In so doing, the trial court noted that, when  Appellant pled guilty, he was aware the Commonwealth was seeking his military  records for the purposes of sentencing with the possibility that the  mandatory minimum 9 The trial court also filed a written order denying  Appellant's pre-sentence motion to withdraw on August  22, 2022. sentence would be applicable. Id. at 9. The trial court  noted that the written plea agreement indicated there  was no agreement as to the imposition of any sentence.  Id. Thus, the trial court concluded Appellant entered his  plea knowingly, intelligently, [*13]  and voluntarily. Id. Moreover, the trial court concluded that, if Appellant was  permitted  to  withdraw  his  guilty  pleas,  ""the  Commonwealth would be significantly prejudiced since  they had already completed their agreement with the co- defendant."" Id. at 9-10. Further, the trial court noted the  emotional trauma the child victim would likely suffer  given that she was told she would not have to testify at  trial against her grandfather. Id. at 10. On October 25, 2022, Appellant proceeded to a  sentencing  hearing,  at  which  the  trial  court  acknowledged it had a pre-sentence investigation  report. The trial court also acknowledged it had the  official records from the United States Army regarding  Appellant's prior military criminal conviction. Appellant  objected to the introduction of the United States Army's  records on the basis the records were hearsay. N.T.,  10/25/22, at 6. Appellant contended the Commonwealth  was ""required to bring someone in from the Department  of Army"" to testify about the records. Id. Moreover, during the sentencing hearing, defense  Page 6 of 12 counsel requested the trial court reconsider permitting  Appellant to withdraw his guilty pleas. Defense counsel  asserted  Appellant  was  unaware [*14]   that  the  Commonwealth was pursuing the imposition of a  mandatory minimum sentence and, had Appellant known, he would not have entered guilty pleas. Id. at 7.  Alternatively, defense counsel noted Appellant ""is willing  to stand by the guilty pleas that he previously entered in  this court on May 26, 2022, and asks the court not to  impose  the  mandatory  sentences  that  the  Commonwealth is requesting."" Id. at 8. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, argued the  mandatory minimum sentence is applicable based on  Appellant' prior military convictions, as confirmed by the  official United States Army records. Further, the  Commonwealth argued the trial court should impose the  sentences consecutively since, not only did Appellant  commit the sex acts against the young victim, but he  encouraged his son, the victim's uncle, to sexually  abuse the victim, as well. Id. at 13. Appellant informed the trial court that he was ""pushed  and forced"" into ""taking the deal"" while he was in the  military. Id. at 14. He noted his current victim's mother is  an ""unfit mother."" Id. He indicated he had remorse for  what happened to the victim. Id. The  trial  court  concluded  the  Commonwealth  established the existence of Appellant's [*15]  prior  military conviction by a preponderance of the evidence.  The trial court further concluded the military conviction  qualified as a previous conviction for purposes of  applying the mandatory minimum under 42 Pa.C.S.A.  9718.2. The trial court then sentenced Appellant to an  aggregate of 75 years to 150 years in prison.10 The trial court  gave Appellant credit for time served. Appellant filed a timely, counseled post-sentence motion  averring the trial court illegally imposed a mandatory minimum  sentence under 42 Pa.C.S.A. 9718 and 9799. Also, Appellant contended  the trial court erred in denying his pre-sentence motion to withdraw his  guilty pleas on the basis that, when Appellant pled guilty, he was unaware the  Commonwealth would be asking for a mandatory minimum sentence. By order entered on February 27, 2023, the trial court  denied Appellant's post-sentence motion. This timely, counseled appeal  followed,11 and all Pa.R.A.P. 1925 requirements have been met. On appeal, Appellant sets forth the following issues in  his ""Statement of the Questions Involved"" (verbatim): 1. Did the court err by not permitting your Appellant to  withdraw his plea after he was notified that the  Commonwealth would be seeking the imposition of a  mandatory sentence based upon [*16]  the prior military  history? 10 Specifically, imposing the mandatory minimum  sentence, the trial court sentenced Appellant to 25 years  to 50 years in prison for each charge to which Appellant  pled guilty. The trial court directed that the sentence for  each count of indecent assault at lower court docket  number 49-2022 would run consecutively to the  sentence for the sole count of involuntary deviate sexual  intercourse at lower court docket number 49-2022. The  sentences for the remaining convictions at both docket  numbers were imposed concurrently. 11 Appellant filed separate notices of appeal at each  lower court docket number, and this Court sua sponte  consolidated the appeals. 2. Did the court err by allowing hearsay evidence to  establish a prior military conviction such that a  mandatory sentence became applicable? Appellant's Brief at 6 (suggested answers omitted). Initially, we address Appellant's second issue. Appellant  contends the trial court unlawfully sentenced him at each count to a  mandatory minimum of 25 years of incarceration under 42 Pa.C.S.A.  9718.2(a)(1), where the Page 7 of 12 Commonwealth failed to prove Appellant had a prior  qualifying conviction.

Section 9718.2 provides, in relevant part: Any person who is convicted…of an offense set forth in  section 9799.14 (relating to sexual offenses and tier  system) shall, if at the time of the commission of the  current offense the person had previously been  convicted of an offense set forth in section 9799.14…or  an equivalent crime in another jurisdiction, be  sentenced to a minimum sentence of at least 25 years  of total confinement[.] 42 Pa.C.S.A. 9718.2(a)(1) (bold added). The Statute further provides the following: (c) Proof of sentencing.--The provisions of this section  shall notbe an element of the crime, and notice thereof  to the defendant shall not be required prior to conviction,  but reasonable notice of the Commonwealth's intention  to proceed under this section shall be provided after  conviction and before sentencing. The applicability of  this section shall be determined at sentencing. The  sentencing court, prior to imposing sentence on an  offender under subsection (a), shall have a complete  record of the previous convictions of the offender,  copies of which shall be furnished to the offender. If the offender or the attorney for the  Commonwealth [*18]  contests the accuracy of the  record, the court shall schedule a hearing and direct the  offender and the attorney for the Commonwealth to  submit evidence regarding the previous convictions of  the offender. The court shall then determine, by a  preponderance  of  the  evidence,  the  previous  convictions of the offender and, if this section is  applicable, shall impose sentence in accordance with  this section. Should a previous conviction be vacated  and an acquittal or final discharge entered subsequent  to imposition of sentence under this section, the  offender shall have the right to petition the sentencing  court for reconsideration of sentence if this section  would not have been applicable except for the  conviction which was vacated. 42 Pa.C.S.A. 9718.2(c) (bold in original). Here, Appellant does not dispute that, if established, a  prior military conviction for the offense of indecent acts or liberties  with a child, as set forth in the United States Courts-Martial 2000 Manual, is a  qualifying trigger for the application of the mandatory minimum sentence under  Section 9718(a)(1). See Commonwealth v. Smith, 528 Pa. 380, 598 A.2d  268 (1991) (holding military court-martial convictions may qualify as a prior  conviction for purposes of applying mandatory minimum sentencing  provisions).12 [*19]  12 As the trial court explained, under military law, the  elements of the offense of indecent acts or liberties with  a child are: (1) physical contact-the accused  committed a certain act upon or with the body of a  certain person; the person was under 16 years of age  and not the spouse of the accused; the act of the  accused was indecent; the accused committed the act  with intent to arouse, appeal to, or gratify the lust,  passions, or sexual desires of the accused, the victim or  both; and under the circumstances, the conduct of the  accused was to the prejudice of good order and  discipline in the armed forces or was a nature to bring  discredit upon the armed forces. (2) No physical  contact-the accused committed a certain act; the act  amounted to the taking of indecent liberties with a  certain person; the accused committed the act within (Footnote Continued Next Page) However, Appellant contends the Commonwealth did  not present sufficient evidence for the trial court to conclude, by a  preponderance of the evidence, that he had a prior military conviction, so as to  trigger the applicability of Section 9718.2(a)(1). In this vein,  Appellant argues the Page 8 of 12 Commonwealth improperly relied solely upon ""a military  document,"" [*20]  which the presence of this person; this person was under the  age of 16 years old and not the spouse of the accused;  the accused committed the act with intent to arouse,  appeal to, or gratify the lust, passions, or sexual desires  of the accused, the victim or both; and under the  circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the  prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed  forces or was a nature to bring discredit upon the armed  forces. See Trial Court Opinion, filed 2/27/23, at 11  (citing Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, Part IV,  pp. IV-110-11 (2000 ed.)). The military law defines  ""indecent"" as ""that form of immorality relating to sexual impurity, which  is not only grossly vulgar, obscene, and repugnant to  common propriety, but tends to excite lust and deprave  the morals with respect to sexual relations."" Id. at IV- 110-112 ¶¶ 88(3), 90(c). The trial court concluded the military conviction for  indecent acts or liberties with a child-physical contact, to  which Appellant pled guilty, is equivalent to indecent  assault under 18 Pa.C.S.A. 3126, which provides a  person is guilty of indecent assault ""if the person has  indecent contact with the complainant…and the person  does so without the complainant's [*21]  consent; the  person does so by forcible compulsion; the complainant  is less than 13 years of age; or the complainant is less  than 16 years of age and the person is four or more  years older…and…not married to each other."" 18  Pa.C.S.A.  3126. Further, the trial court concluded the military  conviction for indecent acts or liberties with a child-no  physical contact, to which Appellant pled guilty, is  equivalent to Pennsylvania's crime of corruption of  minors under 18 Pa.C.S.A. 6301(a)(ii), which provides a defendant being  18 years or more, ""by any course of conduct in violation of Chapter 31  (relating to sexual offenses) corrupts or tends to corrupt  the moral of any minor…or who aids, abets, entices or  encourages any such minor in the commission of an  offense under Chapter 31 commits a felony of the third  degree."" 18 Pa.C.S.A.  6301(a)(ii). Appellant raises no claim of error regarding  the trial court's analysis in this regard. . was hearsay, to prove the existence of his prior military  conviction. Appellant avers the trial court should have  required the Commonwealth to introduce a qualified  United States Army official to testify to the contents of  the document. Initially, we note ""a preponderance of the evidence is  the lowest burden of proof in the [*22]  administration of  justice, and it is defined as the greater weight of the  evidence, i.e., to tip a scale slightly in one's favor.""  Commonwealthv. A.R., 990 A.2d 1, n. 4 (Pa.Super.  2010) (quotation marks, quotation, and brackets  omitted). Stated differently, preponderance of the  evidence is tantamount to a ""more likely than not""  standard. Commonwealth v. Heater, 899 A.2d 1126,  1133 (Pa.Super. 2006). Moreover, we observe that the admission of evidence  presented at a sentencing hearing is vested within the  sound discretion of the trial court applying the rules of  evidence. Commonwealth v. Hairston, 624 Pa. 143, 84 A.3d 657, 674 (2014). As such, our standard of  review of a trial court's evidentiary rulings is abuse of  discretion. Commonwealth v. Walter, 625 Pa. 522, 93  A.3d 442, 449 (2014). Thus, we will not disturb an  evidentiary ruling unless ""the law is overridden or  misapplied, or the judgment exercised is manifestly  unreasonable, or the result of partiality, prejudice, bias,  or  ill-will,  as  shown  by  evidence  of  record.""  Commonwealth v. Cooper, 596 Pa. 119, 941 A.2d  655, 667 (2007) (citation omitted). This includes rulings  on the admission of hearsay. Id. Hearsay is a statement that the declarant does not  make while testifying at a trial or hearing that is offered into evidence to prove  the truth of the matter asserted in the statement. Pa.R.E. 801(c)(1)-(2).  Statements that meet this definition [*23]  are not admissible unless a  hearsay exception applies or is permitted by other rules prescribed by the  Pennsylvania Supreme Court or by statute. Pa.R.E. 802. ""The rule against admitting  hearsay evidence stems Page 9 of 12 from its presumed unreliability, because the declarant  cannot be challenged regarding  the  accuracy  of  the  statement.""  Commonwealth v. Chmiel, 585 Pa. 547, 889 A.2d 501, 532 (2005) (citation omitted). Still, for the purposes of sentencing a defendant, a trial  court may admit evidence as to any matter that it deems relevant and  admissible on the question of the sentence to be imposed, and the  evidence shall include matters relating to any of the aggravating or mitigating  circumstances. Commonwealth v. Young, 536 Pa. 57, 637 A.2d 1313,  1321-22 (1993). Notably, ""a proceeding held to determine [a] sentence is  not a trial, and the court is not bound by the restrictive rules of evidence  properly applicable to trials."" Commonwealth v. Medley, 725 A.2d 1225,  1229 (Pa.Super. 1999). Hearsay testimony is precisely the type of evidence  which is the right of a court in sentencing to consider  even though such information is obtained outside the  courtroom from persons whom the defendant has not  been  permitted  to  confront  or  cross-examine.  Significantly, the admission of hearsay in sentencing  proceedings, especially those which do [*24]  not  involve a capital crime, is a common occurrence. In fact,  sentencing courts as a matter of course, consider  hearsay in nearly every sentencing case since pre- sentence investigations are routinely ordered and  considered by the court and a pre-sentence report is the  very definition of hearsay, i.e., the report is a report by a probation officer  reciting other person's out-of-court statements offered  for their truth. Medley, 725 A.2d at 1230. Notably, the Victim's Bill of  Rights, the Sentencing Code, and the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal  Procedure all permit a trial court to consider a pre-sentence investigation report and  victim impact statement prior to imposing a sentence, which include statements  of hearsay. See 18 P.S. 11.201(5); 42 Pa.C.S.A. 9721(b) and 9731:  Pa.R.Crim.P. 702(A). However, the consideration of hearsay, even at a  sentencing hearing, is not unfettered. See Pa.R.E. 101 cmt. Instead, a  sentencing court may rely on hearsay evidence in the limited circumstance where  the hearsay originated from a dependable source under reliable circumstances.  Medley, 725 A.2d at 1225. For example, in Medley, the Commonwealth  established the defendant's prior record based on a  detective's testimony that he had contacted out of state  authorities to verify a prior conviction. Also, the  defendant admitted he had [*25]  a prior conviction.  Although the detective's testimony constituted hearsay, it had sufficient indicia of  reliability under the circumstances to be relied upon by the sentencing  court. Id. at 1230. In the case sub judice, the trial court relevantly  explained as follows: [Appellant] argues that the [trial] court erred in relying on  the records of his court-martial at the time of sentencing  [in the instant case] as those records were hearsay. The  Commonwealth argues that the records were certified  copies  of  the  [military  court-martial]  record  as  evidence[d] by the Motion for Protective Order. The  Commonwealth argues that even if the records  constituted hearsay, the [trial] court could rely on them  in determining if [Appellant] had a prior qualifying  offense as required by Section 9718.2(a) as courts  routinely rely on hearsay during sentencing. *** Here, the Commonwealth offered into evidence the  records related to [Appellant's] 2003 court-martial in  which he entered guilty pleas to one specification each  of indecent liberties with a female under the age of  16….and two specifications of an indecent act with a  Page 10 of 12 female under the age of 16. As evidenced by the May  24, 2022, Motion for Protective Order, these records  were [*26]  provided by the United States Army Crime  Records Center (""Crime Records Center""). [Appellant]  has not offered any evidence to suggest records from  the Crime Records Center were not obtained from a  dependable source under reliable circumstances such  that they should not be considered, whether hearsay or  not, at sentencing. Trial Court Opinion, filed 2/27/23, at 7-9. We find no abuse of discretion. As the trial court noted,  in response to the  trial  court  signing  a  protective  order,  the  Commonwealth received a certified copy of Appellant's military court-martial  records from the Crime Records Center. Trial courts routinely rely upon certified  court records, which contain hearsay, in determining whether a defendant  has a prior conviction because the hearsay originates from a dependable  source under reliable circumstances. Medley, 725 A.2d at 1225. See  Commonwealth v. Norris, 819 A.2d 568, 576 (Pa.Super. 2003) (indicating a trial  court considers a defendant's written court records in determining whether  the defendant has qualifying prior convictions for purposes of applying  mandatory minimum sentences). We agree with the trial court this reasoning  applies to official military court-martial records, as well. Further, we note Appellant admitted during the [*27]   January 12, 2022, bail hearing,  which  occurred  immediately  after  his  preliminary hearing, that he pled guilty before a military tribunal to sex offenses  involving a minor victim in the early 2000s. Accordingly,  the trial court did not err in finding, beyond a  preponderance of the evidence, that Appellant had a  prior military conviction, which triggered the applicability  of Section 9718.2(a)(1). Accordingly, we find no merit to Appellant's claim the  trial court unlawfully sentenced him to the 25-year  mandatory minimum under Section 9718.2(a)(1) since  the Commonwealth proved a prior qualifying offense  meeting the requirements of the statute. Next, we turn to Appellant's claim the trial court erred in  denying his pre-sentence motion to withdraw his guilty  pleas. Appellant contends that, when he pled guilty, he  was unaware that he would be subject to the mandatory  minimum sentences under Section 9718.2(a)(1). Thus,  he contends he set forth a ""fair and just reason"" for  withdrawing his guilty pleas prior to sentencing. We review the trial court's denial of Appellant's pre- sentence motion to withdraw his guilty pleas for an  abuse of discretion. Commonwealth v. Baez, 169 A.3d  35, 39 (Pa.Super. 2017); Commonwealth v. Islas, 156  A.3d 1185, 1187 (Pa.Super. 2017). ""An abuse of  discretion is not a mere error in judgment but,  rather, [*28]  involves bias, ill will, partiality, prejudice,  manifest unreasonableness and/or misapplication of  law. By contrast, a proper exercise of discretion  conforms to the law is based on the facts of record."" Commonwealth  v.  Gordy,  73  A.3d  620,  624  (Pa.Super. 2013) (citation omitted). We presume ""a defendant who entered a guilty plea  was aware of what he was doing, and the defendant bears the burden of  proving otherwise."" Commonwealth v. Hart, 174 A.3d 660, 665 (Pa.Super.  2017) (citation omitted). This Court has recently held: Where a defendant requests to withdraw his guilty plea  before he is sentenced, the trial court has discretion to  grant the withdrawal and that discretion is to be liberally  exercised to permit withdrawal of the plea if two  conditions are present: 1) the defendant demonstrates a  fair and just reason for withdrawing the plea and 2) it is  not shown that withdrawal of the plea would cause  substantial  prejudice  to  the  Commonwealth.  Commonwealth v.Carrasquillo, 631 Pa. 692, 115 A.3d  1284, 1291-92 (2015); Baez, 169 A.3d at 39;Islas, 156  Page 11 of 12 A.3d at 1188; see also Pa.R.Crim.P. 591(A) (""At any  time before the imposition of sentence, the court may, in  its  discretion,  permit,  upon  motion  of  the  defendant,…the withdrawal of a plea of guilty or  nolocontendere and the substitution of a plea of not  guilty"")[.] Commonwealth v. Jamison, 284 A.3d 501, 505  (Pa.Super. 2022) (emphasis added). In the [*29]  case sub judice, assuming, arguendo,  Appellant presented a ""fair and just reason"" for withdrawing his plea based on his  alleged unawareness the Commonwealth would be seeking the mandatory  minimum sentence under Section 9718.2(a)(1),13 we find the trial court did  not abuse its 13 To the extent the Commonwealth suggests, and the  trial court concludes, that, as applied to the instant case,  Section 9718(c) requires notice of mandatory minimums  after conviction and before sentencing, we note the (Footnote Continued Next Page) discretion in denying Appellant's pre-sentence motion  since it was ""shown that withdrawal of the plea would cause substantial prejudice  to the Commonwealth."" Jamison, 284 A.3d at 505 (citations  omitted). In the context of a pre-sentence request for plea  withdrawal, the term ""prejudice"" means that, due to  events occurring after the entry of the plea, the  Commonwealth's prosecution of its case is in a worse  position than it would have been had the trial taken  place as originally scheduled. Thus, prejudice is about  the Commonwealth's ability to try its case, not about the  personal inconvenience to complainants unless that  inconvenience somehow impairs the Commonwealth's  prosecution. Gordy, 73 A.3d at 624 (citations omitted). Here, in explaining [*30]  the reasons it would be  substantially prejudiced if Appellant was permitted to withdraw his guilty pleas, the  Commonwealth averred as follows during the pre-sentence motion  hearing: [Appellant] has to prove that the Commonwealth would  not be prejudiced by withdrawal of [his pleas in] this  case. The Commonwealth maintains the opposite. We  would, in fact, be prejudiced if the court were to allow  withdrawal here. The co-defendant, Michael Shaulis,  [who is Appellant's] son and the uncle of the victim here,  had indicated his willingness to cooperate against  [Appellant] to testify against him. [Michael Shaulis] pled  guilty, and we were waiting his sentencing pending  [Appellant's] decision to plead guilty. [Michael Shaulis] was sentenced on June 6, 2022[.]  [This was] [a]fter [Appellant] had entered a plea and with  the appellate courts have construed the statute differently  for defendants who enter guilty pleas. For a defendant  who pleads guilty, notice that the Commonwealth  intends to seek application of a mandatory minimum  sentence is required prior to the defendant's entry of a  guilty plea. SeeCommonwealth v. Broaden, 980 A.2d  124 (Pa.Super. 2009). understanding that [Michael Shaulis's] cooperation  would not be necessary against [*31]  [Appellant]  because he had entered a plea. [The appellate courts] have indicated that the [trial] court  properly denied [a] defendant's motion to withdraw a  plea where a cooperating co-defendant had been pled  and sentenced prior to the [motion to] withdraw and  would therefore lack motivation to cooperate against the  defendant  at  issue.  For  that  reason,  [the  Commonwealth] believes that [the Commonwealth]  would also be severely prejudiced should the [trial] court  grant [Appellant's] motion to withdraw [in the instant  case]. N.T., 8/22/22, at 7-8. The  trial  court  found  the  Commonwealth's  representation to be credible, and, in denying Appellant's pre-sentence motion,  specifically found ""the Page 12 of 12 Commonwealth would be significantly prejudiced since  they had already completed their agreement with the co-defendant."" Id. at  9-10. Further, the trial court noted the emotional trauma the child victim  would likely suffer given that she was told she would not have to testify at trial  against her grandfather. Id. at 10. Upon review, we find no abuse of discretion. This Court  has held that substantial prejudice exists if a defendant makes a  withdrawal request only after the Commonwealth enters into agreements  with [*32]  the defendant's co- defendants. Commonwealth v. Davis, 191 A.3d 883  (Pa.Super. 2018). In such cases, the co-defendant's ""lack of motivation to  cooperate with the prosecution  would  severely  prejudice  the  Commonwealth if it sought to try [the] appellant."" Id. at 891 (citing Commonwealth v.  Ross, 498 Pa. 512, 447 A.2d 943 (1982) (finding that the ""request to  withdraw the plea, which had been made after the dismissal of numerous key  Commonwealth witnesses in reliance on the plea, was properly denied"")). Moreover, this Court has noted that, although a child  victim may still ""be available in a technical sense,"" the emotional  trauma and diminished memory of a child victim are also appropriate  considerations in determining whether the Commonwealth has been substantially  prejudiced by a defendant seeking to withdraw his guilty pleas. Commonwealth v.  Carr, 543 A.2d 1232, 1234 (Pa.Super. 1988). Accordingly, we conclude  the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the prosecution would  be substantially prejudiced if Appellant were allowed to withdraw his  guilty pleas. Consequently, the trial court properly denied Appellant's  pre-sentence motion to withdraw his guilty pleas.14 For all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm. 14We note that: [A] request to withdraw a guilty [*33]  plea after  sentencing is subject to higher scrutiny [than a pre- sentence request] since courts strive to discourage [the]  entry of guilty pleas as sentence-testing devices.  Therefore, in order to withdraw a guilty plea after the  imposition of sentence, a defendant must make a  showing of prejudice which resulted in a manifest  injustice. A defendant meets this burden only if he can  demonstrate  that  his  guilty  plea  was  entered  involuntarily, unknowingly, or unintelligently. Commonwealth v. Culsoir, 209 A.3d 433, 437  (Pa.Super. 2019) (citations and quotation marks  omitted). Here, given that we have found no relief is due  regarding the denial of Appellant's pre-sentence motion  to withdraw his guilty pleas, we also find that, to the  extent Appellant contends the trial court erred in  denying his post-sentence motion to withdraw on the  same grounds, he is not entitled to relief.

"D.B. v. IE Hotel Grp., LLC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945","OPINION AND ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS G6 HOSPITALITY, LLC,  G6 HOSPITALITY FRANCHISING, LLC, AND G6 HOSPITALITY REAL ESTATE, LLC'S MOTION TO DISMISS IMMERGUT, District Judge. Plaintiff D.B. (""Plaintiff"") filed suit against Studio 6-Portland, IE Hotel Group, LLC (d.b.a. Studio 6-Portland), G6  Hospitality, LLC, G6 Hospitality Franchising, LLC, G6 Hospitality Real Estate, LLC, Shilash Patel, Vipul Patel, and  John Does 1-5 (collectively ""Defendants"") in Multnomah County [*2]  Circuit Court on December 31, 2021 alleging  claims arising out of her being sex trafficked at a Portland motel. ECF 1-1 at 4. On March 16, 2022, Plaintiff filed a  First Amended Complaint. ECF 1-1 at 24. Plaintiff brings claims of direct negligence and direct liability under  Oregon Revised Statute (""O.R.S"") § 30.867 against all Defendants. Id. at ¶¶ 54-66. Plaintiff also brings both a  negligence claim and a claim pursuant to O.R.S. § 30.867 under a theory of vicarious liability against IE Hotel  Page 2 of 14 Group, LLC (""IE""), G6 Hospitality, LLC, G6 Hospitality Franchising, LLC, and G6 Hospitality Real Estate, LLC. Id.  at ¶¶ 67-71. On March 16, 2022, Defendants G6 Hospitality, LLC, G6 Hospitality Franchising, LLC, and G6  Hospitality Real Estate, LLC (collectively ""G6 Defendants"") removed the case to federal court. ECF 1. Before this Court is G6 Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. ECF 19. For the following reasons, this Court DENIES G6  Defendants' motion as to Plaintiff's direct and vicarious negligence claims, DENIES G6 Defendants' motion as to  Plaintiff's vicarious claim under O.R.S. § 30.867, and GRANTS G6 Defendants' motion as to Plaintiff's direct claim  under O.R.S. § 30.867 with leave to amend. STANDARDS A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim may be granted only when [*3]  there is no cognizable legal theory to  support the claim or when the complaint lacks sufficient factual allegations to state a facially plausible claim for  relief. Shroyer v. New Cingular Wireless Servs., Inc., 622 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir. 2010). In evaluating the  sufficiency of a complaint's factual allegations, the court must accept as true all well-pleaded material facts alleged  in the complaint and construe them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Daniels-Hall v. Nat'l  Educ. Ass'n, 629 F.3d 992, 998 (9th Cir. 2010). To be entitled to a presumption of truth, allegations in a complaint  ""may not simply recite the elements of a cause of action, but must contain sufficient allegations of underlying facts  to give fair notice and to enable the opposing party to defend itself effectively."" Starr v. Baca, 652 F.3d 1202, 1216  (9th Cir. 2011). The court must draw all reasonable inferences from the factual allegations in favor of the plaintiff.  Newcal Indus., Inc. v. Ikon Office Sol., 513 F.3d 1038, 1043 n.2 (9th Cir. 2008). The court need not, however, credit  the plaintiff's legal conclusions that are couched as factual allegations. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678-79, 129  S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). A complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations to ""plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief, such that it is  not unfair to require the opposing party to be subjected to the expense of discovery and continued litigation."" Starr,  652 F.3d at 1216. ""A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that [*4]  allows the court  to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678  (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). ""The plausibility  standard is not akin to a probability requirement, but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has  acted unlawfully."" Mashiri v. Epsten Grinnell & Howell, 845 F.3d 984, 988 (9th Cir. 2017) (quotation marks omitted)  (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). Federal courts sitting in diversity apply substantive state law. Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 80, 58 S. Ct.  817, 82 L. Ed. 1188 (1938); see ECF 1 at 2 (removing this action based on diversity jurisdiction). When applying  state law, a federal court is bound by the decisions of the state's highest court. Ticknor v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc.,  265 F.3d 931, 939 (9th Cir. 2001). If the state's highest court has not yet squarely addressed a question, the federal  court must predict how the state court would resolve it. Gonzales v. CarMax Auto Superstores, LLC, 840 F.3d 644,  649 (9th Cir. 2016) (citing Med. Lab. Mgmt. Consultants v. Am. Broad. Companies, Inc., 306 F.3d 806, 812 (9th Cir.  2002)). ""Where the state's highest court has not decided an issue, '[federal courts] look[] for guidance [in] decisions  by intermediate appellate courts of the state and by courts in other jurisdictions.'"" Bozzio v. EMI Grp. Ltd., 811 F.3d  1144, 1151 (9th Cir. 2016) (citation omitted). The following facts are taken from the Complaint, and are accepted as  true, for purposes of this motion. BACKGROUND      2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *2 Page 3 of 14 In February of 2019, Plaintiff was trafficked for approximately one week at a Studio 6 motel property in Portland,  Oregon. ECF 1-1 at ¶¶ 1-3, 52. Plaintiff exhibited [*5]  many indicators of vulnerability for recruitment into sex  trafficking: she was on disability and was financially vulnerable, did not have stable housing, was raised in foster  care, lacked family and social support, suffered from mental health diagnoses, and was a recovering addict. Id. at ¶  49. Originally, Plaintiff agreed to meet the ""recruiter,"" believing the meeting to be a date. Id. at ¶ 45. Instead, the  recruiter brought her to Studio 6, where the two partied with two people who ultimately became Plaintiff's traffickers.  Id. Soon, the recruiter left, and the male trafficker told Plaintiff that she was not free to leave and had to engage in  sex for money. Id. at ¶ 46. The traffickers also informed Plaintiff that she had to follow their rules and threatened  violent consequences if she did not. Id. In the Studio 6 room, the female trafficker took photos of Plaintiff and  uploaded them in an online advertisement for commercial sex. Id. at ¶ 47. The trafficker also told Plaintiff that she  would be required to ""walk the track"" on NE 82nd Avenue to solicit customers when there were no online  customers. Id. Over the course of nearly a week, Plaintiff was trafficked through fraud, coercion, [*6]  and threats of force and  engaged in multiple commercial sexual transactions per day against her will. Id. at ¶¶ 2-4, 52. Plaintiff was not  allowed to leave the room without her traffickers, unless it was to smoke a cigarette within view of the room. Id. at ¶  50. If Plaintiff failed to earn enough money, the traffickers deprived Plaintiff of food. Id. at ¶ 51. At the time of  Plaintiff's trafficking, Defendant John Doe 1 worked the front desk of Studio 6. Id. at ¶ 37. Defendant John Doe 1  paid for sex with the female trafficker. Id. Defendant John Doe 1 also spoke with Plaintiff and implied that she  should engage in a three-way sexual relationship with him and his girlfriend. Id. at ¶ 39. Defendant John Doe 1 did  not report suspected human trafficking to his General Manager. Id. At the first possible moment when Plaintiff was  not being watched closely by her traffickers, Plaintiff called the police and fled. Id. at ¶ 52. The motel property where Plaintiff was trafficked, Studio 6-Portland (""Studio 6""), is located on NE 82nd Avenue in  Portland, Oregon. Id. at ¶ 1. Defendant IE Hotel Group, LLC, a California corporation doing business as Studio 6- Portland, owns and operates Studio 6 as [*7]  a franchisee of one or more G6 Defendants. Id. at ¶ 12. G6  Defendants are Delaware companies in the motel business that build, operate, and manage motels—including  Studio 6—through franchises. Id. at ¶¶ 13-15. Under the franchise agreement, G6 Defendants require Defendant IE  to follow corporate policies regarding the following: bookings, reservations, room rates, websites, rewards  programs, revenue management tools, profit sharing terms, hiring procedures, employment policies, training,  decisions, and wages, building and design standards, rules of operation, facilities and operations inspections,  security policies and procedures, and human trafficking practices and programs. Id. at ¶ 70. G6 Defendants also  receive a share of each room rental payment at Studio 6. Id. at ¶ 44. There are reported incidents dating back to 2003 of a male trafficker using a G6 Hospitality property for sex  trafficking involving extreme violence, rape, drug use, and minor victims. Id. at ¶ 25. G6 Hospitality properties have  been connected to sex trafficking reports predating Plaintiff's trafficking in at least twenty-six different states. Id. at ¶  26. Sex trafficking crimes have been reported at G6 Hospitality [*8]  properties in Portland, including an arrest in  2012 of a male trafficker ultimately resulting in a conviction. Id. at ¶ 27, n.2. That incident involved two victims,  including a sixteen-year-old who was advertised online for sex, made to ""walk the track"" on 82nd Avenue, forced to  abide by strict rules, and deprived of food if she did not earn enough money. Id. at ¶ 27. In a separate incident, a  male and female pair of traffickers were convicted of multiple felonies for trafficking a seventeen-year-old girl at a  different G6 Hospitality property in Portland in 2017. Id. at ¶ 28. The Studio 6 property where Plaintiff was trafficked is located on 82nd Avenue, an area placed into a ""prostitution  free zone"" to support efforts to eliminate sex trafficking and prostitution. Id. at ¶ 29. Over the five years before  Plaintiff brought this suit, multiple online reviews of Studio 6 mention or allude to sex trafficking. Id. at ¶ 30. In a Trip  Advisor review of the property in May of 2016, a reviewer wrote: ""I have stayed in hundreds of motels. So I feel  confident in saying this place should be shut down! It's awful! Hookers, in the parking garage, working! Drug  dealers, pimps and gang members!""  [*9] Id. at ¶ 31. That same month, another Trip Advisor reviewer wrote: ""The  people staying long term here are scary, look like drug dealers and prostitutes."" Id. Less than nine months before  Plaintiff's trafficking, a Yelp reviewer wrote: ""Great place if you are able are willing to deal... with the sex trafficking  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *4 Page 4 of 14 network that chooses to stay here there are safes places in [t]he same neighborhood Along the same street."" Id. at  ¶ 32. In 2018, the year before Plaintiff was trafficked, G6 Hospitality announced it was increasing its commitment to  preventing sex trafficking: Our commitment to anti-trafficking efforts is made clear through our comprehensive awareness, training and  response program. In 2018, G6 overhauled its training materials and program to ensure it was relevant for  Motel 6 and Studio 6 team members and contained updated information on our anti trafficking efforts, including  how to spot the signs of and help prevent human trafficking. Motel 6 and Studio 6 trains all staff — from the  General Manager through the most junior housekeepers — to be the ""eyes and ears"" and to alert the property's  General Manager, local police, and the Motel 6/Studio 6 Hotline upon observing any signs [*10]  of suspected  human trafficking or prostitution. Id. at ¶ 35. G6 Hospitality acknowledged in its anti-trafficking policy statement that its efforts to prevent trafficking  require comprehensive awareness and training, including overhauled training materials on how to spot the signs of  trafficking. Id. at ¶ 43. Widely-known indicators and red flags of trafficking include: customers paying with cash  daily, with no credit card registered at sign-in, frequent male visitors to a room for short periods of time, male  visitors arriving at unusual times, guests showing signs of fear, anxiety, tension, submission, and/or nervousness,  guests showing signs of physical abuse, restraint, and/or confinement, guests showing signs of malnourishment,  guests lacking freedom of movement or being constantly monitored, and guests having no money, no luggage, and  few or no personal items. Id. DISCUSSION A. Anonymity Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(a) This Court first addresses Plaintiff's ""Motion to Designate Known Party Using Pseudonym."" ECF 1-1 at 2-3. Due to  Plaintiff's status as a victim of sex trafficking and the ""sensitive nature"" of sexual abuse cases, Plaintiff seeks leave  of this Court to proceed under the pseudonym ""D.B.."" Id. [*11]  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(a), a  complaint must ""name all the parties."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(a). ""In this circuit, we allow parties to use pseudonyms in  the 'unusual case' when nondisclosure of the party's identity is necessary . . . to protect a person from harassment,  injury, ridicule or personal embarrassment."" Does I thru XXIII v. Advanced Textile Corp., 214 F.3d 1058, 1067-68  (9th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). ""[A] party may preserve his or her anonymity in  judicial proceedings in special circumstances when the party's need for anonymity outweighs prejudice to the  opposing party and the public's interest in knowing the party's identity."" Id. at 1068. The Ninth Circuit does not  require a plaintiff to obtain leave to proceed anonymously before filing an anonymous pleading. A.B. v. Hilton  Worldwide Holdings Inc., 484 F. Supp. 3d 921, 945 (D. Or. 2020) (citation omitted). Because this Court finds the  need for anonymity outweighs any prejudice to the Defendants and the public, this Court grants leave for Plaintiff to  proceed under the pseudonym ""D.B."" in this case. B. Negligence Claim Plaintiff brings a negligence claim against all Defendants, alleging that Defendants breached their duty to protect  Plaintiff from harm by ""failing to properly train and supervise their agents and employees, failing to hire proper  personnel, failing to provide for safety and security, and failing to intervene in illegal or unsafe conduct at Studio 6.""  Id. at ¶¶ 55-56. Plaintiff claims that G6 Defendants owed a heightened duty of care as the possessors of a business  premises. Id. at ¶ 55. Plaintiff brings her negligence claim against G6 Defendants directly as well as vicariously for  the actions of franchisee Defendant IE and its employees. For the reasons stated below, this Court DENIES G6  Defendants' Motion to Dismiss both Plaintiff's direct liability negligence claim and Plaintiff's vicarious liability  negligence claim. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *9 Page 5 of 14 1. Negligence - Direct Liability G6 Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff's direct liability negligence claim on the ground that [*12]  Plaintiff did not  sufficiently allege Defendants had a legal duty to prevent Plaintiff's trafficking. ECF 19 at 25. Typically, the elements  of common-law negligence require a plaintiff to plead and prove that (1) the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff,  (2) the defendant breached that duty, and (3) the breach was the cause-in-fact of a legally cognizable damage to  the plaintiff. Chapman v. Mayfield, 358 Ore. 196, 205, 361 P.3d 566 (2015). However, under Oregon's  contemporary jurisprudence, ""the traditional duty-breach analysis is subsumed in the concept of general  foreseeability, 'unless the parties invoke a status, a relationship, or a particular standard of conduct that creates,  defines, or limits the defendant's duty.'"" Id. (quoting Fazzolari v. Portland School Dist. No. 1J, 303 Ore. 1, 17, 734  P.2d 1326 (1987)). See generally Oregon Steel Mills, Inc. v. Coopers & Lybrand, LLP, 336 Ore. 329, 340, 83 P.3d  322 (2004) (discussing shift in Oregon jurisprudence). Where there is no special status, relationship, or standard,  ""the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant's conduct created a foreseeable and unreasonable risk of  legally cognizable harm to the plaintiff and that the conduct in fact caused that kind of harm to the plaintiff.""  Chapman, 358 Ore. at 205. a. Special Relationship Plaintiff alleges that G6 Defendants had a ""duty to protect [her] from harm"" under a ""heightened duty of care as the  possessors of a business [*13]  premises."" ECF 1-1 at ¶ 55. G6 Defendants argue that Plaintiff does not allege a  special relationship with G6. ECF 19 at 26. Under Oregon law, ""[b]usiness owners and operators have a heightened  duty of care toward patrons—invitees—with respect to the condition of their premises that exceeds the general duty  of care to avoid unreasonable risks of harm to others."" Bagley v. Mt. Bachelor, Inc., 356 Ore. 543, 563, 340 P.3d 27  (2014) (citations omitted). ""In general, it is the duty of the possessor of land to make the premises reasonably safe  for the invitee's visit."" Id. (quoting Woolston v. Wells, 297 Ore. 548, 557, 687 P.2d 144 (1984)). ""[A] business  operator's obligation to make its premises reasonably safe for its invitees includes taking into account the use to  which the premises are put."" Id. at 564 (citations omitted). ""[A] business, as a possessor of premises, has a duty to  take reasonable steps to protect its visitors from reasonably foreseeable criminal acts by third persons."" Stewart v.  Kids Inc. of Dallas, 245 Ore. App. 267, 278, 261 P.3d 1272 (2011). Plaintiff has not sufficiently pled a special relationship between Plaintiff and G6 Defendants implicating a heightened  duty of care. Plaintiff argues that ""G6 Defendants owed her a heightened duty of care as owners and franchisors of  the hotel property."" ECF 29 at 11-12. However, Plaintiff alleges in her complaint that Defendant IE, [*14]  rather  than G6 Defendants, owns the hotel property. ECF 1-1 at ¶ 12. While Plaintiff alleges that G6 Defendants built,  operated, and managed Studio 6 through a franchise, see id. at ¶¶ 12-15, Plaintiff has failed to cite any authority for  the proposition that a franchisor owes a heightened duty of care to its franchisee's customer under Oregon law.  Furthermore, ""Oregon has adopted the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965), which defines a ""possessor of land""  as ""'a person who is in occupation of the land with intent to control it.'"" Cain v. Bovis Lend Lease, Inc., 817 F. Supp.  2d 1251, 1273 (D. Or. 2011) (quoting Fireman's Fund Am. Ins. Cos. v. United States, 482 F. Supp. 893, 896 (D. Or.  1979);  (1965)). Plaintiff has failed to allege facts showing that G6 Defendants were in occupation of the motel  property. Therefore, as G6 Defendants do not qualify as possessors under Oregon law, they did not owe Plaintiff a  heightened duty of care based on a special relationship. See Bagley, 356 Ore. at 563. b. General Foreseeability Defendants also move to dismiss Plaintiff's direct liability negligence claim by asserting that Plaintiff did not  adequately allege that G6 Defendants unreasonably created a foreseeable risk of her being sex trafficked at Studio  6. ECF 19 at 26. For a negligence claim where there is no special status, relationship, or standard, ""the plaintiff  must plead and prove that the [*15]  defendant's conduct created a foreseeable and unreasonable risk of legally  cognizable harm to the plaintiff and that the conduct in fact caused that kind of harm to the plaintiff."" Chapman, 358  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *11 Page 6 of 14 Ore. at 205. Foreseeability, which serves ""as a limit on the scope of liability,"" considers ""what prospectively might  happen"" and is separate from causation. Fazzolari, 303 Ore. at 13. ""It is not necessary that the risk of harm be  more probable than not; rather, the question is whether a reasonable person considering the potential harms that  might result from his or her conduct would have reasonably expected the injury to occur."" Chapman, 358 Ore. at  206 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Stewart v. Jefferson Plywood Co., 255 Ore. 603, 609,  469 P.2d 783 (1970) (en banc) (""[T]he community deems a person to be at fault only when the injury caused by him  is one which could have been anticipated because there was a reasonable likelihood that it could happen.""). G6 Defendants first argue that Plaintiff provided ""shotgun"" negligence allegations not plausibly alleged as to G6  Hospitality. ECF 19 at 27. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a pleading that states a claim for  relief must contain a ""short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed. R.  Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The pleading standard under Rule 8 ""does not require 'detailed factual [*16]  allegations . . . . '""  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). However, the pleading must contain more than ""labels  and conclusions"" or ""'naked assertion[s]' devoid of further factual enhancement."" Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at  557). Pleadings that seek to overwhelm defendants with an unclear mass of allegations and make it difficult or  impossible for the defendants to make informed responses to the plaintiff's allegations are considered ""shotgun""  pleadings. A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide, 484 F. Supp. at 943 (citing Autobidmaster, LLC v. Alpine Auto Gallery, LLC,  No. 3:14-cv-1083-AC, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65048, 2015 WL 2381611, at *15 (D. Or. May 19, 2015)). Another  type of ""shotgun"" pleading is a complaint that asserts claims against ""multiple defendants without specifying which  of the defendants are responsible for which acts or omissions."" Id. (quoting Nissen v. Lindquist, No. C16-5093 BHS,  2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 480, 2017 WL 26843, at *2 (W.D. Wash. Jan. 3, 2017)). While it is true that Plaintiff's allegations are stated generally against all Defendants, Plaintiff also clearly alleges  facts that specifically relate to G6 Defendants regarding this claim. For example, Plaintiff alleges Defendants  generally were negligent in ""failing to develop and implement adequate policies to identify and prevent sex  trafficking,"" ""failing to hire proper personnel,"" ""failing to properly train and supervise their agents and employees,""  and ""failing to implement regular periodic training for all staff on indicators of sex trafficking."" ECF 1-1 [*17]  at ¶ 56.  Plaintiff additionally alleges that G6 Defendants specifically maintained control over hiring procedures, employment  policies and decisions, rules of operation, standardized employee training, security policies and procedures, and  practices and programs to prevent human trafficking. Id. at ¶ 70. Therefore, construed as a whole, Plaintiff's  complaint provides sufficient allegations regarding her negligence claim clearly directed towards G6 Defendants. G6 Defendants also claim that Plaintiff's allegations of foreseeability are insufficient because they are premised on  ""generalized knowledge of the potential for crime."" ECF 19 at 27. Instead, Defendants contend that Oregon  precedent requires knowledge of an unreasonable risk of danger to the particular plaintiff involved. Id. In Piazza v.  Kellim, the Oregon Supreme Court clarified the foreseeability analysis required under Oregon law. 360 Ore. 58, 69- 82, 377 P.3d 492 (2016). When evaluating negligence claims arising from third-party criminal acts, ""there is a  common requirement: a trier of fact must be able to find from concrete facts that a reasonable person in the position  of the defendant reasonably would have foreseen that the person or location and circumstances [*18]  posed a risk  of criminal harm to persons such as the plaintiff."" Id. at 81 (citing Towe v. Sacagawea, Inc., 357 Ore. 74, 86, 347  P.3d 766 (2015); Oregon Steel Mills, Inc. v. Coopers & Lybrand, LLP, 336 Ore. 329, 340, 83 P.3d 322 (2004);  Fazzolari, 303 Ore. at 17). In making a foreseeability determination, a court should consider the following facts: (1)  the similarity, frequency, and recency of prior criminal acts, (2) whether prior criminal acts were committed under  the same or similar circumstances, (3) whether prior criminal acts were committed at or near the same location, (4)  whether prior criminal acts involve the same or similar types of victims, and (5) the place and character of the  location of the current criminal act. Id. at 81 (citing Chapman, 358 Ore. at 220-22; Buchler, 316 Ore. at 511-12). Relying on Buchler, Chapman, and Stewart, G6 Defendants argue that to plausibly allege foreseeability, Plaintiff  must allege G6 Defendants were aware of the risk of danger to Plaintiff specifically. See Buchler v. State By &  Through Oregon Corr. Div., 316 Ore. 499, 853 P.2d 798 (1993); Chapman v. Mayfield, 358 Ore. 196, 361 P.3d 566  (2015); Stewart v. Kids Inc. of Dallas, OR, 245 Ore. App. 267, 261 P.3d 1272 (2011). However, Defendants  interpret this precedent in error. Under the above analysis in Piazza—a case that postdates the cases relied upon  by Defendants—a plaintiff need not allege that defendants were aware of the risk of danger to plaintiff specifically.  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *15 Page 7 of 14 Rather, a plaintiff need only allege that defendants were aware of the risk of danger to persons such as the plaintiff.  Plaintiff has sufficiently pled facts suggesting that her [*19]  trafficking was foreseeable to G6 Defendants under the  Piazza analysis. First, Plaintiff cites multiple online reviews and criminal reports to plausibly suggest that G6 Defendants were aware  of sex trafficking—the very same criminal act at issue here—on their properties generally and at Studio 6  specifically. ECF 1-1 at ¶¶ 24-33. Plaintiff alleges that G6 Hospitality properties have been connected to sex  trafficking reports predating Plaintiff's trafficking in at least twenty-six different states, a statistic suggesting the  frequency of these criminal acts. Id. at ¶ 26. Less than nine months before Plaintiff's trafficking, a Yelp reviewer  evaluated Studio 6 by observing: ""[g]reat place if you are able are willing to deal... with the sex trafficking network  that chooses to stay here there are safes places in [t]he same neighborhood Along the same street."" Id. at ¶ 32. In  addition, in 2018, the year before Plaintiff was trafficked, G6 Hospitality announced an increased commitment to  preventing sex trafficking, including overhauled training materials on how to spot the signs of trafficking. Id. at ¶ 43.  Taken together, these two allegations indicate the recency of criminal acts of sex [*20]  trafficking both at Studio 6  and G6 Hospitality properties more generally. In accordance with the requirements of Piazza, Plaintiff points to reports of sex trafficking that resemble her  trafficking both in terms of the circumstances and the location of the criminal acts. For example, citing an arrest and  conviction of a male trafficker for acts at a G6 Hospitality property in Portland, id. at ¶ 27, n.2., Plaintiff notes that  one victim was subject to similar treatment: she was also advertised online for sex, ""walk[ed] the track"" on 82nd  Avenue, followed strict rules, and was deprived of food if she did not earn enough money. Id. at ¶¶ 27, 46-47, 51. A  2017 incident of trafficking at a Portland G6 Hospitality property also involved a male and female pair of traffickers,  as was the case during Plaintiff's trafficking. Id. at ¶¶ 28, 45. While the facts alleged by Plaintiff do not provide  details about the victims of the prior acts of trafficking, it is true that at least two victims were minors—unlike  Plaintiff—at the time of their trafficking. Id. at ¶¶ 27, 28. Nonetheless, online reviews of the Studio 6 property where  Plaintiff was trafficked indicate its reputation for sex trafficking: [*21]  over the five years before Plaintiff brought this  suit, multiple online reviews mention or allude to sex trafficking. Id. at ¶¶ 30-32. Further, the Studio 6 property is  located on 82nd Avenue, an area placed into a ""prostitution free zone"" to support efforts to eliminate sex trafficking  and prostitution. Id. at ¶¶ 29. In sum, Plaintiff does not rely on allegations that crime is generally foreseeable, but rather that G6 Defendants were  aware of the repeated occurrences of similar sex trafficking acts on their properties and at Studio 6. Compare  Uihlein v. Albertson's, Inc., 282 Ore. 631, 640-42, 580 P.2d 1014 (1978) (store not liable for shopper assaulted in  supermarket when little evidence of unsafe location) with Brown v. J.C. Penney Co., 297 Ore. 695, 710, 688 P.2d  811 (1984) (store liable for shopper attacked in parking lot where there was ample evidence of criminal activity in  area). As required by Piazza, Plaintiff plausibly alleges facts that G6 Defendants ""reasonably would have foreseen  that the person or location and circumstances posed a risk of criminal harm to persons such as [Plaintiff]."" Piazza,  360 Ore. at 81. Plaintiff has therefore sufficiently pled a cognizable legal theory to support the claim that G6  Defendants unreasonably created a foreseeable risk of her trafficking. Finally, G6 Defendants maintain that Plaintiff's allegations [*22]  of foreseeability fall short because Plaintiff's  allegations amount to mere ""facilitation"" under Oregon law, rather than an unreasonable creation of a risk. ECF 19  at 27. G6 Defendants rely on the description of ""facilitation"" in Buchler: ""mere 'facilitation' of an unintended adverse  result, where intervening intentional criminality of another person is the harm-producing force, does not cause the  harm so as to support liability for it."" Buchler, 316 Ore. at 511-12. This Court disagrees. Plaintiff has not alleged the  risk created by the G6 Defendants so broadly as to amount to ""mere facilitation"" under Oregon precedent. The Oregon Supreme Court has clarified that ""mere facilitation"" refers to the problem of ""describing the type of  harm at risk too generally,"" Piazza, 360 Ore. at 75-76, such that criminal acts would become ""the legal responsibility  of everyone who may have contributed in some way to the criminal opportunity,"" id. at 75 (citing Buchler, 316 Ore.  at 511). In this case, Plaintiff alleges specifically that G6 Defendants unreasonably created the risk of her sex  trafficking by failing to implement policies and proper training regarding sex trafficking, after allegedly becoming  aware of sex trafficking at their properties generally and at Studio 6, specifically. ECF [*23]  1-1 at ¶¶ 56, 24-33.  Accordingly, G6 Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's direct negligence claim is DENIED. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *18 Page 8 of 14 2. Negligence - Vicarious Liability Plaintiff alleges G6 Defendants are vicariously liable for franchisee Defendant IE and its employees' failure to  protect Plaintiff from harm. To state a negligence claim for vicarious liability under an agency theory, Plaintiff must  plausibly allege that (1) G6 Defendants and Defendant IE were in an agency relationship, and (2) Defendant IE or  its hotel staff are plausibly liable for negligence. G6 Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to sufficiently allege an  actual agency relationship between G6 Defendants and Defendant IE, reasoning that the allegations in the  complaint merely illustrate a franchisor's right to control its brand, rather than the required day-to-day control over  Defendant IE and its employees. ECF 19 at 21-23; see id. at 29. Defendants also argue that Plaintiff's allegations  do not demonstrate that Defendant IE, itself, is liable for negligence due to a lack of legal duty. Id. at 23; see id. at  29; ECF 31 at 14. a. Agency Relationship between G6 Defendants and Defendant IE An agency relationship ""results from the manifestation [*24]  of consent by one person to another that the other  shall act on behalf and subject to his control, and consent by the other so to act."" Vaughn v. First Transit, Inc., 346  Ore. 128, 135, 206 P.3d 181 (2009) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Hampton Tree Farms, Inc. v. Jewett, 320 Ore.  599, 617, 892 P.2d 683 (1995)). ""The agency relationship can arise either from actual consent (express or implied)  or from the appearance of such consent."" Eads v. Borman, 351 Ore. 729, 736, 277 P.3d 503 (2012) (en banc)  (citation omitted). Under Oregon law, a franchise relationship does not automatically give rise to an agency  relationship as a matter of law. Viado v. Domino's Pizza, LLC, 230 Ore. App. 531, 534, 217 P.3d 199 (2009). A  franchisor may only be held accountable for the acts of its franchisee if the franchisor controls the day-to-day  operation of the franchisee. Viado, 230 Ore. App. at 534 (Or. App. 2009) (quoting Miller v. McDonald's Corp., 150  Ore. App. 274, 280, 945 P.2d 1107 (1997)). The test for vicarious liability further requires that the franchisor  controlled the specific conduct that caused the plaintiff's injury. Id. at 551-52. As recognized by the Oregon  Supreme Court, ""for a principal to be vicariously liable for the negligence of its nonemployee agents, there ordinarily  must be a connection between the principal's 'right to control' the agent's actions and the specific conduct giving  rise to the [claim]."" Vaughn, 346 Ore. 128 at 138 (emphasis added). Plaintiff alleges that G6 Defendants exercised actual control over the day-to-day activities of its franchisee  Defendant IE. ECF 1-1 at ¶ 70. For example, [*25]  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant IE had to abide by G6  Defendants' corporate policies, including ""booking and reservations, room rates, websites . . . revenue management  tools, profit sharing terms, hiring procedures, employment policies and decisions, employee wages, building and  design standards, rules of operation, standardized employee training, inspections of facilities and operations, and  security policies and procedures."" Id. Additionally, Plaintiff alleges G6 Defendants required Defendant IE to follow  practices and programs implemented to prevent human trafficking. Id. G6 Defendants dispute whether they had day-to-day control of Studio 6 via Defendant IE. Although Plaintiff may  ultimately fail to establish the agency allegations, this Court must accept as true all well-pleaded factual allegations  in the complaint at this stage in the proceeding and construe them in Plaintiff's favor. See Daniels-Hall, 629 F.3d at  998; A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 940. This Court finds that Plaintiff has met her burden of alleging  a plausible claim for an actual agency relationship between G6 Defendants and Defendant IE. Plaintiff has alleged  facts which, if proven, support her theory that G6 Defendants had authority to control aspects of Studio 6  operations [*26]  connected to Plaintiff's claim. For example, Plaintiff alleges G6 Defendants exercised control over  the means and methods of daily hotel activities through policies on hiring procedures, employment policies and  decisions, employee wages, building and design standards, rules of operations, standardized employee training,  inspections of facilities and operations, and security policies and procedures. ECF 1-1 at ¶ 70. Plaintiff additionally alleges that G6 Defendants are liable for the actions of individual Defendants John Doe 1,  Shilash Patel, Vipul Patel, and other employees and agents of G6 Defendants under the doctrine of respondeat  superior. ECF 1-1 at ¶¶ 70-71. ""Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, an employer is liable for an employee's  tort when the employee acts within the course and scope of employment."" Minnis v. Oregon Mut. Ins. Co., 334 Ore.  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *23 Page 9 of 14 191, 201, 48 P.3d 137 (2002) (emphasis omitted) (citing Chesterman v. Barmon, 305 Ore. 439, 442, 753 P.2d 404  (1988)). Plaintiff alleges that John Doe 1, Shilash Patel, Vipul Patel, and other individuals were employees of  Defendant IE's hotel, Studio 6. ECF 1-1 at ¶¶ 18-21. Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged an agency relationship  between G6 Defendants and Defendant IE—which is the employer of John Doe 1, Shilash Patel, Vipul Patel.  Accordingly, Plaintiff [*27]  has also sufficiently alleged that G6 Hospitality may be vicariously liable for the actions  of the individual defendants which occurred within the scope of their employment at Studio 6. See A.B. v. Hilton  Worldwide, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 939 (requiring that plaintiff ""plausibly allege that . . . the hotels or hotel staff are  plausibly liable"" to state a claim for vicarious liability between hotel chains and their branded hotels) (emphasis  added); Miller v. D.F. Zee's, Inc., 31 F. Supp. 2d 792, 806 (D. Or. 1998) (""[A] franchisor may be held vicariously  liable under an agency theory for intentional acts . . . by employees of a franchisee."") (citation omitted). b. Special Relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant IE While Plaintiff has failed to plead a special relationship between Plaintiff and G6 Defendants, Plaintiff has  sufficiently pled a special relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant IE, giving rise to a heightened duty of care  on behalf of Defendant IE. Under Oregon law, ""[b]usiness owners and operators have a heightened duty of care  toward patrons—invitees—with respect to the condition of their premises that exceeds the general duty of care to  avoid unreasonable risks of harm to others."" Bagley, 356 Ore. at 563 (2014) (citations omitted). ""In general, it is the  duty of the possessor of land to make the premises reasonably [*28]  safe for the invitee's visit."" Id. (quoting  Woolston, 297 Ore. at 557). ""[A] business, as a possessor of premises, has a duty to take reasonable steps to  protect its visitors from reasonably foreseeable criminal acts by third persons."" Kids Inc. of Dallas, 245 Ore. App. at  278. Plaintiff pleads that Defendant IE is the owner and operator of the Studio 6 property at issue. ECF 1-1 at ¶ 12.  Defendant IE is therefore a possessor of premises and has a duty to protect visitors from reasonably foreseeable  criminal acts by third persons. See, e.g., Radke v. Carpenter, 281 Ore. 671, 677, 576 P.2d 365 (1978) (""The owner  of a[n] . . . inn owes his business guests a duty of ordinary reasonable care to protect them from injury at the hands  of other patrons while on the premises.""). This Court finds that Plaintiff has plausibly alleged an agency relationship between G6 Defendants and Defendant  IE, as Plaintiff has alleged facts which, if proven, support a theory that the G6 Defendants had control over the day- to-day operations of Studio 6 and its employees that relate to Plaintiff's claim. Further, this Court finds that Plaintiff  has plausibly alleged that Defendant IE had a legal duty to prevent Plaintiff's trafficking under Oregon law and that  IE violated that legal duty. Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts that [*29]  employees on site at Studio 6 were aware  that Plaintiff was being trafficked. Included in the Complaint are allegations that there were a variety of indicators  that Plaintiff was the victim of sex trafficking in Studio 6. Further, Plaintiff alleges that one employee, John Doe 1,  engaged in sex with one of her traffickers. Plaintiff further alleges that John Doe 1 suggested that Plaintiff engage in  sex acts with him and his girlfriend. Viewing the allegations and drawing all inferences in the light most favorable to  Plaintiff, this Court finds Plaintiff has sufficiently plead both a negligence claim against the employees of Studio 6  and Defendant IE and that G6 Defendants are vicariously liable for such negligence. Accordingly, this Court  DENIES G6 Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's vicarious negligence claim. C. O.R.S. § 30.867 Claim Plaintiff also brings a claim under O.R.S. § 30.867 against all Defendants for violation of O.R.S. § 163.266  (Trafficking in Persons), alleging Defendants ""knowingly benefit[ed] financially . . . from participation in a venture in      2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *26 Page 10 of 14 which [Plaintiff] was [sex trafficked]."" Id. at ¶¶ 34-37. Plaintiff asserts this claim against G6 Defendants both directly,  id. at ¶¶ 60-66, and vicariously for the [*30]  conduct of Defendant IE and its employees, id. at ¶¶ 69-71. For the  reasons stated below, this Court GRANTS G6 Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's direct liability claim under  O.R.S. § 30.867 and DENIES G6 Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's vicarious liability claim under O.R.S. §  30.867. As considered more fully below, evaluating [*31]  Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's claim under O.R.S. §  30.867 requires this Court to determine, as a matter of first impression, what state of mind a defendant must  possess to be held civilly liable under Oregon's civil trafficking statute. Plaintiff and G6 Defendants disagree as to  the scienter required for defendants under O.R.S. § 30.867. G6 Defendants maintain that O.R.S. § 30.867 requires  actual knowledge or reckless disregard of the victim's trafficking, while Plaintiff asserts that no such scienter  requirement applies. ECF 19 at 12; ECF 29 at 7-8. This Court first examines the scienter required under the  ""knowingly benefitted financially"" element and then the ""participation in a venture that involves a prohibited act""  element. This Court finds that (1) a defendant must act with an awareness that they are benefitting financially to  fulfill the ""knowingly benefitted financially"" element and (2) a defendant must know or recklessly disregard the  purpose of the venture to fulfill the ""participation in a venture that involves a prohibited act"" element. 1. Statutory Interpretation of O.R.S. § 30.867 Both parties have failed to provide this Court with any interpretations of O.R.S. § 30.867 in Oregon courts.  Accordingly, this Court will apply Oregon's [*32]  rules of statutory construction in interpreting the statute's scienter  requirements. When considering the meaning of an Oregon statute, courts in this district apply Oregon rules of statutory  construction. Powell's Books, Inc. v. Kroger, 622 F.3d 1202, 1209 (9th Cir. 2010). The ""paramount goal"" is  ""discerning the legislature's intent."" State v. Gaines, 346 Ore. 160, 171, 206 P.3d 1042 (2009) (en banc). Oregon  courts, interpreting Oregon law, have outlined three steps that courts must follow in ascertaining legislative intent.  Id. (interpreting 2001 amendments to O.R.S. 174.020). First, a court must examine the text and context of the  legislation in question. Id. Second, the court may consider pertinent legislative history proffered by a party, even if  the court does not find ambiguity in the legislative text. Id. at 172. And finally, if the legislature's intent remains  unclear after examining the text, context, and legislative history, ""the court may resort to general maxims of  statutory construction to aid in resolving the remaining uncertainty."" Id. 2. Role of Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (""TVPRA"") As a preliminary matter, when interpreting the scienter requirements in § 30.867, both Plaintiff and G6 Defendants  compare the language in O.R.S. § 30.867 to similar statutory language in the federal Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization [*33]  Act (""TVPRA""). See 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). The TVPRA provides, in relevant part: ""[a]n  individual who is a victim of a violation of this chapter may bring a civil action against . . . whoever knowingly  benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a venture which that person knew or           2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *29 Page 11 of 14 should have known has engaged in an act in violation of this chapter . . . in an appropriate district court of the  United States . . . ."" Id. Defendant claims that this statute provides a direct analog to O.R.S. § 30.867. ECF 19 at  16. Defendant further argues that the TVPRA imposes a lower standard of constructive knowledge compared with  O.R.S. § 30.867, which requires actual knowledge or reckless disregard of the victim's trafficking. Id. at 12; ECF 31  at 2. By contrast, Plaintiff claims that O.R.S. § 30.867 was not enacted as a direct analog and that the ""knowingly""  requirement in O.R.S. § 30.867 was not meant to apply to the ""participation in a venture"" clause. ECF 29 at 4-8. O.R.S. §§ 30.867 and 163.266 were both enacted through a single bill in 2007, a year before Congress passed the  TVPRA. Id. at 4-5. In passing the TVPRA, Congress added the following scienter requirements: ""An individual who  is a victim of a violation of this chapter may bring a civil action against the perpetrator [*34]  (or whoever knowingly  benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district court of the  United States and may recover damages and reasonable attorneys fees."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) (emphasis added);  ECF 19 at 5. The language in O.R.S. §163.266 and, by extension, O.R.S. § 30.867, has not changed since these  additions to the federal statute. ECF 29 at 6. The legislative history provided by the parties indicates that the relevant scienter language in the TVPRA was  incorporated after O.R.S. 30.867 was enacted. ECF 29 at 4; ECF 31 at 4. Nonetheless, Oregon courts have looked  to parallel federal precedent in analyzing an Oregon statute, even when the state statute precedes the federal law.  Portland State Univ. Chapter of Am. Ass'n of Univ. Professors v. Portland State Univ., 352 Ore. 697, 711, 291 P.3d  658 (2012) (en banc) (observing that Oregon Supreme Court has looked to Title VII precedent to analyze state  statues, even though ""Oregon enacted a number of civil rights statutes many years before Congress enacted Title  VII""). ""Oregon courts may examine federal precedent for contextual support when they construe state statutes that  parallel federal law."" Id. Accordingly, this Court looks to TVPRA precedent for context when [*35]  analyzing the  parallel provision in O.R.S. § 30.867. 3. Direct Liability Claim Plaintiff brings a direct claim under O.R.S. § 30.867 against G6 Defendants for violation of O.R.S. § 163.266,  alleging Defendants ""knowingly benefit[ed] financially . . . from participation in a venture in which [Plaintiff] was [sex  trafficked]."" ECF 1-1 at ¶¶ 60-66. This Court will first examine the scienter required under the ""knowingly benefitted  financially"" element and then the ""participation in a venture that involves a prohibited act"" element. a. Knowingly Benefitted Financially As noted above, when applying the Oregon rules of statutory construction, a court must first examine the text and  context of the legislation in question. Gaines, 346 Ore. at 171. The relevant statute at issue, O.R.S. § 30.867,  provides that ""a person injured by a violation of . . . 163.266 may bring a civil action for damages against a person  whose actions are unlawful under ORS . . . 163.266."" O.R.S. § 30.867. O.R.S. § 163.266, in turn, states that: ""[a]  person commits the crime of trafficking in persons if the person knowingly benefits financially or receives something  of value from participation in a venture that involves an act prohibited by subsection (1) of this section or ORS  163.263 or 163.264."" O.R.S. § 163.266(2). Based on the plain meaning of this text, Defendants must ""knowingly  benefit[] financially"" [*36]  under this statute. Under Oregon's Criminal Code, ""knowingly"" means that ""a person acts with an awareness that the conduct of the  person is of a nature so described or that a circumstance so described exists."" O.R.S. § 161.085(8). Applying this  definition to O.R.S. § 30.867, a defendant must act with an awareness that they are benefitting financially to fulfill  this element. See Delgado v. Souders, 334 Ore. 122, 132-33, 46 P.3d 729 (2002) (applying definition of ""knowingly""  from O.R.S. § 161.085 to civil anti-stalking statute with criminal statute counterpart); see also City of Portland v.  Tuttle, 295 Ore. 524, 530 n.8, 668 P.2d 1197 (1983) (applying definition of ""knowingly"" from O.R.S. § 161.085 to  municipal ordinance); A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 936 (citations omitted) (interpreting the  knowingly benefits financially element of § 1595 as ""'merely requir[ing] that Defendant knowingly receive a financial  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *33 Page 12 of 14 benefit'""); State v. Spainhower, 251 Ore. App. 25, 28, 283 P.3d 361 (2012) (""When particular terms are not  statutorily defined, we give them their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning unless the context indicates that the  legislature intended some other meaning.""). In addressing G6 Defendants' direct liability claim under O.R.S. § 30.867, Plaintiff asserts that the money gained  from Plaintiff's sex trafficking was used to pay for the room at Studio 6 where she was being trafficked. ECF 1-1 at ¶  4. Plaintiff further alleges, upon information and belief, that G6 Defendants receive a share [*37]  of each room's  rental payment at Studio 6. Id. at ¶ 44. G6 Defendants respond that Studio 6 was ""independently owned and  operated by a third-party franchisee, IE Hotel Group, LLC,"" and that, as franchisors, G6 Defendants could not have  ""knowingly accepted room rent from the pimp trafficking [of Plaintiff]."" ECF 19 at 10 (quoting ECF 1-1 at ¶ 44).  However, G6 Defendants also admit to receiving royalties tied to Studio 6 rental revenues. Id. As this Court has previously held in the TVPRA context, at this stage, a plaintiff's allegations that ""[the defendants]  benefitted from [the plaintiff's] trafficking each time they received royalty payment for rooms in which she was being  kept"" are ""sufficient to meet the 'knowingly benefits' element."" A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide, 484 F. Supp. at 936. This  Court finds that Plaintiff alleges sufficient facts that G6 Defendants ""knowingly benefitted"" financially from her  trafficking under O.R.S. § 30.867. b. Participation in a Venture that Involves a Prohibited Act The parties provide conflicting interpretations of the scienter required for the second element of participation in a  venture that involves a prohibited act under O.R.S. § 30.867. G6 Defendants assert that O.R.S. § 30.867 directly  incorporates the actual knowledge or reckless disregard [*38]  requirement of the underlying criminal statute:  O.R.S. § 163.266. ECF 31 at 4. Meanwhile, Plaintiff asserts that no scienter requirement applies. ECF 29 at 4.  Unlike the TVPRA—which states that a person may bring a civil action against ""whoever knowingly benefits,  financially . . . from participation in a venture which that person knew or should have known has engaged in an act  [of trafficking] in violation of this chapter,"" 18 U.S.C. § 1595 (emphasis added)—O.R.S. § 30.867 does not expressly  provide a second scienter requirement. Instead, O.R.S. § 163.266 provides that ""[a] person commits the crime of  trafficking in persons if the person knowingly benefits financially . . . from participation in a venture that involves an  act [of trafficking] prohibited by . . . this section."" Plaintiff asserts that the choice not to include a second scienter  requirement implies that there is no scienter required. ECF 29 at 4. Defendants argue, however, that by omitting a  second scienter requirement from the statute, the legislature intended for ""knowingly"" to apply to both the first and  second element. ECF 19 at 12. As stated above, O.R.S. § 30.867 enables a person injured by conduct violating O.R.S. § 163.266—Oregon's  criminal trafficking statute—to bring a civil action for damages. O.R.S. § 163.266 states [*39]  in relevant part that:  ""[a] person commits the crime of trafficking in persons if the person knowingly benefits financially or receives  something of value from participation in a venture"" where ""the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that  force, fraud or coercion will be used to cause the other person to engage in a commercial sex act."" O.R.S. §  163.266. O.R.S. § 30.867 incorporates the language of O.R.S. § 163.266 by reference. Accordingly, based on a  plain reading of these statutes together, in order to ""participate in a venture that involves [the prohibited act of sex  trafficking],"" the participants have to know or recklessly disregard the purpose of the venture. This Court finds that G6 Defendants' actions do not amount to direct participation in a sex trafficking venture. As  outlined in Section B, Plaintiff has alleged numerous facts that would have put employees and managers at Studio  6, and therefore Defendant IE, on notice that Plaintiff was being trafficked. However, these allegations, even when  viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, fall short of plausibly alleging G6 Defendants had knowledge of or  recklessly disregarded the alleged trafficking of Plaintiff at Studio 6. Plaintiff's allegations indicate [*40]  that G6  Defendants had notice of sex trafficking generally occurring at their hotels and perhaps even at Studio 6, id. at ¶¶  24-33, but Plaintiff has not alleged facts which sufficiently link notice of Plaintiff's sex trafficking to G6 Defendants.  See A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 938-39 (dismissing TVPRA claim against franchisor because  plaintiff's complaint failed to demonstrate participation in plaintiff's trafficking). 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *36 Page 13 of 14 Plaintiff must allege facts showing how G6 Defendants knew or, at least, recklessly disregarded the fact that  Plaintiff D.B. was trafficked at Studio 6. Plaintiff has not done so. Accordingly, Plaintiff has not alleged facts  sufficient to state a claim for direct liability under O.R.S. § 30.867. This Court GRANTS Defendants' motion to  dismiss Plaintiff's direct liability claim against G6 Defendants under O.R.S. § 30.867 with leave to amend. 4. Vicarious Liability Claim Plaintiff also asserts a vicarious liability claim under O.R.S. § 30.867 against G6 Defendants for the conduct of  Defendant IE and its employees. ECF 1-1 at ¶¶ 69-71. G6 Defendants argue that, even if Plaintiff has plausibly  alleged the existence of an agency relationship between G6 Defendants and Defendant IE—as this Court has found  that she has—she has still failed to plausibly [*41]  allege Defendant IE or its employees are liable for any violation  of O.R.S. § 30.867. This Court disagrees. a. Knowingly Benefitted Financially Plaintiff has sufficiently pled facts to satisfy the first element of O.R.S. § 30.867. Plaintiff alleges that the money  gained from her sex trafficking was used to pay Defendant IE for the room in which she was being held. ECF 1-1 at  ¶ 4. G6 Defendants also admit to receiving royalties tied to Studio 6 rental revenues. ECF 19 at 10. As this Court  has found in the TVPRA context, at the pleading stage, a plaintiff's allegations that ""[the defendants] benefitted from  [the plaintiff's] trafficking each time they received royalty payments for rooms in which she was being kept"" are  ""sufficient to meet the 'knowingly benefits' element."" A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 936 (discussing  the ""knowingly benefits"" element of 18 U.S.C. § 1595). This Court finds that Plaintiff alleges sufficient facts that  Defendant IE ""knowingly benefitted"" financially from her trafficking under O.R.S. § 30.867. b. Participation in a Venture that Involves a Prohibited Act As noted above, Plaintiff has sufficiently pled facts plausibly suggesting that Defendant IE or its employees  participated in a prohibited venture, the second element of O.R.S. § 30.867. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant [*42]   John Doe 1, an employee of Studio 6, ""paid for sex with the female trafficker who exploited [Plaintiff],"" ECF 1-1 at ¶  37, and that Defendant John Doe 1 suggested that Plaintiff should ""engage in a three-way sexual relationship with  him along with his girlfriend,"" id. at ¶ 39. This Court has recognized that a relationship between a member of the  hotel staff and a plaintiff's trafficker may be evidence that a hotel knew or should have known of the plaintiff's  trafficking in the TVPRA context. A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 941 (citing B.M. v. Wyndham Hotels  & Resorts, Inc., No. 20-CV-00656-BLF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, *6 (N.D. Cal. July 30,  2020)). Based on Plaintiff's allegations concerning John Doe 1, along with numerous factual allegations in the  Complaint that would have put Defendant IE's employees on notice that Plaintiff was being trafficked, this Court  finds that plaintiff plausibly alleges that Defendant IE knowingly or with reckless disregard participated in a sex  trafficking venture sufficient to establish the second element. Knowledge of prostitution is generally not sufficient to satisfy knowledge of sex trafficking. See A.B. v. Hilton  Worldwide, 484 F. Supp. 3d at 941 (collecting TVPRA cases). However, Plaintiff also alleges facts suggesting that  Defendant IE or its employees knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that she was subjected to fraud, force,  threats [*43]  of force, or coercion. Plaintiff alleges that widely known indicators of trafficking include ""younger  individual with an older ""boyfriend,"" ""frequent male visitors to a room for short periods of time,"" ""guest shows signs  of fear, anxiety, tension, submission, and/or nervousness,"" ""guest shows signs of malnourishment, poor hygiene, or  lack of sleep,"" and ""guest lacks freedom of movement or is constantly monitored."" Id. at ¶ 43. Among other  allegations, Plaintiff pleads that she was kept under close watch at Studio 6 for nearly a week and was not allowed  to leave her room without her traffickers unless she stayed within view of the room, id. at ¶ 50, that she was  compelled to have sex with men for money multiple times a day at Studio 6, id. at ¶ 51, and that she was deprived  of food if she failed to earn enough money for her traffickers, id. Accordingly, Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17945, *40 Page 14 of 14 supporting a cognizable legal theory that Defendant IE or its employees had actual knowledge of or recklessly  disregarded her sex trafficking. Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to fulfill the second element of O.R.S. § 30.867. Taking Plaintiff's allegations as true, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a vicarious claim against G6 [*44]  Defendants  under O.R.S. § 30.867. Accordingly, this Court DENIES Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's vicarious liability  claim against G6 Defendants under O.R.S. § 30.867.",1
"D.H. v. Tucker Inn Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181264","ORDER This matter is before the Court on Tucker Inn Incorporated's (""Defendant"") Motion to Dismiss [Doc. 10]. This Court  finds as follows: BACKGROUND D.H. (""Plaintiff"") alleges that in September 2015, she was sex trafficked at the Super 8 (the ""Hotel"") when she was  fifteen years old. [Doc. 1, p. 3]. Plaintiff claims that her trafficker kept two rooms rented at the Hotel where she was  made to have sex with as many as twenty older men each day. Id. at 10-11. [*2]  According to Plaintiff, at all times  relevant to her trafficking, Defendant owned, controlled, operated, supervised and managed the Hotel where  Plaintiff was trafficked. Id. at 3, 7. Plaintiff contends that prior to and during her trafficking, prostitution and child sex trafficking was open, obvious and  rampant at the Hotel. Id. at 17-18. Plaintiff witnessed more than ten other sex traffickers operating openly at the  Page 2 of 6 Hotel and Plaintiff estimates that there were 100 or more buyers there each day. Id. at 9. Plaintiff also witnessed at  least twenty other victims being trafficked for sex at the Hotel. Id. Plaintiff describes seeing women and children  wearing lingerie or very little clothing throughout the Hotel. Id. Plaintiff also observed a constant stream of men  visiting the rooms of these women and children for short periods of time, one after another. Id. During her trafficking at the Hotel, Plaintiff alleges that she exhibited numerous well-known and visible signs  common to minor sex trafficking victims, including her age and inappropriate appearance, fatigue, sleep deprivation,  injuries, failure to make eye contact with others, loitering and solicitation of male patrons. Id. at 11. [*3]  Plaintiff  contends that her rooms also evidenced numerous well-known signs of sex trafficking such as many daily, older  male visitors, an excessive number of used condoms and towels and other sex-related paraphernalia. Id. at 11, 13.  Plaintiff's trafficker also paid cash received from Plaintiff's trafficking for an additional day every day at the Hotel,  which Plaintiff avers was an additional sign of sex trafficking. Id. at 12. Plaintiff contends that Defendant's employees had knowledge of and allowed, condoned, facilitated and/or ignored  the widespread prostitution and sex trafficking occurring at the Hotel. Id. at 18. As to Plaintiff specifically, Plaintiff  claims that she regularly interacted with the Hotel's employees and in one instance, an employee confronted  Plaintiff and asked if she was okay. Id. at 12-13. However, when Plaintiff told Defendant's employee that she was  not okay, the employee did nothing. Id. at 13. Moreover, Plaintiff contends that Defendant's employees knew or should have known generally about the sex  crimes being committed at the Hotel based on an extensive history of police reports regarding incidents relating to  sex crimes at the Hotel and public complaints [*4]  from the Hotel's patrons. Id. at 19-22, 24-27. Plaintiff points to  twenty incidents in the four years leading up to Plaintiff's trafficking where the police investigated and/or made  arrests for sex crimes at the Hotel. Id. at 19-22. Plaintiff also points to nine online reviews by patrons of the Hotel  which cited safety concerns and sex crimes that they observed taking place during their stay. Id. at 24-26.  Ultimately, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant provided a market and beds for traffickers to sell women and children for  sex which caused her trafficker to bring her to the Hotel to be sold for sex. Id. at 18. On August 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed this suit against Defendant alleging the following causes of action: (1) violation of  18 U.S.C. § 1595(a), known as the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (""TVPRA""); and (2) nuisance.  See id. In her Complaint, Plaintiff seeks damages including attorney's fees, costs and punitive damages under the  TVPRA and O.C.G.A. §§ 13-6-11, 9-11-68 and 9-15-14. Id. Defendant filed the instant Motion seeking dismissal of  all of Plaintiff's claims on September 21, 2022. [Doc. 10]. The Motion is now ripe for review. LEGAL STANDARD In evaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the court ""accept[s] the [*5]   allegations in the complaint as true and constru[es] them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff."" Traylor v. P'ship  Title Co., 491 F. App'x 988, 989 (11th Cir. 2012). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) provides that a pleading  must contain ""a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Although  detailed factual allegations are not necessarily required, the pleading must contain more than ""labels and  conclusions"" or a ""formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678,  129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). A complaint is insufficient if it only tenders naked assertions devoid of  further factual enhancement. Id. Importantly, ""a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true,  to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'"" Id. (citation omitted). At bottom, the complaint must contain  more than ""an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation,"" id., and must ""plead[] factual content  that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.""  Traylor, 491 F. App'x at 990 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). While all well-pleaded facts must be accepted as true  and construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, Powell v. Thomas, 643 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir. 2011), a  court need not accept as true the plaintiff's legal conclusions, including those couched as factual [*6]  allegations,  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181264, *2 Page 3 of 6 Accordingly, evaluation of a motion to dismiss requires two steps: (1) a court must eliminate any allegations in the  pleading that are merely legal conclusions, and (2) where there are remaining well-pleaded factual allegations, a  court must ""assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.""  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. ANALYSIS In its motion, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's TVPRA and nuisance claims should be dismissed. Defendant also  argues that Plaintiff's claims for attorney's fees, costs and punitive damages should be dismissed. The Court will  address each claim in turn. 1. TVPRA The TVPRA offers a civil remedy to victims of certain types of human trafficking. The civil remedy portion of the  TVPRA provides that a trafficking victim may bring a civil suit against a sex-trafficking perpetrator or ""whoever  knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a venture which that person  knew or should have known has engaged in an act in violation of [the TVPRA]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). In this case,  Plaintiff is not suing the perpetrator, but rather Defendant, who she claims knowingly benefited from the sex  trafficking. To state [*7]  a claim for beneficiary liability under the TVPRA, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that the  defendant: (1) knowingly benefited, (2) from taking part in a common undertaking or enterprise involving risk and potential  profit, (3) that undertaking or enterprise violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff, and (4) the defendant had  constructive or actual knowledge that the undertaking or enterprise violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff. Doe #1 v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 726 (11th Cir. 2021). As to the first element, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant ""knew it was receiving some value from  participating in the alleged venture."" Id. at 724. In this case, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant rented two rooms to  Plaintiff's trafficker and received cash from the room rental. This Court finds that the revenue from the room rental  constitutes a financial benefit sufficient to meet the ""knowingly benefited"" standard. See S.Y. v. Best W. Int'l, Inc.,  No. 2:20-cv-616, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106139, 2021 WL 2315073, at *5 (M.D. Fla. June 7, 2021); see also A.B. v.  H.K. Grp. of Co., No. 1:21-cv-1344, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29214, 2022 WL 467786, at *4 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 9, 2022)  (holding that the money received from room rentals constitutes a benefit, knowingly received). The second element requires a plaintiff to allege that a defendant participated in a venture. As to this element, the  Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has made clear that the definition of ""participation in a venture"" is not the same  as [*8]  that found in the criminal provisions of § 1591(e)(4). Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. Instead, in the civil  context, ""participation in a venture"" merely requires that a plaintiff allege that the defendant ""took part in a common  undertaking or enterprise involving risk and potential profit."" Id. at 725. In this case, Plaintiff has made the ""kinds of allegations [that] would establish a hotel operator's participation in a  venture with a sex trafficker."" Id. at 726. Plaintiff's allegations are sufficient because she alleges that Defendant            2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181264, *6 Page 4 of 6 had rented rooms to her trafficker and that Defendant knew or should have known that the trafficker was presently  engaged in sex trafficking with Plaintiff. Plaintiff's Complaint adequately sets forth the reasons why Defendant  should have been on notice of the sex trafficking and how it failed to prevent it. Plaintiff alleges that she regularly  interacted with Defendant's employees and exhibited well-known signs consistent with a trafficking victim.  Moreover, Plaintiff contends that one of Defendant's employees asked Plaintiff if she was okay then did nothing  when Plaintiff responded that she was not okay. At bottom, the allegations are sufficient to allege participation in a  venture. See Best W. Int'l, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106139, 2021 WL 2315073, at *4 (holding that it was [*9]   sufficient for a plaintiff to plead that the defendants participated in a venture by renting rooms to people it knew or  should have known were engaged in sex trafficking). As to the third element, a plaintiff must allege ""that the venture . . . violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff."" Red Roof  Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. The TVPRA criminalizes various acts of human trafficking. In this case, Plaintiff specifically  alleges that she was trafficked in violation of § 1591(a), which makes it a crime to cause a person who has not yet  attained the age of eighteen years to engage in a commercial sex act. Consequently, as to this element, Plaintiff  must therefore plead sufficient facts to plausibly allege that the venture in which Defendant participated committed a  crime against her. Defendant argues that this element is not satisfied because Plaintiff did not allege that Defendant knew or acted in  reckless disregard in furtherance of the alleged child sex trafficking venture. Defendant misstates the standard. In  fact, the Eleventh Circuit has determined that, to establish a violation of § 1591(a), it is sufficient that the plaintiff  allege that she was a minor when she was forced to engage in commercial sex acts and that the Defendant had a  reasonable [*10]  opportunity to observe her on the premises. See United States v. Whyte, 928 F.3d 1317, 1328  (11th Cir. 2019). Here, Plaintiff alleges that she was a minor when she was made to engage in commercial sex acts  with as many as twenty men each day. She further alleges that Defendant had ample opportunity to observe her in  common areas of the Hotel and through her frequent interactions with Defendant's employees, including the time  that Plaintiff told a front desk employee that she was not okay. This Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations are more  than sufficient to show that the venture violated the TVPRA as to Plaintiff. Finally, as to the last element, the allegations must show that a defendant had actual or constructive knowledge that  the venture violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff. Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Knowledge is defined as ""an  awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance."" Id. Conversely, constructive knowledge ""is that knowledge  which 'one using reasonable care or diligence should have.'"" Id. The Court finds that Plaintiff has adequately alleged that Defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of  Plaintiff's sex trafficking at the Hotel. In Plaintiff's Complaint, she alleges that Defendant knew or should have  known about the sex trafficking venture [*11]  based on the following: Plaintiff's age and inappropriate appearance,  her fatigue and sleep deprivation, her injuries, her failure to make eye contact with others, her loitering, her  solicitation of male patrons and the number of men visiting her room. Courts considering similar allegations have  found the allegations sufficient to infer that a defendant knew or should have known of the sex trafficking venture,  and the Court finds these allegations sufficient as well. S.Y. v. Naples Hotel Co., 476 F. Supp. 3d 1251, 1257 (M.D.  Fla. 2020) (collecting cases). As explained in the preceding paragraphs, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to support each element of her  TVPRA claim. As such, to the extent Defendant seeks dismissal of the TVPRA claim, Defendant's motion is  DENIED. 2. Nuisance The Court next evaluates whether Plaintiff adequately alleges a claim for nuisance. Under Georgia law, a nuisance  is defined as ""anything that causes hurt, inconvenience, or damage to another . . . ."" O.C.G.A § 41-1-1. To establish  a nuisance claim, a plaintiff must allege ""the existence of the nuisance complained of, that he or she has suffered  injury, and that the injury complained of was caused by the alleged nuisance."" Bord v. Hillman, 335 Ga. App. 18,  780 S.E.2d 725, 728 (Ga. Ct. App. 2015). Defendant argues that Plaintiff's nuisance claim should be [*12]   2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181264, *8 Page 5 of 6 dismissed because Plaintiff failed to assert that Defendant had control over the alleged harm suffered by Plaintiff. In  other words, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not alleged that Defendant, itself, caused Plaintiff to be sex  trafficked. Because Defendant only challenges Plaintiff's ability to establish the causation element of her nuisance  claim, this Court will focus its analysis on that element. Causation is an essential element of nuisance claims. Alexander v. Hulsey Env't Servs., Inc., 306 Ga. App. 459,  702 S.E.2d 435, 439 (Ga. Ct. App. 2010). To establish proximate cause for a nuisance claim, ""a plaintiff must show  a legally attributable causal connection between the defendant's conduct and the alleged injury."" Id. A successful  nuisance claim cannot be based on mere speculation, conjecture or a possibility of causation. Id. Rather, the  causation standard is that ""it is more likely than not that the conduct of the defendant was a cause in fact of the  result."" Id. Contrary to Defendant's contention, this Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded facts that allow the Court  to draw a reasonable inference that Defendant's conduct caused Plaintiff to be sex trafficked at the Hotel. First,  Plaintiff alleges, and Defendant does not dispute, that Defendant owned and [*13]  operated the Hotel where  Plaintiff was trafficked. Further, as this Court previously concluded, Plaintiff's Complaint adequately sets forth the  reasons why Defendant should have been on notice of the rampant sex trafficking occurring at the Hotel and how it  failed to prevent it. As such, Plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to demonstrate that Defendant's management of  the Hotel in a way which allowed for the widespread commission of sex crimes created a market and beds for sex  traffickers to operate. This sufficiently demonstrates a legally attributable causal connection between Defendant's  conduct and Plaintiff's trafficking. Thus, Defendant's argument for dismissing Plaintiff's nuisance claim fails and  dismissal on that basis is DENIED. 3. Attorney's Fees, Costs and Punitive Damages Finally, this Court examines Plaintiff's claims for attorney's fees, costs and punitive damages. Defendant argues  that Plaintiff did not sufficiently plead her claims for attorney's fees and costs. However, Defendant provides little  context as to why it contends Plaintiff's claims are deficiently pled. Absent any substantive arguments  demonstrating why these claims fail, dismissal of Plaintiff's claims [*14]  for attorney's fees and costs is DENIED. Likewise, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently plead her claim for punitive damages. More  specifically, Defendant contends that Plaintiff has failed to allege factual details of Defendant's actions that  exhibited ""willful misconduct, malice, fraud, wantonness, oppression, or . . . entire want of care which would raise  the presumption of conscious indifference to consequences"" as required to recover punitive damages under  Georgia law. See O.C.G.A. § 51-12-5.1. This Court disagrees. As analyzed above, this Court has concluded that  Plaintiff's Complaint adequately sets forth allegations showing that Defendant knew or should have known about  the rampant sex crimes occurring at the Hotel and yet failed to prevent it. The Court finds that such allegations also  demonstrate the type of misconduct that would support an award of punitive damages. Accordingly, dismissal of  Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages is DENIED.",1
"Daniel v. HBO, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217653","[*1] MEMORANDUM OPINION This suit is rooted in the television miniseries We Own  This City (the ""Series"" or the ""Show""), which concerns the now defunct Gun Trace  Task Force (""GTTF""), a corrupt unit of the Baltimore Police Department (""BPD""). Shanea Daniel,  an African American female exotic dancer with dwarfism, filed suit against defendant Home Box  Office, Inc. (""HBO""), the distributor of the Show, alleging that a three-minute scene (the ""Scene"")  falsely implies that she engaged in prostitution with Sergeant Wayne Jenkins, the former  leader of the GTTF. See ECF 1 (""Complaint""), ¶¶ 3, 34, 44, 51. 1 1 In addition to HBO, plaintiff sued the following entities:  Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.; WarnerMedia Direct, LLC;  WarnerMedia Services, LLC; Home Box Office, Inc.;  HBO Service Corporation; Time Warner, Inc.; Warner  Communications, Inc.; and AT&T, Inc. See ECF 1 at 1-  3. However, plaintiff did not effect service on these  defendants. See Docket. The Court provided several  warnings to plaintiff that failure to effect service on these  defendants would result in the dismissal of the suit as to  them, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) and Local Rule 103.8.  ECF 18 (Order of July 31, 2023); ECF 19 (Order of  October 3, 2023). Plaintiff failed to respond. [*2]   Therefore, by Order of November 1, 2023, the Court  dismissed the unserved defendants from the case,  without prejudice. ECF 20. The suit contains three counts, all arising from  allegations that HBO falsely implied that plaintiff  engaged in prostitution with Jenkins. See id. ¶¶ 19, 30,  45, 53. 2 In Count 1, plaintiff alleges that HBO defamed  her by implying that she engaged in prostitution with  Jenkins. Id. at 6- 8; see id. ¶ 30. In Count 2, plaintiff  alleges a claim of ""False Light."" Id. at 8-9; see id. ¶ 45.  And, in Count 3, plaintiff alleges that HBO acted  negligently by failing to ensure the accuracy of the  depiction of events involving plaintiff. Id. at 9-10; see id.  ¶¶ 51, 53. Daniel seeks $3,000,000 in compensatory  damages, $10,000,000 in punitive damages, attorney's  fees, and interest. Id. at 10. HBO has moved to dismiss plaintiff's claims for failure to  state a claim. ECF 8. The motion is supported by a  memorandum. ECF 8-1 (collectively, the ""Motion""). HBO  also moved for leave to file a physical exhibit of a  Universal Serial Bus (""USB"") drive containing a copy of  the Series. ECF 9 (""Motion to File""). Plaintiff did not  respond to the Motion to File. See Docket. But, she  Page 2 of 17 opposes [*3]  the Motion (ECF 16, the ""Opposition""),  supported by exhibits. ECF 16-2 to ECF 16-5.  Defendant replied. ECF 17 (""Reply""). No hearing is necessary to resolve the motions. See  Local Rule 105.6. For the reasons that follow, I shall  grant the Motion to File. And, I shall grant the Motion in  part and deny the Motion in part. 2 Jurisdiction is premised on diversity of citizenship,  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332. ECF 1, ¶ 1.

One was Jenkins, ""who . . . commit[ted] numerous public integrity crimes from  approximately 2015 to 2017."" Id. Plaintiff makes reference to a six-count Superseding  Indictment (""Indictment"") filed in the District of Maryland  on June 22, 2017, which charged Jenkins and two other  officers, inter alia, with Hobbs Act Robbery under 18  U.S.C. § 1951 and violations of the Racketeer  Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Id. ¶ 15; see  United States v. Wayne Jenkins et al., GLR-17-0106,  ECF 137. 4 Among other things, the Indictment alleged  that in the spring of 2015, Jenkins and two  codefendants interrupted a [*4]  significant marijuana  sale and confiscated approximately $20,000 to $25,000  in cash, which Jenkins and his codefendants then  divided among themselves. See id. ¶¶ 15-17. According  to the Indictment, the officers then drove to a strip club  in Baltimore County, where Jenkins robbed a stripper  and subsequently fled with his codefendants. Id. ¶ 18. Plaintiff alleges that she was the ""stripper mentioned in  the"" Indictment. ECF 1, ¶ 15. According to plaintiff, she  ""had been working at the Millstream Inn Gentlemen's  Club in the spring 3As discussed, infra, at this juncture I must assume the  truth of the facts alleged in the suit. See Fusaro v.  Cogan, 930 F.3d 241, 248 (4th Cir. 2019). The Court  may also consider some of the exhibits submitted by the  parties.

Moreover, she asserts that she was  ""one of only two known exotic dancers diagnosed with dwarfism who performed in the greater  Baltimore area from 2015 to 2017."" Id. Indeed, plaintiff posits: ""There is no other person who  possesses the identifying characteristics of the corresponding character in the Show."" Id. ¶ 23. Plaintiff recounts that in 2021, Random House, a  division of Penguin Random House LLC, New York, published investigative reporter Justin  Fenton's book, We Own This City, which described the crimes committed by Jenkins and GTTF.  Id. ¶ 17. The book did not mention that Jenkins had robbed an exotic dancer. Id. HBO released the Series on April 25, 2022. Id. ¶ 18.  Although the Series is based on Fenton's book, it also includes depictions of events not  discussed in the [*6]  book, such as Jenkins's interaction with plaintiff. Id.; see also id. ¶ 23. According  to plaintiff, the Scene, which is in Episode Four of the Series, ""clearly depicts"" Daniel. Id.  ¶ 23. Page 3 of 17 The Scene begins as law enforcement officials interview  one of Jenkins's codefendants, Officer Maurice Ward, about Jenkins's various crimes. 5  Ward mentions Jenkins's interaction with Daniel. At the same time, Jenkins, Ward, and another of  Jenkins's codefendants, Officer Marcus Taylor, are shown seated together in a strip club.  Jenkins is receiving a lap dance from an unnamed dancer. The Scene contains the following depictions and  dialogue: Ward: This shit is crazy. Taylor: You know what's crazy? You really like that  steak right? Jenkins (to Unnamed Dancer): I like how you move.  Damn bro, where'd you get that at? Huh? Ain't you done  girl? You from Dundalk? You smell good for a white girl.  (laughs) Taylor: That's my fucking shit. 5 The Scene begins at about 14:26 in Episode Four. All  timestamps provided by the Court are approximate. The  Court's description and the transcript are based on its  review of the Scene. 4 The officers notice Daniel performing on stage, and  comment on her appearance and performance. The following [*7]  dialogue is relevant: Jenkins: Holy mother fucking shit. Taylor: Oh. Oh, my  lord. Dancer 1: You're on fire, baby. Jenkins. Whoo! That's fire! I don't believe it. She's  fucking gorgeous. Taylor: Holy shit! Ward: Ohhhhhh. Jenkins (to Unnamed Dancer): Okay. Okay girl  Goddamn! Hey this is the greatest mother fucking place  on earth! This is fucking - look at her! Hey, hey, hey,  hey, hey listen, listen, listen. Do me a favor, sweetheart.  Go talk to her. Get her ass off this stage and tell her to  come meet me in VIP all right? Yeah I got you boo. Shit,  you know I always come correct! Fucking stick your  fucking hand out like that. Go get her! Jenkins slaps the Unnamed Dancer on the buttocks. Jenkins: Boom! Unnamed Dancer: Hey! Fuck you, man! Jenkins: Just go fucking get her. Unnamed Patron: Oh she twerking. As the Unnamed Dancer moves toward the stage,  Jenkins talks to Ward and Taylor, as follows: Jenkins: Let me tell you something, I'm a fuck her. I  swear to God. Yes I am. Watch me, dead ass. I'm a fuck  her. Watch me! Taylor: Calm your ass down. Jenkins: I swear to God, my whole life I wanna fuck  [indecipherable]. Taylor: Jenkins, fucking how? Jenkins: What do you mean how? I'm a fucking handle  my business [*8]  baby, what y'all gonna fucking do?  You don't think I will? Taylor: Hell no, this liquor got you horny. Ward: Here  she comes, here she comes. Jenkins (to Daniel): What's up you gorgeous thing!  Goddamn it's an honor to meet you sweet thing. What's  going on? Daniel: I got you. You're mine. Taylor: You're a nasty  motherfucker. Ward: He dead ass. Jenkins: Don't hate me 'cause you ain't me baby. Jenkins (to an Unnamed Bouncer): Hey, put it up there,  that's there, my man. 5 Jenkins enters the VIP area with Daniel. Taylor: Seventy-five percent of that body weight is ass.  Ward: He doing his thing, man. Taylor: He goin' too hard. Ward: How was your steak, man? Mine was fucking  slapping. Thank you. Thank you. Page 4 of 17 Taylor: Variety in everything is the spice of life. Bro  that's some sick shit bro. Ward: Let your man live. Taylor: What the fuck he about to do with that? Ward:  Jenkins crazy man, but let him live. Taylor: Bro, bro. Ward: Why is that sick? You was just saying how she  was twerking. Approximately fourteen seconds after Jenkins enters the  VIP room, Jenkins hurriedly exits and approaches Ward and Taylor. The following  dialogue ensues: Jenkins: Hey, hey, hey, hey yo, yo yo. We gotta bounce!  Ward: That was quick. [*9]  Jenkins: Shut the fuck up man, when I say we gotta  bounce, we gotta bounce. Yo them steaks good? I'ma  take this motherfucker. Lemme take the fucking beer  too, let's go. Jenkins, Ward, and Taylor rush to exit the club, which is  identified by name on the exterior as the ""Millstream Inn."" Jenkins: What's going on? Watch the fuck out. Unnamed Dancer: Hey! Unnamed Bouncer: Hold up! Jenkins, Ward, and Taylor head towards a vehicle. The  following dialogue is pertinent: Jenkins: Come on man, let's get the fuck out of here.  Let's go! Come on, we gotta go. Taylor: Come on man. Ward: Yo, what the. . .? Jenkins, what the fuck did you  [inaudible] Hot damn man. Taylor: Get in the fucking car  already. The officers enter the vehicle and drive away from the  club, with the dialogue that follows: 6 Jenkins. Let's go! Taylor: What the fuck just happened, yo? Ward: Wayne, man we wasn't even in there an hour. Jenkins: Hey hey look look, that little fucking mini-me  motherfucker was on top of me for like five seconds. I  couldn't fit inside of her. So I knew that shit wasn't  gonna happen so I just dumped the runt on the ground  and I . . . Ward: She put it on you, didn't she? Jenkins: Nah man. Ward: She put it on you, didn't she? [*10]  Jenkins: I tell  you what she did. Ward: She put all that ass on him! Jenkins: I'll tell you what happened motherfucker. Hey I  grabbed her fucking money and bailed the fuck out  that's what happened. Taylor: You kidding me? Jenkins: Check this shit out. Yeah you fucking heard  me. Hey look, it's like twice as much as I fucking gave  her. Hee-haw motherfucker. Ward: You robbed the midget stripper? Jenkins: Come  on, don't put it like that, man. Taylor: That's not cool.  That's not cool, Sarge! Plaintiff alleges that the Scene, which is approximately  three minutes long and ends at 17:25, falsely implies that she engaged in prostitution.  ECF 1, ¶ 21. Although plaintiff acknowledges that she gave a lap dance to Jenkins,  she alleges that she ""never had any form of sexual contact with"" him. Id. ¶¶ 22, 31-32. According to plaintiff, the false implication that she  engaged in prostitution with Jenkins harmed her reputation and caused her to ""suffer[]  embarrassment and other emotional distress from her efforts to correct the record with her friends and  family."" Id. ¶¶ 24, 26. In addition, plaintiff alleges that HBO's ""implication of sexual contact  between [her] and . . . Jenkins has caused significant damage to [*11]  the goodwill and reputation  of . . . Daniel's business,"" id. ¶ 25, and ""has made it more difficult for [her] to book performances."" Id.  ¶ 26. Page 5 of 17 Additional facts are discussed, infra. 7 II.Standard of Review A. A defendant may test the legal sufficiency of a plaintiff's  complaint by way of a motion to dismiss under Rule  12(b)(6). Nadendla v. WakeMed, 24 F.4th 299, 304-05  (4th Cir. 2022); Fesslerv. Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp., 959  F.3d 146, 152 (4th Cir. 2020); Paradise Wire & Cable  Defined Benefit Pension Plan v. Weil, 918 F.3d 312, 317  (4th Cir. 2019); In re Birmingham, 846 F.3d 88, 92 (4th  Cir. 2017); Goines v. Valley Cmty. Servs. Bd., 822 F.3d  159, 165-66 (4th Cir. 2016); McBurney v. Cuccinelli, 616 F.3d 393, 408 (4th Cir.  2010), aff'd sub nom. McBurney v. Young, 569 U.S. 221  (2013). A Rule 12(b)(6) motion constitutes an assertion  by a defendant that, even if the facts alleged by a  plaintiff are true, the complaint fails as a matter of law  ""to state a claim upon which relief can be granted."" Fed.  R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Whether a complaint states a claim for relief is assessed  by reference to the pleading requirements of Fed. R.  Civ. P. 8(a)(2). See Migdal v. Rowe Price-Fleming Int'l  Inc., 248 F.3d 321, 325-26 (4th Cir. 2001); see also  Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 513 (2002).  That rule provides that a complaint must contain a ""short  and plain statement of the claim showing that the  pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The  purpose of the rule is to provide the defendant with ""fair  notice"" of the claims and the ""grounds"" for entitlement to  relief. Bell Atl.Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555-56  (2007). To survive a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), a  complaint must contain facts sufficient to ""state a claim  to relief that is plausible on its face."" Twombly, 550 U.S.  at 570; seeAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 684 (2009)  (citation omitted) (""Our decision in Twombly expounded  the pleading standard for 'all civil actions' . . . .""); see  also Fauconier v. Clarke, 966 F.3d 265, 276 (4th Cir.  2020); Paradise Wire & Cable Defined Benefit Pension  Plan, 918 F.3d at 8 317-18; Willner v. Dimon, 849 F.3d 93, 112 (4th Cir.  2017). [*12]  ""A claim has facial plausibility when the  plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to  draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is  liable for the misconduct alleged."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at  678. ""But where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the  court to infer more than the mere possibility of  misconduct, the complaint has alleged-but it has not  'show[n]'-'that the pleader is entitled to relief.'"" Id. at 679  (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)). A plaintiff need not include ""detailed factual allegations""  to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2). Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.  Moreover, federal pleading rules ""do not countenance  dismissal of a complaint for imperfect statement of the  legal theory supporting the claim asserted."" Johnson v.  City ofShelby, Miss., 574 U.S. 10, 11 (2014) (per  curiam).  However,  mere  ""'naked  assertions'  of  wrongdoing"" are generally insufficient to state a claim  for relief. Francis v. Giacomelli, 588 F.3d 186, 193 (4th  Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). In other words, the rule demands more than bald  accusations or mere speculation. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555; see Painter's Mill Grille, LLC  v. Brown, 716 F.3d 342, 350 (4th Cir. 2013). If a  complaint  provides  no  more  than  ""labels  and  conclusions"" or ""a formulaic recitation of the elements of  a cause of action,"" it is insufficient. Twombly, 550 U.S.  at 555. ""[A]n unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully- harmed-me accusation"" does not state a plausible claim  of relief. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Instead, to satisfy the  minimal requirements of Rule 8(a)(2), the complaint  must set [*13]  forth ""enough factual matter (taken as  true) to suggest"" a cognizable cause of action, ""even if .  . . [the] actual proof of those facts is improbable and . . .  recovery is very remote and unlikely."" Twombly, 550  U.S. at 556 (internal quotation marks omitted). In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, ""a court 'must  accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in  the complaint,' and must 'draw all reasonable inferences  [from those facts] 9 in favor of the plaintiff.'"" Retfalvi v. United States, 930  F.3d 600, 605 (4th Cir. 2019) (alteration in Retfalvi)  (quoting E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Kolon Indus.,  Inc., 637 F.3d 435, 440 (4th Cir. 2011)); see Semenova  v. Md. Transit Admin., 845 F.3d 564, 567 (4th Cir.  2017); Houck v.Substitute Tr. Servs., Inc., 791 F.3d 473,  484 (4th Cir. 2015). However, ""a court is not required to  accept legal conclusions drawn from the facts."" Retfalvi,  930 F.3d at 605 (citing Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265,  286 (1986)); see Glassman v. Arlington Cnty., 628 F.3d  140, 146 (4th Cir. 2010). ""A court decides whether [the  Page 6 of 17 pleading] standard is met by separating the legal  conclusions from the factual allegations, assuming the  truth of only the factual allegations, and then  determining whether those allegations allow the court to  reasonably infer"" that the plaintiff is entitled to the legal  remedy sought. A Society Without a Name v. Virginia,  655 F.3d 342, 346 (4th. Cir. 2011), cert. denied, 566  U.S. 937 (2012). But, ""[m]ere recitals of a cause of  action, supported only by conclusory statements, are  insufficient to survive"" a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Morrow v.  NavyFederal Credit Union, 2022 WL 2526676, at *2 (4th  Cir. July 7, 2022). When ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, courts ordinarily  do not ""'resolve contests surrounding the facts, the  merits of a claim, or the applicability of defenses.'"" King  v. Rubenstein, 825 F.3d 206, 214 (4th Cir. 2016)  (citation [*14]  omitted); see Bing v. Brio Sys., LLC, 959  F.3d 605, 616 (4th Cir. 2020). But, ""in the relatively rare  circumstances where facts sufficient to rule on an  affirmative defense are alleged in the complaint, the  defense may be reached by a motion to dismiss filed  under Rule 12(b)(6)."" Goodman v. Praxair, Inc., 494  F.3d 458, 464 (4th Cir. 2007) (en banc); accord  Pressley v. Tupperware Long Term Disability Plan, 553  F.3d 334, 336 (4th Cir. 2009). Because Rule 12(b)(6) ""is  intended [only] to test the legal adequacy of the  complaint,"" Richmond,Fredericksburg & Potomac R.R.  Co. v. Forst, 4 F.3d 244, 250 (4th Cir. 1993), ""[t]his  principle only applies . . . if all facts necessary to the  affirmative defense 'clearly appear[ ] on the face of 10 the complaint.' "" Goodman, 494 F.3d at 464 (emphasis  in Goodman) (quoting Forst, 4 F.3d at 250). It is well settled that a plaintiff may not cure a defect in a  complaint or otherwise amend a complaint by way of  opposition briefing. See, e.g., De Simone v. VSL  Pharmaceuticals, 36 F.4th 518, 531 (4th Cir. 2022)  (recognizing that, generally, new arguments cannot be  raised in a reply brief); Henderson v. City of Roanoke,  2022 WL 704351, at *3 (4th Cir. Mar. 9, 2022) (per  curiam) (""[N]o litigant is exempt from the well- established rule 'that parties cannot amend their  complaints through briefing or oral advocacy.'"") (quoting  So. Walk at Broadlands Homeowner's Ass'n, Inc.v.  OpenBand at Broadlands, LLC, 713 F.3d 175, 184 (4th  Cir. 2013)); Glenn v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., DKC-15- 3058, 2016 WL 3570274, at *3 (D. Md.

Driggs, 965 F. Supp. 741, 748 n.4 (D.  Md. 1997) (stating that a plaintiff ""is bound by the  allegations contained in its complaint and cannot,  through the use of motion briefs, amend the complaint""),  aff'd, 141 F.3d 1162 (4th Cir. 1998). B. Both parties [*15]  have filed exhibits with their  respective submissions. In support of her Opposition,  plaintiff filed a law review article discussing libel in fiction  (ECF 16-2); an article published by the ""Freedom Forum  Institute,"" also discussing libel in fiction (ECF 16-3); a  purported transcript of the Scene (ECF 16-4); and  definitions of the terms ""put it on me"" and ""put it in me""  from the Urban Dictionary website (ECF 16-5). With respect to the purported transcript, defendant  states, ECF 17 at 11 n.6: The Opposition attaches . . . what purports to be a  transcript of the Scene from a third-party website  (""rev.com"") (ECF 16 -4). That unauthenticated transcript  contains  numerous  clear  errors  (including  by  misattributing who is speaking at various points, and the  fact that the transcript lists ""Shanea Daniel"" as the name  of 11 the dancer even though the character has no name in  the Series). In any event, the outcome of this motion  would be the same regardless of the transcript version,  and the Court should review the Series, including the  Scene, for itself. In support of its Motion, defendant moved to file a copy  of the Show, which has been provided to the Court on a  USB drive. ECF 9. Plaintiff did not [*16]  respond to the  Motion to File. See Docket. Nor does she oppose defendant's request. She  states, ECF 16 at 23: ""Plaintiff encourages this  Honorable Court to watch the whole series. HBO has  facilitated as much by filing its physical exhibit.""

U.S.  Airways, 510 F.3d 442, 450 (4th Cir. 2007). 12 Under limited circumstances, when resolving a Rule  12(b)(6) motion, a court may consider documents  beyond the complaint without converting the motion to  dismiss to one for summary judgment. Goldfarb v.  Mayor & City Council of Balt., 791 F.3d 500, 508 (4th  Cir. 2015). In particular, a court may ""consider a  document submitted by the movant that [is] not attached  to or expressly incorporated in a complaint, so long as  the document was integral [*17]  to the complaint and  there is no dispute about the document's authenticity.""  Goines, 822 F.3d at 166 (citations omitted); see also  Fusaro, 930 F.3d at 248; Woods v. City of Greensboro,  855 F.3d 639, 642 (4th Cir. 2017), cert. denied, ___  U.S. ___, 138 S.

However, ""before treating the contents of an attached or  incorporated document as true, the district court should  consider the nature of the document and why the  plaintiff attached it."" Goines, 822 F.3d at 167. ""When the plaintiff attaches or  incorporates a document upon which his claim is based,  or when the complaint otherwise shows that the plaintiff  has adopted the contents of the document, crediting the  document over conflicting allegations in the complaint is  proper.""

Conversely, ""where the  plaintiff attaches or incorporates a document for  purposes other than the truthfulness of the document, it  is inappropriate to treat the contents of that document  as true."" Id. In addition, ""a court may properly take judicial notice of  'matters of public record' and other information that,  under Federal Rule of Evidence 201, constitute  'adjudicative facts.'""

Penn Nat'l Gaming, Inc., 637 F.3d  462, 466 (4th Cir. 2011), cert. denied, 565 U.S. 825  (2011); Philips v. Pitt Cty. Mem'l Hosp., 572 F.3d 176,  180 (4th Cir. 2009). However, under Fed. R. Evid. 201,  a court may take judicial notice of adjudicative  facts [*18]  only if they are ""not subject to reasonable  dispute,"" that is, if they are ""(1) generally known within  the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable  of accurate and ready determination by resort to  sources  whose  accuracy  cannot  reasonably  be  questioned."" Fed. R. Evid. 201(a) distinguishes ""adjudicative facts,""  which are subject to the Rule, from ""legislative facts,""  which are not. See Fed. R. Evid. 201, Note to  Subdivision (a). ""[A]djudicative facts are those to which  the law is applied in the process of adjudication. They  are the facts that normally go to the jury in a jury case.""  Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  ""Legislative facts, on the other hand, are those which  have relevance to legal reasoning and the lawmaking  process, whether in the formulation of a legal principle  or ruling by a judge or court or in the enactment of a  legislative body."" Id. Under the principles described above, I may consider  the copy of the Series submitted by defendant. See ECF  9. Plaintiff does not dispute that the copy of the Show  defendant provided to the Court is authentic. And,  plaintiff urges the Court to consider it. ECF 16 at 23.  Moreover, the Show is integral to the Complaint  because plaintiff's claims ""turn on"" [*19]  and are  ""otherwise . . . based on"" its content. Brentzel, 2021 WL  6138286, at *2. Therefore, I shall grant defendant's  Motion to File. See ECF 9. Page 8 of 17 As noted, plaintiff filed as attachments to her Opposition  two articles from legal publications discussing libel in  fiction (ECF 16-2; ECF 16-3); a purported transcript of  the Scene (16-4); and entries for the terms ""put it on  me"" and ""put it in me"" from the Urban Dictionary website  (ECF 16-5). 14 The articles filed by plaintiff as ""exhibits"" are, in  essence, legal authorities. Plaintiff appears to submit  them to substantiate her theory of defamation, not to  establish any fact upon which her claim for relief  depends. The usual manner of directing the Court's  attention to a legal authority is to provide a citation to  that authority. However, instead of citing the two articles  in question, plaintiff appended copies of them to her  Opposition. In my view, it is appropriate to evaluate  these sources as if plaintiff had cited them in the usual  way. That is, I shall disregard the copies of the sources  that plaintiff provided to the Court. Instead, I shall  consider myself at libertyto locate the sources in a  reliable legal database, as I would any other authority  recommended to the [*20]  Court by a party. As noted, defendant claims in its Reply that the  transcript provided by plaintiff contains ""numerous clear  errors,"" such as ""the fact that the transcript lists 'Shanea  Daniel' as the name of the dancer even though the  character has no name in the Series."" ECF 17 at 11 n.6.  Elsewhere in the Reply, defendant states: ""Although  Plaintiff is not personally identified in the Scene, for  purposes of this Motion, Defendant is not arguing that  the dancer in the Scene could not be understood to be  Plaintiff."" Id. at 3. Therefore, the fact that the transcript  provided by plaintiff identifies the dancer as plaintiff is  not material to the Court's assessment of the Motion. Nevertheless, I cannot accept the purported transcript of  the Scene as an authoritative statement of what was  said during the Scene. See ECF 16-4. The transcript-as  distinguished from the Scene it purports to describe-is  not integral to plaintiff's Complaint. Nor is ""Rev.com,""  the service that apparently generated this transcript, a  ""source[] whose accuracy cannot reasonably be  questioned."" Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2); see ECF 16-4.  However, the transcript has been an aid to the Court in  its own review of the Scene and in preparing the  relevant [*21]  dialogue for inclusion in 15 this Memorandum Opinion. But, the Court considers the  transcript only insofar as the transcript is consistent with  what the Court has seen and heard during its own  review of the Scene. As to the entries for the terms ""put it on me"" and ""put it  in me"" from the Urban Dictionary website, I decline to  consider them. ECF 16-5. Certainly, these entries are  not ""integral"" to plaintiff's Complaint. Nor is the Urban  Dictionary  a  ""source[]  whose  accuracy  cannot  reasonably be questioned."" Fed. R.

Discussion A. Defamation (Count 1) 1. The parties assume, without discussion, that Maryland  law applies to plaintiff's defamation claim. See ECF 8-1  at 15; ECF 16 [*22]  at 5-6; ECF 17 at 2. As noted, the  Court's jurisdiction in this case rests on diversity of  citizenship of the parties. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332. In a  diversity case, the court ""must apply the forum state's  choice-of-law  rules  to  determine  the  governing  substantive law."" Towers Watson & Co. v. Nat. Union  Fire Ins.

Plaintiff alleges that HBO ""published the [defamatory]  statement to a worldwide [*23]  audience."" ECF 1, ¶ 35.  Therefore, in determining which state's law applies, I  consider ""the state of plaintiff's domicile, the state of  plaintiff's principal activity to which the alleged  defamation relates, and the state where plaintiff suffered  the greatest amount of harm."" Driver, 2021 WL 82864,  at *8. Plaintiff alleges that she ""is an adult resident and  citizen of Baltimore City, Maryland,"" id. ¶ 3, who  ""performed in the greater Baltimore area from 2015 to  2017."" Id. ¶ 4. Thus, according to the allegations,  Maryland is the state of plaintiff's domicile, the state of  the 17 activity  to  which  the  defamation  relates,  and,  presumably, ""the state where plaintiff suffered the  greatest amount of harm."" Driver, 2021 WL 82864, at *8.  As a result, I conclude that Maryland's law of defamation  applies to plaintiff's claim. 2. ""Under Maryland law, a properly pleaded defamation  claim is accompanied by specific facts establishing the  following four elements: '(1) that the defendant made a  defamatory statement to a third person, (2) that the  statement was false, (3) that the defendant was legally  at fault in making the statement, and (4) that the plaintiff  thereby suffered harm.'""

In other words, the plaintiff must establish [*26]   that the defendant acted with actual malice.

However, in cases in which the statement  is defamatory per quod, or defamatory per se but made 20 without actual malice, a plaintiff must prove actual  damages. See Shapiro, 105 Md. App. at 774; 661 A.2d at 217-18; Rorie, 653 F. Supp. 3d at 242  (citations omitted). 3. In the Motion, defendant urges dismissal of plaintiff's  defamation claim on two grounds. ECF 8-1 at 19-22. First, defendant invokes a purported  rule of federal constitutional law, to the effect that a statement that does not assert an ""actual  fact"" cannot give rise to liability for defamation. Id. at 16 (citing Biospherics, Inc. v. Forbes,  Inc., 151 F.3d 180, 186 (4th Cir. 1998)); see ECF 8-1 at 19-21. According to defendant, the  Scene is not actionable because it does not state an ""actual fact"" about plaintiff. ECF 8-1 at 21.  Defendant explains, [*27]  id. at 20 (emphasis in original): The alleged defamation claim is premised entirely on  lines spoken by WayneJenkins only to his buddies- and it is a central tenet of the entire Series that Jenkins  is a serial liar and shameless braggart. His words carry  no presumption of truth, and no reasonable viewer  would accept Jenkins' account of any interaction as a  statement of ""actual fact"" unless they can confirm it with  their own eyes. And here, nothing actually happens  onscreen to suggest anything more than a (very brief)  lap dance from the dancer in the VIP room . . . . Second, defendant argues that the Scene neither  implies that plaintiff engaged in prostitution with Jenkins nor suggests that HBO  intended or endorsed such an implication. Id. at 21-22. Defendant recounts that after opening the dancer  Page 11 of 17 exits the stage, Jenkins tells her it's an ""honor"" to meet her. ECF 8-1 at 13. The dancer takes  Jenkins's hand and leads him toward the private rooms. Id. Jenkins ""high-fives a security guard.""  According to HBO, no other conversation occurs between the dancer and Jenkins.  Id. Moreover, no sexual activity is depicted. HBO states, id.: ""Instead, only eighteen seconds after  opening the door to the private [*28]  room, Jenkins comes bursting out fully dressed-not even adjusting any  item of clothing-and insists that the group leave right away."" 21 According to defendant, ""it is a matter of constitutional  law that where a plaintiff alleges a claim for defamation  by implication, the work in question must not only  'reasonably . . . impart the false innuendo,"" but also  'affirmatively suggest that the author intends or  endorses the inference.'"" Id. at 22 (quoting Chapin v.  Knight-Ridder, 993 F.2d 1087, 1092-93 (4th Cir. 1993)).  Defendant  asserts  that  ""nothing  in  the  Series  affirmatively suggests that HBO intended to convey th[e]  implication"" that plaintiff engaged in prostitution with  Jenkins. ECF 8-1 at 22. Instead, defendant claims that  ""th[e] Scene is set up like numerous others throughout  the Series-many of which occur in the very same  episode-where Jenkins shamelessly lies and boasts,  while the audience watches a different reality unfold  onscreen than the one he is describing."" Id. HBO's argument concerning plaintiff's defamation claim  also contains a subsection with the heading: ""Courts  Provide Broad Protection for Docudramas."" Id. at 17.  Citing several cases in which courts have considered  allegedly [*29]  defamatory docudramas, defendant  maintains that reasonable viewers generally understand  that docudramas are not accurate as to every particular. See id. at 17-19. According to defendant, ""[w]hen  analyzing  defamation  claims  involving  scripted  docudramas like this one, courts assume viewers are  'sufficiently familiar with this genre to avoid assuming  that all statements within them represent assertions of  verifiable facts.'"" Id. at 18 (quoting Partington v. Bugliosi,  56 F.3d 1147, 1554-55 (9th Cir. 1995)). In defendant's  view, ""[t]hat is particularly true here, where the work in  question contains a disclaimer acknowledging that the  work  contains  elements  of  fictionalization  and  dramatization."" ECF 8-1 at 19 n.3. Defendant also  asserts, more categorically, that ""lines of dialogue  spoken by characters in a docudrama 'should not be  interpreted as the actual statements of the speaker to  whom they are attributed.'"" Id. at 19 (citing Masson v.  New Yorker Magazine, 501 U.S. 496, 512-13 (1991)). 22 Nonetheless, HBO acknowledges that the status of the  Series as a docudrama-a dramatized depiction of real events-does not, in itself,  disqualify the Series from serving as the basis of a defamation claim. ECF 8-1 at 19 (""[T]here is  not a wholesale 'docudrama exception' to defamation  .  .  .  ."").  Therefore,  defendant's  contention [*30]  that ""Courts Provide Broad Protection  for Docudramas""  does  not  appear  to  advance  an  independent ground for dismissing the defamation claim. Instead, the argument in this subsection appears  to complement defendant's assertions in the other subsections that dismissal is warranted  because the Scene does not purport to state an ""actual fact,"" id. at 19, or reasonably imply that plaintiff  engaged in prostitution. Id. at 21. In her Opposition, plaintiff argues, first, that the  elements of fiction present in the Series do not immunize its creators from liability for  defamation. ECF 16 at 5. According to plaintiff, ""[t]he Maryland Court of Special Appeals specifically  recognized that defamation could arise from a work of fiction in"" Publish Am., LLP v. Stern, 216 Md.  App. 82, 99, 84 A.3d 237, 247 (2014). ECF 16 at 10. 6 As plaintiff observes, id. at 10-11, in  Stern, 216 Md. App. at 99, 84 A.3d at 247, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals said: A libel[] may be published of an actual person by a story  or essay, novel, play or moving picture that is intended  to deal only with fictitious characters if the characters or  plot bear such a resemblance to actual persons or  Page 12 of 17 events as to make it reasonable for its readers or  audience to understand that a particular character is  intended to portray that person. . . . The fact [*31]  that  the author or producer states that his work is exclusively  one of fiction and in no sense applicable to living  persons is not decisive if readers actually and  reasonably understand otherwise. 6 In Maryland's general election of November 2022, the  voters  of  Maryland  approved  a  constitutional  amendment to change the name of the State's highest  court, the Maryland Court of Appeals, to the Supreme  Court of Maryland. And, the voters also approved  changing the name of the Maryland Court of Special  Appeals, the State's intermediate appellate court, to the  Appellate Court of Maryland. These changes went into  effect on December 14, 2022. See Press Release,  Maryland Courts, Voter-approved constitutional change  renames high courts to Supreme and Appellate Court of  Maryland (Dec. 14, 2022), https://perma.cc/DH62- 7N7M. However, to avoid confusion, I will refer to the  Maryland courts by the names that were in effect when  the cited cases were decided. 23 Plaintiff asserts that the allegations in the Complaint  leave ""no doubt that the little-person, exotic dancer in  the Series is Shanea Daniel."" ECF 16 at 11. Second, plaintiff argues that, contrary to HBO's  assertion that courts afford ""broad protection"" [*32]  to  docudramas, ECF 8-1 at 17, the law recognizes ""no  special dispensation [from defamation liability] for  docudramas."" ECF 16 at 14. According to plaintiff, in  each of the cases cited by defendant to illustrate the  supposedly  ""broad  protection""  courts  afford  to  docudramas, the defamation claim at issue failed  because it did not satisfy ""one of the specific elements""  of defamation, not because it concerned a work that  was ""part of the docudrama genre."" Id. at 12. Therefore,  in plaintiff's view, ""HBO has merely pulled together a list  of  cases  where  [defamation  claims  based  on]  docudramas happened to fail"" for reasons unrelated to  the fact that that the works at issue were docudramas.  Id. at 14. Third, plaintiff maintains that, with respect to the first  element of her defamation claim, defamatory meaning,  the Scene ""involves statements that a reasonable finder  of fact could easily interpret as derogatory. Id. at 16. In  particular, according to plaintiff, ""[t]he Series explicitly  states that Wayne Jenkins attempted to have sex with  Shanea Daniel, necessarily implying that she engaged  in prostitution, engaged in voluntary sexual contact with  a man she met just minutes before, or was sexually  assaulted [*33]  by Sgt. Jenkins."" Id. Citing the Maryland  Court of Appeals's statement in Batson, 325 Md. at 723,  602 A.2d at 1210-11, that it ""is a question of fact for the  jury"" whether words ""capable of a defamatory meaning""  are, in fact, defamatory, plaintiff asserts: ""[T]his Court  does not have the power to dismiss Plaintiff's  defamation claims as a matter of law and must submit  the question of whether HBO's publication was  derogatory to a jury."" ECF 16 at 16. 24 Fourth, plaintiff argues that Jenkins's statement that he  had sexual contact with the character representing  plaintiff, when considered in the context of the Scene,  must be understood as a statement of actual fact. See  id. at 17-23. Plaintiff acknowledges that ""the character  based on Wayne Jenkins is certainly written to be  disreputable."" Id. at 17. Nonetheless, according to  plaintiff, ""one of the main themes of the Series"" is that  Jenkins cultivated a ""circle of trust"" with other officers  complicit in his wrongdoing. Id. Plaintiff suggests that,  because the character identified as Jenkins made the  allegedly defamatory statement to officers in this ""circle  of trust,"" that statement can be reasonably considered  one of actual fact, notwithstanding Jenkins's general  tendency to mendacity. [*34]  See id. at 18. Plaintiff  also  objects  to  HBO's  purported  ""characteriz[ation]"" of the defamation ""as limited to a few  lines"" spoken by Jenkins. Id. at 19. In plaintiff's view, the  defamatory  implication  arises  from  the  Scene  considered in its totality. Id. Therefore, according to  plaintiff, the Court's assessment of whether the Scene  implies as an ""actual fact"" that plaintiff engaged in  prostitution with Jenkins should not be limited to the  words spoken by Jenkins. Id. Instead, the Court must  account, inter alia, for the fact that the Scene depicts  plaintiff ""actually leading Sgt. Jenkins into the VIP room""  where his encounter with plaintiff occurred. Id. In its Reply (ECF 17), HBO reiterates that dismissal is  warranted because ""the hyperbolic boasts by"" Jenkins,  ""a character known to be a serial liar[,] cannot  reasonably be interpreted as a factually accurate  account of what happened with the dancer offscreen.""  Id. at 3. HBO offers several reasons why Jenkins's  ""boasts"" about sexual contact with plaintiff should be  considered ""facially implausible."" Id. at 9. For example, HBO contends that Jenkins's statement  that he ended the sexual encounter with plaintiff  Page 13 of 17 because he could not ""fit [*35]  inside"" her is facially  implausible, because it depends on 25 the ""physiologically false"" premise that ""a normal-size[d]  man cannot have sexual relations with a little person.""  Id. at 8. In addition, in HBO's view, ""Jenkins bursting out  of the room less than 20 seconds after entering it, fully  dressed, can[not] be squared with a sexual encounter.""  Id. at 9. Moreover, according to HBO, Jenkins admits  that no sexual encounter occurred when, after he has  fled from the club, he states to the other officers: ""I'll tell  you happened . . . I grabbed her . . . money and I bailed . . . out."" Id. at 10. HBO also renews its argument that it cannot be  considered to have ""'intend[ed] or endorse[ed]' the  various [defamatory] implications Plaintiff claims [the  boasts] convey."" ECF 17 at 3-4. As noted, HBO asserts  that, ""[w]here a plaintiff alleges a claim for defamation  by implication"" from a depiction of true facts, ""the work  in question must not only 'reasonably . . . impart the false innuendo,' but also 'affirmatively  suggest that the author intends or endorses the  inference.'"" Id. at 13 (quoting Chapin, 993 F.3d at 1092- 93). According to HBO, plaintiff concedes that all events  depicted in the Scene, except [*36]  for Jenkins's  statements that he had sexual contact with plaintiff,  actually occurred. Id. at 13. Therefore, HBO claims that  the defamatory implication ""arise[s],"" if at all, ""from the  combination of those true facts and the 'five seconds' of  hyperbole"" spoken by Jenkins. Id. at 14. In HBO's view,  plaintiff's allegations provide no basis for concluding  that, by depicting the events in the Scene, HBO  ""intend[ed] or endorse[d] the inference"" that plaintiff was  engaged in prostitution with Jenkins. Id. at 13-14; see  Chapin, 993 F.3d at 1092-93. Finally, according to HBO, it does not advocate ""some  kind of 'special protection' or 'special dispensation' for  docudramas,"" as plaintiff maintains. ECF 17 at 7  (quoting ECF 16 at 12, 14). Instead, HBO's claim is  simply that, ""under the First Amendment and the  governing case law, no matter the type of work, in every  defamation case, the nature and 'general tenor' of that 26 work is always relevant to a court's assessment of  whether it reasonably conveys the meaning alleged.""  ECF 17 at 6. 4. As noted, ""[u]nder Maryland law, a properly pleaded  defamation claim is accompanied by specific facts  establishing the following four elements: '(1) that the  defendant made a defamatory statement [*37]  to a third  person, (2) that the statement was false, (3) that the  defendant was legally at fault in making the statement,  and (4) that the plaintiff thereby suffered harm.'"" Baker- Proctor, 2023 WL 1801932, at *2 (quoting Piscatelli, 424  Md. at 306, 35 A.3d at 1147). Defendant offers two grounds for concluding that  plaintiff did not plausibly allege the first element of  defamation, ""that the defendant made a defamatory  statement to a third person."" Baker-Proctor, 2023 WL  1801932, at *2 (internal quotation marks and citation  omitted).  First,  defendant  claims  that  Jenkins's  statements  cannot  reasonably  be  considered  statements of ""actual fact."" ECF 8-1 at 19-21; ECF 17 at  8-13. Second, defendant claims that there is no basis  for concluding that HBO intended or endorsed the  inference that plaintiff engaged in sexual contact with  Jenkins. ECF 8-1 at 21-22; ECF 17 at 13-14. HBO does  not appear to contest that plaintiff has adequately  alleged the remaining three elements of defamation:  falsity, fault, and harm. See Baker-Proctor, 2023 WL  1801932, at *2. I do not agree with HBO that the statements alleged by  plaintiff to be suggestive of sexual contact with Jenkins- e.g., Jenkins's statement that he ""couldn't fit inside of  her""-cannot reasonably be considered statements of  actual fact. At this stage of the litigation, it is not for the  Court to [*38]  decide the best or most likely  interpretation of these statements. Instead, the Court's  task is to determine whether the statements can  ""reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts."" Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1, 2 (1990). 27 In my view, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that  Jenkins, despite his tendency to exaggerate or lie, was  truthfully recounting his encounter with plaintiff when he  made the statements in question. Jenkins and the  character depicting plaintiff are shown heading to a  room together after Jenkins repeatedly states his  intention to ""fuck"" this character. After Jenkins leaves  the room, he tells his companions that that he ""couldn't  fit inside of"" the character portraying plaintiff. A  reasonable factfinder could conclude from these  statements that Jenkins sought to engage in sex with  Page 14 of 17 plaintiff; that plaintiff was willing to engage in sex with  Jenkins; and that some form of sexual contact between  them occurred. To be sure, defendant offers several reasons why, in its  view, Jenkins's statements should not be regarded as  statements of actual fact. For example, defendant  suggests that Jenkins's statement that he ""couldn't fit  inside of her"" cannot reasonably be considered a true  description  of  events, [*39]   because  it  is  ""physiologically false"" that ""a normal-size[d] man cannot  have sexual relations with a little person."" ECF 17 at 8.  Moreover, according to defendant, it is implausible that  Jenkins would have left the room fully clothed after  having a sexual encounter with plaintiff. Id. at 9. These supposed inconsistencies might affect a  factfinder's view of what is the best interpretation of  Jenkins's statements. However, they do not establish as  a matter of law that the only reasonable interpretation of  the statements is the one urged by defendant, namely,  that the statements were untruthful boasts. In support of its argument that Jenkins's statements do  not concern actual facts, defendant cites John E. Reid &  Assocs., 2020 WL 1330657 (N.D. Ill. 2020), and  Brodeur v. Atlas Ent., Inc., 248 Cal. App. 4th 665  (2016). ECF 8-1 at 19-20. These cases do not compel  the conclusion advocated by HBO. 28 In Reid, 2020 WL 1330657, the plaintiff, a company that  ""owne[d] . . . the trademarked method for interviewing  criminal suspects called the Reid Technique,"" alleged  that it was defamed by a scene in the television series  When They See Us, in which a prosecutor states that  the ""Reid Technique has been universally rejected."" Id.  at *1. The court ruled that this statement was not  defamatory because it could not be considered a  statement [*40]  of actual fact. Id. The court explained:  ""To ensure that public debate does not suffer for lack of  'imaginative expression' and 'rhetorical hyperbole,' the  First Amendment protects from defamation liability any  statement that 'cannot reasonably be interpreted as  stating actual facts.'"" Id. at *7 (quoting Milkovich, 497  U.S. at 2). ""'[L]oose language' and 'undefined slogans'- like saying something is 'unfair' or 'fascist,' or calling  someone a 'traitor,' or accusing someone of blackmail- do not necessarily amount to falsifications of fact."" Reid,  2020 WL 1330657, at *7 (quoting Old Dominion Branch  No. 496,Nat Ass'n of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO v. Austin,  418 U.S. 264, 284 (1974)) (citation omitted). According  to the court, ""[w]hen the prosecutor [says] . . . that the  Reid Technique has been 'universally rejected,' he is  using the kind of loose, hyperbolic rhetoric that is a  protected part of the nation's discourse."" Reid, 2020 WL  1330657, at *7 (citation omitted). In other words, the  statement at issue in Reid was nothing more than ""non- verifiable hyperbole."" Id. at *8. The same cannot be said of Jenkins's statements that  plaintiff ""was on top of [him] for like five seconds"" and  that he ""couldn't fit inside of her."" These words, perhaps  colorful, could nonetheless be understood to mean that  the two attempted to have sex and had some form of  sexual contact. And, in contrast to terms such as [*41]   ""unfair"" or ""fascist,"" Jenkins's statements cannot be  characterized as value judgments. See Reid, 2020 WL  1330657, at *7. In Brodeur, 248 Cal. App. 4th 665, the plaintiff, Paul  Brodeur, was ""a well-known author in the environmental  field"" whose work has described the health dangers  posed by microwave 29 ovens. Id. at 669. He alleged in a California state court  that he was defamed by a scene in the film American Hustle in which a character named Rosalyn  attributes to Brodeur the view that microwaves ""take all  the nutrition out of . . . food."" Id. at 670. The court  determined that ""Rosalyn's comment in the microwave  oven scene . . . is not reasonably susceptible of a  defamatory meaning"" under California law. Id. at 680.  According to the court, ""the general tenor of American  Hustle, the entirely farcical nature of the 'science oven'  scene, and the ditzy nature of the character uttering the  allegedly defamatory statement, all indicate that an  audience would not expect anything Rosalyn says to  reflect objective fact."" Id. at 681. In this case, the Show is a docudrama depicting real  events involving a rogue police unit in a generally  serious tone. It is certainly not a farce. Nor is the Scene,  in particular, a farce. And, although Jenkins as depicted  in  the  Series  is  boastful [*42]   and  given  to  exaggeration, I cannot say ""that an audience would not  expect anything [he] says to reflect objective fact""- especially when what Jenkins says is consistent with  other elements of the Scene that are clearly intended to  be factual. See Brodeur, 248 Cal. App. 4th at 681. In short, the  ""entirely farcical"" scene considered in Brodeur bears  little resemblance to the Scene at issue here. See id.  Page 15 of 17 For that reason, Brodeur is not a reliable guide to my  interpretation of Jenkins's remarks or the Scene more  generally. In sum, I conclude that Jenkins's statements suggesting  that he engaged in sexual contact with plaintiff can be  reasonably considered statements of actual fact.  Therefore, defendant's first proposed ground for  dismissal of the defamation claim is unavailing. I turn to defendant's second proposed ground for  dismissal: that the Scene does not reasonably imply that  Jenkins engaged in sexual contact with plaintiff and,  even if the Scene did so imply, that HBO did not intend  or endorse such an implication. ECF 8-1 at 21-22; ECF  17 at 13-14. 30 In my view, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that  the Scene implies that Jenkins engaged in prostitution  with plaintiff. As the scene begins, Jenkins repeatedly  states his intention [*43]  to ""fuck"" the character  allegedly portraying plaintiff. Then, plaintiff is shown  entering a room with Jenkins. After Jenkins leaves the  room and flees the club, he states to his companions:  ""[T]hat little fucking mini-me motherfucker was on top of  me for like five seconds. I couldn't fit inside of her. So I  knew that shit wasn't gonna happen so I just dumped  the runt on the ground . . . ."" Jenkins also states: ""I  grabbed her fucking money and bailed the fuck out . . .  Hey look, it's like twice as much as I fucking gave her.""  A reasonable factfinder could readily conclude on the  basis of these statements that Jenkins had some form  of sexual contact with plaintiff in exchange for money. HBO asserts that, even if the Scene does reasonably  imply prostitution on the part of plaintiff, HBO cannot be  liable for this defamatory implication because, under  Chapin, 993 F.2d at 1092-93, nothing in the Scene  ""'affirmatively suggest[s] that [HBO] intends or endorses  th[at] inference.'"" ECF 8-1 at 22 (quoting Chapin, 993  F.2d at 1092-93). The rule from Chapin that defendant  invokes provides, more fully, 993 F.2d at 1092  (emphasis added) (citing White v.Fraternal Order of  Police, 909 F.2d 512, 520 (D.C. Cir. 1990)): [B]ecause the [C]onstitution provides a sanctuary  for [*44]  truth,[] a libel-by-implication plaintiff must make  an especially rigorous showing where the expressed  facts areliterally true. The language must not only be  read to impart the false innuendo, but it must also  affirmatively suggest that the author intends or endorses  the inference. In Chapin, the plaintiffs operated a charity that sent  packages of snack food, purchased with donated  money, to American soldiers in Saudi Arabia. Id. at  1091. After a newspaper article reported, inter alia, that  the wholesale cost of these packages was substantially  less than the price charged to donors, the plaintiffs sued  for defamation. Id. They alleged ""that the reporting of  these true facts"" about the significant markup charged to  donors was ""intended to convey the false impression  that [the plaintiffs] lined their pockets,"" that is, that they  embezzled some of the 31 donated money. Id. at 1095. The Fourth Circuit  disagreed. Id. In the Court's view, ""[t]he article simply  invite[d] inquiry about the mark-up""-but it did not  ""intend[] or endorse[]"" the implication that the plaintiff  embezzled donated money. Id. Unlike the plaintiff in Chapin, plaintiff in this case does  not allege that the defamatory meaning [*45]  of the  Scene  arises  from  ""literally  true""  depictions  or  statements of fact. To be sure, plaintiff acknowledges  that several elements of the Scene are true depictions  of the events in question. For example, plaintiff did  dance at the Millstream Inn; plaintiff did enter a ""VIP  room"" with Jenkins; and Jenkins did rob plaintiff. ECF 16  at 19. Nonetheless, plaintiff asserts that Jenkins's  statements that he wanted to ""fuck"" the character  depicting plaintiff and that he ""couldn't fit inside of her""  were ""embellish[ments],"" ECF 1, ¶ 21, intended ""to  sensationalize the story and enhance the entertainment  value of the Series."" ECF 16 at 23. To ""embellish"" a story is to ""heighten [it] with fictitious  additions.""  Embellish,  Oxford  English  Dictionary,  https://doi.org/10.1093/OED/7537505685 (last visited  Nov. 30, 2023). Therefore, I understand plaintiff to  allege that Jenkins's purportedly defamatory statements  were ""fictitious additions"" to an otherwise substantially  true depiction of real events. In my view, the alleged presence in the Scene of  allegedly defamatory ""fictitious additions"" removes  plaintiff's claim of defamation by implication from the  ambit of Chapin. HBO does not provide viewers [*46]   with an entirely factual depiction of the events and then  ""simply invite[]"" the viewers to wonder about what  happened offscreen. Chapin, 993 F.2d at 1095. Instead,  according to the Complaint, HBO adds to the otherwise  factual Scene certain fictitious statements that ""invite""  one conclusion in particular about what happened  between Jenkins and plaintiff: that plaintiff had some  Page 16 of 17 form of sexual contact with Jenkins in exchange for  money. 32 In sum, I conclude that the Scene could be reasonably  interpreted to imply that plaintiff had sexual contact with  Jenkins in exchange for money. Further, I conclude that,  because the alleged defamatory implication arises  largely from allegedly fictitious statements made by  Jenkins, Chapin provides no basis for concluding that HBO  neither  intended  nor  endorsed  the  defamatory  implication plaintiff alleges. 5. Having determined that defendant's two proposed  grounds for dismissal of the defamation claim are  unavailing, I conclude without difficulty that plaintiff has  adequately alleged the four elements of defamation  under Maryland law. First, plaintiff has adequately alleged that defendant  made a ""defamatory statement to a third person."" Baker- Proctor, 2023 WL 1801932, at *2; see ECF 1, ¶¶ 20- 24. [*47]  The ""statement"" in this case is the Scene in its  entirety, which a reasonable factfinder could understand  to imply that plaintiff engaged in sexual contact with  Jenkins in exchange for money. To imply that plaintiff  engaged in prostitution is defamatory in the relevant  sense, because the exchange of sexual contact for  money is a crime under Maryland law. See Md. Code  (2021 Repl. Vol., 2022 Supp.), § 11-303(a) of the  Criminal Law Article. And, ""accusing someone of  criminal behavior is actionable as defamation per se.""  Solomon Found., 2023 WL 3058321, at * 4 (citing  Shapiro, 105 Md. App. at 775, 661 A.2d at 218). In  addition, plaintiff has alleged that defendant made the  allegedly defamatory statement ""to a third person,""  Baker-Proctor, 2023 WL 1801932, at *2, because,  according to the Complaint, ""[d]efendant published the  false statement to a worldwide audience by releasing  the [Series] on the HBO cable Network and HBO- controlled online streaming services."" ECF 1, ¶ 35. 33 Plaintiff has also adequately alleged the second and  third elements of defamation, falsity and fault. See  Baker-Proctor, 2023 WL 1801932, at *2. In particular,  plaintiff has alleged ""that the statement was false,"" ECF  1, ¶¶ 19, 25, 32, and that defendant's portrayal of  plaintiff was ""negligent[]."" Id. ¶ 33, 39-40. Finally, plaintiff has adequately alleged that she  ""suffered harm"" from the alleged defamation. See  Baker-Proctor, 2023 WL 1801932, at *2. According to  plaintiff, ""[t]he false [*48]  statement has caused the  Plaintiff serious financial harm by diminishing her ability  to apply her trade and other job prospects."" ECF 1, ¶  37. In addition, plaintiff alleges that ""[t]he false  statement has . . . caused [her] serious emotional  distress in the form of embarrassment, aggravation, and  strained interpersonal relationships."" Id. ¶ 38. Therefore, I conclude that plaintiff has stated a claim for  defamation. B. False Light (Count 2) ""'[T]o establish a successful claim for false light invasion  of privacy, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant [1]  gave publicity to a matter concerning another that  places the other before the public in a false light, [2] that  the false light in which the other person was placed  would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and  [3] that 'the actor had knowledge of or acted in reckless  disregard as to the falsity of the publicized matter and  the false light in which the other would be placed.'"" Kaur  v. Pollack, SAG-21-00292, 2023 WL 3093405, at *12  (D. Md. Apr. 26, 2023) (quoting Hill v. Hunt, CCB-20- 3746, 2022 WL 704001, at *6 (D. Md. March 9, 2022));  seealso Watkins v. Carr, PX-17-0819, 2018 WL  6570686, at *4 (D. Md. Dec. 13, 2018) (quoting Bagwell v. Peninsula Reg'l Med. Ctr., 106 Md. App. 470,  514, 665 A.2d 297, 318-319 (1995)) (Hollander, J.). 34 Although defendant claims that plaintiff fails to state a  claim for false light invasion of privacy, defendant does  not identify which of the three elements of the false light  tort plaintiff fails to allege. [*49]  ECF 8-1 at 22-23.  Instead, citing the rule that ""a claim for false light . . .  may not stand unless the claim also meets the  standards for defamation,"" Crowley v. Fox Broad. Co.,  851 F. Supp. 700, 704 (D. Md. 1994), defendant asserts  that, ""[b]ecause the Complaint fails to state a claim for  defamation, the false light claim must also be  dismissed."" ECF 8-1 at 23. In her Opposition, plaintiff  asserts the inverse: that because the Complaint does  state a claim for defamation, it also states a claim for  false light invasion of privacy. ECF 16 at 23-24. Because the Complaint states a claim for defamation,  Page 17 of 17 the rule from Crowley, 851 F. Supp. at 704, cited by  defendant, does not provide a basis for dismissal of the  false light claim. On the other hand, I am not aware of  any authority for the proposition urged by plaintiff, i.e.,  that a complaint stating a claim for defamation  necessarily states a claim for false light invasion of  privacy. In any event, I am satisfied that plaintiff has adequately  alleged the three elements of the false light tort. In  particular, according to the Complaint, plaintiff ""gave  publicity"" to the Scene by ""publish[ing] [it] to a worldwide  audience by releasing the Show on the HBO cable  Network and HBO-controlled online streaming services.""  ECF 1, ¶ 35. [*50]  The Scene is alleged to have placed  plaintiff in a ""false light"" by implying that she engaged in  prostitution with Jenkins. Id. ¶ 45. The Scene's  purported  implication  that  plaintiff  engaged  in  prostitution would be ""highly offensive to a reasonable  person."" Kaur, 2023 WL 3093405, at *12. Finally,  plaintiff has alleged that, ""[i]n portraying Plaintiff in a  false light, Defendant[] acted in reckless disregard for  the truth and with reckless disregard for Plaintiff's  privacy interests."" ECF 1, ¶ 47. 35 C. Negligence (Count 3) A ""claim for negligent publication"" is, ""however cast,  simply a claim for libel."" Tani v.Wash. Post, PJM-08- 1130, 2009 WL 8652384, at *2 (D. Md. June 18,  2009),aff'd 352 F. App'x 792 (4th Cir. 2009) (citing  Zeran v. America Online, Inc., 129 F.3d 327 (4th Cir.  1997)). That is, under Maryland law, ""there is no  separate claim for negligent publication"" when a plaintiff  has already alleged defamation. Tani, 2009 WL  8652384, at *2; see also D & A Designs LLC v.  FoxTelevision Stations, LLC, JKB-20-2993, 2021 WL  100803, at * 6 (D. Md. Jan. 12 2021). ""As a matter of judicial economy, courts should dismiss  a claim if it is duplicative of another claim in the same  suit."" Wultz v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 755 F. Supp. 2d  1, 81 (D. D.C. 2010); see also W. Veg-Produce, Inc. v.  The Lexy Group, 2018 WL 1804689, at *5 (C.D. Cal.  Apr. 16, 2018) (""'A court may dismiss duplicative claims  in its discretion.'"") (quoting DTCC Data Repository (U.S.) LLC v. U.S. Commodity  Futures Trading Comm'n, 25 F. Supp. 3d 9, 18 (D. D.C.  2014)). Plaintiff's claim is most appropriately addressed as a  claim of defamation. To avoid confusion and the burden  associated with duplicate claims, and to avoid the need  to pare the claims at a later time, I shall dismiss Count  Three, as duplicative.",1
"Doe v. Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503","OPINION AND ORDER JED S. RAKOFF, U.S.D.J.: The plaintiffs in these three related cases are two  anonymous women, referred to here as ""JPM Jane Doe""  and [*4]  ""DB Jane Doe,"" and the Government of the  United States Virgin Islands (the ""USVI""). Plaintiffs claim  that defendants JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (""JP  Morgan"") and the related entities Deutsche Bank  Aktiengesellschaft, Deutsche Bank AG New York  Branch, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas  (collectively, ""Deutsche Bank"") are legally liable for their  alleged facilitation of Jeffrey Epstein's sex crimes. On February 1, 2023, and February 7, 2023, defendants  filed motions to dismiss the operative complaints in each  case. After full consideration of the parties' written  submissions and oral arguments, the Court granted  those motions in part and denied those motions in part  by a ""bottom-line order"" dated March 20, 2023. This  Opinion reconfirms the Court's rulings and explains the  reasoning behind them. I. Plaintiffs' Allegations  A. Jeffrey Epstein's Sex-Trafficking Operation Plaintiffs allege that between 2006 and 2018, DB Jane  Doe and JPM Jane Doe were Jeffrey Epstein's sex  slaves. He raped them repeatedly, and he sexually [*5]   abused them in other ways as well. JPM Jane Doe FAC,  ¶ 99; DB Jane Doe FAC, ¶ 128. He kept them in his  thrall through a combination of promises, payments, and  threats: promises to advance their careers and  educations, payments in cash and in kind, and threats to  destroy them if they did not obey his demands. JPM  Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 70, 96, 111; DB Jane Doe FAC, ¶  139, 143. These Jane Does were not alone. Plaintiffs allege that  beginning in 1998 and continuing until 2019, over two  decades later, Epstein ran an organization that recruited  hundreds of young women and girls and coerced them  into performing sex acts. JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 62, 67,  76; DB Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 39, 40, 88. Typically, Epstein  would lure a victim to one of his residences by  promising to grant a wish, would then pressure her into  performing massages that became increasingly sexual,  and then would force her to participate in sex acts on a  continuing basis. JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶ 66; DB Jane  Doe FAC, ¶ 107. Cash was the lifeblood of Epstein's operation. Victims  were paid hundreds of dollars, in cash, each time  Epstein abused them; and they were also paid hundreds  of dollars, in cash, for each additional victim that they  recruited. [*6]  JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 66, 68; DB Jane  Doe FAC, ¶¶ 52-53, 115. At times, plaintiffs allege,  Epstein dispensed thousands of dollars in cash every           2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *2 Page 9 of 23 day to his victims, amounting to, on average $200,000  per year. DB Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 54, 280-81; USVI FAC,  ¶ 80. Epstein could not have run his operation, plaintiffs  claim, without ready access to cash through the banking  system. B. JP Morgan's Alleged Involvement JP Morgan began to serve as Jeffrey Epstein's principal  bank as early as 1998. JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶ 41; USVI  FAC, ¶ 41. Eventually, both Epstein and at least a  dozen entities affiliated with Epstein and his operation  maintained bank accounts with JP Morgan. USVI FAC,  ¶ 27. These accounts, plaintiffs allege, were highly  lucrative for JP Morgan and essential to Jeffrey  Epstein's sex-trafficking operation. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that JP Morgan supported  Epstein's sex-trafficking operation in four different ways.  First, they allege that JP Morgan enabled Epstein to  access the large quantities of cash that fueled his  operation. JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶ 45; USVI FAC, ¶ 103.  Second, they allege that JP Morgan assisted Epstein  with ""structuring"" his cash withdrawals so as to elude  suspicion. [*7]  JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶ 179; USVI FAC,  ¶ 67. Third, plaintiffs allege that JP Morgan did not  timely file suspicious activity reports (""SARs"") that would  have alerted authorities to Jeffrey Epstein's sex- trafficking operation. JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 180-81;  USVI FAC, ¶¶ 74-75. In particular, plaintiffs allege that  JP Morgan delayed filing SARs for ""thousands of  transactions . . . totaling more than $1 billion, including  payments to dozens of women, often with Eastern  European surnames."" USVI FAC, ¶ 75. Finally, plaintiffs  allege that a JP Morgan subsidiary, Highbridge Capital  Management, transported young women and girls from  Florida to Epstein in New York, on the company's  private jet. JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶ 170. According to the plaintiffs, by no later than 2006, JP  Morgan either actually knew or should have known that  it was supporting a sexual predator. JPM Jane Doe  FAC, ¶¶ 190, 196. In 2006, police reports and news  articles revealed that Epstein had sexually abused  dozens of young women and girls. Id at 190. In 2008,  Epstein pled guilty to sex offenses, including soliciting a  minor for prostitution, and he registered as a sex  offender. USVI FAC, ¶ 38. Following Epstein's guilty  plea, dozens of public [*8]  lawsuits were filed against  him, which included detailed accusations of his sexual  abuse of young women and girls. JPM Jane Doe FAC,  ¶¶ 207-209. While JP Morgan allegedly was aware of  several of these accusations, JP Morgan nonetheless  continued to bank Epstein. USVI FAC, ¶ 44. After Epstein was released from prison, accusations that  he trafficked young women and girls continued to  surface. Plaintiffs allege that employees within JP  Morgan would occasionally report these accusations to  their superiors and would ask whether JP Morgan  should maintain its relationship with Epstein. In 2010, for  example, JP Morgan's risk management division  discussed new allegations against Epstein: ""See below  new allegations of an investigation related to child  trafficking — are you still comfortable with this client  who is now a registered sex offender?"" USVI FAC, ¶ 45.  In January 2011, JP Morgan's director of anti-money  laundering compliance requested re-approval for the  bank's relationship with Epstein from JP Morgan's then- General Counsel ""in light of the new allegations of  human trafficking . . ."" Id. at ¶ 46. And there were other alleged red flags. Epstein and/or  his associates are alleged to have [*9]  made significant  cash withdrawals from JP Morgan accounts with no  known payee. USVI FAC, ¶ 67. For example, Hyperion  Air, Inc. -- the Epstein-controlled company that owned  Epstein's private jet -- issued over $547,000 in checks  payable to cash purportedly for ""fuel expenses when  traveling to foreign countries."" Id. Additionally, JP  Morgan accounts in the name of Epstein's affiliated  charitable organizations made payments without a clear  connection to those organizations' charitable purposes.  For example, Epstein and/or his representative used the  C.O.U.Q. Foundation account to pay $29,464.66 to  three young women, including two people known to be  Epstein's victims. USVI FAC, ¶ 68. One final source of JP Morgan's alleged knowledge is  James (""Jes"") Staley. Circa 2000, Mr. Staley headed  JP Morgan's private banking division, and he began to  service Epstein's account. JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶ 131.  Mr. Staley is alleged to have developed a close  personal friendship with Epstein. Indeed, Mr. Staley  once wrote to Epstein, ""I deeply appreciate our  friendship. I have few so profound."" USVI FAC, ¶ 56.  Later, while Epstein was still a JP Morgan client, Mr.  Staley was promoted to be CEO of JP Morgan  Asset [*10]  Management. Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Staley had first-hand knowledge  of Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking operation. Mr. Staley       2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *6 Page 10 of 23 is alleged to have visited Epstein's residences several  times while that operation was ongoing, and, during  these visits, observed JPM Jane Doe ""as a sexual  trafficking and abuse victim."" JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶  115. On December 5, 2009, one day after Mr. Staley  visited Epstein in New York, Epstein emailed Mr. Staley  to say, ""you were with Larry, and I had to put up with . .  ."" and attached a picture of a young woman in a  sexually suggestive pose. USVI FAC, ¶ 58. On  December 20, 2009, Epstein sent to Mr. Staley an email  that consisted entirely of a picture of a young woman.  Id. at ¶ 59. Plaintiffs further allege that Mr. Staley himself abused  some of Epstein's victims, including JPM Jane Doe  herself. JPM Jane Doe claims that ""one of Epstein's  friends"" -- whom she later identified as Mr. Staley --  ""used aggressive force in his sexual assault of her and  informed [JPM Jane Doe] that he had Epstein's  permission to do what he wanted to her."" JPM Jane Doe  FAC, ¶ 107. And the USVI asserts that it possesses  email correspondence between Epstein and Mr.  Staley [*11]  which suggests, albeit cryptically, that Mr.  Staley had sexual encounters while visiting Epstein. In  July 2010, Mr. Staley emailed Epstein, ""That was fun.  Say hi to Snow White."" To which Epstein responded:  ""[W]hat character would you like next?"" Mr. Staley  answered: ""Beauty and the Beast."" USVI FAC, ¶ 61. C. Deutsche Bank's Alleged Involvement In 2013, a JP Morgan compliance officer terminated JP  Morgan's relationship with Epstein. USVI FAC, ¶ 63.  Epstein then went on the market for a new bank. Shortly before then, Paul Morris, a banker with JP  Morgan who had serviced Epstein's accounts, left JP  Morgan and joined Deutsche Bank. DB Jane Doe FAC,  at ¶ 202. Mr. Morris suggested to Deutsche Bank's  senior management that a relationship with Epstein  could be very lucrative: banking Epstein could generate  millions of dollars in fees, and it could also lead to  further relationships with Epstein's wealthy friends. Id. Deutsche Bank took on Epstein as a client on August  19, 2013. DB Jane Doe FAC, ¶ 210. Eventually,  Epstein, his related entities, and his associates opened  and funded more than 40 accounts at Deutsche Bank,  which held more than $110 million in assets. Id. at ¶  210.   DB Jane Doe alleges [*12]  that Epstein used his  Deutsche Bank accounts much as he did his accounts  with JP Morgan. He used them to withdraw cash to pay  off his victims and associates. Id. at ¶¶ 52-53, 115. He  solicited Deutsche Bank's advice about how to structure  his withdrawals so as to evade notice. Id. at ¶¶ 229-239.  And he was shielded by Deutsche Bank's failure to file  suspicious activity reports. Id. at ¶ 324. DB Jane Doe likewise alleges that Deutsche Bank either  knew or should have known that Epstein used his  Deutsche Bank accounts to power his sex-trafficking  operation. In April 2013, after Mr. Morris proposed  taking on Epstein as a client, a junior relationship  coordinator assigned to the Epstein account prepared a  memorandum which noted various risks posed by a  relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. This memorandum  noted that ""Epstein was charged with soliciting an  underage prostitution [sic] in 2007,"" that ""[h]e served 13  months out of his 18-month sentence,"" and that ""[h]e  was accused of paying young woman [sic] for massages  in his Florida home."" Id. at ¶ 52. Around the same time,  a  Deutsche  Bank  compliance  officer  performed  background checks on the beneficiaries of one of  Epstein's entities, the Butterfly [*13]  Trust. Id. at ¶ 216.  This check revealed that one of the beneficiaries, Sarah  Kellen, was named as one of Epstein's co-conspirators  in a related criminal case. Id. Once Deutsche Bank began to serve as Epstein's bank,  it allegedly continued to receive red flags. Between  2014 and 2015, DB's Anti-Financial Crime department  alerted DB's senior management to issues concerning  Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking. DB Jane Doe FAC, ¶  206. In May 2018, one of Deutsche Bank's compliance  officers asked a relationship manager assigned to  Epstein's account about payments to ""accounts of  women with Eastern European surnames at a Russian  Bank."" An accountant at Deutsche Bank, who was  looped into the conversation, replied that the money  was ""SENT TO A FRIEND FOR TUITION FOR  SCHOOL."" Id. at ¶ 226. The compliance officer did not  ask any follow-up questions, and the transaction was  cleared. Id. at ¶ 227. And Epstein's personal attorney  withdrew over $800,000 in cash on Epstein's behalf over  a four-year period, on multiple occasions asking about  the maximum amount that could be withdrawn without  triggering a reporting requirement. Id. at ¶¶ 231-32. The  attorney's only explanation for these withdrawals  was [*14]  that Epstein needed cash for travel, tipping,  and expenses. Id. D. Plaintiffs' Claims 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *10 Page 11 of 23 In total, plaintiffs assert 28 claims against the  defendants. Several of these claims are brought under  the federal Trafficking Victims Protection ACT (""TVPA"").  Others assert violations of the federal Racketeering  Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (""RICO"") and  the USVI's territorial-law analogue to RICO, the Virgin  Islands Criminally Influenced and Corrupt Organizations  Act (""CICO""). A final statutory claim alleges a violation of  the Virgin Islands Consumer Fraud and Deceptive  Business Practices Act (""CFDBPA""). Plaintiffs assert a  variety of state tort claims as well. II. Discussion HN1[ ] ""To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint  must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true,  to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'""  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937,  173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v.  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L.  Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). In reviewing a motion to dismiss,  the Court ""accept[s] the complaint's factual allegations  as true and draw[s] all reasonable inferences in the  plaintiff's favor."" Brown Media Corp. v. K&L Gates, LLP,  854 F.3d 150, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2017). The Court begins by discussing three threshold issues  that could, potentially, bar multiple claims asserted by  two of the plaintiffs. It then discusses each surviving  claim that defendants seek to dismiss. A. Threshold Issues [*15]  1. Release by Settlement Agreement On April 28, 2022, DB Jane Doe resolved her claims  against Jeffrey Epstein's estate by signing a settlement  agreement (the ""Settlement Agreement""). Deutsche  Bank was not a party to this agreement. Nonetheless,  Deutsche Bank argues that it is a third-party beneficiary  of that agreement, and that, as such, it is entitled under  the terms of that agreement to dismissal of the instant  claims. The first issue raised by Deutsche Bank's argument is  whether the Court may even entertain it at this juncture.  HN2[ ] Asserting that a plaintiff's claim is barred by  agreement is an affirmative defense, and affirmative  defenses usually cannot be considered on a motion to  dismiss. See, e.g., Deckard v. Gen. Motors Corp., 307  F.3d 556, 560 (7th Cir. 2002) (""A motion to dismiss was  improper since release is an affirmative defense, and  the existence of a defense does not undercut the  adequacy of the claim.""). Nonetheless, this bar is not  absolute. For example, the Court may consider any  affirmative defense that ""appears on the face of the  complaint."" Pani v. Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, 152  F.3d 67, 74 (2d Cir. 1998). More generally, the Court  retains discretion to consider even at this early stage an  affirmative defense that presents a straightforward issue  of law, such as a statute of limitations defense [*16]   where the relevant facts are not in dispute. See, e.g.,  Harris v. City of New York, 186 F.3d 243, 250 (2d Cir.  1999). While the Settlement Agreement is not mentioned in DB  Jane Doe's complaint, the Court finds nonetheless that  Deutsche Bank's argument is appropriately considered  at this stage. The authenticity of the Settlement  Agreement is not disputed, and neither party has  suggested that extrinsic evidence would inform the  Court's interpretation of it. Thus, Deutsche Bank's  argument presents an unfettered question of law that  can be resolved on a motion to dismiss and should not  be deferred. See Giuffre v. Andrew, 579 F. Supp. 3d  429, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2022) (considering a similar  settlement agreement on a motion to dismiss). Turning now to the merits of Deutsche Bank's argument,  the Court first notes that this argument succeeds only if  the parties to the Settlement Agreement intended for  Deutsche Bank to benefit from it. See Port Chester Elec.  Const. Co. v. Atlas, 40 N.Y.2d 652, 357 N.E.2d 983,  985-86, 389 N.Y.S.2d 327 (N.Y. 1976) (HN3[ ] ""It is old  law that a third party may sue as a beneficiary on a  contract made for his benefit. However, an intent to  benefit the third party must be shown . . . .""); Suffolk  Cnty. v. Long Island Lighting Co., 728 F.2d 52, 63 (2d  Cir. 1984) (""It is ancient law in New York that to succeed  on a third party beneficiary theory, a non-party must be  the intended beneficiary of the contract, not an  incidental beneficiary to whom no duty is owed.""); see  also [*17]  Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 302. In  general, such an intent can be found only when ""the  language of the contract . . . clearly evidences an intent  to permit enforcement by the third party."" Fourth Ocean  Putnam Corp. v. Interstate Wrecking Co., 66 N.Y.2d 38,  485 N.E.2d 208, 212, 495 N.Y.S.2d 1 (N.Y. 1985). Deutsche Bank claims that the Settlement Agreement  evidences such an intent because it is styled a ""broad  release"" of claims against ""any entities or individuals  who are or have ever been engaged by (whether as  independent contractors or otherwise), employed by, or  worked in any capacity for"" Jeffrey Epstein. See  Declaration of David B. Hennes in Supp. of Mot. to  Dismiss, Ex. A (""Settlement Agreement""), at p. 2. Since,  Deutsche Bank argues, DB Jane Doe's own theory of  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *14 Page 12 of 23 her case is that Deutsche Bank was both ""engaged by""  and in some sense ""worked . . . for"" Epstein, Deutsche  Bank is covered by the Settlement Agreement. But the terms ""engaged by"" and ""worked . . . for"" must  be read in the context of the agreement as a whole. And  another provision of the Settlement Agreement plainly  indicates that it was not intended to preclude claims  against financial institutions that provided services to  Epstein. Specifically, the Settlement Agreement states,  ""[T]he parties do not believe there is any reasonable  interpretation that this General [*18]  Release could be  construed to release James (""Jes"") Staley, Leon Black,  or their respective entity affiliations."" Settlement  Agreement, at p. 4 (emphasis supplied). Jes Staley was  employed by JP Morgan, which provided financial  services to Jeffrey Epstein. In effect, this demonstrates  the parties' agreement that the Settlement Agreement  was never intended to release claims against financial  institutions that provided services for Epstein and,  indeed, could not even be reasonably interpreted as  such. Read as a whole, therefore, the Settlement Agreement  does not ""clearly evidence"" an intent to benefit  Deutsche Bank. Thus, the Court finds that Deutsche  Bank is not a third-party beneficiary of that agreement,  and DB Jane Doe's claims are not barred by it. 2. Parens Patriae Standing                       The next two threshold issues concern whether the  USVI can assert claims under the TVPA. The first such  issue is whether the USVI has standing to assert such  claims. The USVI asserts that it has standing as parens patriae.  There can be no doubt that Congress intended to grant  it such standing. One section of the Trafficking Victims  Protection Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1595(d), reads: In any case in which the attorney general of a State  has reason to believe that [*19]  an interest of the  residents of that State has been or is threatened or  adversely affected by any person who violates  section 1591, the attorney general of the State, as  parens patriae, may bring a civil action against such  person on behalf of the residents of the State in an  appropriate district court of the United States to  obtain appropriate relief. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(d). Congress, however, does not have final word. HN4[ ]  Article III of the Constitution has been interpreted to  impose distinct requirements for standing to sue in  federal  court,  and  those  requirements  are  not  ""automatically"" satisfied ""whenever a statute grants a  person a statutory right and purports to authorize that  person to sue to vindicate that right."" Spokeo, Inc. v.  Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 341, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 194 L. Ed.  2d 635 (2016), as revised (May 24, 2016). To establish  Article III standing, any plaintiff must show (i) that he  suffered an injury in fact that is concrete, particularized,  and actual or imminent; (ii) that the injury was likely  caused by the defendant; and (iii) that the injury would  likely be redressed by judicial relief. TransUnion LLC v.  Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2203, 210 L. Ed. 2d 568  (2021). States and territories that seek to sue parens  patriae must also (1) allege an injury to a quasi- sovereign interest that affects a sufficiently substantial  segment of its population and (2) seek relief to the  territory's injury that [*20]  would be unavailable to  individual plaintiffs. See Alfred L. Snapp & Son Inc. v.  P.R. ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 607, 102 S. Ct. 3260,  73 L. Ed. 2d 995 (1982). Nonetheless, even though  Congress's creation of a statutory right of action does  not settle whether these requirements are satisfied, it is  ""instructive."" Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 341. ""Congress may  elevate harms that exist in the real world before  Congress recognized them to actionable legal status.""  Id. (cleaned up).   2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *17 Page 13 of 23 JP Morgan challenges the USVI's parens patriae  standing. It argues, first, that to the extent that the USVI  sues on behalf of Epstein's victims who resided in the  USVI, that interest is not ""distinct from the interests of  particular private parties"" and therefore cannot be a  basis for parens patriae standing. Def's Mem. of Law in  Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, at 6. But, second, to the extent  that the USVI seeks to vindicate a more generalized  interest -- such as an interest in ""assuring its residents it  will act to protect them from the harmful effects of  criminal sex-trafficking enterprises flourishing in the  Islands that are their home,"" Mem. of Law. in Opp. to  Def's Mot. to Dismiss, at pp. 9-10 -- this interest, JP  Morgan  says,  is  insufficiently  concrete  and  particularized. However, JP Morgan overstates the second objection.  The USVI's asserted [*21]  interest in ""assuring its  residents it will act to protect them from the harmful  effects of criminal sex-trafficking enterprises flourishing  in the Islands that are their home"" is indeed general (as  all interests that ground parens patriae standing must  be); but it directly parallels the interest that Puerto Rico  successfully asserted in Snapp, which was an interest in  ""assuring its residents that it will act to protect them from  . . . the harmful effects of discrimination."" Snapp, 458  U.S. at 609. Indeed, the similarities between the interest asserted by  the USVI here and that asserted by Puerto Rico in  Snapp are considerable. Like the discrimination that  was at stake in Snapp, sex-trafficking is a problem that  might well re-occur, especially in a remote an isolated  territory such as the USVI. Additionally, sex-trafficking is  a problem that the USVI would, if it could, ""likely attempt  to address through its sovereign lawmaking powers.""  Snapp, 458 U.S. at 607. Snapp remains a leading case -- perhaps the leading  case --on parens patriae standing. Since the interest  asserted by the USVI here is directly analogous to the  interest that provided parens patriae standing in Snapp,  the USVI has Article III standing. 3. Retroactivity of [*22]  18 U.S.C. § 1595(d) The last threshold issue, which similarly affects whether  the USVI can assert a TVPA claim, is whether the  applicable statutory provision, 18 U.S.C. § 1595(d)  applies retroactively. While the statute providing a  federal civil remedy for victims of sex trafficking, 18  U.S.C. § 1595, was mostly enacted in 2003, the ""parens  patriae"" subdivision, section 1595(d), was not added  until 2018, approximately five years after JP Morgan  terminated its relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. JP  Morgan argues that Section 1595(d) does not apply  retroactively and, therefore, does not provide the USVI  with a right to assert the parens patriae TVPA claim  alleged in the USVI's complaint. HN5[ ] As a general matter, federal courts apply a two- prong test to determine whether statutes apply  retroactively. Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244,  280, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1994); Velez v.  Sanchez, 693 F.3d 308, 324-25 (2d Cir. 2012). The first  step is to ask ""whether Congress has expressly  prescribed the statute's proper reach."" Landgraf, 511  U.S. at 280; Velez, 693 F.3d at 325. If Congress is  silent, a court must ask ""whether [the statute] would  impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase  a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties  with respect to transactions already completed.""  Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280; Velez, 693 F.3d at 325. Since Congress did not expressly indicate whether  section 1595(d) applies retroactively, the precise issue  before the Court is whether section 1595(d) increased  parties' liabilities [*23]  for past conduct to such an  extent that it does not apply retroactively. To address  that question, the Court must consider whether section  1595(d) so greatly increased the likelihood that  defendants would face suit that it is equivalent to a new  cause of action. HN6[ ] Section 1595(d) does not, in  itself, impose any legal liability; it merely allows a new  group of people -- state attorneys general -- to vindicate  liabilities that already existed. Cf. Hughes Aircraft Co. v.  U.S. ex rel. Schumer, 520 U.S. 939, 950, 117 S. Ct.  1871, 138 L. Ed. 2d 135 (1997), (distinguishing a statute  that ""essentially creates a new cause of action"" from  one that creates ""an increased likelihood that an existing  cause of action will be pursued""). Nonetheless, by  conferring a right of action on ""an expanded universe of  plaintiffs with different incentives,"" id. at 950, a statute  can so greatly increase the likelihood of suit that it is  functionally equivalent to a new cause of action.  Determining whether a statute does this demands ""a  commonsense, functional judgment about whether the  new provision attaches new legal consequences to  events completed before its enactment."" I.N.S. v. St.  Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 321, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d  347 (2001) (cleaned up). The Court's judgment should  be guided by ""familiar considerations of fair notice,  reasonable reliance, and settled expectations."" Martin v.  Hadix, 527 U.S. 343, 345, 119 S. Ct. 1998, 144 L. Ed.  2d 347 (1999). Applying this standard, the Court finds [*24]  that  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *20 Page 14 of 23 section 1595(d) applies retroactively. State attorneys  general do indeed have somewhat different incentives  to bring suit than private citizens; presumably, that is  one reason why Congress added section 1595(d). So  there likely will be some cases in which a state attorney  general files a civil action under the TVPA even though  individual victims of human trafficking would not. HN7[ ] But section 1595(d) only authorizes state  attorneys general to vindicate the interests of their  individual residents, acting as parens patriae. This limits  the incremental exposure of defendants in two ways.  First, section 1595(d) confers a right of action on only a  small number of new plaintiffs in each case: the  attorneys general of each state whose residents have  been harmed by a particular sex trafficking venture.  Second, and more important, the quasi-sovereign  interests that give states standing to sue under section  1595(d) are tied to injuries that would give individual  plaintiffs a right to sue under section 1595(a). For both  of these reasons, section 1595(d) increases the  likelihood of suit to a relatively small degree. A comparison to the facts of Hughes is instructive.  Hughes considered the inverse of the facts presented  here. Prior to a 1986 amendment, the False Claims Act  did not permit private relators to sue on behalf of  the [*25]  Government when their suits were based on  information already in the Government's possession. Id.  at 941. (The Government, by contrast, could sue on its  own behalf.) A 1986 amendment eliminated that  precondition for private parties to sue. Thus, the 1986  amendment to the False Claims Act enabled countless  private parties to sue under circumstances in which,  previously, only the Government could sue. The  statutory amendment considered in Hughes, therefore,  expanded the likelihood of suit dramatically. The Second Circuit's decision in Velez is not to the  contrary. In Velez, the Second Circuit rejected a  plaintiff's claim that the TVPA's private right of action --  18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) -- applies retroactively. Applying  this right of action retroactively, the Second Circuit held,  would ""represent[] a significant expansion of civil  liability."" Velez, 693 F.3d at 325; see also Hughes, 520  U.S. at 939 (""The extension of an FCA cause of action  to private parties in circumstances where the action was  previously foreclosed . . . essentially creates a new  cause of action . . . .""); Doe v. Siddig, 810 F.Supp.2d  127, 135 (D.D.C.2011) (rejecting the retroactive  applicability of 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) because it  ""represented a significant expansion of civil liability""). But there is a crucial difference between Velez and the  USVI's claim against JP Morgan. Before Congress  established [*26]  a private right of action under the  TVPA, the TVPA was a purely criminal statute. Thus,  when Congress added a private right of action to the  TVPA in 2003, it added civil liability to a statute that  previously only imposed criminal sanctions. That act did  indeed ""represent a significant expansion of civil  liability."" Velez, 693 F.3d at 325. By contrast, in 2018,  when Congress empowered state attorneys general to  assert TVPA claims, it merely gave a new set of  plaintiffs the right to vindicate potential liabilities which  already existed. Put another way, 18 U.S.C § 1595(d)  did not expand any party's liability; it merely made it  more likely that such liability would actually be  assessed. Cf. Hughes, 520 U.S. at 950 (distinguishing a  statute that ""essentially creates a new cause of action""  from one that creates ""an increased likelihood that an  existing cause of action will be pursued""). Velez,  therefore, does not control. B. TVPA Participation Liability Having disposed of these threshold issues, the Court  now turns to the plaintiffs' individual claims. Each  plaintiff claims that JP Morgan or Deutsche Bank  participated in Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking venture,  in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2). This claim  involves three elements. HN8[ ] First, the defendant  must have participated [*27]  in a commercial sex  trafficking venture. Second, the defendant must have  known (or recklessly disregarded) that force, fraud, or  coercion would be used in the sex-trafficking venture.  Finally, the defendant must have benefited from its  participation in the venture. 1. Participation JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank argue that they did not  participate in Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking venture  because they merely provided their usual banking  services to him and his affiliated entities. That, they  contend, is not enough to ""participate"" in the venture  under the TVPA. HN9[ ] Participation requires ""specific  conduct that furthered the sex trafficking venture,"" Noble  v. Weinstein, 335 F. Supp. 3d 504, 524 (S.D.N.Y. 2018)  -- ""more than just passive facilitation, but some level of  active engagement."" G.G. v. Salesforce.com, 603 F.  Supp. 3d 626, 644 (N.D. Ill. 2022). Simply providing  their usual services, defendants say, does not rise to the  level of such active engagement. See Geiss v.  Weinstein Co. Holdings LLC, 383 F. Supp. 3d 156, 169  (S.D.N.Y. 2019); Salesforce.com, 603 F. Supp. 3d at  648. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *24 Page 15 of 23 But even if participation requires such engagement,  plaintiffs  adequately  allege  that  defendants  so  participated in Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking venture.  JPM Jane Doe and the USVI allege, inter alia, that JP  Morgan assisted with ""structuring"" cash withdrawals so  that those withdrawals would not appear suspicious.  JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 179, 189. [*28]  They allege  that JP Morgan delayed filing suspicious activity reports  concerning Epstein's activities. Id. at ¶¶ 180-81; USVI  FAC, ¶¶ 74-75. And they allege that JP Morgan actually  trafficked women and girls for Jeffrey Epstein through its  subsidiary, Highbridge. JPM Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 170,  176. Similarly, DB Jane Doe alleges that Deutsche Bank  ""concealed its delivery of hundreds of thousands of  dollars in cash to Epstein and his associates"" by willfully  failing to file suspicious activity reports, DB Jane Doe  FAC, ¶ 324; that DB ""structured"" 97 cash withdrawals by  Epstein's co-conspirators in the amount of $7,500 per  withdrawal to avoid alerting authorities, id. at ¶ 337; that  Deutsche Bank failed to implement oversight imposed  by its Americas Reputational Risk Committee, id. at ¶  325; and that Deutsche Bank allowed Epstein to use its  accounts ""to send dozens of wires, directly and  indirectly, including at least 18 wires in the amount of  $10,000 or more to then known co-conspirators."" Id. at  ¶¶ 212-13. Moreover, even the cash that DB provided to  Epstein, DB Jane Doe alleges, was unusual. Id. at ¶ 320  (""It was far from routine for Deutsche Bank to provide  $200,000 per year in cash to [*29]  someone like  Epstein, who did not have an apparent need for such  extravagant sums. Moreover, the circumstances in  which Epstein was requesting such large amounts were  far from routine and raised numerous 'red flags'—taking  it well outside routine circumstances.""). In short, plaintiffs allege that both JP Morgan and  Deutsche Bank went well beyond merely providing their  usual services to Jeffrey Epstein and his affiliated  entities. Thus, even if it is true that ""active participation""  in a sex-trafficking venture requires some special  tailoring of one's services to that venture, plaintiffs  plausibly plead that this element of participation liability  is satisfied. 2. Knowledge HN10[ ] The second element of participation liability  under the TVPA is knowledge. The defendant must  either have known, or recklessly disregarded the fact  that, ""force, fraud, or coercion"" was used to ""cause [a]  person to engage in a commercial sex act."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a)(2). To satisfy this element, it not enough for  the defendant to have ""only an abstract awareness of  sex trafficking in general."" S.J. v. Choice Hotels Int'l,  Inc., 473 F. Supp. 3d 147, 154 (E.D.N.Y. 2020). Instead,  the defendant must have known, or recklessly  disregarded, that force, fraud, or coercion was used in  the particular sex-trafficking venture [*30]  that it is  alleged to have participated in. Id. Defendants argue that even more specific knowledge is  necessary. They say that they can be held liable only if  they knew that force, fraud, or coercion was used with  respect to the plaintiff herself. It is true that some courts  appear to have taken this position in the past. See, e.g.,  Salesforce.com, 603 F. Supp. 3d at 646 (""[A] claim  under [Section] 1595 requires that 'the defendant must  have either actual or constructive knowledge that the  venture—in which it voluntarily participated and from  which it knowingly benefited—violated [Section 1591] as  to the plaintiff.""); Lundstrom v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc.,  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 228651, 2021 WL 5579117, at *8  (D. Colo. Nov. 30, 2021) (failure to allege defendant  ""should have known about plaintiff's sex trafficking at its  hotels""); A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc., 484 F.  Supp. 3d 921, 938-39 (D. Or. 2020) (failure to ""allege[]  facts which sufficiently link notice of Plaintiff['s] sex  trafficking to any of these Defendants""). But those  decisions do not control this Court, and defendants do  not cite to any element of either the text or the  legislative history of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2) that  supports this interpretation. Instead, the text of section 1591(a)(2) directly supports  the plaintiffs' interpretation of the knowledge element of  their TVPA claims. HN11[ ] Section 1591(a)(2)  imposes  liability  for  knowingly  benefiting  from  ""participating in"" a sex-trafficking venture. A sex- trafficking venture, [*31]  in turn, is defined as a venture  that has ""recruit[ed], entic[ed], harbor[ed], transport[ed],  provid[ed],  obtain[ed],  advertise[d],  maintain[ed],  patronize[ed], or solicit[ed] by any means a person"" that  uses ""force, threats of force, fraud, coercion . . . or any  combination of such means"" to ""cause the person to  engage in a commercial sex act."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a).  By the express terms of the statute, then, liability is  imposed for knowingly benefiting from participation in a  sex-trafficking venture, not for knowingly benefiting from  the sex-trafficking of a particular person. Knowledge,  therefore, is required with respect to the venture, not    2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *27 Page 16 of 23 with respect to any particular person. Plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts to support their  allegations that JP Morgan had such knowledge of  Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking venture, either directly  or by recklessly disregarding what was plainly to be  seen. As detailed above, plaintiffs allege that JP Morgan  was aware of Epstein's convictions for sex crimes and  ignored numerous red flags associated with Epstein's  accounts, which all suggested that Jeffrey Epstein  operated  a  sex-trafficking  venture.  Even  these  allegations  alone  are  sufficient  to  support  plaintiffs' [*32]  allegations that JP Morgan knew or  recklessly disregarded that Epstein operated such a  venture. But there is more, such as Jes Staley's alleged personal  knowledge of Epstein's sex-trafficking venture. HN12[ ]  ""[W]hen an agent is employed to perform certain duties  for his principal and acquires knowledge material to  those duties, the agent's knowledge is imputed to the  principal."" Apollo Fuel Oil v. United States, 195 F.3d 74,  76 (2d Cir. 1999). When Epstein was JP Morgan's  client, Mr. Staley was one of JP Morgan's high-level  executives, and his duties included overseeing Epstein's  account. USVI FAC, ¶ 84. And if the allegations in  plaintiffs' complaints are taken as true, Mr. Staley had  actual first-hand knowledge that Epstein conducted a  sex-trafficking venture. In fact, JPM Jane Doe alleges  that Mr. Staley observed her specifically ""as a sexual  trafficking and abuse victim."" FAC, ¶ 115. Through  attribution of Mr. Staley's alleged knowledge to JP  Morgan, the complaints might well support an allegation  that JP Morgan actually knew that Jeffrey Epstein ran a  sex-trafficking venture. At the very least, they sufficiently  support plaintiffs' allegation that JP Morgan recklessly  disregarded the existence of such a venture. DB Jane Doe also pleads sufficient facts [*33]  to  support her allegation that Deutsche Bank knew or  recklessly disregarded that Jeffrey Epstein ran a sex- trafficking venture. Before Epstein was onboarded at  Deutsche Bank, DB Jane Doe alleges, Epstein was  convicted of soliciting a minor for prostitution. DB Jane  Doe FAC, ¶¶ 42-43, 279. Then, in November 2012, Paul  Morris joined Deutsche Bank from JP Morgan, where he        had been a member of the team that serviced Epstein's  account, he and brought to DB his knowledge of  Epstein's affairs. Id. at ¶ 201. Thereafter, beginning  around November 2013, Epstein began using Deutsche  Bank accounts to send wire transfers to collaborators in  his sex-trafficking operation, whose names and alleged  collaborative activity had by then been made public. Id.  at ¶¶ 212-16. Not much after that, in 2014 and 2015, an  internal department within Deutsche Bank alerted  management about Epstein's sex trafficking. Id. at ¶  231. And a Deutsche Bank executive is alleged to have  met with Epstein and to have observed victims in  Epstein's home. Id. at ¶¶ 235-36. If taken as true, and  viewed in a light most favorably to DB Jane Doe, these  allegations make it plausible that Deutsche Bank knew  of, or recklessly disregarded, [*34]  Jeffrey Epstein's  sex-trafficking venture. Thus, the Court finds that the plaintiffs have pled  sufficient facts to support their allegations that JP  Morgan and Deutsche Bank knew or recklessly  disregarded that Jeffrey Epstein conducted a sex- trafficking venture. 3. Benefit HN13[ ] The last element of liability for participating in  a sex-trafficking venture is that the defendant benefited  from its participation. JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank do  not contest that they received fees and other revenue  from providing services to Jeffrey Epstein and his  affiliated entities. But they both assert that the mere  receipt of revenue does not satisfy the benefit  requirement. Instead, they say, plaintiffs must allege  that they received revenue from Jeffrey Epstein and his  affiliated entities in exchange for their furtherance of  Epstein's sex-trafficking venture. See Geiss v. Weinstein  Co. Holdings LLC, 383 F. Supp. 3d 156, 169 (S.D.N.Y.  2019) (""[T]here must be a causal relationship between  affirmative conduct furthering the sex-trafficking venture  and receipt of a benefit.""). Although the Court is not convinced that the benefit  element should be read in this way, even assuming  arguendo that defendants are correct, the plaintiffs have  here offered sufficient allegations to satisfy this [*35]   element. Indeed, JPM Jane Doe expressly alleges that  JP Morgan chose to ignore warnings that Epstein was  involved  in  sex-trafficking  because  JP  Morgan  understood that it would lose a lot of money if it fired  Epstein as client. JPM Jane Doe FAC ¶¶ 152, 173, 214.  JPM Jane Doe also alleges that JP Morgan executives  specifically lobbied to keep Epstein as a client despite  reports of sex-trafficking JP Morgan's relationship with  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *31 Page 17 of 23 Epstein was lucrative. Id. at ¶¶ 132-33, 161, 172, 184,  213-14. DB Jane Doe makes similar allegations against  Deutsche Bank. DB Jane Doe alleges that Deutsche  Bank overlooked warnings that Epstein was involved in  sex-trafficking because of the ""number of sizable deals""  that DB obtained through its relationship with Jeffrey  Epstein. DB Jane Doe FAC, ¶ 243. DB Jane Doe also  alleges that Paul Morris proposed that DB establish  accounts for entities affiliated with Jeffrey Epstein, not  personal accounts in Epstein's name, to help conceal  both DB's participation in Epstein's sex-trafficking  venture and the existence of that venture. Id. at ¶¶ 205,  243. Like plaintiffs' allegations against JP Morgan, these  allegations make it plausible that Deutsche Bank  knowingly  benefited [*36]   from  furthering  Jeffrey  Epstein's sex-trafficking venture. 4. Conclusion In short, the allegations in the complaints, if taken as  true and viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs,  plausibly support each element of plaintiffs' claims under  18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2). Accordingly, defendants'  motions to dismiss these claims are denied. C. Liability for Obstructing TVPA Enforcement JPM Jane Doe and DB Jane Doe also allege that JP  Morgan and Deutsche Bank obstructed the enforcement  of the TVPA. HN14[ ] 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) makes it  unlawful to ""obstruct[], attempt[] to obstruct, or in any  way interfere[] with or prevent[] the enforcement of"" 18  U.S.C. § 1591(d). For a defendant to be liable for  obstructing the enforcement of the TVPA, it must (1)  know of an effort to enforce the TVPA and (2)  intentionally obstruct or attempt to obstruct that  enforcement effort. See United States v. Farah, 766  F.3d 599, 612 (6th Cir. 2014). Plaintiffs allege that JP  Morgan and Deutsche Bank obstructed the enforcement  of the TVPA by, among other things, failing to file  suspicious activity reports that would have alerted  authorities to Epstein's sex-trafficking venture. JPM  Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 476-79; DB Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 449- 52. As an initial matter, defendants argue that JPM Jane  Doe and DB Jane Doe have no right to assert  obstruction [*37]  claims. HN15[ ] The TVPA's ""civil  remedy,"" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a), only provides a right of  action to a ""victim"" of a violation of the TVPA. 18 U.S.C.  § 1595(a). And defendants argue that JPM Jane Doe  and DB Jane Doe are not the victims of any obstruction  of an enforcement effort. The only victim of such an  action, defendants say, is the government that makes  such an effort. See Doe v. Fitzgerald, 2022 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 8194, 2022 WL 425016, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 6,  2022) (""The 'victim' of the obstruction of enforcement set  out in section 1591(d) is the state or federal  government[.]""). Thus, defendants say, the Jane Does  do not have a right to assert their obstruction claims. The statute cannot be read in this cramped fashion.  HN16[ ] While 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) does not define  ""victim,"" a different section of the federal criminal code --  which establishes criminal procedure that is generally  applicable across federal crimes -- defines a ""crime  victim"" as ""a person directly and proximately harmed as  a result of the commission of a Federal offense."" 18  U.S.C. § 3771(e)(2)(A); see also 34 U.S.C. §  20141(e)(2) (defining a victim as ""a person that has  suffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm  as a result of the commission of a crime""). This  definition accords with ordinary usage, which recognizes  as a victim ""one that is injured, destroyed, or sacrificed  under any of various conditions."" Victim, Merriam- Webster's [*38]  Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed.). Thus,  the ""victims"" of one who obstructs the enforcement of  the TVPA include not just the government, but also  include  those  who  suffered  harm  because  the  government's enforcement efforts were hindered. Turning now to the merits of plaintiffs' claims, the Court  finds that the plaintiffs plead sufficient facts to support  their obstruction claims. JPM Jane Doe and DB Jane  Doe allege that JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank,  respectively,  knew  of  investigations  into  Jeffrey  Epstein's  sex-trafficking  operation  and  that  they  intentionally failed to file suspicious activity reports in  order to frustrate such investigations. JPM Jane Doe  FAC, ¶¶ 187, 224, 296, 356, 368, 397, 432, 438-40; DB  Jane Doe FAC, ¶¶ 42-46, 60-63, 188-99, 212-13, 445- 48. Thus, the Court denies defendants' motions to  dismiss plaintiffs' obstruction claims. D. TVPA Perpetrator Liability Plaintiffs'  allegations  that  defendants  themselves  perpetrated sex-trafficking are another matter. HN17[ ]  A direct perpetrator of sex trafficking is someone who  knowingly  ""recruits,  entices,  harbors,  transports,  provides, obtains, advertises, maintains, patronizes, or  solicits""  an  underage  person  to  engage  in  a  commercial [*39]  sex act or does the same to an adult  by means of force, fraud, or coercion. 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a)(1). Plaintiffs' allegations do not adequately  allege that either JP Morgan or Deutsche Bank did so. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *35 Page 18 of 23 DB Jane Doe claims that Deutsche Bank's cash ""was  part of the 'recruitment' of Jane Doe and other victims.""  Pl.'s Mem. in Oppo. to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss, at 21. The  alleged facts that Epstein used cash obtained from  Deutsche Bank to recruit his victims, and that Deutsche  Bank recklessly disregarded that he was so doing, might  jointly render Deutsche Bank liable for participating in  Epstein's venture (see above). But they do not make  Deutsche Bank the recruiter. JPM Jane Doe's allegations are a little more on point,  but still not sufficient. JPM Jane Doe alleges that JP  Morgan directly perpetrated sex-trafficking in two ways.  First, she alleges that ""a powerful financial executive"" at  JP Morgan (later identified as Jes Staley) sexually  assaulted JPM Jane Doe. Second, JPM Jane Doe  alleges that JP Morgan's subsidiary, Highbridge,  transported some of the victims of Jeffrey Epstein's sex- trafficking venture. But even if Mr. Staley's actions are  attributable to JP Morgan, those actions do not support  a perpetrator claim, [*40]  because the TVPA does not  impose liability for sexual assault per se (a classic state  crime), but also requires the additional elements  described above. See 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1). And JPM  Jane Doe's complaint does not allege that JP Morgan  knew that the women and girls allegedly transported by  Highbridge would be caused to engage in a commercial  sex act, which is likewise an essential element of a  TVPA perpetrator claim. See 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Since plaintiffs' allegations do not state all the elements  of claims for perpetrating a violation of the TVPA,  defendants' motions to dismiss these claims are  granted. E. Aiding and Abetting a Violation of the TVPA JPM Jane Doe and DB Jane Doe also allege that JP  Morgan and Deutsche Bank, even if they were not  themselves perpetrators, aided and abetted Jeffrey  Epstein's violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). They  support this claim with the following train of logic. First,  Jeffrey Epstein violated 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) through his  direct acts of sex-trafficking. Second, 18 U.S.C. § 2  makes anyone criminally ""punishable as a principal"" if  they aid or abet the commission of an offense against  the United States. Finally, 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) provides  a ""civil remedy"" to victims of the TVPA. It states: ""An  individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter [*41]  may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator (or whoever knowingly benefits, financially  or by receiving anything of value from participation in a  venture which that person knew or should have known  has engaged in an act in violation of this chapter) in an  appropriate  district  court  of  the  United  States""  (emphasis supplied). In other words, plaintiffs contend  that 18 U.S.C. § 2 (a criminal statute) is incorporated  within the civil remedy provision of the TVPA. Since  principals are subject to civil liability when they violate  18 U.S.C. § 1591(a), and 18 U.S.C. § 2 puts aiders and  abettors in an equivalent criminal position to principals,  plaintiffs contend that aiders and abettors are subject to  civil liability under 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Plaintiffs' claims thus hinge on a question of law:  whether the ""civil remedy"" provided by 18 U.S.C. §  1595(a) enables sex-trafficking victims to pursue claims  for aiding and abetting. The parties take opposing  positions. Defendants argue that section 1595(a)'s civil  remedy does not apply, because aiding and abetting  liability is provided by 18 U.S.C. § 2, which is not within  ""this chapter"" (i.e., the TVPA: 18 U.S.C. § 1581 et seq.).  See Noble, 335 F. Supp. 3d at 525-526 (rejecting aiding  and abetting liability under the TVPA). Plaintiffs,  meanwhile, contend that 18 U.S.C. § 2 is incorporated  within the TVPA. HN18[ ] The defendants [*42]  are correct: The TVPA  does not provide civil liability for aiding and abetting. In  general, aiding and abetting liability should not be  inferred when a statute does not expressly provide for it.  See Cent. Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank  of Denver, N.A., 511 U.S. 164, 185, 114 S. Ct. 1439,  128 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1994) (""it is not plausible to interpret  the statutory silence as tantamount to an implicit  congressional intent to impose § 10(b) aiding and  abetting liability.""). Moreover, neither the text nor the  legislative history of the TVPA indicates that Congress  intended to provide civil liability for aiding and abetting a  violation of it. In fact, some aspects of the TVPA's  legislative history suggests that Congress had the  opposite  intention:  Congress  specifically  rejected  defining ""participation in a venture"" -- which would entail  civil liability -- so as to include aiding and abetting.  Compare Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex  Trafficking Act of 2017, Pub. L. No. 115-164, § 5, 132  Stat. 1253, 1255 (2018) (rejecting definition of  ""participation in a venture"" that included ""aids or abets"")  with H.R. 1865, 115th Cong. (as introduced in House,  April 3, 2017) (bill draft proposing ""aids or abets"" in  definition of participation in a venture). A comparison to Rothstein v. UBS AG is instructive. See  Rothstein v. UBS AG, 708 F.3d 82 (2d Cir. 2013). In  Rothstein, the Second Circuit considered this issue as  presented by a similar statute, the Anti-Terrorism Act.  HN19[ ] The Anti-Terrorism Act, like the Trafficking  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *39 Page 19 of 23 Victims Protection Act [*43] , is a largely criminal statute  that also provides a civil remedy for violations of it. See  18 U.S.C. § 2333(a) (providing a private right of action).  Also like the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, the civil  remedy provision of the Anti-Terrorism Act does not  expressly provide liability for aiding or abetting, but the  Act is codified in Title 18 of the United States Code,  section 2 of which makes any aider or abettor  ""punishable as a principal."" In Rothstein, the Second  Circuit held that 18 U.S.C. § 2333 does not provide a  right of action to assert claims for aiding and abetting.  Rothstein, 708 F.3d at 97-98. Rothstein's holding was supported by two premises. The  court noted Central Bank's general presumption that  aiding and abetting liability should not be inferred from  statutory silence. Id. at 97. And the court also noted that  other provisions of the ATA --sections that surround its  civil remedy provision -- do provide for aiding and  abetting liability. Id. at 98. That context, the court found,  suggested that Congress affirmatively rejected aiding  civil liability for aiding and abetting a violation of the  ATA. HN20[ ] So too for the TVPA. There is a presumption  that aiding and abetting liability should not be read into  section 1595's silence, a presumption that is confirmed  by its legislative history. Since, therefore, the TVPA  does not provide civil liability for aiding and abetting  under section 2, plaintiffs' aiding and abetting claims are  dismissed. F. Attempting to Benefit from a TVPA Violation Plaintiffs also allege that JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank  attempted to benefit from a TVPA violation. HN21[ ] A  defendant is liable for attempting to violate the law only  if they have the specific intent to commit the underlying  violation of the law. United States v. Farhane, 634 F.3d  127, 145 (2d Cir. 2011). But [*44]  the complaints here  do not plead facts that support the inference that either  JP Morgan or Deutsche Bank had this specific intention.  If taken as true, plaintiffs' allegations do support the  inference that Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan intended  to profit from their relationships with Jeffrey Epstein, and  that accomplishing that object required JP Morgan and  Deutsche Bank to provide banking services that  allegedly,  they  knew,  or  recklessly  disregarded,  supported Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking venture. But  the complaints do not support the allegation that either  JP Morgan or Deutsche Bank acted with the specific  intent of benefiting from a sex-trafficking venture. Thus,  plaintiffs' claims for attempting to violate the TPVA are  dismissed. G. Conspiracy to Violate the TVPA Finally, plaintiffs allege that JP Morgan and Deutsche  Bank conspired with Epstein and others to violate the  TVPA. HN22[ ] ""The gist of conspiracy is, of course,  agreement."" United States v. Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp.,  871 F.2d 1181, 1191 (2d Cir. 1989). To be liable, each  defendant must have ""entered into a joint enterprise with  consciousness of its general nature and extent."" United  States v. Alessi, 638 F.2d 466, 473 (2d Cir. 1980).  Plaintiffs' factual allegations do not support the inference  that either defendant made such an agreement. If the  allegations [*45]  in the complaints are taken as true,  the defendants did indeed agree to provide banking  services for Epstein and his affiliated entities and that  they knew, or recklessly disregarded, would assist his  sex-trafficking venture. But that agreement is different  from an actual agreement to participate in a sex- trafficking venture. Plaintiffs also allege that the  defendants covered up Epstein's sex-trafficking by  willfully failing to file suspicious activity reports. But  plaintiffs do not plead any facts which support the  inference that the defendants did so pursuant to an  agreement with Epstein and/or others to further his sex- trafficking operation. Thus, plaintiffs' conspiracy claims  are dismissed. H. RICO Having discussed plaintiffs' TVPA claims, the Court now  turns to DB Jane Doe's claim that Deutsche Bank  violated section 1962(c) of the Racketeering Influenced  and Corrupt Organizations Act (""RICO""), 18 U.S.C. §§  1961 et seq., and conspired to violate RICO in violation  of section 1962(d). HN23[ ] There can no liability under section 1962(c) if  the defendant did not participate in the conduct of an  enterprise. See DeFalco v. Bernas, 244 F.3d 286, 306  (2d Cir. 2001) (to state a civil claim under 18 U.S.C.  1962(c), a plaintiff must allege that a defendant  participated in ""(1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3)  through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity"") (quoting  Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496, 105  S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1985)). To participate in a  racketeering  enterprise [*46]   under  the  relevant  provisions of RICO, a defendant must ""direct the  enterprise's affairs."" Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S.  170, 177, 180, 113 S. Ct. 1163, 122 L. Ed. 2d 525  (1993). While a defendant need not play the  ""predominant"" part in the operation of the enterprise, it  must ""exert"" some ""control"" over it. Dubai Islamic Bank  v. Citibank, N.A., 256 F. Supp. 2d 158, 164 (S.D.N.Y.  2003). 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *42 Page 20 of 23 While DB Jane Doe does not precisely define the  enterprise that Deutsche Bank and Jeffrey Epstein  allegedly formed (and this itself would warrant dismissal  of her RICO claims) her allegation appears to be that  Deutsche Bank participated in Jeffrey Epstein's sex  trafficking venture. If that is Jane Doe's allegation, her  substantive civil RICO claim fails, for she has not  alleged that Deutsche Bank controlled or directed that  venture in any way. DB Jane Doe's RICO conspiracy claim likewise fails, for  she has not alleged any factual basis for a finding of a  ""conscious agreement among the defendants."" Hecht v.  Commerce Clearing House, Inc., 897 F.2d 21, 26 n. 4  (2d Cir. 1990). DB Jane Doe has not pled sufficient facts  to  support  her  allegation  that  Deutsche  Bank  consciously agreed to undertake racketeering activity in  violation of section 1962 with Jeffrey Epstein. Instead, at  most, she alleges that Deutsche Bank acted unlawfully  as part of an implicit quid pro quo: Deutsche Bank would  conceal Epstein's sex-trafficking venture in exchange for  Epstein's [*47]  lucrative fees. Because DB Jane Doe fails to plausibly allege that  Deutsche Bank participated in a violation of section  1962(c), or that Deutsche Bank consciously agreed to  participate in one, Deutsche Bank's motion to dismiss  DB Jane Doe's civil RICO claims is granted. I. CICO The USVI makes a similar allegation against JP  Morgan, which fails for similar reasons. The USVI  claims that JP Morgan violated the Virgin Islands  Criminally Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act  (""CICO""), the Virgin Islands' territorial-law analogue to  RICO. But the USVI fails to plausibly allege two of the  initial elements of such a claim: that a criminal  enterprise existed, and that JP Morgan participated in it. The USVI alleges that JP Morgan's association with  Jeffrey Epstein was a de facto enterprise. HN24[ ] Any  enterprise formed in this way -- an ""association-in-fact  enterprise"" -- must have three features: a common  purpose, relationships among those associated with the  enterprise, and longevity to pursue the enterprise's  purpose. People v. McKenzie, 66 V.I. 3, 12 (Super. Ct.  2017). The USVI, however, has failed to support its allegation  that JP Morgan shared a common purpose with Jeffrey  Epstein. The USVI does not allege that JP Morgan  shared the purpose of trafficking or abusing [*48]   Epstein's victims. Rather, the USVI alleges that the  purpose of JP Morgan's association with Epstein was  simply to make money. If the USVI's allegations are  taken as true, achieving that purpose did require JP  Morgan to support Epstein's sex-trafficking venture. But  neither human trafficking nor its consequences were  part of JP Morgan's purpose; JP Morgan would have  been just as happy for Epstein's victims to escape, so  long as Epstein's fees continued to roll in. And even if JP Morgan did form an enterprise with  Jeffrey Epstein, the facts in the complaint do not support  the USVI's allegation that JP Morgan participated in it.  Like DB Jane Doe, the USVI does not allege that JP  Morgan conducted Epstein's sex-trafficking venture in  any way. For that reason, and because the USVI fails to  plausibly allege an enterprise as well, JP Morgan's  motion to dismiss the USVI's CICO claim is granted. J. CFDBPA The last statutory claim brought against the defendants  is the USVI's claim that JP Morgan violated the Virgin  Islands Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business  Practices Act (""CFDBPA""). The USVI alleges that JP  Morgan gained an unfair advantage over other, law- abiding banks by supporting Epstein's [*49]  sex- trafficking venture. USVI FAC, ¶¶ 130-36. In exchange  for JP Morgan's support, the USVI alleges, Epstein  provided JP Morgan with ""referrals of high-value  business opportunities."" Id. at ¶ 135. The USVI's pleadings are threadbare. The USVI does  not say which banks, in particular, were denied the  ""high-value business opportunities"" that JP Morgan  allegedly obtained. It does not describe any connection  between those banks and the Virgin Islands. And it does  not say that these banks actually did comply with their  legal obligations with respect to similarly-situated  customers, which is an essential aspect of the USVI's  unfairness claim. Thus, the USVI's allegations fall well  short of making its CFBDPA claim plausible, and JP  Morgan's motion to dismiss this claim is granted. K. Negligence JPM Jane Doe and DB Jane Doe and also assert  several New York state-law tort claims against JP  Morgan and Deutsche Bank. Their first set of such  claims allege that JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank were  negligent. They allege that the banks failed to exercise  reasonable care to prevent physical harm and that the  banks failed to exercise reasonable care as banking  institutions  providing  non-routine  banking  services. [*50]  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *46 Page 21 of 23 HN25[ ] Under New York law (as under the law of  virtually every state), there are three elements of  negligence: ""(1) a duty owed by the defendant to the  plaintiff, (2) a breach thereof, and (3) injury proximately  resulting therefrom."" Solomon ex rel. Solomon v. City of  New York, 66 N.Y.2d 1026, 489 N.E.2d 1294, 499  N.Y.S.2d 392 (N.Y. 1985). The parties contest the first  and the third elements, duty and proximate causation. JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank say that they owed no  duty to Jane Doe. According the banks, they had no  duty to prevent Jeffrey Epstein from harming either Jane  Doe, nor did they acquire any duty of care from their  banking relationship with Epstein. See In re Terrorist  Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 714 F.3d 118, 126 (2d Cir.  2013) (""[B]anks and other financial institutions do not  owe non-customers a duty to protect them from the  intentional torts of their customers.""). HN26[ ] But JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank, like  everyone else, owed both Jane Does the ordinary duty  of reasonable care. This duty can extend to actions  undertaken by third parties. Restatement (Third) of  Torts: Phys. & Emot. Harm § 19 (""The conduct of a  defendant can lack reasonable care insofar as it  foreseeably combines with or permits the improper  conduct of the plaintiff or a third party.""); Ford v. Grand  Union Co., 268 N.Y. 243, 197 N.E. 266, 268-69 (N.Y.  1935) (defendant owes a duty to avoid injury to others  ""by forces set in motion"" by the defendant). Banks are  not exempt from this duty. See Elmaliach v. Bank of  China Ltd., 110 A.D.3d 192, 206, 971 N.Y.S.2d 504  (N.Y. App. Div. 2013) (""We do not find case law [*51]  to  support the argument that . . . a bank can never be held  liable to non-customers""); id. at 206 (""[A] tortfeasor's  compliance with relevant laws and regulations will not  insulate it from liability if it fails to act objectively  reasonably""). And this duty applies when banks provide  nonroutine services. See id. at 207 (""Although New York  does not generally recognize a duty on the part of banks  to non-customers, that does not mean that New York  policy would prohibit recovery under the alleged facts, if  proven.""). Since JPM Jane Doe and DB Jane Doe do  indeed allege that JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank  helped ""set in motion"" Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking  venture -- by providing the cash that fueled it -- they  plausibly assert that JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank  owed a duty to them. JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank also contend that their  conduct is not a proximate cause of Jane Doe's injury.  HN27[ ] When an alleged injury is caused by an  intervening criminal act, such as sexual abuse, the  defendant's conduct is a proximate cause only when  that intervening act is ""a natural and foreseeable  consequence of a circumstance created by [the]  defendant."" Hain v. Jamison, 28 N.Y.3d 524, 46  N.Y.S.3d 502, 68 N.E. 3d 1233, 1236-37 (N.Y. 2016).  ""[P]roximate cause will be found lacking where the  original negligent act [*52]  merely 'furnished the  occasion for' . . . 'an unrelated act to cause injuries not  ordinarily anticipated.'"" Id. at 1238. And the banks assert  (rehearsing arguments considered above) that they  neither knew nor should have known that their services  contributed to the abuse of the Jane Does. For the reasons already discussed above, however,  JPM Jane Doe and DB Jane Doe allege that JP Morgan  and Deutsche Bank should have known that their  banking services sustained Jeffrey Epstein's sex- trafficking venture. Indeed, they go further and  adequately allege that the defendants actually knew this  or at least recklessly disregarded what was plainly to be  seen. Such constructive knowledge plausibly makes  harm to plaintiffs and other victims of Epstein's sex- trafficking a ""natural and foreseeable"" consequence of  the actions of JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank. Thus, the Court finds that JPM Jane Doe and DB Jane  Doe plausibly allege both that JP Morgan and Deutsche  Bank owed a duty to them, and that the banks  proximately caused harm to them by breaching that  duty. Thus, the Court denies defendants' motions to  dismiss plaintiffs' negligence claims. L. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress JPM Jane Doe and DB Jane [*53]  Doe also allege that  JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank intentionally inflicted  emotional distress upon them. HN28[ ] The elements  of such a claim under here applicable New York law are:  ""(1) extreme and outrageous conduct; (2) the intent to  cause, or the disregard of a substantial likelihood of  causing, severe emotional distress; (3) causation; and  (4) severe emotional distress."" Eskridge v. Diocese of  Brooklyn, 210 A.D.3d 1056, 1057, 180 N.Y.S.3d 179  (N.Y. App. Div. 2022). At the outset, the Court notes that this cause of action is  ""highly disfavored"" and ""almost never successful."" Sesto  v. Slaine, 171 F. Supp. 3d 194, 201-02 (S.D.N.Y. 2016).  That is especially so when, as here, the plaintiff asserts  a negligence claim. HN29[ ] Since almost all conduct  that amounts to the intentional infliction of emotional  distress (""IIED"") also constitutes negligence, IIED claims  are routinely dismissed for their redundancy with  negligence claims. See, e.g., Wolkstein v. Morgenstern,  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *50 Page 22 of 23 275 A.D.2d 635, 637, 713 N.Y.S.2d 171 (N.Y. App. Div.  1st Dep't. 2000) (""Generally, a cause of action for  infliction of emotional distress is not allowed if  essentially duplicative of tort or contract causes of  action.""); Samuel et al. v. Rockefeller Univ., 2022 N.Y.  Misc. LEXIS 4415, 2022 WL 2916784, at *2 (N.Y. Sup.  Ct. July 25, 2022) (dismissing IIED claim as duplicative  of negligence claim). So it is with the Jane Does' IIED  claims: if the conduct of JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank  was extreme and outrageous, and was intended to  cause (or was made with reckless disregard for) severe  emotional distress, [*54]  and in fact caused severe  emotional distress -- JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank  were thereby also liable for negligence. This alone is  likely sufficient grounds for dismissal. Additionally, the plaintiffs fail to allege that JP Morgan  and Deutsche Bank ""intentionally directed"" their conduct  at them. Martin v. Citibank, N.A., 762 F.2d 212, 220 (2d  Cir. 1985) (""The conduct must also be intentionally  directed at the plaintiff . . . .""). None of the plaintiffs'  allegations supports the inference that either JP Morgan  or Deutsche Bank directed their conduct at JPM Jane  Doe or DB Jane Doe specifically. Instead, they are  alleged to have financed Jeffrey Epstein, who then  harmed JPM Jane Doe, DB Jane Doe, and others.  While the plaintiffs' harm might have been a foreseeable  consequence of defendants' actions, the allegations in  the complaints do not support the inference that it was  specifically directed toward them. For both of these  reasons, plaintiffs' IIED claims are dismissed. M. Aiding and Abetting Battery Last, JPM Jane Doe and DB Jane Doe allege that JP  Morgan and Deutsche Bank aided and abetted the  battery of them. They claim that Jeffrey Epstein and his  associates sexually abused them --acts that amounted  to battery -- and that the defendants supported [*55]   those wrongs. HN30[ ] Under New York law, there are three  elements of aiding and abetting battery: ""(1) a wrongful  act producing an injury; (2) the defendant's awareness  of a role as a part of an overall illegal or tortious activity  at the time he provides the assistance; and (3) the  defendant's knowing and substantial assistance in the  principal violation."" Scollo ex rel. Scollo v. Nunez, 16  Misc. 3d 1118(A), 847 N.Y.S.2d 899 (Sup. Ct. 2007),  aff'd, 60 A.D.3d 840, 874 N.Y.S.2d 380 (N.Y. App. Div.  2009). The defendants focus on this last element: whether they  provided ""knowing and substantial assistance"" to those  who battered the Jane Does. ""Knowledge,"" for these  purposes, is actual knowledge. Lerner v. Fleet Bank,  N.A., 459 F.3d 273, 292 (2d Cir. 2006); JP Morgan  Chase Bank v. Winnick, 406 F. Supp. 2d 247, 253 n.4  (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (""[T]he weight of the case law, cited  above, defines knowledge in the context of an aiding  and abetting claim as actual knowledge.""); Kolbeck v.  LIT Am., Inc., 939 F. Supp. 240, 246 (S.D.N.Y. 1996),  aff'd, 152 F.3d 918 (2d Cir. 1998) (""New York common  law, which controls the analysis here, has not adopted a  constructive knowledge standard for imposing aiding  and abetting liability. Rather, New York courts and  federal courts in this district, have required actual  knowledge.""); Steinberg v. Goldstein, 27 A.D.2d 955,  279 N.Y.S.2d 240, 242 (App. Div. 1967). ""Substantial  assistance,"" meanwhile, requires ""commit[ting] some  overt act, either by words or conduct, in furtherance of""  the battery of Plaintiff. McKiernan v. Vaccaro, 168  A.D.3d 827, 91 N.Y.S.3d 478, 481 (App. Div. 2019);  Lindsay v. Lockwood, 163 Misc. 2d 228, 625 N.Y.S.2d  393, 397 (Sup. Ct. 1994). That, in turn, requires  ""intentional or deliberate acts directed at causing harm  which would rise [*56]  to the level of actionable conduct  in relation to the subject assault."" Shea v. Cornell Univ.,  192 A.D.2d 857, 858, 596 N.Y.S.2d 502, 503 (1993). As explained above, the complaints are devoid of facts  which support the allegation that the acts of JP Morgan  and Deutsche Bank were specifically and intentionally  directed at causing harm to the Jane Does. Thus, the  defendants' motions to dismiss plaintiffs' claims for  aiding and abetting battery are granted. III. Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby reconfirms  its rulings in its ""bottom-line"" order of March 20, 2023.  Defendants' motions to dismiss are therefore granted in  part and denied in part, as specified below: With  respect  to  Jane  Doe  v.  Deutsche  Bank  Aktiengesellschaft et al., 22-cv-10018, the Court grants  defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to Counts II,  III, IV, V, VII, VIII, IX, and X of the First Amended  Complaint. The Court denies defendants' motion with  respect to Counts I, VI, XI, and XII of the First Amended  Complaint. Thus, for clarity, the following claims  asserted by plaintiff Jane Doe against defendants  Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Deutsche Bank AG  New York Branch, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company  Americas remain as part of the case: (1) the claim that  defendants [*57]  knowingly benefited from participating  in a sex-trafficking venture, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a)(2); (2) the claim that defendants obstructed  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *53 Page 23 of 23 enforcement of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, in  violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d); (3) the claim that  defendants negligently failed to exercise reasonable  care to prevent physical harm; and (4) the claim that  defendants negligently failed to exercise reasonable  care as a banking institution providing non-routine  banking. All other claims are dismissed. With respect to Jane Doe v. JP Morgan Chase Bank,  N.A., 22-cv-10019, the Court grants defendant's motion  to dismiss with respect to Counts I, II, VI, VII, VIII, and  IX of the First Amended Complaint. The Court denies  defendant's motion with respect to Counts III, IV, V, and  X of the First Amended Complaint. Thus, for clarity, the  following claims asserted by plaintiff Jane Doe against  defendant J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. remain as  part of the case: (1) the claim that defendant negligently  failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent physical  harm; (2) the claim that defendant negligently failed to  exercise reasonable care as a banking institution  providing non-routine banking; (3) the claim that  defendant knowingly benefited from participating in  a [*58]  sex-trafficking venture, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  § 1591(a)(2); and (4) the claim that defendant  obstructed enforcement of the Trafficking Victims  Protection Act, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d). All  other claims are dismissed. With respect to Government of the United States Virgin  Islands v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 22-cv-10904,  the Court grants defendant's motion to dismiss with  respect to Counts II, III, and IV of the First Amended  Complaint. The Court denies defendant's motion with  respect to Count I of the First Amended Complaint.  Thus, for clarity, the claim of plaintiff the Government of  the United States Virgin Islands that defendant JP  Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly benefited from  participating in a sex-trafficking venture, in violation of  18 U.S.C. § 1591 (a) (2), remains as part of the case. All  other claims are dismissed. SO ORDERED. New York, NY May 1, 2023 /s/ Jed S. Rakoff JED S. RAKOFF, U.S.D.J.  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75503, *57",1
"Doe v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714","[*718]  BRASHER, Circuit Judge: 21 F.4th 714, *714; 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 38060, **1 Page 6 of 14 Four sex trafficking victims, proceeding as Jane Does,  filed complaints against numerous  [*719]  defendants  within the hotel industry for violations of the Trafficking  Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, specifically 18  U.S.C. § 1595(a), and Georgia state law. HN1[ ] Under  the TVPRA, a trafficking victim may sue a sex-trafficking  perpetrator and ""whoever knowingly benefits, financially  or by receiving anything of value from participation in a  venture which that person knew or should have known  has engaged in an act in violation of [the Trafficking  Victims Protection Act]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). The Does  alleged that they were trafficked in Atlanta-area hotels  and sued the hotel operators, employees, owners,  franchisees, and franchisors of those hotels. The district court held that the Does failed to plausibly  allege claims against three hotel franchisors: [**4]   Choice Hotels International, Inc., Wyndham Hotels &  Resorts, Inc., and Microtel Inn & Suites Franchising, Inc.  It dismissed their amended complaints as to those  franchisors. And the Does appealed. To resolve this appeal, we must answer two questions.  First, we must decide a question of first impression  about the elements of a TVPRA beneficiary claim. HN2[ ] We hold that Section 1595(a) should be applied  according to its plain meaning: that is, to state a claim  for beneficiary liability under the TVPRA, a plaintiff must  plausibly allege that the defendant (1) knowingly  benefited (2) from taking part in a common undertaking  or enterprise involving risk and potential profit, (3) that  the undertaking or enterprise violated the TVPRA as to  the plaintiff, and (4) that the defendant had constructive  or actual knowledge that the undertaking or enterprise  violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff. Second, we must  determine whether the Does have plausibly alleged  facts that satisfy those elements against each of the  franchisors. Here, we conclude that the Does have  failed to meet that burden as to the three franchisors at  issue on appeal. We likewise conclude that, as to these  three defendants, the Does did not state [**5]  a  plausible claim under Georgia state law. Accordingly,  we affirm. I. BACKGROUND A. Factual Background Four Jane Does filed nearly identical amended  complaints against individuals and businesses involved  in the hotel industry, including individual hotels, owners,  management, and franchisors. The Does alleged that  they were ""victims of the conspicuous and open sex  trafficking that occurred at Defendants' hotels."" They  pleaded facts about hotel sex trafficking generally and  sex trafficking in the Atlanta area, specifically. Among the defendants are the three franchisors  relevant to this appeal: Choice Hotels International, Inc.,  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., and Microtel Inn &  Suites Franchising, Inc. Choice is a franchisor that  licenses its brand to the Suburban Extended Stay in  Chamblee, Georgia. Wyndham is the parent company of  MISF and the franchisor that licenses its brand to the  Microtel Inn & Suites in Atlanta, Georgia. MISF enters  into franchise agreements with Microtel Inn & Suites  franchisees on Wyndham's behalf. The Does alleged  that these franchisors violated the TVPRA, 18 U.S.C. §  1595(a); the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt  Organizations Act, O.C.G.A. §§ 16-14-4(a), (c); and  acted negligently. The Does alleged [**6]  that these two hotels—the  Suburban Extended Stay in Chamblee and the Microtel  Inn & Suites in At-lanta—""accommodate[d], facilitate[d],  and participate[d] in the sex trafficking of women, men,  and children in Atlanta""—including their own sex  trafficking. The  [*720]  Does alleged that they were  ""forced to engage in commercial sex acts at [these]  hotels by various sex traffickers."" And the money that  their traffickers made from those ventures was ""used to  pay . . . for their hotel rooms and other services in  furtherance of the sex trafficking ventures occurring at  [these] hotels."" Some of the hotels' employees worked  with the traffickers by, for example, acting ""as lookouts,  notifying traffickers if police were present."" Traffickers  paid these employees in cash or drugs. Does 1, 2, and 4 alleged that there was a ""well- established sex trafficking venture"" at the Suburban  Extended Stay licensed by Choice Hotels in Chamblee,  Georgia. That alleged venture was comprised of  ""traffickers,  the  hotel's  employees,  management,  owners, and franchisor, as well as others involved in the  sex trafficking of victims at that hotel."" Many of the local  hotel's employees assisted and facilitated the Does'  trafficking [**7]  and were paid by the traffickers to work  as lookouts. While being trafficked at the Suburban  Extended  Stay,  the  Does  ""exhibited  numerous  wellknown and visible signs of a sex trafficking victim.""  And the state of the hotel rooms used for the trafficking  and the constant flow of men in and out of rooms  suggested that sex trafficking was occurring at the hotel. Three Does alleged that Choice ""controlled the policies  and standards applicable to and enforced (or not  enforced) at the Suburban Extended Stay (Chamblee),  21 F.4th 714, *718; 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 38060, **3 Page 7 of 14 as well as the training of its managers and employees.""  Choice also ""sent inspectors to examine this hotel, at  times anonymously, and the ongoing sex trafficking  activity would have been apparent to those inspectors.""  Further, the Does alleged upon information and belief  that Choice monitored online reviews of the hotel, which  ""reported widespread prostitution and crime occurring at  the hotel."" The Does also alleged that customers  complained to Choice about prostitution, commercial  sex trafficking, and other criminal activity at the hotel.  The police responded to prostitution calls at the hotel on  numerous occasions, and nonprofit and religious groups  regularly visited ""to provide [**8]  food and rescue  information  to  the  sex  trafficking  victims  they  encounter[ed] at the hotel."" As for Wyndham and MISF, all four Does alleged that  there was also a ""well-established sex trafficking  venture at the Microtel"" in Atlanta that was licensed by  Wyndham and MISF. The Does allege that the local  hotel's  employees  participated  in,  assisted,  and  facilitated the Does' trafficking at the Microtel by working  as lookouts for traffickers and allowing them to use the  lobby computer to advertise for sex with Does 1 and 2.  And during the years that Doe 4 was trafficked at the  Microtel, ""a single sex trafficker completely controlled  the third floor of the hotel."" That trafficker also used the  banquet room to take photographs of victims to use for  online advertisements. Wyndham and MISF ""controlled  the policies and standards applicable to and enforced  (or not enforced) at the Microtel (Atlanta), as well as the  training of its managers and employees."" ""Wyndham  and [MISF]--the hotel's franchisor[s]-- sent inspectors to  examine this hotel, at times anonymously, and the  ongoing sex trafficking activity would have been  apparent to those inspectors."" The  Does  alleged  that  the  three  franchisors  profited [**9]  from this activity. In exchange for allowing  the Microtel to use its brand, Wyndham received ""royalty  and other fees based on a percentage of their gross  room revenue."" The other franchisors also earned a  percentage of the revenue generated from the daily  rental of hotel rooms, including the rental of rooms   [*721]  used to ""harbor, exploit, and sell"" each of the  Does. And the franchisors ""intentionally turn[ed] a blind  eye to safety and security issues at their hotels . . . even  when [they] knew or should have known part of [their]  profits were derived from sex trafficking ventures."" They  ""should have known"" about those sex trafficking  ventures, according to the Does, because sex trafficking  occurred openly at the hotels, and the franchisors  routinely ""investigate individual hotel locations and take  remedial action"" when revenue is down. B. Procedural Background The Does asserted a ""standalone"" civil beneficiary  TVPRA claim against the franchisors and alleged that  they knowingly benefitted from participation in a sex  trafficking venture that they ""knew or should have  known"" violated the TVPRA. They also asserted  Georgia RICO claims predicated on violations of Section  1591 and Georgia state law. Finally, [**10]  they alleged  negligence based on the franchisors' ""supervisory  control and authority over employees, contractors and  others"" at the hotels, their failure to keep the hotels safe,  and their failure to ""adequately and properly protect their  invitees, including [the Does], in breach of their duty of  care."" Soon after filing the amended complaint, Doe 3  voluntarily dismissed all claims against Choice without  prejudice. Choice, Wyndham, and MISF moved to dismiss each of  the Does' amended complaints against them for failure  to state a claim. Choice alternatively moved to strike  certain allegations from Does 1, 2, and 4's amended  complaints as ""impertinent and salacious."" The district  court granted the motions to dismiss as to all claims  against Choice, Wyndham, and MISF without prejudice  in nearly identical orders in each case. In those orders,  the district court also granted Choice's motion to strike  the disputed language from Does 1, 2, and 4's amended  complaints and sua sponte struck the same material  from Doe 3's amended complaint. The Does then moved for entry of judgment in favor of  Choice (in all cases except for the third Doe's case),  Wyndham, and MISF under Federal Rule of Civil  Procedure 54(b) and for interlocutory [**11]  review  under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). They argued that the district  court's order dismissing Wyndham, MISF, and Choice  was a final judgment under Rule 54(b) and there was no  just reason for delay because (1) the immediate  resolution of an appeal would resolve issues in all four  interrelated Doe actions, streamlining the litigation; (2)  there would be a risk of duplicative discovery and trials  without an immediate appeal, and an immediate appeal  could serve to limit the scope of discovery; (3) the cases  were still in the early stages of discovery, so duplicative  discovery could best be avoided now; and (4) COVID- 19's impact on the defendants' operations could  diminish the Does' ability to recover later on. The Does  also argued that the question presented by the  dismissal order, how to interpret 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a)'s  knowledge requirement, satisfied the Section 1292(b)  factors for interlocutory review. No defendant opposed  21 F.4th 714, *720; 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 38060, **7 Page 8 of 14 the motion. The district court granted the franchisors' motions for  Rule 54(b) certification and interlocutory review under  Section 1292(b) and stayed discovery pending the  anticipated appeals. The court later amended the entry  of final judgment to dismiss Choice, Wyndham, and  MISF with prejudice at the Does' request and after they  waived the right to later [**12]  add the defendants if  unsuccessful on appeal. Each Doe timely appealed the district court's amended  Rule 54(b) judgment and, in the alternative, filed a  petition for permission to appeal under Section 1292(b).  [*722]  II. JURISDICTION We must first satisfy ourselves that we have jurisdiction  over this appeal. See Boyd v. Homes of Legend, Inc.,  188 F.3d 1294, 1297 (11th Cir. 1999). The Does argue  that we have jurisdiction under both 28 U.S.C. § 1291  and 28 U.S.C. § 1292. We conclude that jurisdiction is  proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 because the district  court properly directed entry of final judgment as to the  franchisor defendants under Rule 54(b). We therefore  do not reach the question of whether jurisdiction is  proper under Section 1292(b). HN3[ ] ""A district court must follow a two-step analysis  in determining whether a partial final judgment may  properly be certified under Rule 54(b)."" Lloyd Noland  Found., Inc. v. Tenet Health Care Corp., 483 F.3d 773,  777 (11th Cir. 2007). The court must determine (1)  whether ""its final judgment is, in fact, both 'final' and a  'judgment'""; and (2) whether there is ""just reason for  delay"" in certifying the order as immediately appealable.  Id. An order is ""final"" if it ""disposes entirely of a  separable claim or dismisses a party entirely."" In re Se.  Banking Corp., 69 F.3d 1539, 1547 (11th Cir. 1995). It is  a ""judgment"" if ""it is a decision upon a cognizable claim  for relief."" Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Gen. Elec. Co., 446  U.S. 1, 7, 100 S. Ct. 1460, 64 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1980). When  determining whether there is no just reason for delay,  the district court should consider ""judicial [**13]   administrative interests--including the historic federal  policy against piecemeal appeals--and the equities  involved."" Lloyd Noland Found., 483 F.3d at 778  (cleaned up). This Court reviews the first step of the  district court's analysis-- whether the order constitutes a  final judgment--de novo. Id. at 778 & n.5. We review  whether there was no ""just reason for delay"" only for  abuse of discretion. Id. at 778 n.5. First, the district court's orders granting the motions to  dismiss filed by Choice, Wyndham, and MISF were  ""final judgments"" for purposes of Rule 54(b). Those  orders dismissed Choice, Wyndham, and MISF from the  cases entirely. See In re Se. Banking Corp., 69 F.3d at  1547. The court initially dismissed the franchisors  without prejudice and reserved the Does' rights to add  them back later if newly discovered evidence warranted  their inclusion. Even with this reservation of right, that  order was still an ""ultimate disposition"" of the claims  against those parties. See Lloyd Noland Found., 483  F.3d at 777. The district court later amended its  dismissal of the franchisors to be with prejudice after the  Does stipulated that they would rest on their original  allegations against the franchisors and waived their right  to add them to the case later should their appeals fail.  Accordingly, the district court did not err in concluding  that [**14]  its dismissals of the franchisors were ""final  judgments"" for purposes of Rule 54(b). Second, the district court did not abuse its discretion in  determining that there was no just reason to delay this  appeal. HN4[ ] This Court has stated that ""limitation of  piecemeal appeals [is] an essential purpose served by  postponing final disposition"" of claims that a party  wishes to appeal. Ebrahimi v. City of Huntsville Bd. of  Educ., 114 F.3d 162, 168 (11th Cir. 1997). We have  also cautioned that ""[a]bsent special circumstances . . .  the district court's preference for pretrial appellate  review of its dismissal decisions constitutes an improper  basis for issuance of a partial final judgment"" under Rule  54(b). Id. at 168. The district court did not abuse its discretion in  concluding that there was no just reason for delay due  to the unique circumstances of these cases. The Does'  cases closely parallel one another, and the district  court's dismissal order is the same  [*723]  in each.  Addressing this consolidated appeal now significantly  enhances the efficiency of the litigation. The relatedness  of these four cases, their early stage in litigation, the  number of defendants involved, and the substantial  discovery to be had are the kind of ""special  circumstances"" that warrant appellate review. See  Ebrahimi,  114  F.3d  at  168.  Accordingly,  the  district [**15]  court did not abuse its discretion in finding  no just reason to delay the appeal. Consequently, this  Court has jurisdiction over the appeal under 28 U.S.C. §  1291 and we need not reach the question of whether  the district court properly certified its rulings as  immediately appealable under Section 1292(b). III. STANDARD OF REVIEW 21 F.4th 714, *721; 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 38060, **11 Page 9 of 14 HN5[ ] This Court ""review[s] an order granting a  motion to dismiss with prejudice de novo, applying the  same standards the district court used."" Young  Apartments, Inc. v. Town of Jupiter, 529 F.3d 1027,  1037 (11th Cir. 2008). As such, we must accept all  factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe  them ""in the light most favorable to the plaintiff."" Id.  ""Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of  action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do  not suffice."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.  Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). Instead, a plaintiff  must allege sufficient facts that, ""accepted as true, []  'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'"" Id.  (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570,  127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). IV. DISCUSSION A. Defining a Beneficiary Claim At its core, this is a case about statutory interpretation.  HN6[ ] We begin that task, as always, with the  common and ordinary meaning of the words used in a  statute. See Consol. Bank, N.A. v. U.S. Dep't of  Treasury, 118 F.3d 1461, 1464 (11th Cir. 1997) (""In the  absence of a statutory definition of a term, we look to  the common usage of words for their meaning.""); see  also CBS Inc. v. PrimeTime 24 Joint Venture, 245 F.3d  1217, 1222 (11th Cir. 2001) (stating that, [**16]  when  the statutory text is unambiguous, this Court should  begin and end its analysis with the text's plain meaning). HN7[ ]  The  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1591, prohibits the sex  trafficking of children or adults by force, fraud, or  coercion. In addition to that criminal prohibition, the Act  provides sex-trafficking victims with a civil cause of  action against ""the perpetrator (or whoever knowingly  benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value  from participation in a venture which that person knew  or should have known has engaged in an act in violation  of this chapter)."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). For purposes of  this appeal, we assume that the Does are sex-trafficking  victims under the TVPRA. The only question for this  Court, therefore, is whether the Does have plausibly  alleged that the franchisors are liable. The Does allege  that the franchisors are liable because they knowingly  benefited from participation in a venture that they should  have known violated Section 1591(a). That allegation  can be broken down into four component parts: that the  franchisors (1) knowingly benefited (2) from participating  in a venture; (3) that venture violated the TVPRA as to  the Does; and (4) the franchisors knew or [**17]  should  have known that the venture violated the TVPRA as to  the Does. We address each part in turn. The parties do not meaningfully dispute the first  element, and we likewise have little difficulty in deciding  what ""knowingly benefits"" means. HN8[ ] ""Knowledge""   [*724]  is ""[a]n awareness or understanding of a fact or  circumstance; a state of mind in which a person has no  substantial doubt about the existence of a fact.""  Knowledge, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). And  Section 1595(a) explains that a defendant may benefit  ""financially  or  by  receiving  anything  of  value.""  Accordingly, a plaintiff like the Does must allege that the  defendant knew it was receiving some value from  participating in the alleged venture. Most of the parties' dispute concerns the second  element—to knowingly benefit from participating in a  venture. The franchisors argue, and the district court  held, that we should incorporate the definition of  ""participation in a venture"" from the criminal provisions  in  Section  1591.  Section  1591(e)(4)  defines  ""participation in a venture"" as ""knowingly assisting,  supporting, or facilitating a violation of subsection  (a)(1),"" which criminalizes ""commercial sex act[s]"" of  minors or obtained through threat or force. For the  following reasons, we disagree [**18]  with transposing  the statutory definition from this criminal section to the  civil cause of action. First, although we usually presume that Congress  intends phrases in the same statute to mean the same  thing, see, e.g., Law v. Siegel, 571 U.S. 415, 422, 134  S. Ct. 1188, 188 L. Ed. 2d 146 (2014), the text of this  statute overcomes that presumption. HN9[ ] Section  1591 clearly states that its definition of ""participation in a  venture"" applies only ""[i]n this section."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(e). That is, by its plain terms, the definition applies  only to the phrase as used in Section 1591 of the  statute. That limited application makes sense; Section  1591 carries criminal penalties, whereas Section 1595  does not. Presumably because it imposes criminal  liability, Section 1591(a) includes a scienter requirement  that does not appear in Section 1595(a)--a defendant  must know ""that means of force, threats of force, fraud,  coercion . . . , or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a commercial  sex act."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Second, the civil provisions of Section 1595(a) make no  sense with Section 1591's definition of ""participation in a  venture"" read in. A plaintiff can sue a perpetrator of sex  trafficking—i.e., someone who has violated the criminal  statute—without resort to the beneficiary cause of  21 F.4th 714, *723; 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 38060, **15 Page 10 of 14 action. To state a beneficiary claim, however, a plaintiff  must allege that the defendant [**19]  ""knowingly  benefit[ted], financially or by receiving anything of value  from participation in a venture which that person knew  or should have known has engaged in an act in violation  of this chapter."" See 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). If we replace  ""participation in a venture"" with Section 1591(e)(4)'s  ""knowingly assisting, supporting, or facilitating a  violation of subsection (a)(1),"" we get a nonsense  sentence:  benefited  ""from  [knowingly  assisting,  supporting, or facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)]  which that person knew or should have known has  engaged in an act in violation of this chapter."" In other  words, the franchisors' formulation requires a plaintiff to  prove that the defendant knowingly facilitated a  violation, making the ""should have known"" language  superfluous. HN10[ ] Instead of incorporating Section 1591(e)(4)'s  idiosyncratic definition of ""participation in a venture,"" we  interpret that phrase in Section 1595(a) according to its  plain meaning. The ordinary meaning of ""venture"" is an  undertaking or enterprise involving risk and potential  profit. See Venture, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed.  2019) (""[a]n undertaking that involves risk; esp., a  speculative commercial enterprise""); Venture, Oxford  English Dictionary 520 (2d ed. 1989) (""[a]n enterprise of  a business nature in which [**20]  there is considerable   [*725]  risk of loss as well as chance of gain; a  commercial speculation""). The ordinary meaning of  participate or participation is to take part in or share with  others  in  common  or  in  an  association.  See  Participation, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019)  (""[t]he act of taking part in something""); Participate,  Oxford English Dictionary 268 (2d ed. 1989) (""[a] taking  part, association, or sharing (with others) in some action  or matter""). Accordingly, we conclude that the phrase  ""participation in a venture"" requires that the Does allege  that the franchisors took part in a common undertaking  or enterprise involving risk and potential profit. The third element of the Does' claim is that the venture  in which the defendant participated and from which it  knowingly benefited must have violated the TVPRA as  to the plaintiff. The TVPRA criminalizes various acts, but  the Does specifically premise their Section 1595(a)  beneficiary claims on violations of Section 1591(a).  HN11[ ] Section 1591(a) makes it a crime to  ""knowingly"" harbor or solicit a person for commercial  sex while ""knowing . . . that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion . . . , or any combination of such  means will be used to cause the person to engage  in [**21]  a commercial sex act."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a).  Section 1591(a) also prohibits anyone from knowingly  ""benefit[ting], financially or by receiving anything of  value""  from  ""knowingly  assisting,  supporting,  or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)."" Id. at  1591(a)(2) & (e)(4). Consequently, the Does must plead  sufficient facts to plausibly allege that the venture in  which the franchisors participated committed one of  these crimes against them. HN12[ ] Fourth, the defendant must have either actual  or constructive knowledge that the venture—in which it  voluntarily participated and from which it knowingly  benefited—violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff.  Section 1595(a) requires that the defendant ""knew or  should have known [that the venture] has engaged in an  act in violation of this chapter."" Knowledge requires ""[a]n  awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance.""  Knowledge, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019).  Constructive knowledge, on the other hand, is that  knowledge which ""one using reasonable care or  diligence  should  have.""  Constructive  Knowledge,  Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). Thus, the fran- chisors may be liable under the TVPRA if they have  either actual or constructive knowledge that the venture  in which they participated and from which they  benefited [**22]  violated the TVPRA as to the Does. In defining these elements according to their plain  meaning, we depart from some courts and agree with  others. The district courts are all over the map on the  meaning of these terms. See, e.g., A.B. v. Hilton  Worldwide Holdings Inc., 484 F.Supp.3d 921, 937 (D.  Or. 2020) (collecting cases). But most district courts, like  us, have rejected the idea that a court can transpose the  definition of ""participation in a venture"" from the criminal  section to the civil cause of action. See, e.g., A.B. v.  Marriott Int'l, Inc., 455 F.Supp.3d 171, 183 (E.D. Pa.  2020). As for our sister circuits, only the First Circuit has  addressed a Section 1595(a) beneficiary claim. See  Ricchio v. McLean, 853 F.3d 553, 556-58 (1st Cir.  2017). And we think our reasoning is consistent with the  disposition there. In Ricchio, the plaintiff sued the owner  and live-in operators of a hotel where she was held  hostage and sexually abused. Id. at 556. The First  Circuit held that the plaintiff had plausibly alleged that  the operators' association with the plaintiff's sex  trafficker was a ""venture"" because her abuser ""had prior  commercial dealings with the [operators], which the  parties wished to reinstate for profit."" Id. at 555.  Considering  [*726]  these dealings, the plaintiff also  plausibly alleged that, by renting a room to the abuser,  the operators were ""associating with him in an effort to  force [the plaintiff] to serve their [**23]  business  21 F.4th 714, *724; 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 38060, **18 Page 11 of 14 objective."" Id. We agree that these kinds of allegations  would establish a hotel operator's participation in a  venture with a sex trafficker. HN13[ ] In short, we hold that, to state a beneficiary  claim under Section 1595(a), a plaintiff must plausibly  allege that the defendant (1) knowingly benefited, (2)  from taking part in a common undertaking or enterprise  involving risk and potential profit, (3) that undertaking or  enterprise violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff, and (4)  the defendant had constructive or actual knowledge that  the undertaking or enterprise violated the TVPRA as to  the plaintiff. B. The Does' Beneficiary Claims Against the  Franchisors Having defined the elements of a beneficiary claim, we  now consider whether the Does have stated such a  claim against these three hotel franchisors for the  operation of these two hotels. We conclude that they  have not. Specifically, the Does have not plausibly  alleged that these three hotel franchisors participated in  a venture that violated the TVPRA. We begin with the venture the Does say that the  franchisors participated in. Throughout their complaints,  the Does alleged that the franchisors participated in ""sex  trafficking ventures."" On the first [**24]  page of the  complaints, they referred to ""sex trafficking ventures""  that the ""Defendants were essential to the success of.""  On the next page they alleged that ""[e]ach of  Defendants' hotels hosted one or more hotel sex  trafficking  ventures.""  They  stated  that  ""several  Defendants' agents and employees actively participated  in sex trafficking ventures and were rewarded for doing  so."" They subtitled the allegations against each  franchisor as ""The Suburban Extended Stay (Chamblee)  Sex Trafficking Venture"" and ""The Microtel (Atlanta) Sex  Trafficking Venture."" Over and over, they repeated this  phrase: sex trafficking venture. In fact, every single  reference to a ""venture"" in the complaints refers to a  ""sex trafficking venture."" Then, the Does alleged that the  franchisors profited from this ""sex trafficking venture""               through room fees and should have known that this  venture victimized them in violation of the TVPRA. So we must determine whether the Does plausibly  alleged that the franchisors took part in the common  undertaking of sex trafficking with hotel employees,  management, owners, and sex traffickers. On this  complaint, they did not. The Does alleged that  Wyndham ""licenses its hotel brands, [**25]  including  Microtel . . . to franchisees who pay Wyndham royalty  and other fees based on a percentage of their gross  room revenue."" They alleged that Choice ""received a  percentage of the revenue generated by the operation  of the Suburban Extended Stay (Chamblee), including a  percentage of the revenue generated for the rate  charged on the rooms in which"" each Doe was  trafficked. They also alleged that each of the franchisors  ""owned, managed, supervised, operated, oversaw,  controlled the operation of, and/or were inextricably  connected to the renting of rooms"" at the hotels. These  allegations may suggest  [*727]  that the franchisors  financially benefitted from renting hotel rooms to the  Does' sex traffickers. But they do nothing to show that  the franchisors participated in a common undertaking  involving risk or profit that violated the TVPRA—i.e., the  alleged sex trafficking ventures. The Does also alleged that the franchisors investigated  the individual hotels, took remedial action when revenue  was down, read online reviews mentioning prostitution  and crime occurring generally at the hotels, and  controlled the training of managers and employees who  were allegedly involved in facilitating sex [**26]   trafficking at the hotels. Again, these allegations are  insufficient to state a claim. None of these allegations  suggest that the franchisors participated in an alleged  common undertaking or enterprise with the Does' sex  traffickers or others at the hotel who violated the statute. Perhaps recognizing their tenuous legal position, the  Does allege something different on appeal: that the  franchisors participated in commercial ventures to  operate hotels and that those hotel ventures violated the  statute. There are two problems with that new theory.  First, it is incompatible with the allegations in the Does'  complaints. Again, every time the complaints refer to  ventures, they refer to ""sex trafficking ventures."" And  those ventures were alleged to include the sex  traffickers themselves as participants. On the other  hand, there are no nonconclusory allegations in the  complaint about the franchisors' business relationship  with anyone else involved in operating these hotels.  Second, the Does failed to present this theory to the  21 F.4th 714, *726; 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 38060, **23 Page 12 of 14 district court when given the opportunity. This was no  oversight. The district court granted the Does leave to  amend their complaints, yet they still alleged ""sex  trafficking [**27]  ventures."" The district court then  dismissed the franchisors without prejudice, specifically  so that the Does could later amend their complaints to  add them back. The Does chose instead to request that  dismissal be entered with prejudice. We will not  consider this theory for the first time on appeal after the  Does were given ample opportunity to present it in the  district court. Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., 385  F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir. 2004). HN14[ ] In short, to participate in a venture under  Section 1595(a), a defendant must take part in a  common undertaking involving risk or profit. The Does  chose to frame the ventures at issue as sex trafficking  ventures in their amended complaints. Yet they have  provided no plausible allegations that the franchisors  took part in the common undertaking of sex trafficking.  Their only allegations as to the franchisors' knowledge  or participation in those sex trafficking ventures are that  the franchisors sent inspectors to the hotels who would  have seen signs of sex trafficking and that they received  reviews mentioning sex work occurring at the hotels. But  observing something is not the same as participating in  it. Accordingly, the Does' Section 1595(a) beneficiary  claims against the franchisors fail. C. State Law Claims We also affirm the district [**28]  court's dismissal of the  Does' Georgia RICO Act and negligence claims against  the franchisors. The Does argue that the district court erred by failing to  accept their allegations when dismissing their RICO  claims. And they argue that they plausibly alleged the  predicate acts of prostitution and sexual servitude.  Finally, they argue that the district court applied an  incorrect standard in determining that they had failed to  plausibly allege a criminal agreement. As part of that  argument, the Does explain that to  [*728]  establish an  agreement for purposes of a RICO conspiracy, they  need only allege ""a mere tacit understanding between  two or more people that they will pursue a particular  criminal objective."" And they continue that they plausibly  alleged such ""a tacit understanding between the  Franchisors and their franchisees to turn a blind eye to  allow and profit from the sex trafficking at the Microtel  and SES."" We disagree. Accepting all allegations in the amended complaints, the  Does have failed to plausibly allege a Georgia RICO  claim. First, the Does alleged that the franchisors  violated O.C.G.A. §§ 16-14-4(a) and (c). Section 16-14- 4(a) makes it illegal ""for any person, through a pattern of  racketeering  activity  or  proceeds  derived [**29]   therefrom, to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly,  any interest in or control of any enterprise, real property,  or personal property of any nature, including money."" A  ""pattern of racketeering activity"" means ""[e]ngaging in at  least two acts of racketeering activity in furtherance of  one or more incidents, schemes, or transactions that  have the same or similar intents, results, accomplices,  victims, or methods of commission or otherwise are  interrelated by distinguishing characteristics."" O.C.G.A.  § 16-14-3(4)(A). A ""racketeering activity"" is the  commission,  attempted  commission,  solicitation,  coercion, or intimidation of another ""to commit any crime  which is chargeable by indictment under"" Georgia law.  Id. at § 16-14-3(5)(A). And ""[a]ny person who is injured  by reason of any violation of Code Section 16-4-4 shall  have a cause of action"" against the violator. Id. at § 16- 14-6(c). The Does alleged that the franchisors ""as parties to the  crime, and as co-conspirators"" subjected them to sexual  servitude in violation of O.C.G.A. § 16-5-46(c)(1) ""when  they were coerced into performing or conducting  sexually explicit conduct for which something of value,  directly or indirectly, was given, promised to, or received  by someone."" That ""threadbare recital[]"" of the elements  of [**30]  ""sexual servitude"" is insufficient to plausibly  allege a violation of Section 16-5-46(c)(1). See Iqbal,  556 U.S. at 663. The Does also alleged that the franchisors committed  false imprisonment, keeping a place of prostitution,  pimping, and pandering, in violation of Georgia law.  Each allegation contained no more than a threadbare  recital of the elements of the crimes supported by  conclusory allegations. Accordingly, the Does failed to  plausibly allege the predicate acts necessary to support  their RICO claims. The district court did not err in  dismissing the Does' substantive RICO claims against  the franchisors. HN15[ ] Section 16-14-4(c) makes it illegal ""for any  person to conspire or endeavor to violate"" Section 16- 14-4(a). To violate Section 16-14-4(c), one must either  commit an overt act to ""effect the object of"" the  endeavor or conspiracy or a co-conspirator must commit  such an overt act. See O.C.G.A. § 16-14-4(c)(1)-(2).  The Does alleged that the franchisors conspired ""to  acquire money through a pattern of racketeering  21 F.4th 714, *727; 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 38060, **26 Page 13 of 14 activity."" But the pattern of racketeering activity on which  they predicate their conspiracy counts relies on the  same threadbare allegations as the substantive RICO  claims. Because those allegations are insufficient to  plausibly allege any RICO violation, the district court  also correctly dismissed [**31]  the Does' conspiracy  counts. Finally, the district court dismissed the Does' negligence  claims after concluding that the amended complaints  merely alleged ordinary franchise relationships ""which  do not give rise to vicarious liability against franchisors.""  HN16[ ] A franchisor that ""maintain[s] no control over  the operation of the [franchise]"" and ""simply provide[s]   [*729]   supplies  and  consultation  services""  to  franchisee employees does not owe a duty to patrons of  the franchise. Cobb v. Popeye's, Inc., 188 Ga. App. 443,  373 S.E.2d 233, 235 (Ga. Ct. App. 1988). Such a duty  only arises if the franchisor retains a right to control the  day-to-day  operations  of  the  franchise.  See  Schlotzsky's, Inc. v. Hyde, 245 Ga. App. 888, 538  S.E.2d 561, 562 (Ga. Ct. App. 2000). The Does allege that the franchisors ""owned and/or  managed and/or operated and/or oversaw and/or  controlled the operation"" of their hotels and that they  ""had supervisory control over"" the hotels. Those  allegations are mere recitations of the requirements for  franchisor liability, and the Does do not allege any facts  to support them. Accordingly, they have failed to  plausibly allege that the franchisors owed the Does a  duty. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663. The Does' argument that the franchisors ratified the acts  of the franchisees also fails. HN17[ ] Under O.C.G.A. §  10-6-1, a principal-agent relationship arises when one  party ""subsequently ratifies the acts [**32]  of another in  his behalf."" A party ratifies the acts of another by  accepting and retaining the benefits of the other party's  alleged unauthorized act. DaimlerChrysler Motors Co. v.  Clemente, 294 Ga. App. 38, 668 S.E.2d 737, 746 (Ga.  Ct. App. 2008). But the principal must also have ""full  knowledge of all the material facts"" for that acceptance  and retention to constitute ratification. Hyer v. Citizens &  S. Nat'l Bank in Macon, 188 Ga. App. 452, 373 S.E.2d  391, 393 (Ga. Ct. App. 1988). The Does did not plausibly allege that the franchisors  had ""full knowledge of all the material facts"" regarding  the franchise employees' actions in assisting and  facilitating sex trafficking. The Does argue otherwise  based on their allegations that the franchisors sent  inspectors to the hotels ""while hotel employees either  assisted or at the very least, turned a blind eye"" to the  trafficking occurring there. But that allegation alone does  not rise to the level of plausibly alleging the franchisors'  full knowledge of all material facts. Accordingly, the  Does did not plausibly allege that the franchisors ratified  the franchise employees' actions, and the district court  did not err in dismissing the negligence claims.",1
Doe v. Twitter,"[*893]  ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING  IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS FIRST AMENDED  COMPLAINT Re: Dkt. No. 48 I. INTRODUCTION Plaintiffs John Doe #1 and John Doe #2 allege that  when they were thirteen years  [*894]  old they were  solicited  and  recruited  for  sex  trafficking  and  manipulated into providing to a third-party sex trafficker  pornographic videos (""the Videos"") of themselves  through the social media platform Snapchat. A few  years later, when Plaintiffs were still in high school, links  to the Videos were posted on Twitter. Plaintiffs allege  that when they learned of the posts, they informed law  enforcement and urgently requested that Twitter remove  them but Twitter initially refused to do so, allowing the  posts to remain on Twitter, where they accrued more  than 167,000 views and 2,223 retweets. According to  Plaintiffs, it wasn't until the mother of one of the boys  contacted an agent of the Department of Homeland  Security, who initiated contact with Twitter and  requested the removal of the material, that Twitter finally  took down the posts, nine days later. Plaintiffs assert state and federal claims against Twitter  based on its alleged involvement in and/or enabling of  sex trafficking and [**3]  the distribution of the child  pornography containing their images. Twitter, however,  contends that even after Congress's enactment of the  Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act and Stop Enabling  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *889; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **157158 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *889; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **157158 Page 6 of 34 Sex Traffickers Act in 2018, the conduct alleged by  Plaintiffs is shielded from liability under Section 230 of  the Communications Decency Act (""CDA""). Thus,  Twitter brings a Motion to Dismiss First Amended  Complaint (""Motion"") seeking dismissal of all of  Plaintiffs' claims on the basis that it is immune from  liability under the CDA. In the Motion, Twitter also  contends Plaintiffs fail to state viable claims as to many  of their claims. A hearing on the Motion was held on  August 6, 2021. For the reasons stated below, the  Motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. II. BACKGROUND A. First Amended Complaint Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (""FAC""), which is the  operative  complaint,  contains  detailed  allegations  describing: 1) Twitter's platform, business model and  content moderation policies and practices (FAC ¶¶ 23- 51); 2) the ways Twitter allegedly permits and even aids  in the distribution of child pornography on its platform  and profits from doing so (FAC ¶¶ 52-84); 3) how  pornographic content featuring John [**4]  Doe #1 and  John Doe #2 was created and eventually ended up on  Twitter's platform (FAC ¶¶ 85-100); and 4) Twitter's  response to requests that the pornographic photos and  videos containing Plaintiffs' images be removed from  Twitter (FAC ¶¶ 101-132). Based on these allegations, Plaintiffs assert the  following claims: 1) violation of the Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act (""TVPRA""), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a)(1)  and 1595(a) based on the allegation that ""Twitter knew,  or was in reckless disregard of the fact, that through  monetization and providing, obtaining, and maintaining  [child sexual abuse material (""CSAM"")] on its platform,  Twitter and Twitter users received something of value  for the video depicting sex acts of John Doe #1 and  John Doe #2 as minors."" FAC ¶¶ 133-143 (Claim One); 2) violation of the TVPRA, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a)(2) and  1595(a), based on the allegation that Twitter ""knowingly  benefited, or should have known that it was benefiting,  from assisting, supporting, or facilitating a violation of  1591(a)(1)."" FAC ¶¶ 144-155 (Claim Two);    [*895]  3) violation of the duty to report child sexual  abuse material under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2258A and 2258B.

Statutory Background 1. The CDA The  CDA  was  enacted  as  part  of  the  Telecommunications Act of 1996. It contains a ""Good  Samaritan""  provision  that  immunizes  interactive  computer service (""ICS"") providers from liability for  restricting access to certain types of materials or giving  users the technical means to restrict access to such  materials, providing [**8]  as follows: (c) Protection for ""Good Samaritan"" blocking  and screening of offensive material (1) Treatment of publisher or speaker No provider or user of an interactive computer  service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker  of any information provided by another information  content provider. (2) Civil liability No provider or user of an interactive computer  service shall be held liable on account of— (A) any action voluntarily taken in good faith to  restrict access to or availability of material that the  provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd,  lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or  otherwise objectionable, whether or not such  material is constitutionally protected; or (B) any action taken to enable or make available to  information  content  providers  or  others  the  technical means to restrict access to material  described in paragraph (1). 47 U.S.C. § 230(c). ""This grant of immunity dates back to the early days of  the internet when concerns first arose about children  being able to access online pornography."" Enigma  Software Grp. USA, LLC v. Malwarebytes, Inc., 946  F.3d 1040, 1046 (9th Cir. 2019), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct.  13, 208 L. Ed. 2d 197 (2020). At that time, ""[p]arents  could not program their computers to block online  pornography, and this was at least partially due to a  combination of trial court decisions in New [**9]  York  that had deterred the creation of online-filtration efforts.""  Id. Under the New York cases, ""if a provider remained  passive and uninvolved in filtering third-party material  from its network, the provider could not be held liable for  any offensive content it carried from third parties."" Id.  (citing Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe, Inc., 776 F. Supp.  135, 139-43 (S.D.N.Y. 1991)). On the other hand, ""once  a service provider undertook to filter offensive content  from its network, it assumed responsibility for any  offensive content it failed to filter, even if it lacked  knowledge of the content."" Id. (citing Stratton Oakmont,  Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co., 1995 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS  229, 1995 WL 323710, *5 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. May 24,  1995)). ""The Stratton Oakmont decision, along with the  increasing public concern about pornography on the  internet, served as catalysts"" for the enactment of the  CDA. Id. HN1[ ] The Ninth Circuit has interpreted CDA § 230  broadly: so long as an interactive computer service  provider is not also an ""information content provider,""  that is, someone who is ""responsible, in whole or in part,  for the creation or development of"" the offending  content, it is immune from liability arising from content  created by third parties. Fair Hous. Council of San  Fernando Valley v. Roommates.Com,  [*897]  LLC, 521  F.3d 1157, 1162 (9th Cir. 2008) (citing 47 U.S.C. §§  230(c), (f)). Thus, a defendant is entitled to immunity  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *895; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **6 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *895; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **6 Page 8 of 34 under the CDA if: 1) it is a ""provider or user of an  interactive computer service,"" 2) the information  for [**10]  which the plaintiff seeks to hold the defendant  liable was ""information provided by another information  content provider,"" and 3) the complaint seeks to hold the  defendant liable as the ""publisher or speaker"" of that  information. Klayman v. Zuckerberg, 753 F.3d 1354,  1357, 410 U.S. App. D.C. 187 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (citing 47  U.S.C. § 230(c)(1)); see also Pennie v. Twitter, Inc., 281  F. Supp. 3d 874, 890 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (finding that  under Section 230 Twitter was immune from claims  based on theory that third-party content Twitter allowed  to be posted on its platform led to plaintiff's injury  because the claim sought to hold Twitter liable as a  publisher). As expressly stated in Section 230, the policies  underlying the enactment of that section (1) United States District Court Northern District of  California are: (2) to promote the continued development of the  Internet and other interactive computer services  and other interactive media; (3) to preserve the vibrant and competitive free  market that presently exists for the Internet and  other interactive computer services, unfettered by  Federal or State regulation; (4) to encourage the development of technologies  which maximize user control over what information  is received by individuals, families, and schools  who use the Internet and other interactive computer  services; (5) to remove disincentives for the development  and utilization [**11]  of blocking and filtering  technologies that empower parents to restrict their  children's access to objectionable or inappropriate  online material; and (6) to ensure vigorous enforcement of Federal  criminal laws to deter and punish trafficking in  obscenity, stalking, and harassment by means of  computer. 47 U.S.C. § 230(b). Section 230 expressly states that it has ""[n]o effect on  criminal law[,]"" providing that ""[n]othing in this section  shall be construed to impair the enforcement of section  223 or 231 of this title, chapter 71 (relating to obscenity)     or 110 (relating to sexual exploitation of children) of Title  18, or any other Federal criminal statute."" 47 U.S.C. §  230(e)(1). HN2[ ] It expressly preempts all state laws  that are inconsistent with Section 230's grant of  immunity. 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(3) (""No cause of action  may be brought and no liability may be imposed under  any State or local law that is inconsistent with this  section.""). 2. The TVPRA In 2000, Congress enacted the TVPRA, which  criminalized sex trafficking. When it enacted the  TVPRA, ""Congress declared that the purposes of the  [TVPRA] are to 'combat trafficking in persons, a  contemporary manifestation of slavery whose victims  are predominantly women and children, to ensure just  and effective punishment of traffickers, and to [**12]   protect their victims.'"" Ditullio v. Boehm, 662 F.3d 1091,  1094 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Pub.L. No. 106-386, §  102, 114 Stat. 1488 (2000) (codified as amended at 18  U.S.C. § 1589 et seq.)). In 2003, the law was expanded  to provide a private right of civil action for victims of sex  trafficking, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1595. Id. ""The  version of § 1595 enacted in 2003 limited the civil  remedy to victims of three specific  [*898]  trafficking  acts (including sex trafficking of minors), and did not  expressly permit recovery against individuals who  benefit from participation in a trafficking venture."" Id. n.  1 (citing Pub.L. 108-193, § 4(a)(4)(A), 117 Stat. 2878  (2003)). ""In the [TVPRA's] 2008 reauthorization,  Congress deleted those limitations."" Id. (citing Pub.L.  110-457, Title II, § 221(2), 122 Stat. 5067 (2008)). In its current form, the TVPRA makes it a crime to  engage in direct sex trafficking or to benefit financially  from sex trafficking, providing as follows: (a) Whoever knowingly— (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or  within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction  of the United States, recruits, entices, harbors,  transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains,  patronizes, or solicits by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or, except where the act constituting the  violation [**13]  of paragraph (1) is advertising, in  reckless disregard of the fact, that means of force,  threats of force, fraud, coercion described in  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *897; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **9 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *897; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **9 Page 9 of 34 subsection (e)(2), or any combination of such  means will be used to cause the person to engage  in a commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Section 1591(e) further provides  that ""[in] this section . . . [t]he term 'participation in a  venture' means knowingly assisting, supporting, or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(e)(4). The civil liability provision in its current form provides  that ""[a]n individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the perpetrator  (or whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by  receiving anything of value from participation in a  venture which that person knew or should have known  has engaged in an act in violation of this chapter) in an  appropriate district court of the United States and may  recover damages and reasonable attorneys fees."" 18  U.S.C. § 1595(a). 3. FOSTA In 2018, the CDA was amended by the Allow States and  Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017,  Pub. L. No. 115-164, 132 Stat. 1253 (2018) (""FOSTA""),  which inserted a new provision in CDA § 230  specifically [**14]  addressing the application of that  section in the context of sex trafficking law. See 47  U.S.C. § 230(e)(5). "" 'Congress passed [FOSTA] to  narrow Section 230's scope and provide prosecutors  with new tools to combat the sex trafficking of both  minors and adults.'"" J.B. v. G6 Hosp., LLC, No. 19-CV- 07848-HSG, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213, 2020 WL  4901196, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 20, 2020) (quoting  Woodhull Freedom Found. v. United States, 948 F.3d  363, 368, 445 U.S. App. D.C. 111 (D.C. Cir. 2020)); see  also 164 Cong. Rec. S1849-08, 164 Cong. Rec. S1849- 08, S1849 (reflecting that FOSTA was enacted in  response to an increase in sex trafficking resulting  from ""the presence of [sex trafficking] organizations  online that are using the ruthless efficiency of the  internet to sell women and children""). The legislative  history reflects that one of the websites of particular  concern to Congress was a sex trafficking website  called ""Backpage,"" which knowingly trafficked in young  women and children. See 164 Cong. Rec. S1849-08,  164 Cong. Rec. S1849-08, S1854 (""Why is this law so  important? If I am looking at this through a prosecutor's  lens, now all of  [*899]  the prosecutors in the country  can go after anyone who knowingly facilitates sex  trafficking online. I am not saying when it is by  accident, and I am not saying when it has slipped  through and they don't know it; I am talking about to  knowingly facilitate, which is what [B]ackpage was  doing."") (Senator [**15]  McCaskill). FOSTA's amendment of the CDA consisted of adding  Section 230(e)(5): (5) No effect on sex trafficking law Nothing in this section (other than subsection  (c)(2)(A)) shall be construed to impair or limit— (A) any claim in a civil action brought under section  1595 of Title 18, if the conduct underlying the claim  constitutes a violation of section 1591 of that title; (B) any charge in a criminal prosecution brought  under State law if the conduct underlying the  charge would constitute a violation of section 1591  of Title 18; or (C) any charge in a criminal prosecution brought  under State law if the conduct underlying the  charge would constitute a violation of section  2421A of Title 18, and promotion or facilitation of  prostitution is illegal in the jurisdiction where the  defendant's promotion or facilitation of prostitution  was targeted. 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5). "" 'HN3[ ] FOSTA narrowed the  scope of immunity for interactive computer service  providers, by providing that Section 230 has ""[n]o effect  on sex trafficking law,"" and shall not ""be construed to  impair or limit"" civil claims brought under TVPRA  Section 1595 or criminal charges brought under state  law if the underlying conduct would constitute a violation  of TVPRA Sections 1591 or 2421A.'"" J. B. v. G6 Hosp.,  LLC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213, 2020 WL 4901196,  at *4 (quoting Woodhull Freedom Found. v. United  States, 948 F.3d at 368) (quoting 132 Stat. at 1254). C. Contentions of the Parties 1. Motion Twitter argues in the Motion that it is [**16]  immune  under CDA § 230 as to all of Plaintiffs' claims. Motion at  2. According to Twitter, the amendment of Section 230  under FOSTA, permitting sex trafficking victims to  pursue civil claims under 18 U.S.C. § 1595 against an  interactive computer service provider where the provider  violates 18 U.S.C. § 1591, created only a narrow  exception to the immunity afforded under Section 230  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *898; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **13 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *898; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **13 Page 10 of 34 that was ""carefully targeted to remove civil immunity for  the few criminal websites that, unlike Twitter here, were  deliberately and knowingly assisting and profiting from  reprehensible crimes."" Id. Twitter contends, ""FOSTA's  language, its legislative history, and the pre-existing  case law on Section 1591 all point to the same  conclusion: civil claims can only proceed against sex  traffickers and those who knowingly benefit from their  affirmative participation in a sex trafficking venture."" Id. Twitter argues that here, Plaintiffs have failed to allege  facts showing that the exception to immunity created  under FOSTA applies because the FAC: 1) ""lacks any  facts showing that Twitter affirmatively participated in  any kind of venture with the Perpetrators, let alone a  sex trafficking venture""; 2) ""does not allege, as  required to establish a violation of Section 1591, any  facts establishing that Twitter [**17]  knew that Plaintiffs  were victims of sex trafficking or that the Videos were  evidence of this crime""; and 3) does not ""allege any  connection between the Perpetrators and Twitter or that  Twitter received any benefits because of the Videos."" Id.  Twitter further asserts that CDA § 230 protects it from  liability because ""Twitter did remove the Videos and  suspend the  [*900]  accounts that had posted them""  and it cannot be held liable under ""any applicable law""  simply because it did not take the videos down  immediately. Id. Twitter represents that it ""vigorously combats [child  sexual  exploitation  material  (""CSE"")]  through  a  combination of methods, including review of user  reports and the use of proprietary technology to  proactively identify and remove such material"" but that  ""given the sheer volume of Tweets posted every day on  Twitter's platform (hundreds of millions of Tweets posted  by over 190 million daily users), it is simply not possible  for Twitter - or the individuals who enforce its Rules and  policies - to find and remove all offending content  immediately or accurately in all cases."" Id. at 1. Twitter  points to its zero-tolerance policy for child sexual  exploitation materials, which is set forth [**18]  in its  Rules - to which users must agree when they create a  Twitter account. Id. at 6. According to Twitter, it also  ""utilizes multiple tools, including reports by the public . . .  , moderators who review reports of abuse and CSE  content, innovative technology and algorithms that  proactively  identify  abusive  content,  and  online  education and information sharing to combat online  abuse."" Id.

According to Twitter, in  enacting FOSTA, Congress did not intend ""for online  platforms like Twitter that proactively act against such  activity to be sued for their inadvertent failure to remove  content."" Id. at 2. The purpose of CDA § 230, according to Twitter, was ""to  ensure  that  interactive  computer  service  ('ICS')  providers would never have to choose 'between taking  responsibility for all messages and deleting no  messages at all,' which presents such providers a 'grim'  and illusory choice."" Id. at 3 (quoting Fair Hous. Council  of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.Com, LLC, 521  F.3d 1157, 1162-63 (9th Cir. 2008)). To achieve that  purpose,  it  asserts,  ""§  230  creates  broad  immunity [**19]  for claims against ICS providers based  on content created by users: 'No provider . . . of an  interactive computer service shall be treated as the  publisher or speaker of any information provided by  another information content provider.'"" Id. (quoting 47  U.S.C. § 230(c)(1)). Twitter contends this provision  ""bars all causes of action that seek to hold ICS  providers like Twitter liable for not removing content  created by a third-party."" Id. (citing Igbonwa v.  Facebook, Inc., 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173769, 2018  WL 4907632, at *5-7 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 9, 2018), aff'd, 786  F. App'x 104 (9th Cir. 2019)). Twitter asserts that FOSTA created only a narrow  exception to the immunity afforded under CDA § 230,  permitting a victim of sex trafficking to bring a civil  action under § 1595, but only "" 'if the conduct underlying  the claim constitutes a violation of [S]ection 1591,' the  criminal statute prohibiting sex trafficking."" Id. at 4  (citing 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)(A); Doe v. Kik Interactive,  482 F.Supp.3d 1242, 1251 (S.D. Fla. 2020) (""FOSTA  permits civil liability for websites only if the conduct  underlying the claim constitutes a violation of section  1591."")). This limitation is important, it contends,  because ""Section 1591 has more stringent mens rea  and required elements to meet than Section 1595."" Id.  Thus, Twitter argues, the FOSTA exception only applies  to ""openly malicious actors"" and does not otherwise  change the scope of immunity under CDA § 230. Id. at 5  (citing Kik, 482 F.Supp.3d at 1249-51); see also id. at 3.  According to Twitter, this [**20]  is apparent from the  legislative history. Id. (citing 164 Cong. Rec., at S1860- 62 (statement of Senator Durbin (""[FOSTA] is a narrowly  crafted bill that would ensure that Section 230 . . .

Supp. 3d 889, *899; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **16 Page 11 of 34 nuisance lawsuits against technology companies."")). Here, Twitter asserts, it meets all the requirements for  establishing immunity under CDA § 230, namely, that  (1) it is an ICS provider; (2) Plaintiffs' claims treat Twitter  as the publisher or speaker of the content in question;  and (3) someone other than Twitter provided or created  the content at issue. Id. at 8-11. Twitter argues further  that the FAC does not allege facts that would establish  that any exemption to CDA § 230 applies, including the  FOSTA exception that allows for the imposition of  liability where the ICS itself violates Section 1591, either  as a ""primary violator"" or a ""secondary participant"" that  'knowingly . . . benefits, financially or by receiving  anything of value, from participation in a venture' with a  primary violator."" Id. (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)). Id.  at 11-12.  [**21] With respect to Plaintiffs' claim that Twitter was a  primary participant in sex trafficking under Section  1591(a)(1), Twitter contends Plaintiffs' allegations fall  short because ""[t]o plead a primary violation, a plaintiff  must allege that the defendant 'provide[d], obtain[ed],  [and] maintain[ed] . . . a person"" knowing that he or she  ""will be . . . cause[d]"" to engage in a commercial sex  act."" Id. at 12 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1))  (emphasis added by Twitter). Twitter contends ""Plaintiffs  allege only that 'Twitter knowingly provided, obtained,  and maintained the Videos,' not Plaintiffs"" and therefore  they fail to allege a primary violation. Id. (quoting FAC ¶  141) (emphasis added by Twitter). Twitter also argues  that as to Plaintiffs' claims under both Section  1591(a)(1) and Section 1591(a)(2), those claims fall  short for the additional reason that Section 1591  ""requires a defendant to know that the victim 'will in the  future [be] cause[d] . . . to engage in prostitution.'"" Id. at  12 n. 10 (citing United States v. Todd, 627 F.3d 329,  334 (9th Cir. 2010)). According to Twitter, ""Plaintiffs  cannot plead that Twitter had such knowledge as the  FAC alleges that Plaintiffs had cut off contact with the  Perpetrators before the Videos were posted on Twitter's  platform."" Id. (citing FAC ¶¶ 94-96). Twitter contends Plaintiffs also fail to allege that it was a  secondary participant under Section 1591(a)(2). Id. at  12-19. According to Twitter, to establish that it is a  secondary participant, Plaintiffs must ""plead that Twitter  'knowingly . . . benefit[ed] . . . from participation in a  venture which has engaged in [sex trafficking] in  violation of [Section 1591(a)(1)].'"" Id. (quoting 18 U.S.C.  § 1591(a)(2)). It further asserts that Section 1591 was  amended by FOSTA to define ""[p]articipation in a  venture"" as ""knowingly assisting, supporting, or  facilitating"" a primary violation. Id. at 12 (quoting 18  U.S.C. § 1591(e)(4)) (emphasis added by Twitter)).  Twitter argues that neither of the grounds upon which  Plaintiffs rely to establish that Twitter was a secondary  participant - ""(i) Twitter's initial failure to find a violation  of its policies after reviewing the Video, or (ii) Twitter's  nine-day delay in removing the Videos"" - establishes it  was a secondary participant for three reasons. Id. ""First, Plaintiffs do not allege the existence of any type  of venture between Twitter and any party that has a  common purpose, much less facts [**22]  suggesting  'that [Twitter] actually participated in a sex-trafficking  venture' that had the common purpose of trafficking  Plaintiffs.""

In particular, Twitter asserts that  the FAC contains no factual allegations that it monetized  or benefited from the Videos, instead containing only  conclusory allegations that it did so, which are  insufficient.

[**23]  Id. at 16 (citing Geiss, 383  F.Supp.3d at 169-170). ""Third, the FAC does not contain any allegation that  Twitter had actual knowledge that Plaintiffs were victims  of sex trafficking or that it knew the Videos contained  evidence of this.""

According to Twitter,  Plaintiffs ""must show that Twitter knew specifically that  Plaintiffs had been sex trafficked, and deliberately  assisted the sex trafficking."" Id. at 17 (citing Kik, 482  F.Supp.3d  at  1251).  They  do  not  satisfy  this  requirement, Twitter asserts, because ""[t]he FAC . . .  contains no facts plausibly alleging that Twitter had  actual knowledge of Plaintiffs' prior interactions with the  Perpetrators"" or that it knew the perpetrators were sex  traffickers or that the videos related to commercial sex.  Id. at 18-19 (citing Noble, 335 F.Supp.3d at 524;  Lawson v. Rubin, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71582, 2018  WL 2012869, at *12-14 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 29, 2018); A.B. v.

Twitter argues that even if it is not immune under CDA §  230, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under Section 1595.  Id. at 19-21. First, it argues that Plaintiffs fail to allege  that Twitter is a perpetrator and therefore cannot  establish liability on the basis of primary liability. Id. at  19. To the extent that Plaintiffs assert their claim under  Section 1595 on a ""beneficiary"" theory the claim also  fails, Twitter asserts, because [**24]  Plaintiffs have not  alleged that Twitter participated in a venture with the  perpetrators or that Twitter should have known of  Plaintiffs' alleged sex trafficking. Id. at 19-21. Twitter further asserts that even if Plaintiffs' Section  1595 claim is not subject to immunity under CDA § 230,  their remaining claims are nonetheless barred because  FOSTA removes immunity only for claims asserted  under Section 1595. Id. at 21-22 (citing Kik, 482  F.Supp.3d at 1249; M. L. v. Craigslist Inc., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 166836, 2020 WL 6434845, at *9-10 (W.D.  Wash. Apr. 17, 2020); Doe v. Bates, 2006 U.S. Dist.

LEXIS  218207, 2020 WL 6822891, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 20,  2020)). Twitter argues further that Plaintiffs fail to state viable  claims under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2258A & 2258B, California  products liability law, as to any of their negligence  claims, under Cal. Civ. Code § 1708.85, or under Cal.  Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200. Id. at 22-25. Twitter  contends there is no private right of action as to18  U.S.C. §§ 2258A & 2258B. Id. at 22 (citing Abcarian v.  Levine, 972 F.3d 1019, 1025-26 (9th Cir. 2020)). It  challenges the California product liability claim on the  grounds that Plaintiffs ""do not allege physical injury or  property damage resulting from their use of a defective  product"" or even identify any product that is defective.  Id. at 22 (citing Hernandez v. Avis Budget Grp., Inc.,  2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 206835, 2017 WL 6406838, at *5  (E.D. Cal. Dec. 15, 2017); Griff v. Woejeckloski, 2017  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 222114, 2017 WL 8185857, at *3 (C.D.  Cal. March 20, 2017)). Twitter further asserts that to the  extent Plaintiffs base that claim on defective platform  design, it fails because product liability law is ""geared to  the tangible world."" Id. at 23 (citing Winter v. G.P.  Putnam's Sons, 938 F.2d 1033, 1034-35 (9th Cir. 1991);  Intellect Art Multimedia Inc. v.

Rptr. 756 (1989); Wilson v. Midway Games,  Inc., 198 F.Supp.2d 167, 172-73 (D. Conn. 2002)). With respect to Plaintiffs' negligence [**25]  claims  (Claims Six through Nine), Twitter challenges the  negligence per se and negligent infliction of emotional  distress claims (Claims Eight and Nine) on the basis  that they are not independent causes of action. Id. at 23  (citing J.B. v. G6 Hospitality LLC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  151213, 2020 WL 4901196, at *11; Sinclair for Tucker v.  Twitter, Inc., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 234164, 2019 WL  10252752, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 20, 2019)). As to the  two remaining negligence claims (Claims Six and  Seven), Twitter argues that they fail because Plaintiffs  have not alleged that Twitter owed them any duty. Id.  (citing Worldwide Media, Inc. v. Twitter, Inc., 2018 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 182700, 2018 WL 5304852, at *8-9 (N.D.  Cal. Oct. 24, 2018)). According to Twitter, Plaintiffs'  allegations that ""Twitter had a duty to protect"" them  because it knew of the Videos and failed to take them  down (FAC ¶¶ 112, 128, 194-95) are insufficient  because a defendant can only be liable for negligence  based on failure to act where there is a special  relationship between the parties and Plaintiffs have not  alleged such a relationship. Id. at 24. 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *902; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **23 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *902; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **23 Page 13 of 34 Twitter contends Plaintiffs' claim under California Civil  Code section 1708.85, which creates a private right of  action against a person ""who intentionally distributes""  private sexually explicit materials ""without consent"" fails  to state a claim because ""the FAC alleges no facts from  which the Court could infer that Twitter 'intentionally  distribute[d]' the Videos; rather, it makes a conclusory  allegation that '[b]y refusing to [**26]  remove or block  [the Videos], Twitter intentionally distributed' them"" Id.  (citing FAC ¶ 214). It argues further that ""liability is  precluded if the 'material was previously distributed by  another person,' Cal. Civ. Code § 1708.85(c)(6), and  here, the Videos were distributed first on a different  platform—Snapchat—by  two  individuals  (whom  Plaintiffs do not allege were the individual(s) who  trafficked them) months before  [*904]  Twitter ever  became aware of the Videos—@StraightBross and  @fitmalesblog."" Id. (citing FAC ¶¶ 87-89, 99, 100.) Finally, Twitter argues that Plaintiffs' UCL claim is  insufficiently pled because Plaintiffs have not alleged  any economic injury and therefore, they do not have  standing to assert the claim. Id. at 24 (citing Huynh v.  Quora, Inc., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 235733, 2019 WL  11502875, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 19, 2019)). Twitter  further contends Plaintiffs have not alleged an unfair  business practice because: 1) they have not pled any  statutory violation and therefore have not alleged an  unlawful act by Twitter; and 2) ""To the extent Plaintiffs'  claim is premised on an alleged misrepresentation (¶  230), it fails to meet Rule 9(b) because Plaintiffs do not  allege with particularity a misrepresentation by Twitter.""  Id. (citing Letizia v. Facebook Inc., 267 F. Supp. 3d  1235, 1244 (N.D. Cal. 2017)). Twitter also argues that  the claim fails because Plaintiffs have not alleged  actual [**27]  reliance, having failed to allege that they  ""ever used Twitter, saw or read its policies, or that  seeing those policies resulted in an economic injury."" Id. 2. Opposition In their Opposition, Plaintiffs reject Twitter's challenges  under CDA § 230, arguing that the claims in this case  are based on just the sort of knowing conduct that  Congress intended to exempt from Section 230 when it  enacted FOSTA. Opposition at 1. In particular, they  assert that Twitter knew that the Videos were being  widely distributed on its platform and that they contained  child pornography created as a result of sex trafficking  and deliberately allowed the posts to remain on Twitter.  Id. First, Plaintiffs argue that they have sufficiently alleged  their claims under the TVPRA, which FOSTA exempts  from CDA § 230, both on the basis of direct sex  trafficking under Section 1591(a)(1) and as a  beneficiary of sex trafficking under Section 1591(a)(2).  Id. at 3. With respect to direct sex trafficking, Plaintiffs  point to the language of Section 1591(a)(1), providing  for liability for a perpetrator who ""knowingly . . . recruits,  entices,  harbors,  transports,  provides,  obtains,  advertises, maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any  means a person,"" while ""knowing, or . . . in reckless  disregard of the fact [**28]  . . . that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act[.]"" Id. (quoting 18  U.S.C. § 1591(a)) (emphasis added). According to  Plaintiffs, ""the phrase 'by any means' is not defined and  contains no exception for electronic or virtual actions.""  Id. Further, they assert, while the statute does not define  the words ""provide[],"" ""obtain[ ],"" or ""maintain[ ],"" their  ordinary meaning as evidenced by dictionary definitions  - upon which the Ninth Circuit has relied to define other  undefined terms of the TVPRA -support the conclusion  that Plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient as to the first part  of Section 1591(a)(1) (establishing liability as to a  defendant that ""knowingly . . . recruits, entices, harbors,  transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains,  patronizes, or solicits by any means a person""). Id. at 3- 4. In particular, Plaintiffs contend they have satisfied this  requirement by alleging that ""Twitter made them  available, as depicted in a CSAM compilation video, to  users on Twitter, having gained or attained Plaintiffs by  the same electronic means, and having kept them in the  same existing state, all despite Plaintiffs' own reports  and objections."" Id. at 4 (citing [**29]  United States v.  Love, 743 F. App'x 138, 139 (9th Cir. 2018) (using  Webster's dictionary to define ""force"" in § 1591(a)(1)  charge against sex trafficker)). Plaintiffs further assert that child pornography can be  the basis for a TVPRA claim under Section 1591(a)(1),  including in cases where the perpetrator procures  pornographic material without having direct  [*905]   contact with the child or paying money for the material.  Id.at 4-5 (citing United States v. Flanders, 752 F.3d  1317, 1330 (11th Cir. 2014); United States v. Tollefson,  367 F. Supp. 3d 865, 878-880 (E.D. Wis. 2019)). Plaintiffs argues further that their allegations are  sufficient as to the second phrase of Section 1591(a)(1),  requiring that the conduct that is the basis for the claim  must have been ""knowing, or . . . in reckless disregard  of the fact . . . that the person has not attained the age  of 18 years and will be caused to engage in a  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *903; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **25 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *903; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **25 Page 14 of 34 commercial sex act[.]"" Id. at 5-6. According to Plaintiffs,  a ""commercial sex act"" is defined under the TVPRA as ""  'any sex act, on account of which anything of value is  given to or received by any person[.]'"" Id. at 6 (quoting  18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(3)). Here, they contend, they have  alleged ""actual knowledge"" in that they ""alleged that  they reported child sexual abuse material featuring them  to Twitter, depicting them engaged in sexual acts due to  extortion and blackmail (that is, in exchange for  'something of value')."" Id. (citing FAC ¶¶ 112, 114, 123).  They [**30]  also point to their allegation that ""John Doe  1 provided proof of his age to Twitter, that numerous  users commented on their belief that videos featured  minors and that one disseminating account had already  been reported to Twitter for CSAM."" Id. (citing FAC ¶¶  101-102, 114, 121-122). Plaintiffs argue that ""[t]aken  together, these allegations are more than sufficient to  indicate that Twitter knew, or at least was in reckless  disregard of, Plaintiffs' status as minors when engaging  in the commercial sex acts at issue."" Id. at 5-6. Plaintiffs also argue that they state a claim on the basis  of beneficiary liability under Section 1595(a) and Section  1591(a)(2), addressing the requirements of both  provisions; according to Plaintiffs, Sections 1591(a)(2)  and 1595(a) ""have similar provisions for those who  benefit  financially,  and  distinct  requirements  for  participation in a venture and the requisite level of  knowledge."" Id. at 6. With respect to whether Plaintiffs have alleged that  Twitter knowingly ""benefited financially or by receiving  anything of value,"" Plaintiffs contend they have satisfied  this requirement by alleging that Twitter both monetizes  the CSAM on its platform and gains more viewers from  CSAM, which makes the platform more popular  and [**31]  attracts advertisers. Id. at 6-7. In support of  this argument, it points to B.M. v. Wyndham, 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *4 (N.D. Cal.  July 30, 2020). Id. According to Plaintiffs, in that case  the Court rejected the defendant's argument that a  plaintiff asserting a claim under Sections 1591(a)(2) and  1595(a) was required to show that the financial benefit  ""must [have] derive[d] directly from, and [been]  knowingly received in exchange for, participation in a  sex trafficking venture."" Id. at 7 (quoting B.M., 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *4  (internal citations omitted) (alterations added)). Instead,  Plaintiffs assert, the court in B.M. found ""that § 1595  claims could not be subjected to the same knowledge  standard as § 1591 without undermining the 'should  have known' language, and the Court concluded that it  was sufficient to allege that the hotels knowingly  received revenue from room rentals."" Id. (citing B.M.,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at  *4) (internal citations omitted). Plaintiffs reject Twitter's argument that ""any benefit [it]  receives must have a causal relationship to the sex  trafficking[,]"" arguing that the cases upon which it relies  - Geiss v. Weinstein Co. Holdings LLC, 383 F.Supp. 3d  156, 169 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) and Kolbek v. Twenty First  Century Holiness Tabernacle Church, Inc., 2013 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 180463, 2013 WL 6816174, at *16 (W.D.  Ark. Dec. 24, 2013) - are not on point. Id. at 8 (citing  Motion at 13, 15). Even if Twitter is correct,  [*906]   Plaintiffs contend, they have demonstrated such a  connection through the allegations in the FAC. Id. at 8- 10. Plaintiffs argue that many [**32]  of Twitter's  assertions as to their allegations are contradicted by the  FAC and provide a list of examples comparing specific  claims about the allegations made by Twitter with the  actual allegations in the FAC. Id. Next, Plaintiffs address whether they have adequately  alleged that Twitter participated in what it knew or  should have known was a sex trafficking venture. Id. at  10-16. According to Plaintiffs, Sections 1591(a)(2) and  1595  contain  distinct  requirements.  Id.  at  10.  ""Participation in a venture"" for the purposes of Section  1591(a)(2) means ""knowingly assisting, supporting, or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1)."" Id. (quoting  18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(4)). Plaintiffs contend they have  alleged a violation of subsection (a)(1) for the reasons  discussed above and therefore have satisfied that  aspect of the definition of ""participation in a venture""  under Section 1591(a)(2). Id. at 11. Further, they reject  Twitter's arguments that it did not participate in a  venture that it knew was sex trafficking, which they  characterize are as follows: ""(1) Twitter did not have a  common purpose with the initial sex traffickers, (2)  Twitter was at most a passive beneficiary of sex  trafficking profits, and (3) Twitter does not know what  sex trafficking is."" Id. As to the ""common purpose"" argument, Plaintiffs [**33]   contend Twitter relies on cases interpreting the  Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act  (""RICO"") in support of such a requirement, but that  these cases have no bearing on Plaintiffs' TVPRA  claims. Id. (citing Motion at 13 (citing United States v.  Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 101 S. Ct. 2524, 69 L. Ed. 2d  246 (1981); Washington v. Deleon, 2019 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 236640, 2019 WL 11691424 (N.D. Cal. July 9,  2019)). 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *905; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **29 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *905; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **29 Page 15 of 34 Plaintiffs argue that Twitter's passive beneficiary  argument also fails because it's reliance on Afyare, 632  F. App'x at 286, is misplaced. Id. at 11-12. According to  Plaintiffs, in Afyare the court offered an analogy ""that a  defendant who joins a soccer team whose members  include sex traffickers who sponsor the team financially,  does not violate § 1591(a)(2) unless that defendant  commits 'some overt act' that 'furthers the sex  trafficking aspect of the venture.'"" Id. at 11 (quoting  Motion at 14). Plaintiffs argue that Twitter's reliance on  that analogy to argue that there must be ""some overt act  that furthers the sex trafficking aspect of the venture""  should be rejected because ""[t]he decision's logic  doesn't apply where the beneficiary defendant is  engaging in illegal acts."" Id. at 12. In particular, they  assert, while playing soccer is a lawful venture, ""CSAM  possession and distribution are not."" Id. (citing 18  U.S.C. § 2252A). Thus, Plaintiffs assert, they have  alleged that Twitter engaged in overt acts that further  the sex trafficking venture [**34]  ""[b]y knowingly  hosting, possessing, and distributing the CSAM of  Plaintiffs, as Plaintiffs have alleged."" Id. Next, Plaintiffs reject Twitter's claims that it ""did not  know of the alleged sex trafficking"" (Motion at 17), that  ""there is no allegation that any of these submissions  informed Twitter that Plaintiffs were victims of sex  trafficking"" (Motion at 18), that ""none of the reports or  emails sent to Twitter about the videos indicated that  Plaintiffs had been sex trafficked or that they involved  commercial sex acts"" (Motion at 21), and that Plaintiffs  did not allege ""that the videos would have, on their face,  indicated to Twitter (or a reasonable viewer) that  Plaintiffs had been trafficked and the videos involved  commercial sex"" (Motion at 18). Id. at 12. Plaintiffs  argue that these claims are ""misleading and meritless""  in light of the allegations in the FAC. Id. at 12-13 (citing  FAC ¶¶ 52-53, 57,  [*907]  101-102, 112, 114, 121-123,  196). Likewise, they argue that Twitter's suggestion that  their claims are merely about ""delay,"" implying that it  acted in good faither in eventually taking action to  remove the Videos rather than doing so in response to  an intervening event (a request from the [**35]  federal  government that it take action) after refusing to take  action, is misleading. Id. at 12 n. 26. According to  Plaintiffs, ""unless the charge is advertising, § 1591(a),  nowhere does the TVPRA require that the defendant  actually knew that someone was a sex trafficking  victim to be liable. Reckless disregard or constructive  knowledge suffice for civil liability."" Id. (citing 18 U.S.C.  §§ 1591(a), 1595(a)). Thus, they contend, their  allegations are sufficient to establish knowledge of their  sex trafficking. Id. Plaintiffs also point to Section 1595, which they contend  under B.M. requires that they ""allege that Twitter (1)  'knowingly benefit[ted] financially or by receiving  anything of value'; (2) from participation in a venture; (3)  that they 'knew or should have known [had] engaged in'  sex trafficking.'"" Id. at 14 (quoting B.M., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *4). They  contend, ""[t]he B.M. court determined, as most courts  have, that the plaintiff 'is not required to allege an overt  act in furtherance of or actual knowledge of a sex  trafficking venture in order to sufficiently plead her  section 1595 civil liability claim[.]'"" Id. (quoting B.M.,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *4  and citing S.Y. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. &  Laxmi of Naples, LLC, No. 2:20-CV-619-JES-MRM,  2021 U.S. Dist.

Plaintiffs note  that Afyare, upon which Twitter relies to [**36]  assert  that an overt act is required, was a criminal action, in  contrast to B.M., and argue that under B.M. Plaintiffs are  not required to plead a § 1595 claim under a § 1591  standard. Id. (citing B.M., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *3; J.C. v.

Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp.  3d 959, 966 (S.D. Ohio 2019) is misplaced because is  mischaracterizes the facts and holding of that case. Id.  at 14-15. According to Plaintiffs, they have ""sufficiently  alleged that Twitter had constructive and actual  knowledge of Plaintiffs' sex trafficking, which it could  see for itself; the main crime happened in plain sight.""  Id. at 16. Plaintiffs  strenuously  disagree  with  Twitter's  characterization of the legislative history of FOSTA and  its argument that Congress intended to create only a  narrow exception for bad actors like Backpage. Id. at  16-19. Plaintiffs argue that in any event, they have  alleged conduct that is sufficient to fall within the  exception, and the question of ""how Twitter's actions  compare to Backpage is a factual question that cannot  be resolved at this stage of the litigation."" Id. Plaintiffs also argue that even apart from FOSTA, CDA  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *906; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **33 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *906; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **33 Page 16 of 34 § 230 was ""never intended to immunize conduct that  entails both criminal and civil liability."" Id. (citing Fair  Hous.  Council  of  San  Fernando  Valley  v.  Roommates.Com, LLC, 521 F.3d 1157, 1164 (9th Cir.  2008) (""The Communications Decency [**37]  Act was  not meant to create a lawless no-man's-land on the  Internet."")). In particular, they argue that the plain  language of Section 230(c) requires that an interactive  service provider ""take action in good faith to restrict  access to material, which is the opposite of  [*908]  what  Twitter did in the instant case."" Id. at 20 (emphasis in  original). Plaintiffs concede that ""[s]ome Ninth Circuit  decisions have interpreted the liability shield in CDA 230  to cover not just the removal of objectionable content,  but the decision whether to remove the content."" Id.  (citing Barnes v. Yahoo!, Inc., 570 F.3d 1096, 1102 (9th  Cir. 2009), as amended (Sept. 28, 2009) (citing Fair  Housing  Council  of  San  Fernando  Valley  v.  Roommates.com, LLC, 521 F.3d 1157, 1170-71 (9th  Cir. 2008)). According to Plaintiffs, ""[t]his interpretation  is not consistent with the plain language of § 230(c)(2),  which only limits liability for 'any action . . . to restrict  access' to harmful content[,]"" but these cases do not  apply here because ""they do not hold that CDA 230  immunizes a knowing decision to possess and distribute  CSAM and Twitter has pointed to no controlling  authority for such a proposition."" Id. at 21. Further, Plaintiffs assert, the stated purpose for CDA §  230 is inconsistent with Twitter's argument that it  creates ""immunity for all third-party content, even  contraband - specifically, child pornography[.]"" Id. The  title of Section 230 - ""Protection [**38]  for private  blocking and screening of offensive material"" - supports  this conclusion, Plaintiffs assert. Id. Likewise, the  policies stated in Section 230 indicate that it was  enacted ""to remove disincentives for the development  and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies that  empower parents to restrict their children's access to  objectionable or inappropriate online material,"" and ""to  ensure vigorous enforcement of Federal criminal laws to  deter and punish trafficking in obscenity, stalking, and  harassment by means of computer."" Id. (quoting 47  U.S.C.A. § 230(b)(4)-(5)). Twitter's position would  undermine these policies rather than advance them,  Plaintiffs assert. Id. Plaintiffs also argue that CDA § 230 does not apply to  their claim under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A and 2255 that  Twitter knowingly possessed and distributed child  pornography (Claim Four) because ""CSAM material is  not lawful 'information provided by another information  content provider'"" but rather is illegal contraband,  stemming from the sexual abuse of a child, and wholly  outside any protection or immunity under the law, to  include CDA 230.'"" Id. at 22. Plaintiffs' further assert that  ""CDA 230 was enacted to incentivize internet service  providers (""ISP's"") to protect children, not [**39]   immunize them for intentionally or recklessly harming  them."" Id. Plaintiffs argue that the Court should decline to follow  the case cited by Twitter, Doe v. Bates, 2006 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 93348, 2006 WL 3813758 (E.D. Tex., Dec. 27,  2006), which is a ""non-binding, first of its kind, federal  decision extending CDA immunity to a civil suit alleging  receipt and possession of child pornography."" Id. at 23.  According to Plaintiffs, neither of the cases upon which  the Texas district court relied, Zeran v. Am. Online, Inc.,  129 F.3d 327 (4th Cir. 1997) and Noah v. AOL Time  Warner, Inc., 261 F. Supp. 2d 532, 537 (E.D. Va. 2003),  aff'd, No. 03-1770, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 5495, 2004  WL 602711 (4th Cir. Mar. 24, 2004), involved child  pornography. Id. They also contend the reasoning of the  Texas case is wrong to the extent it treats child  pornography in the same way courts have treated  defamatory statements instead of treating it as  contraband. Id. at 23-24. According to Plaintiffs, given that Congress made clear  that the protection of children was paramount when  Section 230 was enacted, as is evidenced by the  policies stated in subsection (b) and the exemption for ""  'chapter . . . 110 of title 18 (relating to sexual exploitation  of children),' which includes §§ 2252A and 2255[,]"" ""[i]t  is untenable . . . to assert that CDA 230 immunizes  platforms from knowingly possessing and distributing  child sexual exploitation  [*909]  material."" Id. at 24.  Moreover, Plaintiffs assert, Twitter does not dispute that  they have adequately alleged the elements [**40]  of  claim under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A. Id. at 25. Plaintiffs also challenge Twitter's argument that their  claims under 18 U.S.C. § 2258A(a)(1) and (a)(2) fail  because those provisions do not create a civil cause of  action. Id. (citing Motion at 22). According to Plaintiffs,  ""Congress intended to make deliberate and reckless  violations of 2258A privately enforceable"" and that is  what they allege here. Id. (citing 18 U.S.C. § 2258B(b)).  Plaintiffs argue further that ""the standards of misconduct  in paragraph (b) of 2258(B) establish the duty of care  that Twitter owes Plaintiffs"" for the purposes of their  negligence claims and thus establish liability under both  federal and state law. Id. at 25-26. Next, Plaintiffs argue that CDA § 230 does not give rise  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *907; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **36 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *907; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **36 Page 17 of 34 to immunity as to their state law products liability claim  based on negligent design. Id. According to Plaintiffs,  this is because their claim ""does not attempt to treat  Twitter as the 'publisher or speaker' of information."" Id.  at 26. Instead, ""it seeks to hold Twitter accountable for  failing in its 'duty to exercise due care in supplying  products that do not present an unreasonable risk of  injury or harm to the public.'"" Id. (quoting Lemmon v.  Snap, Inc., 995 F.3d 1085, 2021 WL 1743576, at *4 (9th  Cir. 2021)). Plaintiffs contend that the distinction drawn  by the Ninth Circuit in Lemmon, in which the court  ""rejected [**41]  a social media platform's attempt to  argue that CDA 230 applied because the platform  allowed its users to transmit user-generated content to  one another. . . .[,]'"" also applies here, supporting the  conclusion that Section 230 does not apply to this claim.  Id. at 26-27. To the extent Twitter argues that Plaintiffs  have not clearly identified what aspect of its platform is  the ""product,"" Plaintiffs contend this is just semantics. Id.  at 27. They also reject Twitter's argument that product  liability law applies only to the ""tangible"" world, arguing  that the Ninth Circuit's holding in Lemmon shows that  Twitter is incorrect. Id. Finally, Plaintiffs argue that their state law claims are  adequately alleged and should be allowed to proceed.  As to the negligence claims, they assert that it is  apparent from the FAC that these claims are based on  different theories and California's Civil Jury Instructions  treat them as separate causes of action. Id. at 28. To  the extent negligence per se operates as a presumption  to establish a duty of care rather than a separate claim,  Plaintiffs argue, ""that simply means that Plaintiffs'  allegations of Twitter's multiple violations of its statutory  duties should be read [**42]  in tandem with its  negligence claims."" Id. (citing Tinoco v. San Diego Gas  & Elec. Co., No. 17-CV 2433-BAS-JLB, 2018 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 163523, 2018 WL 4562479, at *2 (S.D. Cal.  Sept. 21, 2018)). Plaintiffs also argue that they state a  claim for violation of California's UCL based on  ""unlawful"" conduct because ""Twitter's criminal, aiding  and abetting conduct is actionable under § 17200."" Id. at  29 (citing Chetal v. Am. Home Mortg., No. C 09-02727  CRB, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77806, 2009 WL 2612312,  at *4 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 24, 2009); Plascencia v. Lending  1st Mortg., 583 F. Supp. 2d 1090, 1098 (N.D. Cal.  2008)). Twitter's argument that Plaintiffs do not have  standing on this claim because they cannot seek ""the  full spectrum of damages"" also falls short, Plaintiffs  contend, as ""the availability of a certain remedy is not  relevant to a determination of standing to assert the  claim."" Id. (citing Finelite, Inc. v. Ledalite Architectural  Prods., No. C-10-1276 MMC, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  88041, 2010 WL 3385027, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 26,  2010)). 3. Reply In its Reply, Twitter reiterates its arguments that it  cannot be held liable as either a perpetrator of sex  trafficking under  [*910]  Section 1591(a)(1) or a  criminal beneficiary of sex trafficking under Section  1591(a)(2). Reply at 1-10. As to Plaintiffs' direct sex  trafficking claim under Section 1591(a)(1), Twitter  rejects Plaintiffs' interpretation of the provision, again  pointing to the words ""a person"" in the provision to  argue that the prohibited conduct applies to an  individual. Id. at 2. Twitter argues that Plaintiffs' ""novel""  interpretation of the provision as also encompassing a  video depicting a person is not supported by any  authority. Id. Twitter points to other uses of the  word [**43]  ""person"" in Section 1591 to support its  argument that this word cannot be read to mean a  depiction of a person under Section 1591(a)(1). Id. at 3  (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2) (""person has not attained  the age of 18""); 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(2) (""coercion"" is  ""threats of serious harm to or physical restraint against  any person"")). Twitter argues further that the cases cited by Plaintiffs in  support of their reading of Section 1591(a)(1), United  States v. Flanders, 752 F.3d 1317, 1330 (11th Cir.  2014) and United States v. Tollefson, 367 F. Supp. 3d  865, 878-80 (E.D. Wis. 2019), are not on point because  in those cases, the court ""determined that each  defendant violated Section 1591(a)(1) because they  procured a person for commercial sex using electronic  means, i.e., they used the internet to communicate with  the victims and to pay them to engage in recorded sex  acts, similar to what the Perpetrators did here."" Id. at 3  (citing Flanders, 752 F.3d at 1330; Tollefson, 367 F.  Supp. 3d at 878-80). According to Twitter, Flanders and  Tollefson ""revolved around whether Section 1591  covered situations in which the defendant was not  physically present during the alleged sex trafficking,  not whether the challenged conduct could apply to an  object (such as a video) instead of a person."" Id. Twitter also repeats its argument that Plaintiffs, by their  own admission, cannot satisfy the requirement under  Section 1591(a) that a defendant must have known that  a victim ""will in the future [be] cause[d]"" to engage in a  commercial  sex [**44]   act  given  that  Plaintiffs'  allegations establish that ""the venture was over at the  time Twitter allegedly refused to remove the Videos  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *909; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **40 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *909; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **40 Page 18 of 34 from its platform, . . . making it impossible for Twitter to  know that its alleged failure to act would likely cause  Plaintiffs to engage in commercial sex acts in the  future."" Id. Twitter also rejects Plaintiffs' arguments as to their claim  that Twitter is liable as a beneficiary of sex trafficking  under Section 1591(a)(2). Id. at 3-10. It again argues  that it did not participate in any ""venture"" for the  purposes of this subsection because it was not  ""associated in fact"" with the perpetrators. Id. at 4. Twitter  acknowledges that this term is not defined under  Section 1591 but argues it is reasonable to look to the  RICO cases cited in the Motion to understand its  meaning. Id. Twitter reiterates its argument that these  cases support the conclusion that to be engaged in a  ""venture"" under Section 1591 the participants must have  a common purpose, which Plaintiffs fail to allege. Id.  Twitter notes that ""[t]his construction of 'venture' is  implicit to the Afyare court's holding that Section  1591(a)(2) requires proof of a sex trafficking venture  and that '[t]wo or more people who engage in sex  trafficking  together  are [**45]   a  sex-trafficking  venture.'"" Id. n. 4 (quoting United States v. Afyare, 632  F. App'x 272, 279-86 (6th Cir. 2016)). Moreover, Twitter contends, under Section 1591 the  common purpose that is alleged must involve the  particular sex trafficking venture involving the plaintiff.  Id. at 4-5 (citing S.J. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, 473 F. Supp.  3d 147, 154 (E.D.N.Y. 2020);  [*911]  Doe v. Kik, 482 F.  Supp. 3d 1242, 1251 (S.D. Fla. 2020); J.B. v. G6  Hospitality, LLC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213, 2020  WL 4901196, at *10 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 20, 2020)).  Plaintiffs fail to meet this requirement as well, Twitter  argues. Id. at 5. Twitter argues further that ""[f]inding a  venture between Twitter and the Perpetrators based on  a standard platform-user relationship also makes no  sense considering Twitter's userbase, which numbers in  the hundreds of millions."" Id. at 6 (citing FAC ¶ 23; J.B.,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213, 2020 WL 4901196, at  *10 (""Craigslist cannot be deemed to have participated  in all ventures arising out of each post on its site."")). Twitter also asserts that Plaintiffs' claim under Section  1592(a)(2) fails because the FAC does not allege any  ""active participation"" by Twitter, arguing again that  Plaintiffs must allege overt acts by Twitter in furtherance  of the venture. Id. According to Twitter, Plaintiffs do not  dispute that this is a requirement but instead argue,  without authority, that its denial of the requests to  remove the Videos was an affirmative act that satisfies  this requirement. Id. (citing Opposition at 12). Twitter  contends this argument ""conflicts with the FAC  itself, [**46]  which is clear that Plaintiffs were allegedly  harmed by the failure to immediately remove the  Videos."" Id. (citing FAC ¶¶ 124- 25). In any event, they  assert, Plaintiffs' argument fails because ""Twitter's  failing to act is not 'affirmative conduct'"" and ""the nine- day removal time frame is not tantamount to an  affirmative act on Twitter's part."" Id. (citing Motion at 14- 15 (quoting Geiss v. Weinstein Co. Holdings LLC, 383  F. Supp. 3d 156, 169 (S.D.N.Y. 2019)); Bradley  Bergeron v. Monex Deposit Co., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  210652, 2020 WL 6468457, at *6-7 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 18,  2020); Gressett v. Contra Costa Cty., 2013 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 70667, 2013 WL 2156278, at *17 (N.D. Cal. May  17, 2013)). Even if Twitter's inaction were deemed an  overt act, it argues, it would still be insufficient because  it did not further the sex trafficking venture. Id. at 6 n. 6  (citing Kik, 482 F. Supp. 3d at 1251). Twitter reiterates its argument that Plaintiffs' claim under  Section 1591(a)(2) also fails because the FAC does not  plead that Twitter knowingly benefited from its  participation in Plaintiffs' alleged sex trafficking. Id. at  7-8. Twitter rejects Plaintiffs' attempt to distinguish  Geiss and Kolbek, cited in the Motion, arguing that ""the  specific procedural posture and facts of those cases are  irrelevant to the legal holding about what the statute  requires."" Id. at 7. More importantly, Twitter argues, ""the Opposition never  explains how Twitter could have received a benefit from  Plaintiffs' alleged sex trafficking when none of the  broad allegations [**47]  regarding how Twitter makes  money are connected to what happened to them."" Id.  Twitter contends the ""FAC does not allege that there  were  any  advertisements,  or  promoted  Tweets  associated with the Videos, nor does it allege that  Twitter obtained (let alone licensed) any data related to  the Videos."" Id. Moreover, it argues, the allegations that  Twitter "" 'continued to distribute the CSAM that it had  monetized after' John Doe #1 and his mother reported  it"" are not supported by any specific facts and therefore  do not raise a plausible inference that Twitter received a  benefit from the Videos. Id. at 7-8 (citing Opposition at  8-10 (citing FAC ¶¶ 52-54)). Twitter argues further that the Opposition also ""does not  provide any other facts that would establish the 'causal  relationship' between receipt of a benefit and Twitter's  'actual knowledge of that causal relationship.'"" Id. at 8.  Twitter rejects Plaintiffs' argument that it has satisfied  this requirement by alleging that Twitter's conduct was  motivated by the fact that ""CSE content is 'highly  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *910; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **44 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *910; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **44 Page 19 of 34 sought-after' on Twitter and Twitter 'makes significant  revenue   [*912]   from  the  presence,  searches,  connections, and interactions of such illegal and  dangerous [**48]  material.'"" Id. at 8 (quoting Opposition  at 9 (citing ¶¶ 37, 71, 84))). According to Twitter, ""these  allegations are not only incorrect, they are conclusory  and unsupported."" Id. And to the extent that Plaintiffs  point to allegations citing statements about how it  monetizes its platform, these allegations are insufficient,  Twitter asserts, because they do not establish that  Twitter monetizes all public posts and interactions. Id. n.  8 (citing Opposition at 8-9; FAC ¶ 33). Next, Twitter rejects Plaintiffs' argument that they have  satisfied the ""actual knowledge"" requirement of Section  1591(a)(2) by alleging facts showing ""reckless disregard  or constructive knowledge."" Id. at 9. Twitter argues that  this standard is incorrect and that ""[c]ourts have  repeatedly held that Section 1591(a)(2) requires a  defendant to have actual knowledge of the sex  trafficking venture involving the plaintiff to constitute a  criminal violation suffices for a Section 1591(a)(2)  violation."" Id. at 9 (citing Kik, 482 F. Supp. 3d at 1251).  Twitter contends Plaintiffs also fail to establish in the  Opposition that it had actual knowledge as the  allegations they point to do not ""demonstrate that Twitter  understood that Plaintiffs were the victims of sex  trafficking and the acts depicted in the [**49]  Videos  were commercial sex acts."" Id. (citing Opposition at 5,  12-14). Twitter concedes that Plaintiffs allege ""that John Doe #1  emailed saying Plaintiffs 'were baited, harassed, and  threatened to take these videos,'"" but contends ""that is  simply  insufficient  to  establish  Twitter's  actual  knowledge of the alleged sex trafficking"" because  ""[f]rom John Doe #1's email Twitter cannot tell whether  Plaintiffs were harassed and baited by friends or an  adult, for example, and Twitter cannot tell whether the  harassment caused them to engage in the sex acts, film  them, or share the Videos with others."" Id. at 9-10 (citing  Opposition at 13 (citing FAC ¶ 123)). Twitter reiterates its arguments that Congress intended  only to create a narrow exception to Section 230 when it  enacted FOSTA. Id. at 10-12. That exception, it  contends, was to allow for the imposition of liability on  ""websites that 'have done nothing to prevent the  trafficking of children.'"" Id. at 12 (quoting Opposition at  17-18 (emphasis in Opposition)). Twitter argues that  ""even according to Plaintiffs' own allegations, Twitter  plainly is not one of those websites."" Id. (citing FAC ¶¶  42-43, 55-58, 60, 64-65, 128-29). Twitter also rejects Plaintiffs' [**50]  argument that CDA  § 230 only provides immunity where an ICS removes  offensive content, arguing that it is well settled in the  Ninth Circuit that Section 230 applies whenever a claim  is based on an ICS's decision to publish or remove third- party content. Id. at 12-13 (citing Fair Hous. Council of  San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.Com, LLC, 521  F.3d 1157, 1170-71 (9th Cir. 2008); Barnes v. Yahoo!,  Inc., 570 F.3d 1096, 1103 (9th Cir. 2009); Jones v. Dirty  World Ent. Recordings LLC, 755 F.3d 398, 406-07 (6th  Cir. 2014)). This immunity applies even when an ICS  has received notice of the offensive content, Twitter  contends. Id. at 14 (citing Zeran v. Am. Online, Inc., 129  F.3d 327, 333 (4th Cir. 1997); Doe v. Bates, 2006 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 93348, 2006 WL 3813758, at *18 (E.D. Tex.  Dec. 27, 2006); Igbonwa v. Facebook, Inc., 2018 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 173769, 2018 WL 4907632, at *1, *5-7  (N.D. Cal. Oct. 9, 2018), aff'd, 786 F. App'x 104 (9th Cir.  2019)). Twitter argues that even if Plaintiffs' claim under Section  1595 is not barred under CDA § 230, it fails to state a  claim because Plaintiffs have not alleged all the required  elements, namely, ""that Twitter participated in a venture  with the Perpetrator  [*913]  or should have known  about Plaintiffs' alleged sex trafficking."" Id. at 14-16.  According to Twitter, Plaintiffs' argument that the FAC is  not required to allege a ""conspiracy"" between Twitter  and the sex traffickers is a ""red herring."" Id. at 15 (citing  Opposition at 14-15). Rather, Twitter contends, its  argument is that ""pleading a 'venture' under Section  1595 required Plaintiffs to allege facts demonstrating 'a  continuous [] relationship between the trafficker and the  [defendant] such that it would appear that the trafficker  and the [defendant] have established a pattern of  conduct [**51]  or could be said to have a tacit  agreement.'"" Id. (quoting J.B., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  151213, 2020 WL 4901196, at *9 (citing M.A., 425 F.  Supp. 3d at 970)). Here, Twitter asserts, the FAC does  not allege facts establishing such a continuous  relationship. Id. Twitter argues further that ""the FAC alleges no facts  showing that Twitter 'should have known' that the  Videos involved sex trafficking conduct - i.e., the  exploitation of children for commercial sex purposes,""  despite the arguments in the Opposition to the contrary.  Id. at 15-16 (citing Motion at 20-21; Reply at 9-10;  Opposition  at  15).  According  to  Twitter,  ""[t]he  Opposition's reliance on Twitter's alleged 'general  knowledge' of CSE content on its platform also fails  because such knowledge does not demonstrate Twitter  should have known of what specifically happened to  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *911; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **47 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *911; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **47 Page 20 of 34 Plaintiffs."" Id. at 16 (citing A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc., 484 F. Supp. 3d 921, 937-38 (D. Oregon  2020)). Twitter reiterates it position that all of Plaintiffs'  remaining claims are barred under CDA § 230. Id. at 16- 18. Twitter contends Plaintiffs ""do not disagree save for  their products liability claim."" Id. As to Twitter's arguments that Plaintiffs have failed to  state viable state law claims, Twitter notes that Plaintiffs  did not address its arguments related to California Civil  Code section 1708.85 and contends this claim should  therefore be dismissed. Id. [**52]  at 19. Twitter argues as to the products liability claim that  Plaintiffs' reliance on Lemmon v. Snap to argue that  CDA § 230 does not immunize Twitter from their  products liability claim is misplaced because in that  case, the plaintiffs' claims were based on the use of a  ""speed filter"" and did not, as here, treat the defendant  as a publisher of information. Id. at 19-20 (citing 995  F.3d at 1087-88). Twitter argues that Plaintiffs' Opposition fails to establish  that they have viable negligence claims because if does  not address Twitter's argument that it owed Plaintiffs no  duty. Id. at 20 (citing Motion at 23-24; GN Resound A/S  v. Callpod, Inc., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40402, 2013 WL  1190651, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 21, 2013)). Nor have  Plaintiffs ""established that Twitter violated any law or  statute that would give rise to a presumption of  negligence,"" Twitter contends, ""and Plaintiffs' own  authority agrees that negligence per se is not an  independent claim."" Id. Finally, Twitter argues that the Opposition fails to  establish that Plaintiffs have standing on their UCL  claim. Id. at 20-21. First, to the extent that the  Opposition ""seemingly argues that Plaintiffs have  standing to bring a UCL claim because they suffered  economic injury as a result of the 'monetization and  dissemination of Plaintiffs' images and likenesses'  by [**53]  Twitter[,]"" Twitter rejects that argument. Id.  (citing Opposition at 29-30 (citing Fraley v. Facebook,  Inc., 830 F. Supp. 2d 785, 811 (N.D. Cal. 2011))).  According to Twitter, Fraley does not support Plaintiffs'  position because in that case, the ""plaintiffs alleged that  Facebook 'fail[ed] to compensate them for their valuable  endorsement of third-party products and services' when  it took their image and name to create 'Sponsored  Stories.'"" Id. (quoting 830 F. Supp. 2d at  [*914]  790).  Twitter contrasts the allegations in the FAC, which  ""alleges that advertisements or promoted Tweets are  'displayed intermixed between tweets'"" but does not  allege ""that Plaintiffs' image or name was used to  endorse any product or used in any advertisement."" Id.  at 20-21. Twitter also rejects Plaintiffs' reliance on its alleged  ""criminal, aiding and abetting conduct"" in support of  UCL standing, arguing that this theory (which was  raised for the first time in the Opposition) fails because  ""[a]iding and abetting requires not only knowledge [of  the complained of act], but 'substantial assistance o[r]  encouragement' of another's tort."" Id. at 21 (citing  Opposition at 29; quoting Chetal v. Am. Home Mortg.,  2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77806, 2009 WL 2612312, at *4  (N.D. Cal. Aug. 24, 2009)). Plaintiffs have not alleged  such facts, Twitter asserts. Id. For these reasons, Twitter asks the Court to dismiss all  of Plaintiffs' claims [**54]  with prejudice. Id.). 4. Amicus Brief In addition to the briefing supplied by the parties, a  group of anti-trafficking organizations have submitted  an amicus brief addressing Congress's intent in  enacting  FOSTA.  These  organizations  contend  Congress intended to afford greater protection to victims  of online sex trafficking by abrogating the broad  immunity afforded under CDA § 230 and urge the Court  to reject Twitter's assertion that it is immune from  Plaintiffs' claims in this case. III. ANALYSIS A. Legal Standards Under Rule 12(b)(6) HN4[ ] A complaint may be dismissed under Rule  12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for  failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.  ""The purpose of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)  is to test the legal sufficiency of the complaint."" N. Star  Int'l v. Ariz. Corp. Comm'n, 720 F.2d 578, 581 (9th Cir.  1983). Generally, a plaintiff's burden at the pleading  stage is relatively light. Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of  Civil Procedure states that a ""pleading which sets forth a  claim for relief . . . shall contain . . . a short and plain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). HN5[ ] In ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule  12(b)(6), the court analyzes the complaint and takes ""all  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *913; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **51 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *913; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **51 Page 21 of 34 allegations of material fact as true and construe[s] them  in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.""  Parks Sch. of Bus. v. Symington, 51 F.3d 1480, 1484  (9th Cir. 1995). Dismissal may be based on a lack  of [**55]  a cognizable legal theory or on the absence of  facts that would support a valid theory. Balistreri v.  Pacifica Police Dep't, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1990).  A complaint must ""contain either direct or inferential  allegations  respecting  all  the  material  elements  necessary to sustain recovery under some viable legal  theory."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 562,  127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citing Car  Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101, 1106  (7th Cir. 1984)). ""A pleading that offers 'labels and  conclusions' or 'a formulaic recitation of the elements of  a cause of action will not do.'"" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556  U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868  (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). ""[C]ourts  'are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion  couched as a factual allegation.'"" Twombly, 550 U.S. at  555 (quoting Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286, 106  S. Ct. 2932, 92 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1986)). ""Nor does a  complaint suffice if it tenders 'naked assertion[s]' devoid  of 'further factual enhancement.'"" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678  (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557) (alteration in  original). Rather, the claim must be "" 'plausible on its  face,'"" meaning that the plaintiff must plead sufficient  factual  [*915]  allegations to ""allow [] the court to draw  the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for  the misconduct alleged."" Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S.  at 570). B. The TVPRA Claims (Claims One and Two) Plaintiffs assert two claims against Twitter under the  TVPRA - a claim for direct sex trafficking and a claim  for beneficiary liability. For the reasons set forth below,  the Court finds that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for  direct sex trafficking [**56]  and therefore does not  reach the question of whether that claim is barred under  CDA § 230. On the other hand, the Court finds that  Plaintiffs state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA and that Section 230 does not apply to that  claim. 1. Direct Sex Trafficking Both sides rely on the plain language of Section  1591(a)(1) in support of their arguments relating to the  sufficiency of Plaintiffs' allegations that Twitter engaged  in direct sex trafficking in violation of the TVPRA.  Twitter argues that the series of verbs in the provision  relate to a ""person"" and that here, Twitter's alleged  conduct relates not to a person but to the Videos.  Plaintiffs, on the other hand, points to the words ""by any  means"" in Section 1591(a)(1) in support of their reading  of the provision. The Court finds Twitter's argument  more persuasive. Section 1591(a)(1) contains a series of verbs, all of  which relate to a ""person."" One of the verbs - the word  ""advertises"" - might plausibly be read to fit the  allegations in the FAC as a video posted on Twitter  could, at least as a matter of grammar, advertise a  ""person""  but  Plaintiffs  don't  claim  that  Twitter  ""advertised"" them. The verbs on which Plaintiffs rely  (""provides"", ""obtains"" and ""maintains""), on the other  hand, do not lend [**57]  themselves to the reading  Plaintiffs suggest and Plaintiffs have pointed to no  authority that supports their interpretation of Section  1591(a)(1). Plaintiffs' reliance on United States v. Tollefson, 367 F.  Supp. 3d 865, 878-80 (E.D. Wis. 2019) to support their  reading of Section 1591(a)(1) is misplaced. In that case,  the defendant was criminally charged under Section  1591(a)(1) on the basis that he had ""solicited"" a child  using an online chat, which he used to communicate  with the victim and to persuade her to create and send  him pornographic content using her phone. 367 F.  Supp. 3d at 867-68. HN6[ ] Section 1591(a)(1)  expressly allows for criminal liability where a defendant  ""solicits by any means a person"" and the conduct at  issue in that case falls comfortably within that language.  Plaintiffs here do not, however, allege any solicitation by  Twitter. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs do not  state a claim for direct sex trafficking under Section  1591(a)(1) and does not reach the question of Section  230 immunity as to that claim. 2. Beneficiary Liability The more difficult issue is whether Plaintiffs have stated  a claim under Section 1591(a)(2) and, if they have,  whether Twitter is immune from liability under Section  230 on that claim. To decide these questions, the Court  must grapple with three primary issues. First, how  stringent is the mens rea requirement as to Twitter's  knowledge of whether Plaintiffs [**58]  were victims of  sex trafficking. Second, what must be alleged to show  that Twitter participated in a ""venture."" Finally, what  must be alleged to show that Twitter received a benefit  from the sex trafficking venture and that the benefit  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *914; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **54 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *914; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **54 Page 22 of 34 motivated its conduct. As to all three questions, Twitter  urges the Court to adopt the stringent requirements for  establishing a criminal violation under Section 1591(a).  The Court concludes, however, that Twitter's arguments   [*916]  are at odds with the plain language of FOSTA  and the case law addressing the requirements for  establishing civil liability under Section 1595. Although the post-FOSTA case law addressing the  requirements of Section 1595 and 1591(a)(2) as they  relate to third-party content and ICS providers is scant,  a series of cases in which victims of sex trafficking  have sought to impose civil liability against hotel chains  shed light on the pleading requirements for such claims  in other contexts. In those cases, courts have  addressed the significance of the fact that the ""language  of § 1591 differs from the language of § 1595"" in that  ""the former does not have a constructive knowledge  element manifested by 'should have known' language.""  M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp.  3d 959, 969 (S.D. Ohio 2019). In M.A., and in a number  of cases that have adopted the reasoning [**59]  of that  case, the court ""rejected the application of the criminal  definition to civil claims under the TVPRA."" A.B. v. Hilton  Worldwide Holdings Inc., 484 F. Supp. 3d 921, 937 (D.  Or. 2020) (citing M.A. 425 F. Supp. 3d at 969 (S.D. Ohio  2019); A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 455 F.Supp.3d 171,  186-88 (E.D. Pa. 2020); B.M. v. Wyndham Hotels &  Resorts, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL  4368214 at *3 (N.D. Cal. July 30, 2020)). In M.A., the plaintiff was a victim of sex trafficking that  occurred at hotels owned by the defendant and she  sued under Sections 1595 and 1591(a)(2). Her claims  were based on the theory that the hotel chain benefited  from the rental of the rooms where she was trafficked  and knew or should have known that trafficking was  occurring there based on various signs of sex  trafficking that should have been obvious to hotel staff.  425 F. Supp. 3d at 962. The court found that the plaintiff  adequately alleged that the hotel chain benefited from  the sex trafficking based on the rental of its rooms. Id.  at 965. It further found that she alleged sufficient facts to  show that it ""knew or should have known"" that the  venture was engaged in sex trafficking, applying the  looser knowledge requirement of Section 1595 rather  than the knowledge requirement that applies to criminal  claims under Section 1591(a)(2). Id. at 968. It cited both  to allegations that there were obvious signs of sex  trafficking that hotel staff should have recognized and  that the hotel chain was ""on notice about the prevalence  of sex trafficking generally at their hotels and failed to  take adequate [**60]  steps to train staff in order to  prevent its occurrence."" Id. at 969. Next, the M.A. court addressed what the plaintiff was  required to allege to meet the ""participation in a venture""  requirement of Section 1595. Like Twitter here, the  defendant in M.A. ""rel[ied] extensively on United States  v. Afyare, 632 F. App'x 272 (6th Cir. 2016), which  addresses the meaning of 'participation in a venture'  under § 1591."" Id. at 968. As the M.A. court explained,  ""[i]n Afyare, a panel of the Sixth Circuit affirmed the  district court's finding that § 1591(a)(2) 'require[s] that a  defendant actually participate and commit some 'overt  act' that furthers the sex trafficking aspect of the  venture.'"" Id. (quoting Afyare, 632 F. App'x at 286).  Thus, under Section 1591, ""the venture had to be a sex- trafficking venture and the 'participation' had to be an  'overt act' that furthers the sex trafficking aspect of the  venture.'"" Id. (quoting Afyare, 632 F. App'x at 286).  Further, Afyare held that under Section 1591 a  defendant had to be "" 'associated for the purpose of  furthering the sex trafficking.'"" Id. The court in M.A.  found, however, that this criminal standard did not apply  to the plaintiff's civil claim under Section 1595,  concluding that a defendant ""need not have actual  knowledge of the sex trafficking in order to have  participated in the sex trafficking venture  [*917]  for  civil liability under the [**61]  TVPRA, otherwise the  'should have known' language in § 1595(a) would be  meaningless."" Id. at 971. It further found that the alleged  acts and omissions of the hotel chain in that case were  sufficient to allege ""participation in a venture"" under  Section 1595. Id. The M.A. court's interpretation of Section 1595 and the  meaning of ""participation in a venture"" under that  section was based on the following statutory analysis: Some Defendants have relied on the definition of  ""participation in a venture"" supplied in § 1591(e)(4).  HN7[ ] Generally, ""there is a natural presumption  that identical words used in different parts of the  same act are intended to have the same meaning.""  Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, 286  U.S. 427, 433, 52 S.Ct. 607, 76 L.Ed. 1204 (1932).  But this presumption does not apply where ""there is  such variation in the connection in which the words  are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion  that they were employed in different parts of the act  with different intent."" Id. Here, § 1591(e) purports to  only apply to ""this section,"" i.e., § 1591. See, e.g.,  Gilbert v. United States Olympic Committee, No.  18-cv-00981-CMA-MEH, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  35921, 2019 WL 1058194, at *9, *10 (D. Colo. Mar.  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *915; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **58 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *915; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **58 Page 23 of 34 6, 2019) (noting that ""there are persuasive reasons  to conclude ... that the term 'venture' is defined  differently in § 1591(a)(2) than it is in § 1589(b)""  and ""neither §§ 1589 nor 1595 define 'venture'""). In addition to the language in § 1591(e) limiting the  definitions [**62]  to that section, applying the  definition of ""participation in a venture"" provided for  in § 1591(e) to the requirements under § 1595  would void the ""known or should have known""  language of § 1595. Such a construction would  violat[e] the "" HN8[ ] 'cardinal principle of statutory  construction' that 'a statute ought, upon the whole,  to be construed so that, if it can be prevented, no  clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous,  void, or insignificant.'"" TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534  U.S. 19, 31, 122 S.Ct. 441, 151 L.Ed.2d 339 (2001)  (quoting Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 174, 121  S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001)). HN9[ ]  Section 1591(e)(4) provides the following definition  of ""participation in a venture"": ""knowingly assisting,  supporting, or facilitating a violation of subsection  (a)(1)."" The term ""participation in a venture"" in §  1591 thus imports a state of mind requirement—the  participation must be ""knowing."" Although §  1591(a)(2) also criminalizes some action taken with  less than actual knowledge, that is, ""reckless  disregard, such ""reckless disregard"" provision  applies only to the requirement ""that means of  force, threats of force, fraud, coercion described in  subsection (e)(2), or any combination of such  means will be used to cause the person to engage  in a commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act."" § 1591 (a). It  does not lessen the scienter requirement [**63]  of  actual knowledge as to participation or the venture's  true ends. 425 F. Supp. 3d 959, 969-70. The court therefore  concluded that "" 'participation' under § 1595 does not  require actual knowledge of participation in the sex  trafficking itself."" Id. at 970. The court in M.A. went on to find that ""[i]n the absence  of a direct association, ""the plaintiff could adequately  allege participation under Section 1595 only by alleging  facts showing ""a continuous business relationship  between the trafficker and the hotels such that it would  appear that the trafficker and the hotels have  established a pattern of conduct or could be said to  have a tacit agreement."" Id. The court found that the  plaintiff met this requirement by alleging that the  defendant rented rooms  [*918]  to people it knew or  should have known were engaged in sex trafficking. Id. District courts, including in this district, have found the  statutory analysis in M.A. supporting its interpretation of  Section 1595 to be persuasive. In B.M. v. Wyndham  Hotels & Resorts, Inc., Judge Freeman stated, ""The  Court agrees with the statutory construction analysis in  M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp.  3d 959, 969 (S.D.

June 5, 2020) that applying the  'participation  in  a  venture'  definition  from  the  criminal [**64]  liability section of the TVPRA to the civil  liability section of the TVPRA, 'would void the ""should  have known"" language in the civil remedy' and '[t]his  violates the ""cardinal principle of statutory construction  that a statute ought, upon the whole, to be construed so  that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word  shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant."" '"" No. 20 CV- 00656-BLF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL  4368214, at *3 (N.D. Cal. July 30, 2020) (quoting J.C. v.  Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99252,  2020 WL 3035794, at *1, n. 1 (quoting M.A. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d at  969)). Thus, in B.M., the court concluded that the  plaintiff was ""not required to allege an overt act in  furtherance of or actual knowledge of a sex trafficking  venture in order to sufficiently plead her section 1595  civil liability claim"" based on beneficiary liability under  Section 1591(a)(2) against parent companies that  owned hotels where the plaintiff was the victim of sex  trafficking. Id. The undersigned also finds the reasoning and analysis  of M.A. to be persuasive and therefore concludes that  HN10[ ] as a general matter, where a plaintiff seeks to                555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *917; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **61 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *917; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **61 Page 24 of 34 impose civil liability under Section 1595 based on a  violation of Section 1591(a)(2), not only does the  ""known or should have known"" language of Section  1595 apply (rather than the actual knowledge standard  of Section 1591(a)) but such a claim also does not  require that a plaintiff [**65]  demonstrate an overt act  that furthered the sex trafficking aspect of the venture  in order to satisfy the ""participation in a venture""  requirement. The hotel line of cases, however, does not answer the  question of whether the same standards apply where a  civil claim is asserted under Section 1591(a)(2) against  an ICS provider and thus (arguably) falls within the  ambit of Section 230 immunity. This issue was recently  addressed in Doe v. Kik Interactive, Inc., 482 F. Supp.  3d 1242, 1244 (S.D. Fla. 2020), on which Twitter relies.  In that case, the defendant was a web-based interactive  service called Kik that offered a messaging service that  was marketed to teens and young adults. The plaintiff  alleged that numerous adult male users of Kik ""solicited  her and convinced her to take and send them sexually  graphic pictures of herself using Kik""; that these adult  males sent her sexually explicit photographs via Kik"";  that ""her father found  [*919]  the photographs on her  cellphone and computer tablet and reported the  incidents to the police""; that there had been ""multiple  instances where adult users of Kik ha[d] used the  service to contact and solicit sexual activity with minors,  with some of those contacts resulting in death of the  minors""; and that the defendants knew ""that sexual  predators use[d] [**66]  its service to prey on minors but  have failed to provide any warnings or enact policies to  protect minors from such abuses."" Kik, 482 F. Supp. 3d  at 1244. The plaintiff sued Kik's owner, seeking to  impose beneficiary liability under Section 1595 based on  alleged violations of Section 1591(a)(2) and the  defendant brought a motion to dismiss asserting that it  was immune under CDA § 230 and that the plaintiff  failed to state a claim under Section 1595(a). Id. at  1244-1245. In addressing what the plaintiff was required to allege to  fall under the FOSTA exemption to CDA § 230, the  court in Kik acknowledged that in the context of sex  trafficking at hotels, courts have found that plaintiffs  need not satisfy the definitions that apply to criminal  prosecutions under Section 1591(a) to establish civil  liability under Section 1595(a) but concluded that under  FOSTA, a plaintiff who asserts such a claim against an  interactive computer service is required to satisfy those  more demanding requirements. Id. at 1248-51. The court in Kik reasoned as follows: Significantly, because the hotel defendants were  not interactive computer service providers, neither  FOSTA nor CDA immunity were considered. The  present case presents a different scenario, because  Congress - in balancing the needs of protecting  children  and  encouraging  ""robust  Internet  communication"" [**67]   -  enacted  a  statute  protecting interactive computer service providers  from liability for their users' content and conduct. If  it were not for FOSTA, Defendants in this case  would be completely immune from liability under the  CDA. 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(5); MySpace, 528 F.3d  413. To resolve Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, this  Court must consider the extent to which FOSTA  has affected the immunity provided by the CDA.  Again, FOSTA states that ""[n]othing in this section  (other than subsection (c)(2)(A)) shall be construed  to impair or limit ... any claim in a civil action under  section 1595 of Title 18, if the conduct underlying  the claim constitutes a violation of section 1591 of  that title."" 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)(A) (emphasis  added). Plaintiff argues that as a result of FOSTA,  ""the exacting standard of 'actual knowledge' and  'overt act' employed in a criminal prosecution under  § 1591 is replaced by [a] 'constructive knowledge'  standard when a civil recovery is sought under the  TVPA."" (DE [29], p. 21). But this argument would  have the Court disregard the plain language and  structure of FOSTA. HN11[ ] ""A statute should be  interpreted so that no words shall be discarded as  meaningless, redundant, or mere surplusage.""  United States v. DBB, Inc., 180 F.3d 1277, 1285  (11th Cir. 1999) (quotation omitted). Defendants argue that the Congressional history of  FOSTA shows that Congress [**68]  only intended  to create a narrow exception to the CDA for ""openly  malicious actors such as Backpage where it was  plausible for a plaintiff to allege actual knowledge  and overt participation."" (DE [33], p. 5) and that a  finding of actual knowledge and overt participation  in a venture of sexual trafficking is required to  defeat CDA immunity. This is consistent with the  language of FOSTA. HN12[ ] By its terms, FOSTA  did not abrogate CDA immunity for all claims arising  from sex trafficking; FOSTA permits civil liability  for websites only  [*920]  ""if the conduct underlying  the claim constitutes a violation of section 1591.""  And section 1591 requires knowing and active  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *918; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **64 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *918; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **64 Page 25 of 34 participation in sex trafficking by the defendants.  Afyare, 632 Fed. Appx. at 286; see also Geiss v.  Weinstein Co. Holdings, LLC, 383 F. Supp. 3d 156,  169 (S.D. N.Y. 2019) (""aiders and abettors of sex  trafficking are liable under the TVPA only if they  knowingly 'benefit[ ], financially or by receiving  anything of value from participating in a venture  which has engaged in' sex trafficking"") (quoting 18  U.S.C. § 1591(a)); Noble v. Weinstein, 335 F.  Supp. 3d 504, 524 (S.D. N.Y. 2018) (""Plaintiff must  allege specific conduct that furthered the sex  trafficking venture. Such conduct must have been  undertaken with the knowledge, or in reckless  disregard of the fact, that it was furthering the  alleged sex trafficking venture. In other words,  some participation [**69]  in the sex trafficking act  itself must be shown.""). Id. at 1250-51 (emphasis in original). The court went on  to conclude that the plaintiff in that case had not pled a  violation under Section 1591(a)(2) under the definitions  and requirements that apply to criminal claims and  therefore, that her claim did not fall within FOSTA's  exemption to Section 230 immunity. Id. at 1251. The undersigned respectfully disagrees with the Kik  court's analysis. HN13[ ] In construing a statute, the  Court starts with the language of the statute. Bailey v.  United States, 516 U.S. 137, 145, 116 S. Ct. 501, 133 L.  Ed. 2d 472 (1995) (""We start, as we must, with the  language of the statute.""). The Supreme Court has  instructed, however, that context also matters and  therefore, courts should ""consider not only the bare  meaning of the word but also its placement and purpose  in the statutory scheme."" Id. Further, where a statute is  ""remedial,"" it ""should be liberally construed."" Peyton v.  Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 65, 88 S. Ct. 1549, 20 L. Ed. 2d 426  (1968). There is no question that FOSTA is a remedial  statute in that it carves out exceptions to CDA § 230  immunity, thereby affording remedies to victims of sex  trafficking that otherwise would not have been  available. Moreover, the broader statutory framework  suggests that the Kik court's reading of FOSTA  improperly adopted the most restrictive possible reading  of that provision when there is [**70]  an equally (or  more) plausible reading of the plain language of  FOSTA. HN14[ ] FOSTA consists of two clauses, with the first  clause (""[n]othing in this section . . . shall be construed  to impair or limit . . . any claim in a civil action under  section 1595 of Title 18"") modified by the second clause  (""if the conduct underlying the claim constitutes a  violation of section 1591 of that title""). 47 U.S.C. §  230(e)(5)(A). The Kik court concluded that the second  clause, on its face, not only limits civil claims that fall  outside of CDA § 230 immunity to claims asserted under  Section 1591 but that it also allows for liability on only a  subset of the civil claims that may be brought under  Sections 1595 and 1591, namely, those that can meet  the more stringent burden that applies to criminal  prosecutions under Section 1591. The implication of this  reading is that a sex trafficking victim who seeks to  impose civil liability on an ICS provider on the basis of  beneficiary liability faces a higher burden than a victim  of sex trafficking who seeks to impose such liability on  other types of defendants. Had Congress intended such  a limitation on Section 1595 liability as applied to  interactive computer services, it could have clearly  stated as much, but it did not do so. Furthermore, the more natural reading of the [**71]   second phrase of Section 230(e)(5)(A) is simply that it  creates an exemption to Section 230 immunity for civil  sex trafficking claims under Section 1591 and not as to  other sections of Title  [*921]  18 that can give rise to  civil liability under Section 1595. In particular, Section  1595 is found in Chapter 77 of Title 18, entitled  ""Peonage, Slavery, and Trafficking in Persons,"" and  creates civil liability for ""[a]n individual who is a victim of  a violation of this chapter."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a)  (emphasis added). As the title of the chapter suggests, it  prohibits a host of conduct including ""hold[ing] or  return[ing] any person to a condition of peonage"" (§  1581), ""[e]nticement into slavery"" (§ 1583), and  ""benefit[ing], financially or . . . receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in the providing or obtaining of [forced] labor""  (§ 1589). This more straightforward reading does not  limit FOSTA's exemption to a narrow subset of civil sex  trafficking claims but rather, makes available to victims  of sex trafficking the same civil remedies against an  ICS provider under Section 1591(a)(2) as are available  in cases involving other types of defendants. The Court  finds that this reading is consistent with the broad  language used in the first clause of FOSTA as well as  the remedial purpose [**72]  of FOSTA.         555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *920; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **68 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *920; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **68 Page 26 of 34 Nor does the undersigned find persuasive the Kik  court's finding that the legislative history supports its  interpretation of FOSTA. The two isolated statements  cited by the Kik court provide little guidance as to the  very  specific  question  of  statutory  interpretation  presented here. Further, the parties and amici have  pointed to numerous statements in the legislative  history,  often  seeming  to  support  conflicting  conclusions, highlighting the risks of relying on  statements made prior to passage of a bill to interpret  the statute that was actually enacted. Here, the Court  concludes that this issue is better resolved on the basis  of the language of FOSTA as it  [*922]  fits with the  broader statutory framework of the TVPRA. For these reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs'  Section 1595 claim against Twitter based on alleged  violation of Section 1591(a)(2) is not subject to the more  stringent requirements that apply to criminal violations of                                     that provision. Having reached that conclusion, the  Court now must address whether Plaintiffs have  adequately alleged: 1) that Twitter knowingly [**73]   participated in a venture; 2) that it received a benefit  from its participation; and 3) it knew or should have  known that Plaintiffs were victims of sex trafficking. a. Participation in a Venture HN15[ ] A ""venture"" is defined as ""any group of two or  more individuals associated in fact."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(e)(6). As discussed above, Plaintiffs are not  required to allege an ""overt act"" of participation in the  sex trafficking itself. Nor does "" 'participation' under §  1595 . . . require actual knowledge of participation in the  sex trafficking itself."" M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 970.  Nonetheless, to the extent that Plaintiffs allege that  Twitter has participated in a sex trafficking venture ""by  allowing Twitter to become a safe haven and a refuge  for, 'minor attracted people,' human traffickers, and  discussion  of  'child  sexual  exploitation  as  a  phenomenon,' to include trade and dissemination of  sexual abuse material[,]"" FAC ¶ 9, they must ""allege at  least a showing of a continuous business relationship  between the trafficker and [Twitter] such that it would  appear that the trafficker and [Twitter] have established  a pattern of conduct or could be said to have a tacit  agreement."" Id. Thus, for example, in M.A., this element  was sufficiently alleged because [**74]  the plaintiff  alleged ""that Defendants rented rooms to people it knew  or  should  have  known  were  engaged  in  sex  trafficking."" Id. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs' allegations are  sufficient to meet this requirement. In addition to the  general allegations that Twitter enables sex trafficking  on its platform, see, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 58-59 (alleging Twitter  makes it hard for users to report CSAM and has  received a lower rating than other platforms for its  reporting structure); 61 (""Twitter permits large amounts  of  human  trafficking  and  commercial  sexual  exploitation material on its platform, despite having both  the ability to monitor it, and actual and/or constructive  knowledge of its posting on the platform""); ¶¶ 64-69          555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *921; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **72 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *921; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **72 Page 27 of 34 (alleging that the number of reports by Twitter to the  National Center on Missing and Exploited Children  (""NCMEC"") of apparent child sexual abuse material on  its platform is low compared to what other platforms  report); ¶¶ 74-79 (alleging that Twitter hashtags help  users find CSAM and that it rarely removes hashtags it  knows are associated with CSAM); ¶¶ 80-84 (alleging  that Twitter's search suggestion feature makes it easier  for users to find CSAM), Plaintiffs also [**75]  include  specific allegations that support an inference that Twitter  participated in a ""venture"" involving these Plaintiffs. In particular, the FAC alleges that Twitter was  specifically alerted that the Videos contained sexual  images of children obtained without their consent on  several occasions but either failed or refused to take  action. First, John Doe # 1 and his mother both  allegedly reported the CSAM  [*923]  through Twitter's  content reporting interface. FAC ¶¶ 110, 112. Further,  when Twitter responded to John Doe #1's complaint by  asking for further information, John Doe #1 sent Twitter  a copy of his driver's license (reflecting that he was a  minor) and stated in his responses that the Videos had  been taken three years before ""from harassment and  being threatened"" and that a police report had been  filed. FAC ¶ 114. John Doe #1's mother allegedly made  two  more  complaints,  including  one  specifically  complaining about the user account @StraightBross,  which was one of the accounts that provided links to the  videos."" FAC ¶ 115. Subsequently, after receiving only  form responses, John Doe #1's mother emailed Twitter  to inquire about the status of the complaints. FAC ¶ 119. Two days later, Twitter [**76]  allegedly sent John Doe  #1 a response stating, ""We've reviewed the content, and  didn't find a violation of our policies, so no action will be  taken at this time."" Id. ¶ 120. John Doe #1 allegedly  responded as follows: What do you mean you don't see a problem? We  both are minors right now and were minors at the  time these videos were taken. We both were 13  years of age. We were baited, harassed, and  threatened to take these videos that are now being  posted without our permission. We did not  authorize these videos AT ALL and they need to be  taken down. We have a case number with the [Law  Enforcement Agency] for these videos and this  incident. Please remove this video ASAP and any  videos linked to this one. There is a problem with  these videos and they are going against my legal  rights and they are again at (sic) the law to be on  the internet. (capitalized emphasis in original). FAC ¶ 123. The Videos allegedly remained on Twitter  another seven days. FAC ¶ 124. Notably, Plaintiffs also  allege that the user account @StraightBross, one of the  accounts that allegedly posted the Videos, had been the  subject of a citizen complaint in December 2019 alerting  Twitter that this account carried links [**77]  to  ""OBVIOUS CHILD PORN"" but no action was taken on  that complaint. FAC ¶ 101. The Court finds that these allegations are sufficient to  allege an ongoing pattern of conduct amounting to a  tacit agreement with the perpetrators in this case to  allow them to post videos and photographs it knew or  should have known were related to sex trafficking  without blocking their accounts or the Videos. Therefore,  Plaintiffs have adequately alleged participation in a  venture under Section 1595 in support of their  beneficiary liability claim against Twitter. b. Receipt of a Benefit HN16[ ] ""To state a claim under a section 1595(a)  beneficiary theory,"" Plaintiffs ""must allege facts from  which the Court can reasonably infer that"" Twitter  ""knowingly benefit[ted] financially or by receiving  anything of value[.]"" B.M., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  135494, [WL] at *4. In B.M., the court rejected the  defendant's argument that the "" 'benefit' must derive  directly from, and be knowingly received in exchange  for, participating in a sex-trafficking venture[,]"" finding  that this approach improperly ""reads a requirement   [*924]   for  'actual  knowledge'  of  criminal  sex  trafficking into the civil statute, [and] read[s] out the  'should have known' language."" Id. Instead, the court  found that ""[t]he 'knowingly [**78]  benefit' element of  section 1595 'merely requires that Defendant knowingly  receive a financial benefit'"" from its relationship with the  sex trafficker. Id. (citing H.H. v. G6 Hosp., LLC, No.  2:19-CV-755, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL  6682152, at *2 (S.D. Ohio Dec. 6, 2019). The  undersigned agrees that this is the correct standard and              555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *922; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **74 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *922; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **74 Page 28 of 34 finds that Plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient as to this  requirement. First, contrary to Twitter's repeated assertions, the FAC  contains  detailed  allegations  about  how  Twitter  monetizes  content,  including  CSAM,  through  advertising, sale of access to its API, and data  collection. FAC ¶¶ 25, 30-41, 50-54. It further alleges  that searching for hashtags that are known to relate to  CSAM brings up promoted links and advertisements,  offering a screenshot of advertising that appeared in  connection with one such hashtag. FAC ¶ 76. Plaintiffs  also specifically allege that the Videos of Plaintiffs were  ""monetized by Twitter and it receive financial benefit  from [their] distribution on its platform."" FAC ¶ 196.  While Twitter dismisses this allegation as conclusory, it  is supported by allegation that the Videos were ""viewed  at least 167,000 times and retweeted 2,220 times for  additional views,"" FAC ¶195, and that ""[t]he videos  remained live approximately another seven days,  resulting [**79]  in substantially more views and  retweets."" FAC ¶ 125. Read together, these allegations  support a plausible inference that the Videos of Plaintiffs  generated advertising and attracted users, both of which  benefited Twitter. The Court is not persuaded that either Geiss or Kolbek,  cited by Twitter, requires a contrary result. In Geiss, the  court concluded that officers who worked at the  company of film producer Harvey Weinstein could not  be held liable on the basis of beneficiary liability under  Section 1591(a)(2) simply because they received a  benefit from working for the company where that benefit  was unrelated to any conduct that facilitated the alleged  sex trafficking by Weinstein. 383 F. Supp. 3d 156, 169  (S.D.N.Y. 2019). The court reasoned that ""there must be  a causal relationship between affirmative conduct  furthering the sex-trafficking venture and receipt of a  benefit, with actual or, in the civil context, constructive  knowledge of that causal relationship."" Id. Here,  Plaintiffs allege that the benefit - increased advertising  revenue and users - was the result of allowing the  Videos to remain on Twitter, allowing for tens of  thousands of views and retweets of the Videos.  Therefore, Geiss is not on point. Twitter's reliance on Kolbek v. Twenty First Century  Holiness Tabernacle Church, Inc., No. 10-CV-4124,  2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 180463, 2013 WL 6816174, at  *16 (W.D. Ark. Dec. 24, 2013) is also [**80]  misplaced.  In that case, the plaintiffs had been forced as children to  become ""spiritual wives"" of a church leader and brought  claims against various defendants, including the church,  for sex trafficking in violation of Section 1595, alleging  that they had benefited from the sex trafficking under  Section 1591(a)(2). The court concluded that there was  no evidence that the defendants were compensated for  the sexual abuse and therefore, that plaintiffs failed to  establish that they were the victims of ""commercial sex  trafficking"" based on the definition of the term  ""commercial sex act"" in Section 1591(e)(3). 2013 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 180463, 2013 WL 6816174, at *16 (citing 18  U.S.C. § 1591(e)(3) (defining ""commercial sex act"" as  ""any sex act, on account of which anything of value is  given to or received by any person."")). Like the court in  Geiss, the court in Kolbek found that to establish sex  trafficking, there ""needs to be a causal relationship  between the sex act and an  [*925]  exchange of an  item of value."" Id. Yet the only alleged financial benefit  any of the defendants received was payment of the  victim's living expenses by the perpetrator when they  were on out-of-state trips. Id. The court concluded that  these payments were not causally related to the sexual  abuse and therefore did not establish commercial  sex [**81]  trafficking. Id. In contrast to the facts of  Kolbek, the benefit Twitter is alleged to have received  here was the result of the proliferation of retweets and  large number of account users who viewed the Videos,  as discussed above. Moreover, Twitter conceded at oral  argument that the tweeting and retweeting of child  pornography is a ""commercial sex act"" under the  TVPRA. Therefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' have  adequately alleged receipt of a benefit for the purposes  of their claim for beneficiary liability. c. Knew or Should Have Known the Venture Was  Engaged in Trafficking While Twitter need not have actual knowledge of the  sex trafficking in order to have participated in the sex  trafficking venture for the purposes of Section 1595,  Plaintiffs must allege at least that Twitter knew or should  have known that Plaintiffs were the victims of sex  trafficking at the hands of users who posted the  content on Twitter. See B.M., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *5. Twitter contends it  had no way of knowing that the Videos might have been  evidence of commercial sex trafficking, but this  argument is hard to square with Plaintiffs' allegations  that they alerted Twitter that the Videos were created  under threat when Plaintiffs were children [**82]  and  provided evidence of John Doe #1's age in response to  Twitter's request for further information. Plaintiffs also  allege that other Twitter users used the word ""twinks"" to  describe the children in the Videos, which was ""another  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *924; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **78 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *924; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **78 Page 29 of 34 indication that Plaintiffs were minors, and that this fact  was evident from their appearance in the Videos. FAC ¶  37. According to FAC, that term is used to describe  ""young boys or men"" with ""certain boyish characteristics  such as 'little to no body or facial hair; a slim to average  build; and a youthful appearance.'"" Id. (quoting  Wikipedia).  Therefore,  the  Court  concludes  this  requirement is sufficiently alleged. *** In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have stated a claim  for civil liability under the TVPRA on the basis of  beneficiary liability and that the claim falls within the  exemption to Section 230 immunity created by FOSTA. C. Whether the FOSTA Exemption is Limited to  Claims Asserted under Sections 1591 and 1595 Before addressing Plaintiffs' remaining claims, the Court  addresses Twitter's argument that when Congress  enacted FOSTA, it intended to exempt from Section 230  immunity only claims asserted under Sections 1591 and  1595. This was the conclusion of the court in Kik, which  found that the ""plain language [**83]  of [FOSTA]  removes immunity only for conduct that violates 18  U.S.C. § 1591."" 482 F. Supp. 3d at 1249. Similarly, the  court in M. L. v. Craigslist Inc., held that because  ""FOSTA contains no language about whether it amends  the CDA to preclude immunity for state law civil actions""  it exempts Section 1595 claims but not state law claims.  No. C19-6153 BHS-TLF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166836,  2020 WL 6434845, at *9 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 17, 2020),  report and recommendation adopted, No. C19-6153  BHS-TLF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166334, 2020 WL  5494903 (W.D. Wash. Sept. 11, 2020). In J. B. v. G6  Hosp., LLC, Judge Gilliam reached the same conclusion  based on the plain language of FOSTA and further  addressed the legislative history, concluding that even if  it were appropriate  [*926]  to look beyond the words of  the statute to discern Congress's intent, ""it is not clear  that  Congress  was  concerned  specifically  with  permitting civil claims under state law."" No. 19-CV- 07848-HSG, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213, 2020 WL  4901196, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 20, 2020). The Court  agrees that based on the plain language of FOSTA, it  exempts only claims under Sections 1595 and 1591.  Therefore, to the extent that Plaintiffs' remaining claims  fall within the ambit of Section 230 immunity, FOSTA  does not exempt Twitter from immunity as to those  claims. D. Claim Three (18 U.S.C. §§ 2258A and 2258B) HN17[ ] Section 2258A establishes a duty on the part  of electronic communication service providers to report  to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children  (""NCMEC"") ""facts or circumstances from which there is  an apparent violation of section 2251 [**84] , 2251A,  2252, 2252A, 2252B, or 2260 that involves child  pornography."" 18 U.S.C. § 2258A; see also 18 U.S.C. §  2258E (defining ""provider"", ""NCMEC""). Section 2252A,  in turn, makes it a criminal offense to, inter alia,  knowingly mail or transport, receive, distribute or  reproduce child pornography. (As discussed above,  Claim Four is based, in part, on Twitter's alleged  violation of that provision.) HN18[ ] Section 2258B  bars the imposition of liability on a provider in  connection with its performance of the duty established  under Section 2258A except where the provider ""(1)  engaged in intentional misconduct; or (2) acted, or failed  to act-- (A) with actual malice; (B) with reckless  disregard to a substantial risk of causing physical injury  without legal justification; or (C) for a purpose unrelated  to the performance of any responsibility or function  under [Section 2258B], sections 2258A, 2258C, 2702,  or 2703."" 18 U.S.C. § 2258B. HN19[ ] Although Section 2258A establishes a duty to  report under criminal law, that section does not purport  to establish a private right of action. Rather, it provides  that ""knowing and willful failure"" to make a report will  result in the imposition of fines on the provider of up to  $300,000. See 18 U.S.C. 2258A(e). Section 2258B  creates a safe harbor that prohibits the imposition of  criminal or civil liability based on failure to report unless  the failure was the result of intentional or reckless  conduct. Based on their plain language, neither of these  provisions reflects a clear intent on the part of Congress  to establish a private right of action to enforce the  reporting requirement found in Section 2258A. See  Abcarian v. Levine, 972 F.3d 1019, 1025 (9th Cir. 2020  (""a cause of action may now be recognized under a  statute only where the language Congress used  displays an intent to create not just a private right but  also a private remedy."" ) (internal quotation and citation  omitted). Nor have Plaintiffs pointed to any authority  suggesting that there is private right of action under  Section 2258A. For this reason, the Court concludes  that Plaintiffs' claim under this section fails to state a  claim and does not reach the question of immunity  under CDA § 230. 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *925; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **82 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *925; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **82 Page 30 of 34 E. Claim Four (Personal Injuries Related [**85]  To  Sex Trafficking And Receipt And Distribution Of  Child Pornography Under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2252A, and  2255) Section 2255 creates a civil remedy for violations of  certain sections of the  [*927]  criminal code, including  Sections 2252A, providing as follows: (a) In general. Any person who, while a minor, was  a victim of a violation of section 1589, 1590, 1591,  2241(c), 2242, 2243, 2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A,  2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423 of this title and who  suffers personal injury as a result of such violation,  regardless of whether the injury occurred while  such person was a minor, may sue in any  appropriate United States District Court and shall  recover the actual damages such person sustains  or liquidated damages in the amount of $150,000,  and the cost of the action, including reasonable  attorney's fees and other litigation costs reasonably  incurred. The court may also award punitive  damages and such other preliminary and equitable  relief as the court determines to be appropriate. 18 U.S.C. § 2255(a). Twitter does not argue that  Plaintiffs have failed to allege a violation of Section  2252A but contend this claim is barred by CDA § 230  immunity. The Court agrees. While there is not a great deal of authority on this  question, at least two courts have concluded that under  Section 230, ICSs are immune from civil liability under  2252A and 2255. See Doe v. Bates, No. 5:05-CV-91- DF- [**86] CMC, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93348, 2006  WL 3813758, at *4 (E.D. Tex. Dec. 27, 2006); M.A. ex  rel. P.K. v. Vill. Voice Media Holdings, LLC, 809 F.  Supp. 2d 1041, 1051 (E.D. Mo. 2011). The Bates court  relied on the reasoning in Zeran v. Am. Online, Inc., 129  F.3d 327, 329 (4th Cir. 1997), explaining: The Zeran court . . . noted the Congressional  purpose of removing disincentives to self-regulation  by internet service providers. If internet service  providers such as Yahoo! could be liable for  reviewing materials but ultimately deciding to allow  them, they would likely chose not to regulate at all.  Further, even simply responding to notices of       potentially obscene materials would not be feasible  because the sheer number of postings on  interactive computer services would create an  impossible burden in the Internet context. To the  extent an internet service provider actually makes  choices about its content, without immunity they  would be faced with ceaseless choices of  suppressing controversial speech or sustaining  prohibitive liability. While the facts of a child  pornography case such as this one may be highly  offensive, Congress has decided that the parties to  be punished and deterred are not the internet  service providers but rather are those who created  and posted the illegal material[.] 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93348, 2006 WL 3813758, at *4  (internal quotations and citations omitted). Thus, in  Bates, the court concluded that while the exemption in  Section  230(e)(1)  does  not  prohibit  the  government [**87]  from prosecuting an ICS provider  under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A (which is found in chapter 110  of Title 18, the section of Title 18 that is expressly  carved out from Section 230 under subsection (e)(1)),  the exemption does not extend to civil claims asserted  under that section. 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93348, [WL]  at *4-5; see also M.A, 809 F. Supp. 2d at 1055 (holding  that plaintiff's claim seeking to impose civil liability on  internet service based on alleged violation of 18 U.S.C.  § 2252A was barred by Section 230 immunity). In Zeran, the plaintiff sued AOL based on its alleged  delay in taking down offensive posts by an unknown  third party that included the plaintiff's telephone number  and were resulting in the plaintiff being harassed and  receiving death threats. 129 F.3d at 329. The plaintiff  alleged that he repeatedly called AOL requesting that  the posts be removed and was told that they would be,  but that AOL failed to take them  [*928]  down for many  days. Id. AOL asserted that it was immune from the  plaintiff's claims under Section 230 and the court  agreed, rejecting the plaintiff's argument that the fact  that AOL knew about the offending posts deprived AOL  of immunity. Id. at 332-33. The court reasoned: [O]nce a computer service provider receives notice  of a potentially defamatory posting, it is thrust into  the role of a traditional publisher. The computer  service provider [**88]  must decide whether to  publish, edit, or withdraw the posting. In this  respect, Zeran seeks to impose liability on AOL for  assuming the role for which § 230 specifically  proscribes liability—the publisher role. 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *926; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **84 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *926; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **84 Page 31 of 34 Id. Plaintiffs argue that Bates was wrongly decided  because Zeran involved defamatory speech rather than  child pornography. According to Plaintiffs, unlike  defamatory speech, child pornography ""is at once  contraband, beyond the covering of First Amendment  speech protection, evidence of criminal child abuse, and  an ongoing sexual crime against a child"" and therefore,  requiring ICS providers to remove pornography does not  require them to exercise ""traditional editorial functions.""  Opposition at 23. While this argument has some force, it  does not square with Ninth Circuit authority, which has  found that ""[t]o avoid chilling speech, Congress 'made a  policy choice . . . not to deter harmful online speech  through the separate route of imposing tort liability on  companies that serve as intermediaries for other parties'  potentially injurious messages.'"" Gonzalez v. Google  LLC, 2 F.4th 871, 886 (9th Cir. 2021) (citing Carafano v.  Metrosplash.com, Inc., 339 F.3d 1119, 1123 (9th Cir.  2003) (quoting Zeran,129 F.3d at 330)). In Carafano, for  example,  the  third-party  content  was  not  only  defamatory but also included the creation of a fake  profile that resulted [**89]  in threats to the plaintiff and  her son. 339 F.3d at 1122. The Ninth Circuit recognized  that the plaintiff had been the victim of a ""cruel and  sadistic identity theft"" but concluded, ""despite the  serious and utterly deplorable consequences that  occurred in this case, . . . that Congress intended that  service providers such as Matchmaker be afforded  immunity from suit."" Id. at 1121, 1125.                       The undersigned therefore finds the reasoning and  holding of Bates and M.A. ex rel. P.K. v. Vill. Voice  Media Holdings on this question to be in line with Ninth  Circuit authority and concludes that immunity under  Section 230 is not defeated by the fact that the third- party content at issue is illegal child pornography.  Therefore, the Court concludes that this claim fails  under Section 230.  [*929]  F. Plaintiffs' State Law Claims 1. Claim Five (California Products Liability) Plaintiffs' products liability claim is based on the theory  that Twitter's platform is unreasonably dangerous and  therefore defective because it is designed so as to make  it easy for child predators and sex traffickers to quickly  disseminate CSAM on a wide scale while making it  difficult to report or block the dissemination of such  material. Plaintiffs attempt to avoid Section 230 on the  ground that [**90]  the claim is not based on Twitter's  conduct as a publisher of information but instead, on a  defective product, citing Lemmon v. Snap, Inc., 995  F.3d 1085, 1090 (9th Cir. 2021) in support of their  position. That case is distinguishable from the facts  here, however. In Lemmon v. Snap, the plaintiffs were parents of two  boys who were killed in a high speed car accident where  it was alleged that a speed-filter offered by the  defendant's smartphone application, Snapchat, played a  role in the accident. 995 F.3d at 1087-90. The speed  filter allowed Snapchat users to superimpose a filter  over photos or videos captured through Snapchat  recording their real-life speed, and it was alleged that  the speed filter incentivized young drivers to drive at  high speeds because it was suspected by Snapchat  users that logging a speed of over 100 MPH in a user  video would result in ""rewards"" from Snapchat. Id. at  1088-89. It was further alleged that the defendant was  aware of the danger of the speed filter because there  had been a ""series of news articles about this  phenomenon; an online petition that 'called on Snapchat  to address its role in encouraging dangerous speeding';  at least three accidents linked to Snapchat users' pursuit  of high-speed snaps; and at least one other lawsuit  against [**91]  Snap based on these practices."" Id. at  1089-90.  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *928; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **88 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *928; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **88 Page 32 of 34 The plaintiffs in Lemmon brought a products liability  claim based on negligent design against Snap, the  company that owns Snapchat, and Snap asserted that it  was entitled to immunity under Section 230. Id. at 1090.  The district court agreed but the Ninth Circuit reversed,  finding that the plaintiffs' claims did not treat the  defendant as a publisher or speaker. Id. at 1091. The  court reasoned as follows: It is . . . apparent that the Parents' amended  complaint does not seek to hold Snap liable for its  conduct as a publisher or speaker. Their negligent  design  lawsuit  treats  Snap  as  a  products  manufacturer, accusing it of negligently designing a  product (Snapchat) with a defect (the interplay  between Snapchat's reward system and the Speed  Filter). Thus, the duty that Snap allegedly violated  ""springs from"" its distinct capacity as a product  designer. Barnes, 570 F.3d at 1107. This is further  evidenced by the fact that Snap could have  satisfied  its  ""alleged  obligation""—to  take  reasonable measures to design a product more  useful than it was foreseeably dangerous— without altering the content that Snapchat's  users generate. Internet Brands, 824 F.3d at 851.  Snap's alleged duty in this case thus ""has nothing  to do with"" its editing, monitoring, [**92]  or  removing of the content that its users generate  through Snapchat. Id. at 852. . . . That Snap allows  its users to transmit user-generated content to one  another does not detract from the fact that the  Parents seek to hold Snap liable for its role in  violating its distinct duty to design a reasonably  safe product. . . . Though publishing content is ""a  but-for cause of just about everything"" Snap is  involved in, that does not mean that the Parents'  claim, specifically, seeks to hold Snap  [*930]   responsible in its capacity as a ""publisher or  speaker."" Id. at 1092 (emphasis added). Here, as in Lemmon, Plaintiffs' products liability claim is  based on the allegation that the design of the Twitter  platform is unreasonably dangerous. The facts here  differ, however, from those in Lemmon because the  nature of the alleged design flaw in this case - and the  harm that is alleged to flow from that flaw - is directly  related to the posting of third-party content on Twitter. In  particular, Plaintiffs allege that Twitter's design, which is  aimed at ""enabling its users to disseminate information  very quickly to large numbers of people"" through such  features as hashtags and algorithms, also enables ""sex  traffickers to distribute [**93]  CSAM on a massive  scale."" FAC ¶¶ 179-181. Conversely, they allege,  Twitter is not ""designed to enable its users to easily  report CSAM, nor is it designed so that CSAM is  immediately blocked pending review when reported."" Id.  ¶ 182. Nor does Twitter ""consistently deploy IP blocking,  or other measures, to prevent users suspended by  Twitter for disseminating CSAM from opening new  accounts under different names[,]"" Plaintiffs allege.  These flaws, in essence, seek to impose liability on  Twitter based on how well Twitter has designed its  platform to prevent the posting of third-party content  containing child pornography and to remove that content  after it is posted. In other words, to meet the obligation  Plaintiffs seek to impose on Twitter on this claim, Twitter  would have to alter the content posted by its users, in  contrast to the design defect alleged in Lemmon.  Therefore, the Court concludes that Lemmon is not on  point and that Plaintiffs' products liability claim fails on  the basis that Twitter is entitled to immunity as to that  claim under Section 230 immunity. 2. Claims Six through Nine (Negligence Claims) Twitter challenges all of Plaintiffs' negligence claims on  the grounds that it is immune [**94]  from liability on  those claims under Section 230. It further asserts that  the negligence per se and negligent infliction of  emotional distress claims (Claims Eight and Nine) are  not independent causes of action and that the remaining  negligence claims (Claims Six and Seven) fail because  Twitter does not owe Plaintiffs any duty. The Court finds  that these claims fall within the scope of Section 230  and therefore does not reach Twitter's remaining  arguments. The essence of these claims is that Twitter breached a  duty to Plaintiffs - and violated various criminal statutes - by failing to remove the Videos after being notified of  them and instead allowing them to be broadly  disseminated on Twitter. These claims seek to treat  Twitter as a publisher of information, which is prohibited  under Section 230. See In re Facebook, Inc., 625  S.W.3d 80, 2021 WL 2603687, at *9 (Tex. 2021) (finding  that negligence claims against Facebook based on its  failure to protect plaintiffs from sex traffickers who used  its platform were barred under Section 230). Therefore,  the Court finds that Plaintiffs' negligence claims fail  under Section 230.   555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *929; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **91 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *929; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **91 Page 33 of 34 3. Claim Ten (Distribution of Private, Sexually  Explicit Material Under Cal. Civ. Code section  1708.85) California Civil Code section 1708.85(a) provides: A private cause of action lies against a person who  intentionally  distributes  by  any  means  a  photograph, film, [**95]  videotape, recording, or  any other reproduction  [*931]  of another, without  the other's consent, if (1) the person knew that the  other person had a reasonable expectation that the  material would remain private, (2) the distributed  material exposes an intimate body part of the other  person, or shows the other person engaging in an  act of intercourse, oral copulation, sodomy, or other  act of sexual penetration, and (3) the other person  suffers general or special damages as described in  Section 48a. Cal. Civ. Code section 1708.85(a). Section 1708.85  exempts from liability, however, a ""person distributing  material under subdivision (a)"" where ""[t]he distributed  material was previously distributed by another person.""  Cal. Civ. Code section 1708.85(c)(6). Based on the  plain language of these provisions, the Court concludes  Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim. Liability under section 1708.85(a) requires that Twitter  intentionally distributed the Videos. Even assuming that  Twitter's conduct amounted to intentional distribution  once it was put on notice of the Videos, the allegations  in the FAC make clear that at that point these Videos  had already been posted by ""another person,"" namely,  the owners of the user handles @StraightBross and  @fitmalesblog. See FAC ¶¶ 89, 91, 99. Plaintiffs have  not cited any contrary authority [**96]  or even  addressed Twitter's argument in their Opposition.  Therefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs fail to state  a claim under section 1708.85(a). Further, to the extent  that this claim seeks to hold Twitter liable for failing to  remove third-party content from its platform, the Court  concludes that the claim is barred under CDA § 230  because it treats Twitter as a publisher. 4. Claim Eleven (Intrusion Into Private Affairs) HN20[ ] The tort of intrusion into private affairs has two  elements:  ""(1)  intrusion  into  a  private  place,  conversation or matter, (2) in a manner highly offensive  to a reasonable person."" Shulman v. Group W  Productions, Inc., 18 Cal. 4th 200, 231, 74 Cal. Rptr. 2d  843, 955 P.2d 469 (1998), as modified on denial of reh'g  (July 29, 1998). Twitter does not argue in the Motion  that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for intrusion into private  affairs and therefore, the Court assumes that Plaintiffs  adequately allege such a claim. Nonetheless, the basis  for this claim is Twitter's ""role as a 'republisher' of  material posted by a third party,"" and therefore, the  claim is barred by CDA § 230. Caraccioli v. Facebook,  Inc., 700 F. App'x 588, 590 (9th Cir. 2017) (holding that  claim against Facebook for intrusion into private affairs  based on Facebook's refusal to remove private photos  and videos of the plaintiff from Facebook was barred  under Section 230). 5. Claim Twelve (Invasion of Privacy [**97]  Under  California Constitution) HN21[ ] To establish an invasion of privacy claim  under the California Constitution, a plaintiff must  demonstrate three elements: ""(1) a legally protected  privacy interest; (2) a reasonable expectation of privacy  in the circumstances; and (3) conduct by defendant  constituting a serious invasion of privacy."" Hill v. Nat'l  Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 7 Cal.4th 1, 39-40, 26 Cal.  Rptr. 2d 834, 865 P.2d 633 (1994). Again, Twitter has  not argued that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim as to this  claim and the Court assumes that their claim is  sufficiently alleged, but like the claim for intrusion into  private affairs, this claim is based on Twitter's role as a  ""republisher"" of third-party content and therefore is  barred under CDA § 230. 6. Claim Thirteen (UCL Claim) Twitter asserts that Plaintiffs do not have standing to  assert their UCL  [*932]  claim and that they fail to state  a claim because they have not alleged any statutory  violation or, to the extent the claim is based on alleged  misrepresentations by Twitter, any reliance on those  misrepresentations. It also contends the claim is barred  by CDA § 230. The Court assumes without deciding that  Plaintiffs have adequately alleged standing. It also finds  that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged an ""unlawful""  practice under the UCL for the same reasons [**98]  it  finds that Plaintiffs have stated a claim for beneficiary  liability under Section 1595 and 1591(a)(2). The  gravamen of the UCL claim, however, is that Twitter  engaged in an unlawful and unfair practice by failing to  ensure that the Videos were blocked from Twitter or at  least, removed promptly. As such, this claim seeks to  impose liability on Twitter as a publisher of third-party  555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *930; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **94 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, *930; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157158, **94 Page 34 of 34 content and is therefore barred by Section 230.",1
"Does v. Reddit, Inc., 51 F.4th 1137","[*1139]  M. SMITH, Circuit Judge: Users of the social media platform Reddit posted and  circulated sexually explicit images and videos of minors  online. In response, the victims, or their parents, sued  Reddit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1595. The district court     51 F.4th 1137, *1137; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 29510, **1 Page 6 of 11 dismissed the claim, holding that section 230 of the  Communications Decency Act (CDA), 47 U.S.C. §  230(c)(1), shielded Reddit from liability. Because  Reddit  is  an  ""interactive  computer  services"" [**4]  provider, it generally enjoys immunity  from liability for user-posted content under § 230(c)(1),  or ""section 230 immunity."" HN1[ ] However, pursuant  to the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex  Trafficking Act of 2018 (FOSTA), section 230 immunity  does not apply to child sex trafficking claims—if the  ""conduct underlying the claim"" also violates 18 U.S.C. §  1591, the criminal child sex trafficking statute. 47 U.S.C.  § 230(e)(5)(A). The dispute in this case is whether the  availability of FOSTA's immunity exception is contingent  upon a plaintiff proving that a defendantwebsite's own  conduct—rather than its users' conduct—resulted in a  violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. We hold that it does, and  we affirm. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND Reddit is a social media platform that allows users to  publicly post content. It is organized by small,  searchable forums devoted to specific topics, called  subreddits. Reddit users create and moderate each  subreddit, dictating the type of content users can post.  In turn, Reddit employees can remove moderators,  content, or entire subreddits that do not conform to  Reddit policies. The plaintiffs in this case are the parents of minors, and  one former minor, who have had sexually explicit  images and videos of them posted to Reddit. Each  plaintiff [**5]  tells a similar story: after discovering  explicit images or videos of their children (or  themselves) posted to one or more subreddits, they  immediately reported the content to the subreddit  moderators and to Reddit employees. In response,  Reddit sometimes—though not always—removed the  content, only for it to be reposted shortly afterward. This  cycle repeated again and again across different  subreddits. Collectively, the plaintiffs contacted Reddit  hundreds of times to report the explicit posts. The plaintiffs allege that the presence of child  pornography on Reddit is blatant, but Reddit has done  little to remove the unlawful content or prevent it from  being posted, because it drives user traffic and revenue.  As of April 2021, when this suit was filed, Reddit hosted  many subreddits that openly and explicitly marketed  themselves as fora for child pornography, with names  like  /r/BestofYoungNSFW,  r/teensdirtie,  /r/TeenBeauties, and /r/YoungGirlsGoneWild. Users  publicly ""trade"" and solicit child pornography on these  pages, and advocacy groups and the press have  repeatedly reported this activity to Reddit. Plaintiffs allege that Reddit earns substantial advertising  revenue from subreddits [**6]  that feature child  pornography because they generate controversy and   [*1140]  attract viewers. Indeed, third-party advertising  tools have listed several subreddits dedicated to child  pornography as some of the most popular pages on the  platform, which encourages advertisers to buy ad space  on those pages. As such, the plaintiffs contend that  Reddit financially benefits from openly hosting child  pornography. The plaintiffs further contend that, because it enjoys the  revenue generated by child pornography, Reddit has  taken little action to block it from the platform. The  plaintiffs allege that Reddit does not adequately train its  moderators to screen and remove unlawful content and  that  some  moderators  post  child  pornography  themselves. Moreover, Reddit has not implemented  basic security measures, such as age verification or IP- address tracking to ban repeat offenders, and it delayed  adoption of automated image-recognition technologies  like ""PhotoDNA,"" which can detect child pornography  and prevent it from being posted. Based on the foregoing, the plaintiffs filed a class-action  lawsuit against Reddit pursuant to the federal civil sex  trafficking statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1595, claiming that  Reddit is liable as a beneficiary [**7]  of child sex  trafficking, among other causes of action. Reddit filed a  motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, which the  district court granted. The district court held that, to  avoid section 230 immunity under FOSTA, the plaintiffs  were required to plead that Reddit's own conduct  violated the criminal sex trafficking statute, 18 U.S.C. §  1591, and they failed to do so. Plaintiffs now appeal. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW HN2[ ] We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §  1291. We review a decision on a motion to dismiss for  failure to state a claim de novo. Gonzalez v. Google  LLC, 2 F.4th 871, 885 (9th Cir. 2021). We take the  allegations in the complaint as true and view them in the  light most favorable to the plaintiffs. Id. ANALYSIS 51 F.4th 1137, *1139; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 29510, **3 Page 7 of 11 I At issue in this appeal is the scope of FOSTA's  exception to section 230 immunity for civil child sex  trafficking claims. The answer to the question involves  several interrelated statutory provisions. To begin, HN3[ ] pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1), ""[n]o provider or  user of an interactive computer service shall be treated  as the publisher or speaker of any information provided  by another information content provider."" In general, this  provision ""immunizes providers of interactive computer  services against liability arising from content created by  third parties."" Fair Hous. Council of San Fernando  Valley v. Roommates.Com, LLC, 521 F.3d 1157, 1162  (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc) (cleaned [**8]  up). In other  words, it ""protects websites from liability for material  posted on the website by someone else."" Doe v.  Internet Brands, Inc., 824 F.3d 846, 850 (9th Cir. 2016).  This  protection  is  ""robust.""  Carafano  v.  Metrosplash.com, Inc., 339 F.3d 1119, 1123 (9th Cir.  2003). HN4[ ] In 2018, Congress amended section 230 by  passing FOSTA. Pub. L. No. 115-164, 132 Stat. 1253.  Among other things, FOSTA provides that section 230  immunity does not apply to certain sex trafficking claims.  Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)(A), ""[n]othing in  [section 230] . . . shall be construed to impair or limit . . .  any claim in a civil action brought under section 1595 of  title 18, if the conduct underlying the claim constitutes a  violation of section 1591 of that title."" In turn, this  provision of FOSTA incorporates two sections of the  Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act  (TVPRA), 18 U.S.C. § 1589 et seq.  [*1141]  First,  section 1595 of the TVPRA provides a civil cause of  action for violations of the federal trafficking laws. 18  U.S.C. § 1595(a). It permits trafficking victims to sue the  perpetrators of their trafficking as well as anyone who  ""knowingly benefits . . . from participation in a venture  which that person knew or should have known"" was  engaged in sex trafficking. Id. HN5[ ] Section 1591, on the other hand, is the federal  criminal child sex trafficking statute. Like section 1595,  section 1591 covers both perpetrators and beneficiaries  of trafficking. Id. § 1591(a). However, the standard for  beneficiary liability pursuant to section 1591 is higher: to  be held criminally liable as a beneficiary, a defendant  must have actual knowledge [**9]  of the trafficking and  must ""assist[], support[], or facilitat[e]"" the trafficking  venture. Id. § 1591(e)(4). HN6[ ] In sum: websites are generally immune from  liability for user-posted content, but that immunity does  not cover civil child sex trafficking claims if the ""conduct  underlying the claim"" violates 18 U.S.C. §1591. II Both parties agree that section 230 immunity applies to  the claims against Reddit. Reddit is an ""interactive  computer service"" provider as defined in § 230(f)(2) and  the plaintiffs' claims treat Reddit ""as the publisher or  speaker"" of ""information provided by another information  content provider."" 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1). Accordingly,  the parties focus their arguments on whether plaintiffs'  claims benefit from FOSTA's exception. The parties dispute whose conduct must have violated  18 U.S.C. §1591 for a website to be held liable in a civil  trafficking suit. Reddit argues that a website may only  be liable for its own criminal conduct. Plaintiffs argue  that a website may be liable as a beneficiary when  someone's conduct (likely a user's conduct) violated the  criminal statute and the claim against the website  derives from that violation. District courts in our circuit  are split on the issue. Compare J. B. v. G6 Hosp., LLC,  No. 19-CV-07848-HSG, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170338,  2021 WL 4079207, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 8, 2021)  (holding defendant's own conduct must violate criminal  statute), [**10]  M. L. v. Craigslist Inc.1, No. C19-6153  BHS-TLF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166334, 2020 WL  5494903, at *4 (W.D. Wash. Sept. 11, 2020), and A.M.  v. Omegle.com, LLC, No. 3:21-CV-01674-MO, 2022  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123695, 2022 WL 2713721, at *7 (D.  Or. July 13, 2022), with Doe v. Twitter, Inc., 555 F.  Supp. 3d 889, 921 (N.D. Cal. 2021) (holding that the  remedial purpose of FOSTA supports a liberal  construction of the immunity exception), and Doe v.  Mindgeek USA Inc., 574 F. Supp. 3d 760, 773-74 (C.D.  Cal. 2021). We have not had the opportunity to address  the issue until now. HN7[ ] We hold that for a plaintiff  to invoke FOSTA's immunity exception, she must  plausibly allege that the website's own conduct violated  section 1591. A Both parties to the appeal claim that the text of FOSTA  is unambiguous. HN8[ ] Thus, we must first ""determine  whether the language is clear and unambiguous, and if  so, apply it as written."" Thrifty Oil Co. v. Bank of Am.  Nat. Tr. & Sav. Ass'n, 322 F.3d 1039, 1057 (9th Cir.  51 F.4th 1137, *1140; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 29510, **7 Page 8 of 11 2003). Accordingly, we commence our analysis by  considering the plain text of the statute. Ross v. Blake,  578 U.S. 632, 638, 136 S. Ct. 1850, 195 L. Ed. 2d 117  (2016). Doing so, we conclude that the plain text of  FOSTA and precedent interpreting a similar immunity  exception establishes that a website can only be held  liable if its own conduct—not a third party's—violates 18  U.S.C. §1591.  [*1142]  HN9[ ] Section 230(e)(5)(A) reads as follows:  ""[n]othing in [section 230] shall be construed to impair or  limit [ ] any claim in a civil action brought under section  1595 of Title 18, if the conduct underlying the claim  constitutes a violation of section 1591 of that title. . . .""  47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)(A) (emphasis added). The  Supreme Court interpreted analogous language in a  similar context in OBB Personenverkehr AG v. Sachs,  577 U.S. 27, 136 S. Ct. 390, 193 L. Ed. 2d 269 (2015).  There, the Court considered the commercial [**11]   activity exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities  Act, which removes foreign states' sovereign immunity  in any action ""based upon a commercial activity carried  on in the United States."" Id. at 29 (quoting 28 U.S.C. §  1605(a)(2)) (emphasis added). Sachs held that, to  ascertain the conduct that a claim is ""based upon,""  courts should identify ""those elements [of a claim] that, if  proven, would entitle a plaintiff to relief"" and ""the  gravamen of the complaint."" Id. at 33 (quoting Saudi  Arabia v. Nelson, 507 U.S. 349, 357, 113 S. Ct. 1471,  123 L. Ed. 2d 47 (1993)). In that case, the plaintiff sued  an Austrian railway after she was injured in an accident  that occurred in Austria, but she purchased her rail  ticket in Massachusetts. Id. at 29-30. Because the  gravamen of her claim—the accident and her injuries— occurred abroad, her claim was not ""based upon""  domestic activity, and the exception did not apply. Id. at  35. We agree with Reddit that ""underlying"" and ""based  upon"" are analogous, so Sachs' interpretation is  instructive.  See  Underlying,  Merriam-Webster's  Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed. 2020) (""underlying""  means  ""basic""  or  ""foundational"").  Granted,  the  ""gravamen"" inquiry in Sachs was fact-bound: the Court  considered the totality of plaintiff's allegations and         identified those most central to her lawsuit. Id. at 35-36.  In [**12]  contrast, this appeal requires us to make a  binary determination as a matter of law. But the basic  thrust of Sachs—that a claim is ""based upon"" its most  important components, or in other words, the facts  ""underlying"" a claim are those most important to proving  the claim—is commonsense, and has logical import  here. HN10[ ] In a sex trafficking beneficiary suit against a  defendant-website, the most important component is the  defendant-website's own conduct—its ""participation in  the venture."" See 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) (authorizing  lawsuits against those who ""benefit[] . . . from  participation in a [trafficking] venture""). A complaint  against a website that merely alleges trafficking by the  website's users—without the participation of the  website—would not survive. Proof that a user committed  criminal trafficking may ""entitle a plaintiff to relief"" in a  case against the user, but not against the website.  Sachs, 577 U.S. at 33. The structure of the plaintiffs' complaint confirms how  central Reddit's conduct is to their case. Although the  plaintiffs take the position that the conduct ""underlying""  their claim is the conduct of the Reddit users who  posted the offending images and videos, very little of  their complaint describes the trafficking conduct [**13]   itself. Rather, the complaint focuses on the facts critical  to Reddit's liability—the ways that Reddit makes money  from permitting child  [*1143]  pornography on its  platform and Reddit's responses to reports of that  pornography. HN11[ ] Because we conclude that the  ""gravamen"" of a section 1595 beneficiary claim is the  defendant's participation in and benefit from the  trafficking scheme, we hold that a defendant-website's  own conduct must ""underl[ie]"" the claim for purposes of  47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)(A). As such, a website's own  conduct must violate 18 U.S.C. § 1591 for the immunity  exception to apply. B To the extent doubt remains about the meaning of  section 230(e)(5)(A), FOSTA's wider statutory context  confirms our reading. See Niz-Chavez, 141 S. Ct. at  1482 (taking a ""wider look at [the] statutory structure"" to  confirm statutory meaning). HN12[ ] Alongside section 230(e)(5)(A), FOSTA added  two other trafficking-related immunity exceptions to the  CDA: sections 230(e)(5)(B) and (C). Those provisions  permit states to prosecute websites if ""the conduct  51 F.4th 1137, *1141; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 29510, **10 Page 9 of 11 underlying the charge"" would violate 18 U.S.C. § 1591  or 18 U.S.C. § 2421A, which criminalize the facilitation  of child sex trafficking and prostitution, respectively. 47  U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)(B)-(C). Because ""identical words and  phrases within the same statute should normally be  given the same meaning,"" we assume that ""the conduct  underlying"" has the same meaning across [**14]  the  three provisions. Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy  Servs., Inc., 551 U.S. 224, 232, 127 S. Ct. 2411, 168 L.  Ed. 2d 112 (2007). This is ""doubly appropriate"" here, id.,  because the provisions are adjacent and were enacted  simultaneously, see Lomax v. Ortiz-Marquez, 140 S. Ct.  1721, 1725, 207 L. Ed. 2d 132 (2020). HN13[ ] Because subsections (B) and (C) authorize  criminal prosecutions, there is good reason to think that  ""the conduct underlying the charge"" as used in (B) and  (C) refers only to the defendant's own conduct. Reading  criminal statutes, we ""presume[] that Congress did not  intend to 'dispense with a conventional mens rea  element, which would require that the defendant know  the facts that make his conduct illegal.'"" United States v.  Collazo, 984 F.3d 1308, 1324 (9th Cir. 2021) (quoting  Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 605, 114 S. Ct.  1793, 128 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1994)). Applying this principle  here, we presume subsection (B) permits states to  prosecute websites for trafficking only if the defendant  ""knowingly"" facilitated trafficking, in violation of 18  U.S.C. § 1591. See § 1591(e)(4). And we presume  subsection (C) permits states to prosecute websites for  promoting or facilitating prostitution only if the website  ""inten[ded]"" to do so, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §  2421A(a). In short, we presume these provisions  authorize criminal prosecutions only for a defendant's  own crimes. Because section 230(e)(5)(A) uses the  same language, we read it to include the same  limitation. See Powerex, 551 U.S. at 232. The statutory  context  reinforces  our  conclusion  that  section  230(e)(5)(A) removes section 230 immunity only when a  website violates 18 U.S.C. §1591. C Although we conclude that the language [**15]  and  structure of the statute resolves its meaning, FOSTA's  original legislative proponents' understanding about how  FOSTA would be interpreted and applied once several  amendments had been made to their original legislation  decidedly supports Reddit's interpretation. In 1996, Congress passed section 230 to promote  development of the internet's ""vibrant and competitive  free market"" and ""diversity of political discourse, unique  opportunities for cultural development, and myriad  avenues for intellectual activity."" Telecommunications  Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, § 509, 110 Stat. 56,  138  [*1144]  (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 230(a)(3)). But by  the 2010s, there was the growing sense that websites  like Backpage.com were taking advantage of the  immunity afforded by section 230 to facilitate online sex  trafficking and promote illegal pornography. 164 Cong.  Rec. S1854 (daily ed. Mar. 21, 2018) (statement of Sen.  McCaskill).  A  congressional  investigation  of  Backpage.com revealed that minors were being  advertised for sex work on the platform and that  Backpage.com  participated  in  the  scheme  by  ""affirmatively edit[ing] ads that it kn[ew] [we]re selling  children for sex"" to avoid having to remove the ads from  the platform. Id. at S1851 (statement of Sen.  Blumenthal). Although section 230 as originally enacted did not  immunize websites [**16]  like Backpage.com from  federal criminal sex trafficking laws, see 47 U.S.C. §  230(e)(1), it was unclear whether states could bring  analogous prosecutions. Courts were also reluctant to  hold websites liable in any civil trafficking suits  stemming from user-posts, even if the website  participated in the scheme. See, e.g., Doe No. 1 v.  Backpage.com, LLC, 817 F.3d 12, 23 (1st Cir. 2016). Congress passed FOSTA in 2018 to address these  issues. The purpose of the bill was ""to give survivors  their day in court . . . [and] open avenues of prosecution  to  law  enforcement  where  they  are  currently  roadblocked."" 164 Cong. Rec. S1851 (daily ed. March  21, 2018) (statement of Sen. Blumenthal); see 164  Cong. Rec. H1291 (daily ed. Feb. 27, 2018) (statement  of Rep. Jackson Lee) (noting that the bill would allow  victims to hold accountable ""online ad services and  websites that facilitate or allow sex trafficking""). As first  introduced in the House, FOSTA simply stated that  section 230 did not ""impair the enforcement of, or limit  availability of victim restitution or civil remedies under . .  . civil laws relating to sexual exploitation of children or  sex trafficking."" H.R. 1865, 115th Cong. § 3 (Apr. 3,  2017). S. 1693, 115th Cong. § 3 (Aug. 1, 2017). This  version  of  FOSTA  would  have  created  an  immunity [**17]  exception for all section 1595 claims  against websites. Opponents of the bill, however, were concerned that it  would ""bring a deluge of frivolous litigation targeting  legitimate, law-abiding intermediaries"" because it was  ""unbounded by any actual knowledge"" requirement. The  51 F.4th 1137, *1143; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 29510, **13 Page 10 of 11 Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act of 2017: Hearing on  S. 1693 Before the S. Comm. on Com., Sci. & Transp.,  115th Cong. 35 (2017) (statement of Abigail Slater,  General  Counsel,  Internet  Association).  These  opponents suggested amendments to require ""a clear  sense of knowing,"" as to ""not damage those who are  truly trying to grow and innovate based on that  protection they get from lawsuits."" Id. at 53 (statement of  Xavier Becerra, Attorney General of Cal.). In response, the Senate altered the bill to its current  form to ""eliminate section 230 as a defense for websites  that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking."" S. Rep. No.  115-199,  at  2  (2018)  (emphasis  added).  As  reintroduced, the bill's ""knowing standard"" was intended  to create a ""high bar"" for liability. The Stop Enabling Sex  Traffickers Act of 2017, Hearing on S. 1693 Before the  Comm. on Commerce, Sci., and Transp., 115 Cong. 9  (2017). Indeed, Representative Ann Wagner, the House  bill's [**18]  original sponsor, complained that the new  version so dramatically ""narrowed"" the immunity  exception and that ""the 'knowingly' mens rea standard . .  . w[ould] not provide operational recourse to justice for  victims across the country and thus may not actually  prevent future victimization."" The Latest Developments  in Combating Online Sex Trafficking: Hearing Before the  Subcomm. on Commc'ns & Tech. of the H.  [*1145]   Comm. on Energy & Com., 115th Cong. 4 n.7 (2018). HN14[ ] On this record, it is clear that FOSTA requires  that a defendant-website violate the criminal statute by  directly sex trafficking or, with actual knowledge,  ""assisting, supporting, or facilitating"" trafficking, for the  immunity  exception  to  apply.  We  agree  with  Representative Wagner that, as enacted, 47 U.S.C. §  230(e)(5)(A)  retains  only  a  limited  capacity  to  accomplish its original goal of allowing trafficking victims  to hold websites accountable. However, this is a flaw, or  perhaps a feature, that Congress wrote into the statute,  and is not one we can rewrite by judicial fiat. III Having concluded that 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)(A) requires  that a defendantwebsite's own conduct violate 18 U.S.C.  § 1591, we must decide whether the plaintiffs have  alleged that Reddit did so in this case. HN15[ ] Section  1591 punishes anyone [**19]  who ""knowingly . . .  benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value,  from participation in a venture which has engaged in [a  sex trafficking act], knowing . . . that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act . . ."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a)(2). ""Participation in a venture,"" in turn, is  defined  as  ""knowingly  assisting,  supporting,  or  facilitating"" sex trafficking activities. Id. § 1591(e)(4).  Accordingly, establishing criminal liability requires that a  defendant  knowingly  benefit  from  knowingly  participating in child sex trafficking. HN16[ ] We agree with the reasoning of other courts to  address the issue that, to hold a defendant criminally  liable as a beneficiary of sex trafficking, the defendant  must have actually ""engaged in some aspect of the sex  trafficking."" See United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App'x  272, 286 (6th Cir. 2016); Noble v. Weinstein, 335 F.  Supp. 3d 504, 524 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (a plaintiff must  allege some ""specific conduct [by the defendant] that  furthered the sex trafficking venture . . . undertaken with  knowledge"" of the venture). To run afoul of § 1591, a  defendant must knowingly benefit from and knowingly  assist, support, or facilitate sex trafficking activities.  Mere association with sex traffickers is insufficient  absent some knowing ""participation"" in the form of  assistance, [**20]  support, or facilitation. See 18 U.S.C.  § 1591(e)(4). The statute does not target those that  merely ""turn a blind eye to the source of their [revenue].""  Afyare, 632 F. App'x at 286. And knowingly benefitting  from participation in such a venture requires actual  knowledge  and""a  causal  relationship  between  affirmative conduct furthering the sex-trafficking venture  and receipt of a benefit."" Geiss v. Weinstein Co.  Holdings LLC, 383 F. Supp. 3d 156, 169 (S.D.N.Y.  2019). In this case, the plaintiffs have not alleged that Reddit  knowingly participated in or benefitted from a sex  trafficking venture. They allege that Reddit provides a  platform where it is easy to share child pornography,  highlights subreddits that feature child pornography to  sell advertising on those pages, allows users who share  child pornography to serve as subreddit moderators,  and fails to remove child pornography even when users  report it, as the plaintiffs did in this case. Together, they  say, this amounts to knowing participation in a sex  trafficking venture. Taken as true, these allegations suggest only that  Reddit ""turned a blind eye"" to the unlawful content  posted on its platform, not that it actively participated in  sex trafficking. See Afyare, 632 F. App'x at 286.  Moreover, the plaintiffs have not alleged a connection  between the child pornography posted on Reddit [**21]   and the revenue Reddit generates, other than the fact  that Reddit makes money from advertising  [*1146]  on  51 F.4th 1137, *1144; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 29510, **17 Page 11 of 11 all popular subreddits. See Noble, 335 F. Supp. 3d at  524 (finding insufficient connection between general  benefits defendant received from working for individual  who perpetrated sex trafficking and the perpetrator's  conduct toward the victim). Plaintiffs who have  successfully  alleged  beneficiary  liability  for  sex  trafficking have charged defendants with far more active  forms of participation than the plaintiffs allege here. See,  e.g., Canosa v. Ziff, No. 18 CIV. 4115 (PAE), 2019 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 13263, 2019 WL 498865, at *23-24  (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 28, 2019) (denying motion to dismiss  beneficiary liability claims where plaintiffs alleged  affiliates of Harvey Weinstein lured victims ""through the  promise of production deals,"" provided Weinstein  ""medications he required to perform sexual acts,"" and  ""cleaned up after his sexual assaults""). As such, the  plaintiffs have failed to state a claim that Reddit violated  18 U.S.C. § 1591.",1
G.G. v. Salesforce,"[*629]  MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER When G.G. was thirteen years old, she ran away from  home and fell into the hands of a sex trafficker. The  trafficker posted advertisements for sex with G.G. on  the classified ad website run by Backpage.com  [*630]   (""Backpage"").  As  alleged  in  the  complaint,  Backpage [**2]  did not just allow but encouraged these  types of illegal ads, to the point of becoming a dominant  force in online sex trafficking. Beginning in 2013,  Backpage contracted with Defendant Salesforce.com,  Inc.  (""Salesforce"")  to  provide  it  with  customer  relationship management (""CRM"") business software  and support. That relationship allegedly helped grow  Backpage's  operations,  including  promoting  the  business of sex traffickers. G.G. and her mother,  Deanna Rose, (together, ""Plaintiffs"") have now sued  Salesforce pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1595, alleging that,  through its contracts with Backpage, Salesforce violated  the federal anti-trafficking laws by knowingly benefiting  from and participating in a venture that it knew, or  should have known, was engaged in illegal sex  trafficking. Salesforce has filed a motion to dismiss the  complaint in its entirety pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil  Procedure 12(b)(6). (Dkt. No. 63.) For the reasons given  below, the Court grants the motion. BACKGROUND      Page 2 of 15 For purposes of Salesforce's motion to dismiss, the  Court accepts as true all well-pleaded facts in the Third  Amended Complaint (""TAC"") and views those facts in  the light most favorable to Plaintiffs as the non-moving  parties. Killingsworth v. HSBC Bank Nev., N.A., 507  F.3d 614, 618 (7th Cir. 2007). The TAC alleges as  follows. Backpage [**3]  was established in 2004 as an online  marketplace for various goods and services. (TAC ¶ 16,  Dkt. No. 62.) Among other things, Backpage allowed  classified ads for sex. (Id.) In 2008, Backpage's primary  competitor, Craigslist, made it harder for users to post  ads for sex on its platform. Capitalizing on the displaced  ad volume, Backpage entered into a period of explosive  growth, soon becoming the most popular online  classified site for adult advertisements and deriving the  vast majority (up to 99%) of its revenue from such ads.  (Id. ¶¶ 16, 23-24.) Salesforce is the world's top CRM platform, selling  software to help companies manage their relationships  with customers, improve profitability, and streamline  processes. (Id. ¶¶ 29-30.) Specifically, Salesforce sells  ""software as a service"" (""SaaS"") technology consisting  of a set of applications that, among other things, can  help businesses manage sales and marketing functions,  assist with customer service and support, provide  customer data integration and support, permit both  internal communications and communications with  customers, offer business intelligence analytics, and  process other forms of data. (Id. ¶ 31.) The Salesforce  platform [**4]  also has a ""customer org""—that is, a  portal that serves as a point of interaction between  Salesforce and its customers. (Id. ¶ 32.) The customer  org is confidential to each Salesforce customer and  consists of that customer's users, data, and automation.  (Id.) Additionally, to help its customers achieve their  business goals, Salesforce also provides personalized  support. (Id. ¶ 33.) As Backpage grew, it required more support and better  CRM tools and capabilities to keep up with customer  demand and scale its platform. (Id. ¶ 35.) To meet this  need, Backpage contracted with Salesforce in 2013. (Id.  ¶ 37.) As set forth in the Master Service Agreements  between Salesforce and Backpage, Salesforce retained   [*631]  the right to delete or restrict access to  Backpage's customer org if Backpage's actions or  content was tortious. (Id. ¶ 47.) During their negotiations  in November 2013, Backpage's Chief Executive Officer  (""CEO"") Carl Ferrer and another high-level executive  met with a certified Salesforce Consulting Partner to  assess Backpage's needs and goals as a business and  to determine how Salesforce could help. (Id. ¶ 53.) An  in-house Salesforce account executive continued those  conversations, which [**5]  eventually culminated in a  deal between the companies. (Id. ¶ 54.) Over the next  five years, Salesforce sold Backpage access to several  products, including the premium ""Enterprise Edition"" of  its CRM software. (Id.) An in-house Salesforce  executive recommended the Enterprise Edition, which is  described as ""fully customizable."" (Id. ¶ 45.) And, in  2015,  Salesforce  provided  the  technological  infrastructure for Backpage to move its business  overseas, allegedly to help it evade law enforcement  scrutiny in the United States. (Id. ¶ 46.) Overall,  Backpage purchased a new application, requested  support, or renewed a contract with Salesforce on at  least five occasions. (Id. ¶ 48.) Each of those times,  Backpage consulted with Salesforce about how best to  assess and meet its operational needs. (Id.) Using the sophisticated CRM tools, as well as platform  support, provided by Salesforce, Backpage was able to  scale its operations and expand its business. (Id. ¶¶ 39- 42.) The nature of those operations—and Salesforce's  knowledge of them—are at the center of the present  lawsuit. Plaintiffs allege that Backpage was primarily (or  even solely) a sex-trafficking business. As early as  2008, Backpage had [**6]  been publicly identified by  law enforcement and state and federal officials as being  associated with sex trafficking. (Id. ¶ 18.) And over the  next decade, Backpage faced calls to remove its adult  services section by, among others, a group of state  attorneys general. Backpage refused, resisting efforts to  shut down its site on First Amendment grounds. (Id. ¶  21.) Yet, even in the midst of persistent controversy and  allegations regarding sex trafficking on Backpage,  Salesforce continued to provide software and support to  Backpage throughout this period. (Id. ¶ 50.) Eventually, Backpage and its corporate leadership faced  federal criminal charges. (Id. ¶¶ 25-26.) Backpage's  CEO pleaded guilty to charges that he conspired to  facilitate prostitution using a facility in interstate or  foreign commerce and engaged in money laundering,  while the corporation pleaded guilty to conspiring to  engage in money laundering. (Id. ¶¶ 25 n.17, 26 n.18;  see also Plea Agreement, United States v. Ferrer, No.  2:18-cr-00464-DJH (D. Ariz. Apr. 5, 2018); Plea  Agreement, United States v. Backpage, No. 2:18-cr- 00465-DJH (D. Ariz. Apr. 5, 2018.) As part of its plea  agreement with the government, Backpage admitted to  having operated [**7]  as a site for the sale of illegal sex  and to receiving benefits from the sex trafficking of  603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *630; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **2 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *630; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **2 Page 3 of 15 minors. (Id. ¶¶ 26-27.) G.G. was one of those sex-trafficking victims. In 2016,  when she was thirteen years old, G.G. ran away from  home and was soon picked up by her trafficker. (Id. ¶¶  74, 76.) While searching for her daughter, Rose found  an ad featuring G.G. on Backpage's Escort Page. (Id.)  Rose notified Backpage that G.G., a child, was being  advertised for sex on their website and requested that  the ads be taken down. (Id.) Backpage, however, did  not remove the ads and instead merely referred Rose to  the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  (Id.) Although G.G. is no longer under the control of her  trafficker,  she  suffered  significant  physical  and  emotional injuries as a result of her tragic ordeal and still  suffers from the effects of  [*632]  being trafficked at  such a young age. (Id. ¶ 79.) DISCUSSION To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must  contain sufficient factual allegations to ""state a claim to  relief that is plausible on its face."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556  U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868  (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.  544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). In  evaluating a motion to dismiss, the Court accepts as  true all well-pleaded facts and draws all reasonable  inferences from those facts [**8]  in the plaintiff's favor.  Bell v. City of Country Club Hills, 841 F.3d 713, 716 (7th  Cir. 2016). While a complaint need not contain detailed  factual allegations, there ""must be enough to raise a  right to relief above the speculative level."" Twombly, 550  U.S. at 545.""A claim has facial plausibility when the  plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to  draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is  liable for the misconduct alleged."" Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at  678. Federal law provides for both criminal sanctions against  sex traffickers and civil remedies for victims of sex  trafficking. Relevant to this case, 18 U.S.C. § 1591  creates both primary and secondary liability for the sex  trafficking of minors, and 18 U.S.C. § 1595 allows any  victim of such trafficking to sue for damages.  Specifically, § 1595 allows victims of sex trafficking  violations under § 1591 to ""bring a civil action against  the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in violation of  [§ 1591]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Beyond the requirement  that there be an underlying violation of § 1591, a plaintiff  seeking to impose liability under § 1595 must establish  that the defendant (1) knowingly benefited from (2)  participating in a venture that (3) the person knew [**9]   or should have known violated § 1591. See M.A. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959,  969 (S.D. Oh. 2019). Here, Plaintiffs seek to hold Salesforce liable under §  1591 for the trafficking of G.G. by her trafficker as  facilitated by Backpage. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege  that a sex trafficker used ads on Backpage to traffic  G.G., a minor, in violation of § 1591. Plaintiffs further  allege that Backpage facilitated and assisted the use of  its site by sex traffickers such as the one who trafficked  G.G., and that Salesforce, in turn, helped Backpage  expand its business with those sex traffickers.  Salesforce asks this Court to dismiss Plaintiffs'  complaint against it for two reasons: first, Salesforce  contends that Plaintiffs' claims are barred by the  affirmative defense to liability under § 1595 provided by  § 230 of the Communications Decency Act (""CDA""), 47  U.S.C. § 230; and second, Salesforce argues that  Plaintiffs have failed to state an actionable claim under  18 U.S.C. § 1595. As the defense under § 230, if  applicable, is determinative and would warrant dismissal  with prejudice, the Court begins its analysis there. I. Section 230 Section 230 acts as a bar against liability for certain  types of claims against certain defendants—specifically,  it provides that ""[n]o provider or user of an interactive  computer service shall [**10]  be treated as the  publisher or speaker of any information provided by  another information content provider."" 47 U.S.C. §  230(c)(1). Thus, so long as a defendant can establish  that it is (1) a provider or user of an interactive computer  service and (2) the claims against it seek to treat it as a  publisher of a third party's content,  [*633]  § 230 will bar  those claims. See Chi. Lawyers' Comm. for Civ. Rights  Under Law, Inc. v. Craigslist, Inc., 519 F.3d 666, 671  (7th Cir. 2008) (explaining that ""[w]hat § 230(c)(1) says  is that an online information system must not 'be treated  as the publisher or speaker of any information provided  by' someone else"" for purposes of establishing liability).  Specifically in the context of sex trafficking claims,  including under § 1595, courts have found that § 230  precludes liability where the allegations are predicated  on  the  posting  of  user  content—that  is,  the  advertisements trafficking the plaintiffs. See, e.g., M.A.  ex rel. P.K. v. Vill. Voice Media Hldgs, LLC, 809 F.  603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *631; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **7 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *631; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **7 Page 4 of 15 Supp. 2d. 1041, 1052, 1056 (holding that § 230 barred  claims against Backpage because there was ""no  allegation that Backpage was responsible for the  development of any portion of the content of the [sex  trafficker's] posted ads or specifically encouraged the  development of the offensive nature of that content."").  Section 230's protection against such claims, however,  is not absolute—as relevant here, Congress amended §  230 through the Allow States [**11]  and Victims to Fight  Online Sex Trafficking Act (""FOSTA"") to explicitly  exempt certain kinds of sex trafficking claims. FOSTA,  Pub. L. No. 115-164, 132 Stat. 1253 (2018). As a result,  § 230(e)(5)(A) now clarifies that ""nothing in this section .  . . shall be construed to impair or limit any claim in a civil  action brought under [§ 1595], if the conduct underlying  the claim constitutes a violation of [§ 1591]."" Section 230 functions as an affirmative defense. See,  Doe v. GTE Corp., 347 F.3d 655, 657 (7th Cir. 2003);  Bonilla v. Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., No. 20-C- 07390, 574 F. Supp. 3d 582, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  233870, 2021 WL 5795306, at *4 (N.D. Ill. 2021).  Typically, the existence of a potential affirmative  defense does not ""render the claim for relief invalid,""  and ""courts should usually refrain from granting Rule  12(b)(6) motions"" on that basis. Brownmark Films, LLC  v. Comedy Partners, 682 F.3d 687, 690 (7th Cir. 2012).  However, ""[a]n exception applies when the allegations  of the complaint set forth everything necessary to satisfy  the affirmative defense."" Hyson USA, Inc. v. Hyson 2U,  Ltd., 821 F.3d 935, 939 (7th Cir. 2016) (internal  quotation marks omitted). And courts often address the  question of § 230's applicability on a motion to dismiss.  See, e.g., Marshall's Locksmith Serv. Inc. v. Google,  LLC, 925 F.3d 1263, 1267, 441 U.S. App. D.C. 196  (D.C. Cir. 2019) (affirming dismissal of a complaint on §  230 grounds and citing cases in which courts had acted  similarly). As the D.C. Circuit explained in Marshall's  Locksmith Service, Inc., invocation of § 230 immunity in  a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is ""[c]onsistent with Congress'  intent to confer broad immunity for the re-publication of  third-party content."" Id.; see also Nemet Chevrolet, Ltd.  v. Consumeraffairs.com, Inc., 591 F.3d 250, 254 (4th  Cir. 2009) (""Section 230 immunity, like other [**12]   forms of immunity, is generally accorded effect at the  first logical point in the litigation process.""). Still, for a  defendant to raise the defense at the motion to dismiss  stage successfully, ""plaintiff[s] must affirmatively plead  [themselves] out of court."" Hyson USA, 821 F.3d at 939  (internal quotation marks omitted). Salesforce contends  that Plaintiffs here have done just that, arguing that the  allegations of the TAC unambiguously establish that §  230 precludes Plaintiffs' claims against it and that no  exception to § 230's protections apply. A. Salesforce as an Interactive Computer Service First, Salesforce asserts that it qualifies for § 230's  protections because it is a provider of an ""interactive  computer service."" Section 230 defines ""interactive   [*634]  computer service"" as ""any information service,  system, or access software provider that provides or  enables computer access by multiple users to a  computer server, including specifically a service or  system that provides access to the Internet."" 47 U.S.C.  § 230(f)(2). Salesforce argues that it falls under the  definition of ""access software provider,"" which is defined  as ""a provider of software (including client or server  software) or enabling tools which do any one or more of  the following: (a) filter, screen, [**13]  allow, or disallow  content; (b) pick, choose, analyze, or digest content; or  (c) transmit, receive, display, forward, cache, search,  subset, organize, reorganize, or translate content."" 47  U.S.C. § 230(f)(4). Indeed, applying the plain language of the statutory  definition to the allegations in the TAC, Salesforce  plainly qualifies as an ""interactive computer service."" At  oral argument on this motion, Plaintiffs conceded that  Salesforce is a software company, and the complaint  alleges that ""Backpage paid the money that it earned  from trafficking to Salesforce in exchange for the  Salesforce technology and support necessary for  Backpage to operate and expand its business."" (TAC ¶  77.) Looking further into details of the complaint, the  support Salesforce provided Backpage involved the  provision  of  technological  capabilities—specifically,  software that allowed Backpage employees to analyze  and digest customer data as well as applications  providing for the transmission of both internal employee  communications and external customer outreach and  support. Plaintiffs' claims can best be summarized             603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *633; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **10 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *633; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **10 Page 5 of 15 thusly: ""Salesforce provided support to Backpage in the  use of [Salesforce's sophisticated software and related]  technologies [**14]  and had knowledge of the manner  in which Backpage operated with these enhanced  capabilities."" (TAC ¶ 87(b).) Put differently, Salesforce,  through its software, provided multiple users access to a  set of enabling tools that allow those users to analyze,  organize, arrange, transmit, and display content  provided by a third-party (here, Backpage). This  description, which aligns with the statutory definition,  unambiguously establishes that Salesforce is an  ""interactive computer service.""  [*635]  Nonetheless, Plaintiffs argue that Salesforce  has not established that it is an interactive computer  service because it was not involved in the management  of content posted to Backpage. Instead, Plaintiffs  contend,  Salesforce  only  managed  relationships  between Backpage and its customers—most of whom,  Plaintiffs maintain, were sex traffickers. But managing  those relationships did require Salesforce to analyze  content—content provided by Backpage about its  customers. (See, e.g., TAC ¶ 87(f) (alleging [**16]  that  Salesforce ""provid[ed], assist[ed], support[ed], and  facilitat[ed] surveillance and analysis of customer and  user activity with regard to access to ads"").)                                To avoid this result, Plaintiffs ask the Court to read an  additional requirement into the statutory definition of  interactive  service  provider.  Specifically,  Plaintiffs  appear to take the position that § 230 only covers  providers who host publicly accessible platforms.  Salesforce's applications, of course, were only available  internally to Backpage employees. But nothing in either  the statutory text or case law supports this view. It is  true, as Plaintiffs note, that § 230 most commonly has  been applied to bar liability for defendants who host  public platforms. See, e.g., Bennett v. Google, LLC, 882  F.3d 1163, 1167-68, 434 U.S. App. D.C. 311 (D.C. Cir.  2018) (applying § 230 to bar claims against a public  internet search engine); Klayman v. Zuckerberg, 753  F.3d 1354, 1356-58, 410 U.S. App. D.C. 187 (D.C. Cir.  2014) (applying § 230 to bar claims against a social  networking website). But the mere fact that the  defendants that have successfully involved § 230 to  avoid liability have been publicly accessible does not  mean that such accessibility is a statutory requirement.  See, e.g., Fields v. Twitter, Inc., 217 F. Supp. 3d 1116,  1128 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (""[A] number of courts have  applied the CDA to bar claims predicated on a  defendant's transmission of nonpublic messages, and  have done so without [**17]  questioning whether the  CDA applies in such circumstances."" (citing cases)),  aff'd on other grounds, 881 F.3d 739 (9th Cir. 2018)). Zango v. Kaspersky Lab, Inc., 568 F.3d 1169 (9th Cir.  2009), to which both Plaintiffs and Salesforce cite, is  instructive. In Zango, the plaintiff ""propose[d] a gloss on  'interactive computer service' that would construe a  computer service as 'interactive' only if it enables people  to access the Internet or access content found on the  Internet."" Id. at 1175. Based on that construction, the  defendant, which distributed malware software, would  not fall under § 230's definition. Id. at 1172. The Ninth  Circuit, however, ""decline[d] to read the statute so  narrowly,"" explaining that, ""[a]s written, § 230 does not  limit the definition of 'interactive computer service' to  services that provide access to the Internet; rather, its  singular requirement is for 'access by multiple users to a  computer server.'"" Id. at 1175-76 (quoting § 230(f)(2)).  The Court finds this analysis persuasive. After all, if an  interactive computer service is defined as ""including  specifically a service or system that provides access to  the Internet,"" it is not necessarily limited to such  services. 47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(2). And in any event, as  alleged, Salesforce does provide access to its  applications through the Internet. (See TAC ¶ 45 n.20  (citing to ""Sales [**18]  Cloud Pricing"" when describing  the software edition used by Backpage).) 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *634; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **13 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *634; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **13 Page 6 of 15 Still, Plaintiffs insist that because Salesforce was not  involved in managing the content underlying their  claims—the ads posted on Backpage by G.G.'s sex  trafficker—§  230's  protections  cannot  apply  to  Salesforce. According to Plaintiffs' reading, § 230's  references to ""content"" must be understood not as  content generally but rather as the content underlying  the claim against the defendant. Using this logic,  Backpage, as the actual host of the content  [*636]  in  question, would be considered a provider of interactive  computer services, while Salesforce, whose applications  supported Backpage's internal operations, would not.  But the text of § 230 imposes no such requirement—an  interactive computer service must simply permit users to  interact with content, without any reference to what  content. Without a textual basis or supporting case law,  the Court declines to impose unilaterally a requirement  that whether a defendant is an ""interactive computer  service"" under § 230 depends on the nature of the  claims against it. Plaintiffs further assert that, at the very least, it is too  soon to decide the issue of whether Salesforce qualifies  as an interactive [**19]  computer service. Plaintiffs  contend that even if the Court is unable to hold that  Salesforce is not an interactive computer service as a  matter of law, discovery is still necessary to resolve the  question of whether Salesforce in fact is one. But the  allegations of the complaint make clear that Salesforce's  technology allows users (Backpage employees) to  manipulate content in a variety of ways, including by  analyzing  and  organizing  customer  data  and  transmitting messages between Backpage and potential  customers. When questioned during oral argument  about the benefits of allowing limited discovery on this  issue, Plaintiffs suggested that it could provide more  insight into what Salesforce's software was doing. Yet  the Plaintiffs already have provided a thorough overview  of Salesforce's technology in the TAC, suggesting that  they are already well-acquainted with the capabilities of  the software. Similarly, the TAC contains detailed  factual allegations regarding discussions between  Salesforce  and  Backpage  executives,  including  quotations  from  emails  between  Backpage  and  individuals associated with Salesforce. Given the  detailed allegations already contained within the  complaint, as well [**20]  as Plaintiffs inability to specify  how discovery would shift the analysis, the Court finds it  possible to rule on this issue without further inquiry. Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above, the Court  holds that, as a matter of law based on the allegations  of the TAC, Salesforce is an interactive computer  service. B. Salesforce as a Publisher Section 230 does not, however, provide a complete  defense for any type of claim against an interactive  computer service. Craigslist, 519 F.3d at 669-70  (explaining that ""§ 230(c) as a whole cannot be  understood as a general prohibition of civil liability for  web-site operators and other online content hosts,"" and  noting, as an example, that defendants may be liable for  claims like ""contributory infringement if their system is  designed to help people steal music""). But if Salesforce  can be liable only in a capacity as a publisher, then §  230 applies. Id.; see also City of Chi. v. StubHub! Inc.,  624 F.3d 363, 366 (7th Cir. 2010) (finding that a claim  seeking a judgment that a ticket reseller was  responsible for collecting state taxes did not implicate §  230 because the tax in question ""[did] not depend on  who 'publishes' any information or is a 'speaker'"").  Whether a claim treats a defendant as the publisher of  third-party content ""does not depend on the form of  the [**21]  asserted cause of action; rather, it depends  on whether the cause of action necessarily requires that  the defendant be treated as the publisher or speaker of  content provided by another."" Jane Doe No. 1 v.  Backpage.com LLC, 817 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 2016)  (citing cases); see also Cohen v. Facebook, Inc., 252 F.  Supp. 3d 140, 156 (E.D.N.Y. 2017) (explaining that §  230 ""is implicated not only by claims that explicitly point  to third party content but also by claims which, though  artfully pleaded to avoid direct reference,  [*637]   implicitly require recourse to that content to establish  liability or implicate a defendant's role, broadly defined,  in publishing or excluding third party [c]ommunications""). Here, Plaintiffs seek to hold Salesforce liable for harm  caused to G.G. by her trafficking via ads posted on  Backpage. In Salesforce's view, this is a straightforward  example of a claim treating a defendant as a publisher;  after all, Plaintiffs are attempting to hold Salesforce  responsible for the harmful effects of third-party content  posted online. For their part, Plaintiffs argue that  because Salesforce, even if it is an interactive computer  service, did not make any decisions regarding the  editing, monitoring, or publishing of the harmful  advertisements, it is not being treated as a publisher.  Plaintiffs suggest that Salesforce [**22]  should have  monitored Backpage's use of Salesforce's tools and  deleted or restricted access to its software in response  to illegal activity—in other words, that Salesforce acted  as  publisher  regarding  Backpage's  content  on  603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *635; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **18 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *635; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **18 Page 7 of 15 Salesforce's own applications. (See TAC ¶ 47.) And at  least some of Plaintiffs' claims relate to Backpage's use  of Salesforce's CRM software to engage in online  marketing communications with sex traffickers to  expand Backpage's customer base. (See TAC ¶¶ 87(c),  (g), (h), (k).) But those claims would also treat  Salesforce as a publisher, as courts have consistently  found that § 230 bars imposing liability on a provider of  messaging or e-mail services for content and activities  conducted via those services. See Fields, 217 F. Supp.  3d at 1127-29. Plaintiffs' remaining allegations can be summed up  thusly: Backpage, far from acting as a neutral platform  for advertisements, actively sought out sex traffickers.  To do so, Backpage worked with the sex traffickers to  ensure  that  the  advertisements,  including  those  featuring G.G., were ""sanitized"" to hide their illegality.  And Salesforce, even though it was aware that  Backpage's business model was based on sex  trafficking, provided tools and support for those  tools [**23]  to help Backpage expand its customer  base. But while Plaintiffs, perhaps recognizing that the  claims at their core rest upon the publication of an  advertisement,  repeatedly  emphasize  Salesforce's  actions in their briefing, the TAC itself does not suggest  that Salesforce ever took any actions regarding the  harmful advertisements or the sex traffickers. (See TAC  ¶ 40 (""Salesforce provided personalized support for the  technological tools and instruments that made it  possible for Backpage to engage in the internet based  on-line selling of sex, sex trafficking, and compelled  prostitution."") (emphasis added).) Put simply, Plaintiffs  seek to hold Salesforce liable for the fact that Backpage  used Salesforce software to cultivate sex traffickers as  customers and grow the website's reach among sex  traffickers, ultimately resulting in the posting of the  advertisement featuring G.G. This is a quintessential  claim covered by § 230: it seeks to impose liability on an  interactive computer service for third-party content that  was published on an online platform. The Court's finding does not, as Plaintiffs suggest,  abandon the statutory language of § 230 by asking not  whether the claims treat Salesforce [**24]  as the         ""publisher or speaker"" of third-party content but whether  the third-party content is a ""necessary part"" of the facts.  Plaintiffs rely on Doe v.  [*638]  Internet Brands for the  proposition that ""the CDA does not provide a general  immunity against all claims derived from third-party  content."" 824 F.3d 846, 853 (9th Cir. 2016). But Internet  Brands itself makes clear that applying § 230 to  Plaintiffs' claims does not contradict this principle. In  Internet Brands, the defendant was the operator of a  networking website for models. Id. at 848. Somehow,  through an outside source, the defendant became  aware of two men that were using the site to prey on  women. Id. at 849. The plaintiff, one of the women  victimized by those men, sued the website owner for  failing to warn users about the presence of predators on  its site and the risk of being victimized. Id. In finding that  § 230 did not apply to preclude liability, the Ninth Circuit  emphasized that, while the publishing of the plaintiff's  data on the networking website was a but-for cause of  her injuries, in many ways ""publishing activity is a but-for  cause of just about everything"" with which the defendant  website was involved. Id. at 853. Because the plaintiff's  claims were not for any content posted on the  website, [**25]  but rather for a failure to warn in which  the duty breached did not require the defendant to take  any action with regards to third-party content posted on  its site, the claims did not treat the defendant as a  publisher or speaker of such content. Id. at 851. But here, Plaintiffs seek to hold Salesforce liable for the  fact that G.G. was trafficked via advertisements placed  on Backpage by her trafficker. Although Plaintiffs try to  frame their claims in terms of Salesforce's actions  (namely, helping Backpage expand the site on which  G.G.'s  trafficker  would  eventually  place  the  advertisements trafficking G.G.), Plaintiffs do not  contend that they would have a claim against Salesforce  regardless of what was posted to Backpage. See Doe v.  Salesforce.com, No. A159566 at 13-14, 2021 Cal. App.  Unpub. LEXIS 8211 (Cal. Ct. App. Dec. 30, 2021) (not  designated for publication) (holding that plaintiffs,  alleging they ""were injured by online advertising, placed  on Backpage by pimps and traffickers, that caused them  to enter sex trafficking and be sexually exploited,""  brought claims that ""seek to treat Salesforce as the  publisher of ads created by a third party"" and are barred  by § 230). Nor can Plaintiffs point to any distinct duty  that [**26]  Salesforce owed to Plaintiffs untethered from  the third-party content. Compare Lemmon v. Snap, Inc.,  995 F.3d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir. 2021) (explaining that  claims for negligent product-design against a mobile  app developer sought to ""hold [the defendant] liable for  its role in violating its distinct duty to design a  603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *637; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **22 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *637; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **22 Page 8 of 15 reasonably safe product."") In effect, Salesforce could  not satisfy its ""alleged obligation"" to Plaintiffs without  altering either the content generated by Backpage by  monitoring the use of its software and forbidding its use  in certain ways, or by insisting that Backpage only  hosted certain content on its own site. In other words,  Plaintiffs claims are predicated on the notion that  Salesforce should be held responsible for the existence  of third-party content, her advertisements—that is, they  treat Salesforce as a publisher. Plaintiffs protest what they deem an ""overbroad""  interpretation of § 230. But as the Seventh Circuit has  recognized, ""Section 230(c)(1) is general,"" and ""a law's  scope often differs from its genesis."" Craigslist, 519 F.3d  at 671-72 (applying § 230 to bar claims brought against  an online service provider for allegedly violating the Fair  Housing Act by posting discriminatory notices). And  other courts have applied § 230 to bar claims similar to  those here, including claims directly against [**27]   Backpage for sex trafficking on the basis that  Backpage's  decisions  about  various  posting  requirements were done with  [*639]  the express  purpose of facilitating sex trafficking. See Jane Doe  No. 1, 817 F.3d at 20-22 (holding that, although the  plaintiffs tried to argue that § 230 did not apply ""by  claiming Backpage's decisions about what measures to  implement deliberately attempt to make sex trafficking  easier, this is a distinction without a difference"" and  finding that the claims ""necessarily treat[ed] the website  as a publisher or speaker of content provided by third  parties, and, thus, are precluded by section 230(c)(1)""). In fact, it is the very breadth of § 230's coverage that  motivated Congress to pass FOSTA for the express  purpose of preserving claims such as these by  exempting them from the protections of § 230. See  FOSTA, Pub. L. No. 115-164, 132 Stat. 1253, 1253  (2018) (explaining that ""clarification"" of § 230 was  ""warranted to ensure"" that § 230 did not provide  protection to websites that unlawfully promote and  facilitate sex traffickers). That Congress felt the need to  amend § 230 to include express exemptions for certain  sex trafficking claims suggests that such claims would  otherwise be covered by § 230. Put simply, courts have  coalesced around an understanding of § 230 that  ""grant[s] sweeping protection."" Malwarebytes, Inc. v.             Enigma Software Grp. USA, LLC, 141 S. Ct. 13, 15, 208  L. Ed. 2d 197 (2020) (statement [**28]  of Thomas, J.,  respecting the denial of certiorari). It may be, as  Plaintiffs argue, that their claims against Salesforce fall  under this exemption. But, to be exempt, a claim must  first be otherwise covered by the statute. And, for the  reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs' claims do fall under  § 230's coverage. C. FOSTA Amendments In 2018, Congress amended § 230 through FOSTA,  adding three exemptions for sex trafficking claims,  including one exempting ""any claim in a civil action  brought under section 1595 of title 18, if the conduct  underlying the claim constitutes a violation of section  1591 of that title."" 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)(A). Here, the  parties dispute the scope of this exemption—namely,  whether the provision exempts a ""claim in a civil action  brought under"" § 1595 only to the extent that ""the  conduct underlying the claim"" (i.e., the conduct of the  defendant in the civil action) constitutes a violation of §  1591 (i.e., the criminal statute), or, as Plaintiffs propose,  ""the conduct underlying the claim"" refers simply to the  criminal conduct of the venture in which a defendant is  participating and from which they are benefiting. In other  words, must Plaintiffs show that Salesforce's  [*640]   own actions violated § 1591, or is it enough that  someone (here, [**29]  Backpage or G.G.'s trafficker)  committed the § 1591 violation underlying the claim?  Resolving  this  issue  is  a  matter  of  statutory                       603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *638; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **26 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *638; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **26 Page 9 of 15 interpretation, and courts have reached different  conclusions. Compare Doe v. Kik Interactive, Inc., 482  F. Supp. 3d 1242, 1249 (S.D. Fla. 2020) (holding that  ""[t]he plain language of the statute removes immunity  only for conduct that violates 18 U.S.C. § 1591"") with  Doe v. Twitter, Inc., 555 F. Supp. 3d 889, 920-22 (N.D.  Cal. 2021) (holding that FOSTA created an exemption  for any claim brought under § 1595 so long as it  involved a claim predicated on civil sex trafficking  under § 1591, regardless of whether the civil defendant  themselves committed that violation). For the reasons  discussed below, the Court agrees with those which find  that, by the plain language of the statute, § 230(e)(5)(A)  exempts claims brought under § 1595 only in  circumstances in which the defendant's conduct  constitutes a violation of § 1591. The Court first turns to the text of the FOSTA  exemption. Section 230(e)(5)(A) exempts ""any claim in  a civil action brought under section 1595 of Title 18, if  the conduct underlying the claim constitutes a  violation of section 1591 of that title."" (emphasis  added).  Applying  the  ""normal  rule  of  statutory  construction that identical words used in different parts  of the same act are intended to have the same  meaning,"" the Court finds that the ""claim in a civil action""  and the ""claim"" [**30]  which the conduct must underlie  are the same. Commissioner v. Lundy, 516 U.S. 235,  250, 116 S. Ct. 647, 133 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1996) (internal  quotation marks omitted); see also Univ. of Chi. v.  United States, 547 F.3d 773, 782 (7th Cir. 2008)  (explaining that the ""sensible approach"" is to read  identical terms in a statute as having the same  meaning). Indeed, here the words are used not just  within the same act, but within the same sentence.  Thus, the ""most straightforward reading"" of this  provision requires an exemption only ""if the civil  defendant's conduct amounts to a violation of section  1591."" J.B. v. G6 Hospitality, LLC, No. 19-cv-07848- HSG, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213, 2021 WL  4079207, at *6; see also Doe v. Reddit, Inc., No. 8:21- cv-00768, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 235993, 2021 WL  5860904, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 7, 2021). This reading is further confirmed by reading the  exemption in conjunction with the two other exemptions  within § 230(e)(5). ""The plainness or ambiguity of  statutory language is determined"" not just ""by reference  to the language itself,"" but also by reference to ""the  specific context in which that language is used.""  Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 342, 117 S. Ct.  843, 136 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1997). Here, § 230(e)(5)  contains two additional provisions stating that § 230  shall not apply to ""any charge in a criminal prosecution  brought under State law if the conduct underlying the  charge would constitute a violation of"" either § 1591 or  18 U.S.C. § 2421A. 47 U.S.C § 230(e)(5)(B)-(C). ""In the  context of a criminal charge, the underlying conduct  necessarily refers to the conduct of the criminal  defendant""—that is, the named defendant, not someone  else  must  have  committed [**31]   the  conduct  underlying the charge. J.B., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  151213, 2021 WL 4079207, at *6. Although civil claims  and criminal  [*641]  charges have obvious differences,  the Court agrees with the J.B. court that the fact ""that  Congress included nearly identical language in the  same subsection, at the same time, strongly suggests  that it intended to give the 'conduct underlying' phrases  the same meaning."" Id. (citing Powerex Corp. v. Reliant  Energy Servs., Inc., 551 U.S. 224, 232, 127 S. Ct. 2411,  168 L. Ed. 2d 112 (2007) (explaining that the ""maxim""  that ""identical words and phrases within the same  statute should normally be given the same meaning"" is  ""doubly appropriate"" where the phrase in question is  inserted into two provisions ""at the same time"")). Put                                603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *640; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **29 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *640; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **29 Page 10 of 15 simply, even assuming that a statute is ""remedial,"" the  Court must first turn to the text of the statute. See  Walton v. United Consumers Club, Inc., 786 F.2d 303,  310 (7th Cir. 1986) (""Courts should confine their  attention to the purposes Congress sought to achieve  by the words it used.""). And here, the text, both by its  plain terms and statutory structure, is clear that the  FOSTA exemption applies only where the civil  defendant's actions violated § 1591. This conclusion does not, as Plaintiffs contend,  ""eviscerate"" the civil negligence standard in § 1595. To  begin, § 230 only applies in limited circumstances— when the defendant is an interactive computer service  and the claims [**32]  seek to treat the defendant as a  publisher of third-party content. This interpretation of the  exemption has no impact on claims that do not meet  those criteria, such as claims commonly brought by  plaintiffs against hotels who rent rooms to sex  traffickers. Moreover, Plaintiffs' position misunderstands  the interaction between § 230 and the FOSTA  Amendments. Before the FOSTA Amendments, any  claim  against  a  defendant  that  met  §  230's  requirements, including those for sex trafficking under  § 1595, would be completely barred. Under the Court's  reading of the plain language of the statute, the FOSTA  exemptions created a limited exemption to that  otherwise broad protection for certain kinds of (but not  all) § 1595 claims. It is true that the outcome here  results in a situation in which ""a sex trafficking victim  who seeks to impose civil liability on an ICS [interactive  computer service] provider on the basis of beneficiary  liability faces a higher burden than a victim of sex  trafficking who seeks to impose such liability on other  types of defendants."" Twitter, 555 F. Supp. 3d at 920.  But § 230 inherently places higher burdens on plaintiffs  seeking to impose liability on interactive computer  services providers by barring certain types of claims  altogether. [**33]                [*642]  Looking to the legislative history confirms that  the FOSTA exemption was not meant to encompass  fully every possible claim under § 1595. The original  version of the bill that became FOSTA would have  provided that § 230 ""shall not be construed to impair the  enforcement or limit the application of (A) section 1595  of title 18, United States Code."" H.R. 1865, 115th Cong.  § 3(a)(5) (as introduced in the House, Apr. 3, 2017).  Under this language, any violation of § 1595 would be  enough to exempt the claim from § 230—exactly the  interpretation Plaintiffs now propose for the enacted  version. But, as discussed in depth by the J.B. court,  during legislative hearings on the bill, several witnesses  raised concerns that § 1595's ""knew or should have  known"" language was too expansive and risked  encouraging  litigation  against  law-abiding  intermediaries. J.B., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213,  2021 WL 4079207 at *7-11 (providing a thorough  analysis of the various drafts and revisions of the  FOSTA  amendment  to  §  230,  including  contemporaneous  comments  from  stakeholders  expressing apprehension about § 1595's knowledge  standard being imported into § 230 given challenges in  showing a website's knowledge). In response, Congress  added the limiting language requiring that the ""conduct  underlying the claim"" be a violation of § 1591. 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 151213, [WL] at *11. Thus, the final bill  reflected [**34]  a ""compromise by including a narrowed  federal civil sex trafficking carve-out that requires  plaintiffs to show the civil defendant's knowing  assistance, support, or facilitation"" of sex trafficking.  Id.. Accordingly, to state a claim that is exempted from §  230's coverage, Plaintiffs must allege Salesforce  engaged in conduct that would violate § 1591. Plaintiffs  do not dispute that they are unable to do so. Section  1591 creates two types of offenses: a primary liability  offense under § 1591(a)(1) and a secondary liability  offense under § 1591(a)(2). As to primary liability under  § 1591(a)(1), there is no allegation that Salesforce  ""recruit[ed],  entice[d],  harbor[ed],  transport[ed],  provide[d],  obtain[ed],  advertise[d],  maintain[ed],  patronize[d], or solicit[ed]"" any person while knowing (or  in reckless disregard of the fact) that the person ""will be  caused to engage in a commercial sex act"" and is either  under the age of 18 or is subject to force, coercion or  threats. Instead, the complaint makes clear that G.G.'s  trafficker engaged in these trafficking violations. 18  U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1). As to secondary liability, §    603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *641; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **31 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *641; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **31 Page 11 of 15 1591(a)(2) criminalizes ""benefit[ing], financially or by  receiving anything of value, from participation in a  venture which has engaged in a violation of"" §  1591(a)(1). For [**35]  purposes of § 1591(a)(2),  ""participation in a venture"" is defined as ""knowingly  assisting, supporting, or facilitating a violation of  subsection (a)(1)."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(4). Accordingly,  a secondary actor under § 1591(a)(2) must actively and  knowingly assist or facilitate a primary trafficking  violation, which is tied to a specific victim. But Plaintiffs  have not alleged that Salesforce knew of G.G.'s  circumstances or in any way assisted, supported, or  facilitated the primary trafficking violation. Accordingly,  the Court finds (and the parties do not dispute) that  Plaintiffs  [*643]  have not pleaded that Salesforce itself  violated § 1591. Thus, because a claim brought under § 1595 must  allege conduct of the defendant that would violate §  1591, and Plaintiffs have failed to allege that Salesforce  committed any criminal sex trafficking violation, the  FOSTA exemption does not apply. Accordingly, § 230  precludes Plaintiffs' claims against Salesforce. II. Failure to State a Claim Even if their claim were not barred by § 230, Plaintiffs'  claim could not proceed as currently pleaded because  they have failed to state a claim. As noted above, in  addition to the requirement of an underlying violation of  § 1591, there are three elements to a § 1595 claim: the  plaintiff must allege that the defendant [**36]  (1)  knowingly benefited from (2) participating in a venture  that (3) the person knew or should have known violated  § 1591. See M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.,  425 F. Supp. 3d 959, 969 (S.D. Oh. 2019). The Court  addresses each element in turn. A. Knowingly Benefit The Court first considers what it means to ""knowingly  benefit"" from a violation of § 1591. The law as to the  knowledge element for a § 1595 violation is currently  unsettled, with the parties here unsurprising urging the  Court to adopt the standard most in their favor     ""Knowledge"" means simply to have ""[a]n awareness or  understanding of a fact or circumstance; a state of mind  in which a person has no substantial doubt about the  existence of a fact."" Knowledge, Black's Law Dictionary  (11th ed. 2019). So, pursuant to § 1595, a defendant  must have an awareness or understanding that it was  receiving some benefit, be it financial or some other  form of value, from participating in the venture.  Salesforce suggests that the Court should read  ""benefited"" in conjunction with the phrase ""from  participation in a venture"" to require that any benefit  derived must be the specific result of that venture. In  other words, any benefit received by Salesforce would  have to, essentially, be a form of ""profits"" from  Backpage's sex trafficking venture. [**37]  The cases  to  which  Salesforce  cites  in  support  of  this  interpretation, however, do not go so far as to require  that the ""benefits"" be ""profits."" Instead, those cases  simply stand for the proposition that there must be some  ""causal  relationship  between  the  [defendant's]  participation in sex trafficking and their purported  benefit."" Geiss v. Weinstein Co. Hldgs. LLC, 383 F.  Supp. 3d 156, 169 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (""The controlling  question, however, is whether [the sex trafficker]  provided any of those benefits to [the defendant]  because of [the defendant's] facilitation of [the sex  trafficking].""). This Court thus understands § 1595 to  require a plaintiff to plead only that the defendant knew  that it was receiving benefits (financial or otherwise)  because of its participation in a venture that violated §  1591. See B.M. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., No.  20-cv-00656-BLF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020  WL 4368214, at *4 (N.D. Cal. July 30, 2020) (finding  that the rental of a room (or a franchisor's receipt of  royalties for that rental) ""constitutes a financial benefit  from a relationship with the trafficker sufficient to meet  this element""). B. Participate in a Venture The Court next considers what it means to ""participate  in a venture."" There is no current consensus among  courts to have  [*644]  considered the issue as to  whether the second element incorporates the definition  of ""participation in a venture"" from the [**38]  criminal  provisions in § 1591. See A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide  Hldgs, Inc., 484 F. Supp. 3d 921, 937 (D. Or. 2020)  (collecting cases). Under § 1591(e)(4), ""the term  'participation in a venture' means knowingly assisting,  supporting, or facilitating a violation of subsection  (a)(1)."" Courts importing § 1591's definition have stated  that the ""participation giving rise to the benefit must be  603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *642; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **34 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *642; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **34 Page 12 of 15 participation  in  a  sex-trafficking  venture,  not  participation in other activities."" Geiss, 383 F. Supp. 3d  at 169 (citing to United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App'x  272, 286 (6th Cir. 2016)). In other words, ""some  participation in the sex trafficking act itself must be  shown."" Noble v. Weinstein, 335 F. Supp. 3d 504, 524  (S.D.N.Y. 2018). But § 1591 states that these definitions  apply ""[i]n this section,"" not throughout the entire  statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e). And, as courts that have  declined to take this approach have explained, reading  ""participate in a venture"" to require ""knowingly assisting,  supporting, or facilitating"" would render other statutory  language in § 1595 nonsensical. See Doe #1 v. Red  Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 724 (11th Cir. 2021). This  is because applying the criminal definition, which  requires participation to be knowing, would essentially  void the ""should have known"" language contained in the  civil remedy. A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 455 F. Supp. 3d  171, 186 (E.D. Pa. 2020); Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at  724 (""In other words, the [defendants'] formulation  requires a plaintiff to prove that the defendant knowingly  facilitated a violation, making the 'should have known'  language superfluous."") This Court interprets ""participation"" as the [**39]   majority of courts do and finds that ""actual 'participation  in the sex trafficking itself' is not required to state a  claim under section 1595."" S.Y. v. Naples Hotel Co.,  476 F. Supp. 3d 1251, 1256 (M.D. Fl. 2020). Thus,  ""liability under § 1595 can attach when an individual  participates in a venture that is not specifically a sex  trafficking venture and participation is not direct  participation in the sex trafficking."" M.A., 425 F. Supp.  3d at 970 (finding that the plaintiff alleged sufficient facts  to show participation in a venture under § 1595 by  ""alleging that [the defendants] rented rooms to people it  knew or should have known where [sic] engaged in sex  trafficking""). Put another way, the venture need only be  one that violated sex trafficking law and the defendant  need not directly participate in that violation. Still, ""the  ordinary understanding of culpable assistance to a  wrongdoer [] requires a desire to promote the wrongful  venture's success."" GTE, 347 F.3d at658. And the term  ""participation"" itself requires more than just passive  facilitation, but some level of active engagement. See  Participation, Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019)  (""The act of taking part in something""); Participate,  Oxford  English  Dictionary  Online,  https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/138244?rskey=JNFUD z&result=2&isAdvanced=false#eid (last [**40]  visited  May 5, 2022) (""To take part; to have a part or share with  a person""). Thus, in cases where there is no alleged ""direct  association"" between the beneficiary and the trafficker,  courts have ""required 'a showing of a continuous  business relationship between the trafficker and the  [defendant] such that it would appear that the trafficker  and the [defendant] have established a pattern of  conduct or could be said to have a tacit agreement'"" as  to the venture which the defendant knew, or should  have known, involved sex trafficking. J.B. v. G6  Hospitality, LLC, No. 19-cv-07848-HSG, 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 151213, 2020 WL 4901196, *9 (N.D. Cal. Aug.  20, 2020) (quoting M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 970). For  example, courts have  [*645]  found that such a  business relationship existed between a defendant hotel  and a sex trafficker where the defendants themselves  rented rooms to those they knew, or should have  known, were engaged in sex trafficking. See, e.g.,  H.H. v. G6 Hospitality, LLC, No. 2:19-CV-755, 2019  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *5 (S.D.  Oh. Dec. 6, 2019). But a plaintiff must ""connect the  dots"" between their trafficking and the specific  defendant. In cases involving hotel franchisors, for  instance, claims that branded hotels rented rooms to  people they knew or should have known were engaged  in sex trafficking may be ""sufficient to state a plausible  claim against the specific hotels where [the plaintiff] was  trafficked, [but] they do not make a [**41]  plausible  claim that [the franchisors] directly participated in a  venture that trafficked [the plaintiff]."" B.M., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *5; see also  Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 726-27 (finding that  defendant hotel franchisors who owned, supervised,  and controlled the renting of rooms, as well as ""read  online reviews mentioning prostitution and crime  occurring generally at the hotels, and controlled the  training of managers and employees who were allegedly  involved in facilitating sex trafficking at the hotels,""  merely ""financially benefited"" from the renting of hotel  rooms to sex traffickers, not that they ""participated in an  alleged common undertaking or enterprise with the  [plaintiffs'] sex traffickers or others at the hotel who  violated the statute""). C. Knowledge that the Venture Violated § 1951 Lastly, the Court turns to the third element, which  requires a defendant to have ""known or should have  known"" the venture violated § 1591. Put another way, it  requires a defendant to have actual or constructive  knowledge that the venture violated § 1591. Red Roof  Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Courts interpreting § 1595  regularly describe the ""knew or should have known""  603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *644; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **38 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *644; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **38 Page 13 of 15 language as establishing a negligence standard. See id.  (defining constructive knowledge as ""knowledge which  'one using reasonable care or [**42]  diligence should  have'"" (quoting Constructive Knowledge, Black's Law  Dictionary (11th ed. 2019))); see also S.W. v. Lorain- Elyria Motel, Inc., No. 2:19-CV-1194, 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192, at *5 (S.D. Ohio Mar.  16, 2020) (""[T]he plain text of § 1595(a) makes clear  that the standard under this section is a negligence  standard of constructive knowledge.""). Although it is clear that § 1595 allows for either actual or  constructive knowledge, however, courts have reached  different conclusions on whether a defendant must  ""satisf[y] the knowledge element as to a particular sex  trafficking venture."" S.J. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, 473 F.  Supp. 3d 147, 154 (E.D.N.Y. 2020). In other words, is it  enough that the defendant knew or should have known  that the venture has violated § 1591 by engaging in sex  trafficking generally? Or must the defendant have  known or should have known that the venture is  engaged in a violation of § 1591 as to the specific  plaintiff? For purposes of this case, the Court must  decide whether Plaintiffs can successfully plead a claim  under § 1595 by alleging that Salesforce knew or should  have  known  that  Backpage  was  violating  sex  trafficking laws, or if Plaintiffs must allege that  Salesforce knew or should have known that G.G. in  particular was being trafficked using the site. The Court  concludes it is the latter. Section 1595 requires that [**43]  the venture engage in  an act in violation of § 1591, which requires knowledge  as to a specific victim. See 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1)  (criminalizing knowingly recruiting, enticing, harboring,  transporting,  providing,  obtaining,  advertising,  maintaining, patronizing, or soliciting by any means a  person) (emphasis added); 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2)   [*646]  (criminalizing benefiting from participation in a  venture that has violated § 1591(a)(1) where the  defendant knows that ""means of force, threats of force,  fraud, coercion . . . or any combination of such means  will be used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not attained  the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage in a  commercial sex act"") (emphasis added). And ""[t]he  statutory text speaks in singular terms—'participation in  a venture which that person . . . should have known has  engaged in an act in violation of this chapter.'"" S.J., 473  F. Supp. 3d at 154 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a)  (emphasis in original)). Accordingly, a claim under §  1595 requires that ""the defendant must have either  actual or constructive knowledge that the venture—in  which it voluntarily participated and from which it  knowingly benefited—violated [§ 1591] as to the  plaintiff."" Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th at 726  (emphasis added). Plaintiffs  suggest  that  this  interpretation  improperly [**44]  imports the knowledge requirements  of § 1591 into § 1595. But Plaintiffs confuse the  knowledge requirement for what it means to ""participate  in a venture"" with the knowledge requirement as to the  nature of the venture itself. Thus, while a plaintiff need  not allege that a defendant ""knowingly assisted"" a  venture engaged in a violation of § 1591 to ""participate""  in that venture, the plaintiff does need to allege that the  defendant knew (or should have known) about the  specific sex trafficking venture—that is, the venture  tied to the underlying § 1591 violation of the plaintiff.  See B.M., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL  4368214, at *5 (dismissing a complaint for being ""devoid  of any facts linking these Defendants . . . to the sex  trafficking of this Plaintiff"" (emphasis added)). A.B.,  which Plaintiffs cite as holding that § 1595 does not  require a defendant to have knowledge of the specific  victim, provides a useful illustration. There, in finding  that the plaintiffs adequately pleaded a § 1595 claim,  the court emphasized that, had the complaint only  contained general allegations as to the problem of sex  trafficking, efforts to combat that issue, and incidents  involving other victims and other hotels, it ""may [have]  agree[d]"" with the defendant that the allegations were  insufficient. [**45]  455 F. Supp. 3d at 193. However,  the A.B. court noted that the plaintiff had alleged facts  that did establish defendant's knowledge of her own  trafficking—among  other  allegations,  that  the  traffickers had used defendant's hotels, multiple men an  evening entered the hotels creating a ""voluminous and  obvious constant stream of male visitors"" to her rooms,  her trafficker ""repeatedly"" paid for rooms at the hotels in  advance and with prepaid cards, and staff at the hotels  observed the plaintiff with visible signs of injury multiple  times. Id at 193-94. This approach is consistent with the majority view of the  courts to have considered such cases. See, e.g., S.Y.,  476 F. Supp. 3d at 1257 (holding that defendant hotels  knew or should have known of the venture that sex  trafficked the plaintiffs the complaint alleged that the  traffickers requested rooms by exit doors, paid in cash,  excessive condoms were present in the rooms, hotel  staff observed the plaintiffs be escorted by traffickers  into the hotels, hotel staff heard plaintiffs' screams, the  sex trafficking ventures operated out of the same hotel  room for days in succession, and multiple men came  603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *645; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **41 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *645; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **41 Page 14 of 15 and went from plaintiffs' rooms without luggage or  personal possessions); M.L. v. Craigslist Inc., No. C19- 6153 BHS-TLF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166836, 2020  WL 6434845, at *6 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 17, 2020) (denying  a motion to dismiss by [**46]  the defendant website  where ""the complaint alleges that [the defendant  website] not only knew that human trafficking was  occurring on  [*647]  its website, but that [the defendant  website] was part of an active conspiracy with plaintiff's  traffickers to traffic plaintiff,"" and denying a similar  motion to dismiss by the defendant hotel where the  complaint alleged that hotel staff contacted the plaintiff  to request that she be more discrete with her activities  and that police had spoken with the hotel regarding the  plaintiff being a minor (emphasis added)); compare  Lundstrom v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., No. 21-cv-00619- PAB-SKC, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 228651, 2021 WL  5579117, at *8-9 (D. Colo. Nov. 30, 2021) (finding that  allegations that a defendant hotel franchisor was ""on  notice about the prevalence of sex trafficking generally  at its hotels and in the hotel industry"" was ""not sufficient  to show that the defendant should have known about  what happened to [the] plaintiff"" and thus could not  sustain § 1595 claim). In short, to bring a claim for liability under § 1595, a  plaintiff must plausibly allege that a defendant (1)  knowingly benefited, either financially or otherwise, from  (2) participation in a venture, although such participation  need not necessarily be direct participation in the sex  trafficking, and that (3) the person knew or should  have [**47]  known violated § 1591 as to the plaintiff. D. Application to Plaintiffs' Claims Against  Salesforce With this understanding of the elements for a beneficiary  claim under § 1595 in mind, the Court now considers  whether Plaintiffs have stated such a claim against  Salesforce  and  concludes  that  they  have  not.  Specifically, Plaintiffs have failed to allege plausibly that  Salesforce knew, or should have known, about G.G.'s  specific trafficking or any of the advertisements  trafficking her on Backpage. Compare Twitter, 555 F.  Supp. 3d at 925 (finding that plaintiffs adequately  pleaded a § 1595 claim where they alleged that the  defendant website was alerted to the existence of  videos involving the plaintiffs and provided evidence that  the plaintiffs were underage in response to a request for  more information). Plaintiffs do not contend that they  have pleaded such knowledge, instead relying on their  argument that § 1595 does not require that Salesforce  have any knowledge or involvement as to G.G's specific  trafficking. But, as has already been discussed, this  Court disagrees with that approach and finds that §  1595 requires a defendant to have participated in a  venture that the defendant knew or should have known  was involved in sex trafficking of the plaintiff, [**48]   not sex trafficking more generally. Thus, because  Plaintiffs have not alleged that Salesforce had actual or  constructive knowledge of G.G.'s trafficking, they have  not adequately pleaded that element of a § 1595 claim. Plaintiffs also have not adequately alleged that  Salesforce ""participated"" in the venture with Backpage  that trafficked G.G. Considering the TAC as a whole,  Plaintiffs allege that Backpage used Salesforce's CRM  software to cultivate and expand a customer base of  sex traffickers, including G.G.'s trafficker. At times, the  TAC appears to suggest that Salesforce itself took  actions to assist Backpage's efforts. (See TAC ¶ 41  (""Salesforce was the driving force that enabled  Backpage to scale its operations and increase the  trafficking conducted on Backpage."").) But the factual  allegations directly underlying these claims make it clear  that  Salesforce  provided  the  technology  (and  corresponding technological support) that Backpage  utilized to grow its own business. (See Id. (""By providing  technology, implementation skills, and ongoing support  that all constitute affirmative acts by Salesforce that  encouraged the wrongdoing in which Backpage.com  was engaged."").) In other words,  [*648]  while [**49]   Salesforce may have provided the tools that Backpage  used to build a business based on sex trafficking,  Salesforce did not take part in the construction of the  business itself. Allegations concerning Salesforce's role in marketing  Backpage to sex traffickers illustrate how the actions  Plaintiffs allege Salesforce took to assist and support  Backpage in its sex trafficking venture are, in actuality,  actions that Backpage took using Salesforce's CRM  software. The TAC describes Salesforce's CRM  technology as providing companies ""access to a  coordinated set of applications tailored to its business  model, including applications that . . . manage all  marketing functions."" (Id. ¶ 31.) Plaintiffs then allege  that Salesforce ""facilitat[ed] and provid[ed] support for  direct marketing campaigns for Backpage to expand  Backpage's sex trafficking venture."" (TAC ¶ 87(c).) But  even in this allegation, Plaintiffs acknowledge that it is  Backpage, not Salesforce, that actually expanded the  operations through marketing activities. (See also Pls.'  Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss at 25, Dkt. No. 66 (""Among  other things, Salesforce facilitated trafficking through  603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *646; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **45 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, *646; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, **45 Page 15 of 15 Backpage by assisting Backpage in its marketing  efforts [**50]  that allowed Backpage to solicit sex  traffickers and their victims."") The mere fact that  Salesforce's  software  played  a  critical  role  in  Backpage's expansion, indeed, even if such expansion  would not be possible without the capabilities provided  by that software, is not enough to demonstrate  Salesforce's own participation in any venture with  Backpage. See United States v. Papagno, 639 F.3d  1093, 1098, 395 U.S. App. D.C. 82 (D.C. Cir. 2011)  (explaining the difference between ""assistance"" and  ""participation,"" noting that insurers who cover operations  do not participate in that operation, fans who cheer the  home team may help the team win but do not participate  in the game, and engineers who design soldiers'  weapons may support the war effort but do not  participate in the war). Thus, to the extent Plaintiffs'  claims rest on any actions taken by Backpage using  Salesforce's software, they have not adequately alleged  Salesforce ""participated"" in any venture. Plaintiffs contend that they have plausibly alleged that  Salesforce did not just sell Backpage off-the-shelf  software  but  instead  also  offered  Backpage  ""personalized support."" Yet, although the complaint  contains multiple mentions of Salesforce providing  Backpage  with  ""personalized  services  tailored  specifically to the [**51]  needs of its illegal business,""  Plaintiffs provide no examples of these services, or  description, or even suggestion, of how Salesforce  altered its software to better facilitate sex trafficking.  (TAC ¶ 46.) For instance, Plaintiffs emphasize that  Salesforce provided technical support in moving some  of Backpage's operations overseas—ostensibly to help  Backpage avoid U.S. law enforcement. But even  assuming that Backpage's fear of criminal liability  motivated its desire to have a duplicate copy of its  system, the TAC contains no facts indicating that  Salesforce was aware of this motivation, nor do  Plaintiffs explain how, given that the complaint alleges  that G.G. was trafficked on backpage.com (and not any  overseas website), this duplicate copy relates to their  claims. Similarly, Plaintiffs point to the allegation that an in- house Salesforce executive recommended that, based  on Backpage's needs (which Plaintiffs assume to be  related to sex trafficking and prostitution), Backpage  use Salesforce's Enterprise CRM edition. Plaintiffs  emphasize that the Enterprise CRM edition is described  as ""fully customizable,"" suggesting that this means that  Salesforce then took action to tailor the software [**52]   to better meet Backpage's needs (which, Plaintiffs  allege, were solely related to sex trafficking). Yet the   [*649]  mere fact that the Enterprise CRM edition is  customizable (that is, capable of being customized)  does not, without more, support a reasonable inference  that Salesforce actually customized the software to  meet Backpage's needs. In sum, Plaintiffs have failed to  allege facts supporting that Salesforce ""took part in""  Backpage's sex-trafficking venture. Thus, for the reasons stated above, the Court finds that  Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim against Salesforce  for beneficiary liability under § 1595. If this were the only  basis for dismissal, the Court would consider dismissal  without prejudice to allow Plaintiffs one final opportunity  to amend their complaint to state a viable claim. But as  discussed above, the allegations of the TAC establish  that Salesforce is entitled to dismissal based on the  affirmative defense in § 230 of the Communications  Decency Act as well. Accordingly, the dismissal is with  prejudice.",1
"G.G. v. Salesforce.Com, Inc., 76 F.4th 544","[*548]  H, Circuit Judge. In the Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization  Act  of  2003,  Congress gave victims of sex trafficking the power to  bring civil actions to recover damages from those who  trafficked them. 18 U.S.C. § 1595 (2003). In 2008,  Congress broadened that civil remedy to allow what we  will call participant liability. The amendment allows  victims  to  recover  damages  not  only  from  a  trafficker [**2]  who committed a federal crime but also  from a person who ""knowingly benefits ... from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act"" of sex  trafficking. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) (2008). Plaintiffs G.G. and her mother Deanna Rose brought  this suit under Section 1595 alleging participant liability  against defendant Salesforce.com, Inc. G.G. ran away  from home at the age of thirteen. She fell into the hands  of a sex trafficker who used the now defunct  Backpage.com to advertise G.G. Plaintiffs' theory here  is that (a) Backpage.com committed criminal sex- trafficking violations with respect to G.G., among many  other victims; (b) defendant Salesforce at least should  have known that Backpage.com was engaged in sex  trafficking of minors like G.G.; and (c) Salesforce had  such a close business relationship with Backpage— Page 2 of 17 providing advice and custom-tailored software for years  to help Backpage grow its business—that Salesforce, in  the language of Section 1595, knowingly benefited from  its participation in what it knew or should have known  was Backpage's sex-trafficking venture. The district court dismissed the case on the pleadings,  but we conclude that plaintiffs' complaint states a viable  claim under Section 1595 [**3] . More specifically, we  reject defendant's arguments: (1) that a ""venture"" must  be primarily a sex-trafficking venture; (2) that a  participant must have had constructive knowledge of the  specific victim of sex trafficking, the civil plaintiff; (3) that  ""participation in a venture"" requires direct participation in  a ""common undertaking or enterprise involving risk and  potential profit""; and (4) that to knowingly benefit  requires that the sex trafficker provide the participant  with a benefit because of the participant's facilitation of a  sex-trafficking venture and that the participant must  have known that this was the reason for the benefit. All  of these defense theories seek to impose restrictions on  the civil remedy that are not consistent with the statute  as we understand its language. We also find that  Salesforce is not entitled to dismissal under Section 230  of the Communications Decency Act, 47 U.S.C. § 230.  We reverse the judgment of the district court and  remand for further proceedings. I. Factual Background & Procedural History Defendant Salesforce.com moved to dismiss this case  on the pleadings, so we  [*549]  focus on the facts  alleged in plaintiffs' third amended, and operative,  complaint. This opinion says harsh things about  Salesforce contributing to sex-trafficking, including  trafficking of minors. Because of Salesforce's tactical  choice to move to dismiss, we treat the allegations as  true, though we do not vouch for their objective truth at  this point in the case. See, e.g., Goldberg v. United  States, 881 F.3d 529, 531 (7th Cir. 2018). In 2016, when she was just thirteen years old, plaintiff  G.G. ran away from home. She was picked up by a sex  trafficker who advertised her on Backpage.com, an  online marketplace, and repeatedly sold her into  prostitution. G.G.'s mother searched for her daughter.  Eventually, in the summer of 2016, her mother found  photos of G.G.—in Backpage's online ads for escorts.  Backpage referred her mother to the National Center for  Missing and Exploited Children but did not take down  the advertisement. The trafficking [**4]  and advertising of G.G. on  Backpage was not an isolated or even an unusual  incident. When Backpage was created in 2004, it initially  served as a marketplace for a variety of goods and  services. By 2008, however, plaintiffs allege, Backpage  ""had been publicly identified by law enforcement, United  States Attorneys General, and every state Governor as  the biggest and most notorious sex trafficking and  pimping website in the United States."" Backpage's sextrafficking was not limited to adults.  During the three years prior to G.G.'s trafficking,  Backpage generated more than 99% of its revenue from  ""adult advertisements,"" including those offering minors  for sex. In 2010, the National Association of Attorneys  General publicly described Backpage as a ""hub"" of  human trafficking, ""especially the trafficking of minors.""  In October 2016, just a few months after her mother  found the advertisement for G.G. on Backpage,  California authorities arrested and charged the chief  executive officer of Backpage, Carl Ferrer, for pimping  minors. In April 2018, Ferrer and Backpage entered into  plea agreements with the United States Department of  Justice in which they admitted that Backpage had  operated as a site [**5]  for the sale of sex since 2004.  A few days later, in response to a felony charge and on  the advice of counsel, Backpage confessed in a Texas  court that it ""knowingly receive[d] a benefit from  participating in a venture that involved the trafficking ...  of a child younger than 18 years of age, and ... [had]  caused [the child] to engage in or become the victim of  conduct prohibited by"" Texas Penal Code Section 43.05  (""Compelling  Prostitution"").  The  United  States  Department of Justice seized Backpage and shut it  down. According to plaintiffs, Salesforce ""entered into the first  of several lucrative contracts with Backpage"" back in  2013, years after the nature of Backpage's business  was widely known, and about three years before G.G.  was trafficked. The contracts with Salesforce were  designed  to  ""facilitate  and  support""  Backpage's  ""exponential growth"" and to give Backpage ""the ability to  keep pace with increasing customer demand and scale  its platform into an international sex-trafficking hub."" Salesforce did not merely sell Backpage an off-the-shelf  software package. It instead sold Backpage software  designed specifically for Backpage and provided  affirmative, ""personalized support."" With  [*550]  those            Page 3 of 17 products  and  support, [**6]   Salesforce  helped  Backpage operate its business, manage relationships  with existing customers, market itself to new customers,  and improve profitability. ""Salesforce sold Backpage  targeted  solutions  addressed  to  the  needs  of  Backpage's business"" and provided ""active, ongoing  support"" that was ""tailored"" to Backpage's needs. Toward that end, at least five times between November  2013 and April 2017, Salesforce consulted with  Backpage, including its CEO, to learn about the  business and ""to assess its operational needs."" With  Salesforce's help in the form of new software, marketing  technology, and personalized operational support,  Backpage was able to ""collect detailed, in-depth  customer data and use the data to streamline  communications and overall business practices."" When  Backpage faced imminent seizure by the United States  government and wanted to ""establish and maintain a  duplicate copy of the Backpage operations system and  platform"" so that it could ""move and operate its business  overseas,""  Salesforce  ""facilitated  this  system  reorganization and provided the technical infrastructure""  to do so. In short, plaintiffs allege, the business relationship  between  Backpage  and  Salesforce  was [**7]   successful. It enabled Backpage ""to scale its operations  and increase the trafficking conducted"" through its site.  With Salesforce's help, Backpage grew ""to become the  dominant force in online sex trafficking."" Backpage  experienced  ""unprecedented  growth""  in  both  its  business and profits and was transformed from a ""small  ... company with a handful of employees to an  international powerhouse with over 250 employees  spanning three continents."" From the beginning of 2008  through the end of 2010, Backpage's gross revenues  totaled $46 million. In 2012 alone, Backpage's gross  revenue was $71 million. And from January 2013  through May 2015, Backpage's gross revenue climbed  to approximately $346 million, nearly $340 million of  which was generated from adult advertising. As  Backpage's business expanded and its profits grew,  ""the scope of work covered by the Salesforce contracts,""          as well as Salesforce's profits from those contracts, also  grew.  Salesforce  stopped  doing  business  with  Backpage only when it was shut down by the federal  government in April 2018. Two years later, in April 2020, G.G. and her mother filed  this lawsuit in federal court seeking to hold [**8]   Salesforce liable under Section 1595, as well as state  common law theories, for the trafficking of G.G. In  October 2021, plaintiffs filed their third amended  complaint,  correcting  for  various  deficiencies,  abandoning the state-law claims, and adding Backpage  as a defendant. In short order, Salesforce moved to  dismiss plaintiffs' complaint for failure to state a claim. After  plaintiffs  voluntarily  dismissed  defendant  Backpage in February 2022, the district court granted  Salesforce's motion to dismiss. G.G. v. Salesforce.com,  Inc., 603 F. Supp. 3d 626, 630 (N.D. Ill. 2022). The  district court reasoned first that plaintiffs had pled  themselves out of court by alleging facts that showed  Salesforce was entitled to the protection of 47 U.S.C. §  230. Id. at 633, 637, 639. Alternatively, the district court  found that plaintiffs had failed  [*551]  to allege a  plausible claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1595. Id. at 643.  Plaintiffs moved to alter or amend the judgment under  Rule 59(e), and the district court denied the motion.  Plaintiffs then appealed. II. Analysis A. Legal Standard We review de novo both a district court's legal  conclusions and its dismissal of a complaint for failure to  state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). Wirth v. RLJ Dental,  S.C., 59 F.4th 270, 272 (7th Cir. 2023) (legal  conclusions); Proft v. Raoul, 944 F.3d 686, 690 (7th Cir.  2019) (dismissal). We treat the complaint's factual  allegations as true and draw factual inferences in the  plaintiffs' favor. Boogaard v. Nat'l Hockey League, 891  F.3d 289, 290-91 (7th Cir. 2018). A complaint [**9]   needs to present only ""a short and plain statement"" of  the basis for a claim. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). To avoid  dismissal, the factual allegations in the complaint need  not prove the claim. They need to show only that the  claim is ""plausible on its face"" and that if the allegations  are true, the plaintiff is entitled to relief. Roldan v.  Stroud, 52 F.4th 335, 339 (7th Cir. 2022), quoting Bell  Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct.  1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). This pleading standard  is not demanding, asking that plaintiffs allege ""only  enough facts"" to ""nudge[ ] their claims across the line  from conceivable to plausible."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at  Page 4 of 17 570. To be plausible rather than merely conceivable means  that the complaint's ""factual content ... allows the court  to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is  liable for the misconduct alleged."" Firestone Financial  Corp. v. Meyer, 796 F.3d 822, 826 (7th Cir. 2015),  quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct.  1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). The factual allegations  must present ""more than a sheer possibility"" that the  defendant's conduct is unlawful, Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678,  but a complaint should survive a motion to dismiss  ""even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those  facts is improbable, and that a recovery is very remote  and unlikely."" Alam v. Miller Brewing Co., 709 F.3d 662,  666 (7th Cir. 2013), quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556. We explain next in Part B how plaintiffs have alleged a  viable claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1595, addressing  defendant Salesforce's counterarguments as we go. We  then turn in Part C to Salesforce's attempt to  establish [**10]  a defense under 47 U.S.C. § 230. B. Plausibly Alleging a Claim Under 18 U.S.C. § 1595 Plaintiffs seek relief under Section 1595(a), which  creates a civil cause of action for victims of Section  1591 of Title 18: ""An individual who is a victim of a  violation of this chapter may bring a civil action ... ."" We  first ask whether plaintiffs have alleged that G.G. is the  victim of a criminal violation of Section 1591, which has  the title ""Sex trafficking of children or by force, fraud, or  coercion."" At the time of G.G.'s trafficking, Section  1591(a) provided in relevant part: (a) Whoever knowingly— (1) in or affecting  interstate or foreign commerce ... recruits, entices,  harbors, transports, provides, obtains, advertises,  maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any  [*552]   means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by  receiving anything of value, from participation in a  venture which has engaged in an act described in  violation of paragraph (1), knowing, or, except  where the act constituting the violation of paragraph  (1) is advertising, in reckless disregard of the fact,  that means of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion  described in subsection (e)(2), or any combination  of such means will be used to cause the person to       engage in a commercial sex act, or that the person  has not attained the age of 18 years and will  be [**11]  caused to engage in a commercial sex  act, shall be punished as provided in subsection  (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) (2015). To prove a criminal violation of Section 1591, the  government must prove that the defendant, with the  requisite state of mind, either (1) engaged in one of the  listed acts of sex trafficking or (2) benefitted from  participating in a venture that engaged in one of those  acts. Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that G.G. was a victim  of violations of Section 1591. Obviously, there is G.G.'s  street-level trafficker, who plaintiffs allege ""used a  combination of force, fraud, coercion, enticement,  alcohol and drugs to cause"" G.G., who was a minor, to  ""engage"" repeatedly ""in commercial sex."" On these  allegations, G.G.'s street-level trafficker could be  criminally liable under Section 1591(a)(1): ""Whoever  knowingly ... recruits, entices, harbors, transports,  provides, obtains, [or] advertises ... a person ...,  knowing ... that means of force, threats of force, fraud,  coercion ..., or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a commercial  sex act."" Plaintiffs also allege that Backpage violated Section  1591 by advertising G.G. for sale both before and after  learning that she was under the age of 18. On such  allegations, Backpage could be [**12]  subject to  criminal liability under both Section 1591(a)(1) and  (a)(2). By ""knowingly ... advertis[ing]"" G.G., ""knowing, or  ... in reckless disregard of the fact ... that [G.G. had] not  attained the age of 18 years and [would] be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act,"" Backpage violated  Section 1591(a)(1). And by ""knowingly ... benefit[ing] ...  from participation in"" the street-level trafficker's ""venture  which [was] engaged in"" acts that violated Section  1591(a)(1), ""knowing, or ... in reckless disregard of the  fact ... that [G.G. had] not attained the age of 18 years  and [would] be caused to engage in a commercial sex  act,"" Backpage violated Section 1591(a)(2). According to these allegations, then, G.G. was a victim  of multiple violations of both Sections 1591(a)(1) and  1591(a)(2) at the hands of both her street-level trafficker  and Backpage, so G.G. is a proper plaintiff under  Section 1595. The statute's remaining elements  determine whether Salesforce is a proper defendant. Section 1595 creates two kinds of civil liability:  Page 5 of 17 perpetrator liability and participant liability. First, since it  was first enacted, the statute has allowed the victim to  sue ""the perpetrator."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Under a  theory of perpetrator liability, G.G. could have sued  either her street-level trafficker or Backpage, but neither  is a defendant in [**13]  this action. Second, since the  2008 amendment, the statute has allowed the victim to  sue ""whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by  receiving anything of value from participation in a  venture which that person knew or should have known  has engaged in an act in violation of this chapter,"" which  includes Section 1591. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Plaintiffs  here seek to hold Salesforce  [*553]  liable as such a  participant. Under a theory of participant liability, a plaintiff like G.G.  who is a victim of a criminal violation must allege and  ultimately prove that (1) a venture has engaged in an  act in violation of Section 1591, (2) the defendant knew  or should have known that the venture had violated  Section 1591, (3) the defendant participated in that  venture, and (4) the defendant knowingly benefited from  its participation.                              1. A Venture Which Has Engaged in an Act in Violation  of Section 1591 The first element is the existence of ""a venture which ...  has engaged in an act in violation"" of Section 1591. 18  U.S.C. § 1595(a). That Backpage committed multiple  violations of Section 1591 is not in question. As  discussed, Backpage violated Sections 1591(a)(1) and  (a)(2) when it advertised G.G. for sale after learning that  she was a minor and financially benefited from  participation in her street-level trafficking. Salesforce argues that plaintiffs [**14]  have failed to  allege that it participated in a venture that has violated  Section 1591. Appellee's Br. at 53-65. That argument  challenges two distinct elements, as we understand the  statute, which we have labeled as element (1), the  existence of a venture that violated Section 1591, and  element (3), the defendant's participation in the venture. Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the existence of a  venture that violated Section 1591. The text of Section  1595 does  [*554]  not say ""sex-trafficking venture,"" but  only ""venture."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). In other words,  ""venture"" is not described in criminal terms. Indeed, it  would make little sense if it did. The language that  follows, ""which ... has engaged in an act in violation of  this chapter,"" does that work, requiring the venture's  criminality. While Section 1595 does not define the term ""venture,""  Section 1591's definition cuts against construing a                       Page 6 of 17 ""venture"" narrowly as limited to a venture that is  primarily a sex-trafficking venture. Section 1591 defines  ""venture"" as ""any group of two or more individuals  associated in fact, whether or not a legal entity."" 18  U.S.C. § 1591(e)(5). While we decline to import Section  1591's definition into Section 1595, we think it safe to  assume that Congress did not intend ""venture"" in  Section 1595, which establishes civil liability, to be any  more demanding than ""venture"" [**15]  in Section 1591,  which establishes criminal liability. See Peyton v. Rowe,  391 U.S. 54, 65, 88 S. Ct. 1549, 20 L. Ed. 2d 426 (1968)  (applying ""canon of construction that remedial statutes  should be liberally construed""). Because Congress did  not define a ""venture"" under Section 1591 as  necessarily or primarily involving criminal conduct, we  will not impose such a requirement under Section 1595. In short, we agree with the district court that the relevant  ""venture"" under Section 1595 need not be ""specifically a  sex trafficking venture."" G.G., 603 F. Supp. 3d at 644,  quoting M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F.  Supp. 3d 959, 970 (S.D. Ohio 2019). Rather, as the  Eleventh Circuit has acknowledged, the alleged venture  can be a ""commercial venture[]"" like running or  expanding a business. See Doe #1 v. Red Roof Inns,  Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 727 (11th Cir. 2021) (emphasis  added). While a ""venture"" can certainly run the gamut  from an isolated act of sex trafficking to an international  sex-trafficking enterprise, it can also be a business  whose primary focus is not on sex trafficking.                       Plaintiffs have alleged such a venture here. ""By 2013,""  plaintiffs allege, ""Backpage found itself in need of a  partner who could facilitate and support [Backpage's]  exponential growth."" The ""venture"" was Backpage's  business itself, including the ""growth,"" ""expansion,"" and  profitability of that business.  [*555]  2. Salesforce's Constructive Knowledge That  the Venture Had Engaged in an Act in Violation  of [**16]  Section 1591 The next question is whether plaintiffs have plausibly  alleged that Salesforce knew or should have known that  Backpage's venture had engaged in acts in violation of  Section 1591. Section 1595 provides for participant  liability where the defendant ""knew or should have  known"" that the ""venture ... has engaged in an act in  violation"" of Section 1591. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a).                                    Page 7 of 17 Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that Salesforce at least  should have known that Backpage had repeatedly  violated Section 1591 before Salesforce started working  with Backpage and that Backpage was continuing to  violate Section 1591 during their multi-year relationship. According to the allegations in the complaint, by 2008— five years before Salesforce entered into its first contract  with  Backpage—""law  enforcement,  United  States  Attorneys General, and every state Governor"" had  ""publicly identified"" Backpage ""as the biggest and most  notorious sex trafficking and pimping website in the  United States."" In 2010, 21 state attorneys general  called on Backpage ""to shut down its adult services  section."" After a First Circuit decision in March 2016,  Jane Doe No. 1 v. Backpage.com, LLC, 817 F.3d 12  (1st Cir. 2016), afforded Backpage protection under  Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the  Senate investigated Backpage. H.R. Rep. No. 115-572,  pt. 1, at 3-5 (Feb. 20, 2018). Nationwide news coverage  identified [**17]  Backpage as ""the leading platform for  the facilitation of sex trafficking and other forms of  human  degradation.""  Salesforce's  hometown  newspaper, the San Francisco Chronicle, published no  fewer than 400 prominent news articles about Backpage  between 2009 and 2017, including several in 2012  linking Backpage to child sex-trafficking. A 2013 article  revealed that the FBI was monitoring Backpage after  rescuing  more  than  100  children  from  forced  prostitution. These facts about its customer should have  been known to Salesforce. Apart from this public information, plaintiffs are entitled  to a reasonable inference at this stage of the case that,  based on Salesforce's relationship with Backpage,  Salesforce either ""knew or should have known"" that at  least a substantial part of Backpage's business was  illegal sextrafficking, including trafficking of children.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) allows plaintiffs to  plead knowledge ""generally."" Plaintiffs have more than  met their burden under this standard, alleging facts  tending to show with greater specificity than is required  at this stage that  [*556]  Salesforce at least should  have known the nature of Backpage's business. At least  constructive knowledge may be reasonably inferred  from [**18]  the allegations that Salesforce repeatedly  consulted with Backpage ""to assess its operational  needs,"" designed ""targeted solutions addressed to""  those needs, and provided active, ""tailored,"" and  ongoing support as Backpage worked to expand its  business and scale its operations. As the district court  wrote, part of Salesforce's support for Backpage  ""require[d] Salesforce to analyze content ... provided by  Backpage about its customers."" G.G., 603 F. Supp. 3d  at 635 (emphasis removed). While it might be possible  that Salesforce's penny did not actually drop during its  dealings with Backpage, plaintiffs are entitled to an  inference that Salesforce at least should have known  that Backpage was engaged in criminal sextrafficking on  a substantial scale. Plaintiffs' allegations satisfy Section  1595's constructive-knowledge requirement. Salesforce disagrees, arguing that, under ""the plain text""  of Sections 1591 and 1595, a participant defendant  must have had constructive knowledge of the specific  victim of sex-trafficking, the plaintiff suing under Section  1595. Salesforce argues that even if it knew or should  have known that the venture had violated Section 1591  with respect to other victims, it is off the civil hook  unless plaintiffs can allege and later prove that it  should [**19]  have known about the trafficking of G.G.  in particular. Salesforce draws this conclusion from  Section 1595's use of the phrases ""a venture"" and ""an  act."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) (2008) (""[W]hoever knowingly  benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value  from participation in a venture which that person knew  or should have known has engaged in an act in violation  of this chapter."") (emphasis added). We are not persuaded that ""a venture"" and ""an act""  mean ""the victim."" First, as explained above, ""a venture""  need not be primarily a sex-trafficking venture, so it  need not be, as Salesforce suggests, ""a particular"" sex- trafficking venture. Even if it were, it would take an  additional inferential leap to conclude that Section 1595  requires knowledge of a particular victim of that  particular venture. As for ""an act,"" Salesforce's reading is contrary to the  statutory text and overlooks differences between the two  sections. If Congress had meant in Section 1595 that  the participant must have had actual or constructive  knowledge of the specific victim, it could have simply  said so. It did not. Facing statutory text that does not  say what it prefers, Salesforce asks us to make two  interpretive moves to reach that result. First, Salesforce  asks us to [**20]  read ""an act"" of sextrafficking as ""the  act"" of victimization that allowed the plaintiff to bring suit  under Section 1595. Salesforce then asks us to assume  that knowledge of the act means knowledge of the  specific victim. This goes two bridges too far. We see no  reason to rewrite the statutory text by substituting ""the""  for ""an."" Even if we were willing to take that first step, we  would still see no reason to require knowledge of a  particular act to require knowledge of the victim's  identity. Salesforce is arguing, in effect, that the larger  Page 8 of 17 the sex-trafficking venture and the more extensive its  participation in the venture—and so the less likely it is to  have known the specifics of individual victim—the  harder it should be for a victim to obtain civil relief. The cases Salesforce cites to support its argument—all  hotel sex-trafficking cases—simply do not support  requiring knowledge of the specific victim. In S.J. v.  Choice Hotels International, Inc., 473 F. Supp. 3d 147  (E.D.N.Y. 2020), for example, the court found meaning  in ""a venture"" and  [*557]  ""an act"" as used in Section  1595, but not the meaning Salesforce tries to extract.  Rather, the court relied on these phrases to point out  that even ""knowledge or willful blindness of a general  sex  trafficking  problem  in  low-budget  lodgings""  could [**21]  not plausibly show ""knowledge of a specific  sex trafficking venture"" at the hotels the defendant had  franchised. Id. at 154. As the court correctly observed,  to allow allegations that a civil defendant was aware of  sporadic sex trafficking in low-budget hotels generally to  show constructive knowledge of a particular sex  trafficking venture ""unjustifiably bridges the scienter gap  between 'should have known' and 'might have been able  to guess.'"" Id. In other words, the civil defendant needed  to have constructive knowledge of a non-generalized  and non-sporadic—a ""particular""—venture, but the court  did not go so far as to require knowledge of a particular  victim. Id. Other cases on which Salesforce relies are not  persuasive here because they involved the trafficking of  only one victim. In such cases, knowledge of the  specific victim goes hand-in-glove with knowledge of the  ""venture."" E.g., Lundstrom, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  228651, 2021 WL 5579117, at *1-2, *6-8; B.M., 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *5-6.  Because the ventures and the victims were one and the  same, these cases do not stand for the proposition that  a civil defendant who participated in a venture engaged  in sex trafficking on a substantial scale must have had  constructive knowledge of the specific victim.           If such specificity were required, Section 1595  would [**22]  be severely undermined in some of the  most egregious cases. A company like Salesforce could  simply bury its head in the sand with respect to  individual victims. It could work, for example, only with  high-level data on behalf of a venture that the company  knows or should know is engaged in illegal sex  trafficking on a large scale. By way of analogy, a taxi  service transporting trafficking victims on behalf of  traffickers could claim that it lacked constructive  knowledge where it knew that it was generally  transporting trafficking victims so long as the drivers  were shielded from seeing who specifically was in the  back of their taxis. Or consider a prostitution ring that  hires a construction company to build a better brothel,  one that attracts more customers and is better insulated  from the prying eyes of law enforcement. The contractor  knows that the business is generally engaged in sex  trafficking, but so long as the contractor does not know  of any individual victim, it would be insulated from civil  liability. In other words, the larger the sex-trafficking  venture, the less likely a victim would be able to prove  sufficient knowledge. Nothing in the statutory text  requires such an odd [**23]  result.  [*558]  In short, we agree with the majority of courts  that have addressed Section 1595's constructive- knowledge requirement that the statutory text does not  require allegations and ultimately proof that the  defendant knew or should have known of the specific                         Page 9 of 17 victim who has brought the civil action. To state a claim  under Section 1595, a plaintiff needs to allege plausibly  that the defendant had constructive knowledge that a  venture generally has violated Section 1591. Knowledge  of the specific victim, let alone knowledge of her identity,  cf. post at 45, is not required. Plaintiffs here have  therefore sufficiently alleged constructive knowledge  under Section 1595. 3. Participation The next question is whether plaintiffs have sufficiently  alleged  that  Salesforce,  with  that  constructive  knowledge, participated in Backpage's venture. They  have. Congress has not defined ""participation"" under Section  1595. Section 1591 defines ""participation in a venture""  as ""knowingly assisting, supporting, or facilitating a  violation"" of Section 1591(a)(1). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(4)  (April 2018, December 2018). We agree with the  Eleventh Circuit that we should not import that definition  into Section 1595. See Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at  724. Still, Section 1591's definition  [*559]  can                                     establish the upper limits of ""participation"" under Section  1595.  As  with  ""venture,""  we  should  ""liberally""  construe [**24]  ""participation"" so that the civil remedy  does not demand more of the plaintiff than a criminal  prosecution demands of the government. See Peyton,  391 U.S. at 65. ""Participating"" does not therefore require  more than ""assisting, supporting, or facilitating"" a  venture that violates Section 1591. 18 U.S.C. §  1591(e)(4) (April 2018, December 2018). Mindful of that ceiling, we agree with the district court  that ""participation"" does not require ""direct participation  in the sex trafficking."" G.G., 603 F. Supp. 3d at 644,  quoting M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 970. While direct                                          Page 10 of 17 involvement in sex trafficking itself (e.g., transporting  victims, providing hotel rooms) would satisfy Section  1595's ""participation"" element, direct involvement goes  beyond what the statutory text requires. Since the  ""venture"" in question need not be primarily a sex- trafficking venture and the civil defendant itself need not  have committed a criminal violation of Section 1591,  ""participation in"" that venture need not involve direct  participation in the sex trafficking itself. It is the venture  that must violate Section 1591, and not the participant. We read ""participation"" in accord with our ""ordinary  understanding of culpable assistance to a wrongdoer,""  which requires only ""a desire to promote the wrongful  venture's success,"" Doe v. GTE Corp., 347 F.3d 655,  659 (7th Cir. 2003), though Section 1595 does not  require actual [**25]  knowledge of criminal wrongdoing.  We agree with the district court that a plaintiff may  sufficiently allege such ""culpable assistance"" by  showing ""a continuous business relationship"" between  the participant and the trafficker. G.G., 603 F. Supp. 3d  at 644, quoting J.B., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213,  2020 WL 4901196, at *9. Where the participant provides  assistance, support, or facilitation to the trafficker  through such a ""continuous business relationship,"" a  court or jury may infer that the participant and trafficker  have a ""tacit agreement"" that is sufficient for  ""participation"" under Section 1595. See M.A., 425 F.  Supp. 3d at 970-71; accord, Ricchio v. McLean, 853  F.3d 553, 555 (1st Cir. 2017) (Souter, J.) (concluding  that ""participation"" can be inferred, in part, where  trafficker and civil defendants—the owners of a hotel the  trafficker used for his venture—had  [*560]  prior similar  dealings). To survive a motion to dismiss, all that is  necessary is for a plaintiff to allege such a ""continuous  business relationship,"" which gives rise to an inference,                  drawn in the plaintiff's favor, that the civil defendant  facilitated the venture's success. Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged here such a ""continuous  business relationship."" According to the allegations,  Backpage was trying ""to keep pace with increasing  customer demand and scale its platform,"" so it sought  out ""a partner [**26]  who could facilitate and support  the company's exponential growth."" According to  plaintiffs, Backpage found that partner in Salesforce,  which ""entered into the first of several lucrative contracts  with Backpage"" in 2013. Through those contracts,  Salesforce provided Backpage with ""targeted solutions  addressed to the needs of Backpage's business,""  repeatedly assessed Backpage's ""operational needs,""  and provided ""active, ongoing support"" that was  ""tailored"" to those needs. With that support, Backpage was able to build  relationships with more street-level traffickers, to  increase the ""scale [of] its operations,"" and to ""increase  the trafficking conducted"" through its site. During the                                            Page 11 of 17 course of their business relationship, which continued  until Backpage was seized by the Department of  Justice, Backpage was transformed from a ""small ...  company with a handful of employees to an international  powerhouse with over 250 employees spanning three  continents."" In the first three years, Backpage's gross  revenues grew by a factor of five. And as Backpage  expanded, so did the scope of Salesforce's support and  its income from the contracts. In short, Salesforce  facilitated the growth of Backpage's business, [**27]  a  business that was almost exclusively a sex-trafficking  business and that had engaged in multiple acts in  violation of Section 1591, nay, whose business model  was built upon systematic  [*561]  and widespread  violations of Section 1591. Salesforce argues that ""participation"" requires more,  that plaintiffs have alleged only that Salesforce was  ""somehow connected"" to Backpage's sex-trafficking  enterprise. R. 26, Appellee's Br. at 53. The argument is  not persuasive. First, Salesforce argues that plaintiffs  have failed to ""connect Salesforce or its software"" to  ""G.G.'s trafficking or her trafficker."" Put differently,  Salesforce tries to narrow the focus of the ""participation""  inquiry to Backpage's advertisements of G.G. herself,  asserting that Salesforce had no specific involvement  with those advertisements. That focus is simply too  narrow. As a matter of law, such a direct connection  between Salesforce and G.G.'s trafficking is not  necessary.  Under  Section  1595,  we  focus  on  participation in a ""venture,"" not participation in ""an act in  violation"" of Section 1591. 18 U.S.C. § 1595. In other  words, participant liability does not require direct  participation in sex trafficking. By Salesforce's logic, there would be no ""participation""  where a company helped a drug [**28]  kingpin expand  his drug-trafficking operations writ large because the  company might not have been involved in pushing drugs  in a particular market. Or, for that matter, where a  company helped a terrorist organization grow its terrorist  network because the company could not be connected  directly to a specific terrorist act. The statutory text does  not support such narrowing interpretations. Contrary to  Salesforce's arguments, ""participation"" does not require  getting your hands dirty. It is enough that plaintiffs allege  that Salesforce facilitated the success of Backpage's  sex-trafficking venture as a whole. Furthermore, Salesforce's argument fails to engage with  plaintiffs' actual allegations. Salesforce seems to  assume that G.G. had only one trafficker—the street- level  trafficker  who  physically  forced  her  into  prostitution. But that person was not G.G.'s sole sex  trafficker under Section 1591. According to the  allegations in plaintiffs' complaint, Backpage was also a  sex trafficker. Contrary to Salesforce's assumptions,  therefore, Salesforce was not one step removed from  G.G.'s traffickers. It was in a direct, prolonged, and  supportive contractual relationship with one of those sex  traffickers—Backpage. [**29]  Because of these differences, Salesforce's reliance on  the Eleventh Circuit's decision in Doe #1 v. Red Roof  Inns, Inc. is misplaced. In Red Roof Inns, the Eleventh  Circuit defined ""participation in a venture"" as taking ""part  in a common undertaking or enterprise involving risk  and potential profit."" 21 F.4th at 725. The court then  analyzed claims against hotel franchisors to see if they  had taken ""part in the common undertaking of sex  trafficking with hotel employees, management, owners,  and sex traffickers."" Id. at 726. The plaintiffs had alleged  that ""the franchisors 'owned, managed, supervised,  operated, oversaw, controlled the operation of, and/or  were inextricably connected to the renting of rooms' at  the hotels."" Id. They also alleged that the franchisors  had ""investigated the individual hotels, [taken] remedial  action when revenue was down, read online reviews  mentioning prostitution and crime occurring generally at  the hotels, and controlled the training of managers and  employees who were allegedly involved in facilitating  sex trafficking at the hotels."" Id. at 727. On these allegations, the Eleventh Circuit concluded  that plaintiffs had failed to allege that the franchisors  had participated in a ""common undertaking [**30]  or  enterprise with the Does' sex traffickers or others at the  hotel who violated"" Section 1591. Id. Key to the court's  reasoning was how the plaintiffs had chosen to define  the alleged  [*562]  venture—specifically as a ""sex  trafficking"" venture. The court wrote that, if the plaintiffs  had alleged ""that the franchisors participated in  commercial ventures to operate hotels and that those  hotel ventures violated"" Section 1591, the result might  have been different. Id. (emphasis added). The court  rejected this framing, however, because the plaintiffs  had not alleged it in their complaint or presented it to the  district court. But here, plaintiffs have framed the venture in just those  terms. They allege that Salesforce ""participated in  commercial ventures"" with Backpage to grow its  business and that Backpage ""violated the statute."" See  Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 727. Not only that, but the  relationships in play here are distinct from those in play  in Red Roof Inns. The franchisor defendants in that  Page 12 of 17 case were one step removed from the sex traffickers  (i.e., street-level trafficker — > hotel — > hotel  franchisor). Here Salesforce had a direct and long-term  contractual relationship with sex-trafficker Backpage. So  even if we applied the Red Roof Inns [**31]  definition of  ""participation in a venture"" to the allegations here,  plaintiffs would have plausibly alleged that element. See  id. at 729 (Jordan, J., concurring) (""[S]imilar claims  against ... [the] franchisees ... would withstand a Rule  12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.""). That is, Salesforce ""took  part in"" the expansion and success of Backpage—""a  common undertaking or enterprise involving risk and  potential profit."" See id. at 725. In a similar vein, Salesforce argues that it merely  provided Backpage with its software and Backpage did  the rest. This argument also invites us to disregard  plaintiffs'  actual  allegations.  We  assume  that  ""participation"" requires more than providing off-the-shelf  software (or other common products or services from  furniture to telephones or pizza deliveries). But the  allegations here do not paint Salesforce as an arms- length seller of off-the-shelf products. Plaintiffs allege  that Salesforce ""did not merely sell [Backpage] an off- the-shelf product that enabled Backpage to grow without  the input of Salesforce."" ""Rather, Salesforce sold  Backpage targeted solutions addressed to the needs of  Backpage's business,"" repeatedly assessed Backpage's  ""operational needs,"" and provided ""active, ongoing  support"" that was ""tailored"" to those needs. These allegations defeat Salesforce's reliance on Doe v.  GTE Corp., 347 F.3d 655 (7th Cir. 2003), and  Backpage.com, LLC v. Dart, 807 F.3d 229 (7th Cir.  2015). In GTE Corp., plaintiffs had been secretly  recorded on video while they were undressed in ""locker  rooms, bathrooms, and showers."" 347 F.3d at 656.  Plaintiffs sued the company that had provided [**32]   web-hosting services for websites that had offered the  videos for sale. Id. at 656-57. We affirmed dismissal on  the pleadings, concluding that the alleged activities of  the web-hosting services did not amount to ""culpable  assistance"" to those websites or the sellers of the  videos because a ""web host, like a delivery service or  phone company, is an intermediary and normally is  indifferent to the content of what it transmits."" Id. at 659. In Backpage.com, LLC, the Sheriff of Cook County had  pressured credit card companies to stop processing     transactions on Backpage. 807 F.3d at 230. Ordering an  injunction against the Sheriff for violating Backpage's  First Amendment rights, we concluded that the credit  card companies were only ""remote intermediaries,""  indifferent  [*563]  to any of Backpage's allegedly illegal  activities. Id. at 233-34, 239. The allegations here are different. According to  plaintiffs, Salesforce was not a remote intermediary  ""indifferent"" to Backpage's enterprise. If Backpage had  merely  purchased  an  off-the-shelf  product  from  Salesforce,  as  any  company  might  purchase  bookkeeping or word-processing software, then GTE  and Backpage.com might help Salesforce. But plaintiffs  have described a relationship between Salesforce and  Backpage much closer than [**33]  that between a web- hosting service or a credit-card payment processor and  a website. Salesforce and Backpage entered multiple  contracts over a number of years whereby Salesforce  provided Backpage with software designed specifically  for Backpage and affirmative, ""personalized support.""  Salesforce's support of Backpage's business was not  generic, but ""targeted"" to Backpage's specific needs.  Salesforce  repeatedly  consulted  with  Backpage,  including its CEO, ""to assess its operational needs"" and  provided ""active, ongoing support"" that was ""tailored"" to  Backpage's evolving business. This was not a sale by a  ""remote intermediary"" but the active participation of a  contractual partner. Salesforce  insists  that  our  interpretation  of  ""participation"" threatens to sweep up ""a convenience  store that sells disposable cell phones or a clothing  store that sells an outfit used as a disguise."" These are  precisely the kind of routine sales of off-the-shelf  products or standard services that we do not view as  amounting to ""participation."" Salesforce supports its  policy concerns with Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 143 S. Ct.  1206, 215 L. Ed. 2d 444 (2023), where the Supreme  Court interpreted the civil liability provisions of the  Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, 18 U.S.C. §  2333.  Twitter  recognized  the  significant  policy  choices [**34]  Congress makes when it authorizes civil  liability for deep-pocket associates of judgment-proof  wrongdoers, as it has in many contexts. We do not  ignore these policy concerns here but instead consider  them with our focus on the language and context of the  particular statute in question, Section 1595. The statute in Twitter, for example, authorizes civil  liability against ""any person who aids and abets, by  knowingly providing substantial assistance, or who  conspires with the person who committed such an act of  Page 13 of 17 international terrorism."" 18 U.S.C. § 2333(d)(2). The  Court's opinion focused on that language, which echoes  the criminal law of aiding and abetting and requires  actual knowledge, ""conscious, voluntary, and culpable  participation in another's wrongdoing."" 143 S. Ct. at  1223. Twitter affirmed dismissal of claims against three  large internet platforms whose relationships with  terrorist users were ""arm's length, passive, and largely  indifferent."" Id. at 1227. For another example, it is a  federal crime to provide ""material support or resources""  for terrorists, ""knowing or intending that they are to be  used in preparation for, or in carrying out"" any of a long  list of terrorist crimes. 18 U.S.C. § 2339A(a) (emphasis  added); Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1,  130 S. Ct. 2705, 177 L. Ed. 2d 355 (2010) (upholding  law  against  First  Amendment  and  vagueness  challenges). [**35]  By comparison, Congress drafted Section 1595(a) so  that participant liability for sex trafficking does not  require proof of the criminal mens rea needed for aiding  and abetting. Still, as explained above, we read Section  1595(a)'s standard of knowing benefit from participation  in a venture that has violated Section 1591 to require  more  than  what  Twitter  called  ""mere  passive  nonfeasance"" or an ""arm's length, passive, and largely  indifferent"" relationship  [*564]  with the criminal. See  143 S. Ct. at 1227. Plaintiffs here have alleged that  Salesforce provided Backpage with aid much more  ""direct, active, and substantial"" than was alleged in  Twitter. See id. at 1228. Salesforce also cites United States v. Hansen, 143 S.  Ct. 1932, 216 L. Ed. 2d 692 (2023), to support its  argument that ""participation in a venture"" under Section  1595 requires mens rea ""akin to that required for aiding  and abetting."" Noting that, when ""Congress 'borrows  terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition  and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably  knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were  attached to each borrowed word,'"" Hansen held that the  phrase ""encourages or induces"" in 8 U.S.C. §  1324(a)(1)(A)(iv) was used ""in its specialized, criminal- law sense"" and thus incorporated ""common-law liability  for solicitation and facilitation."" 143 S. Ct. at 1942,  quoting Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 263,  72 S. Ct. 240, 96 L. Ed. 288 (1952). That holding might aid our reading [**36]  of the criminal  provisions of Section 1591, but it does not help with civil  liability under Section 1595. Salesforce's reliance on  Hansen attempts to elide the difference between these  two statutes and proposes to transplant Section 1591's  definition of ""participation in a venture"" into Section  1595. As explained above, though, that definition is  expressly limited to Section 1591. Congress could have  transplanted it into Section 1595 when amending the  statutes in 2018, but it declined to do so. Compare 18  U.S.C. § 1591(e)(4) (2018) with 18 U.S.C. § 1595  (2018). We decline to do so as well. In sum, plaintiffs have not, as Salesforce contends,  ""conflated"" Salesforce's conduct with Backpage's.  Plaintiffs are seeking, as Section 1595(a) allows, to hold  Salesforce liable for its own conduct in facilitating the  success of Backpage's business, which engaged in  uncounted acts in violation of Section 1591, including  those that harmed G.G. Based on the repeated and  allegedly lucrative contracts between Salesforce and  Backpage, we draw the reasonable inference in  plaintiffs'  favor  that  Salesforce  participated  with  Backpage in the venture of Backpage's sex-trafficking  business by helping it grow. 4. Knowing Benefit According to the language of Section 1595, a plaintiff  can allege that the defendant ""knowingly benefitted"" by  alleging only that the defendant was aware [**37]  that it  was benefitting in some way from its participation in the  venture. That's it. As the district court correctly  observed, the benefit need not take the form of ""profits""  that are ""the specific result"" of a sex-trafficking venture.  G.G., 603 F. Supp. 3d at 643. Here, the allegations that  Salesforce was aware that it was benefiting, financially  and otherwise, from its numerous contracts with  Backpage are enough to satisfy the ""knowingly benefits""  element. Salesforce thinks that the statutory text requires more.  Relying on one district court decision—Geiss v.  Weinstein Co. Holdings LLC, 383 F. Supp. 3d 156, 168- 70 (S.D.N.Y. 2019)—Salesforce argues that the  ""knowingly benefits"" element requires (1) ""'a causal  relationship'  between  the  defendant's  'affirmative  conduct furthering the sex-trafficking venture and receipt  of a benefit,'"" and (2) ""that the defendant received the  benefits with 'knowledge of that causal relationship."" In Geiss, three women brought a civil action against film  producer Harvey Weinstein, his companies, and the  companies' officers and directors alleging that Weinstein  had sexually harassed and assaulted them and that ""the  other defendants knew  [*565]  of, facilitated, and  covered up his misconduct."" Id. at 161-62, 165, 167.  The court found that the defendants ""undoubtedly  benefited""  from  Weinstein's [**38]   continued  Page 14 of 17 employment and that some of the revenue generated by  Weinstein's ""movies and influence ... flowed to"" the  defendants. Id. at 169. But that was not enough. As the  court saw it, the ""controlling question"" was whether  Weinstein ""provided any of those benefits"" to the other  defendants ""because of [their] facilitation of [his] sexual  misconduct."" Id. at 169 (emphasis in original). In short,  Geiss read ""knowingly benefits"" to require a quid pro  quo between trafficker and participant. But Section 1595  says nothing about why the sex-trafficker provides any  benefit to the participant-defendant. In fact, the statute  does not even require that the sex trafficker itself or  himself provide any benefit. Section 1595 uses the  passive voice: ""Whoever knowingly benefits...."" 18  U.S.C. § 1595(a). The Geiss court and Salesforce's  reading thus find no footing in the statutory text. Again, as the statutory text clearly dictates, where the  defendant is simply aware that it is benefiting, that is  enough. According to the allegations here, Salesforce  and Backpage entered into multiple contracts over  several years that called for close business advice and  consulting. Salesforce's awareness that it was benefiting  from those contracts is enough to satisfy [**39]  the  ""knowingly benefits"" element. In sum, plaintiffs have plausibly alleged a claim under  Section 1595. G.G. was a victim of multiple violations of  Section 1591 at the hands of both her street-level  trafficker and Backpage. Backpage's business was a  venture that repeatedly engaged in acts that violated  Section 1591, and Salesforce at least should have                       known that Backpage's venture had violated and was  continuing to violate that statute. The continuous  business  relationship  between  Salesforce  and  Backpage was sufficient to show that Salesforce  participated in Backpage's venture and knowingly  benefitted from it. C. Whether Defendant is Protected by 47 U.S.C. §  230(c) Salesforce also argues that even if plaintiffs have  otherwise pled a viable claim under Section 1595,  Section 230(c) of the Communications Decency Act, 47  U.S.C. § 230, gives Salesforce a complete defense.  Again, we begin with the statute's text. Section 230(c) is  entitled ""Protection for 'Good Samaritan' blocking and  screening of offensive material"" and reads: ""No provider  or user of an interactive computer service shall be  treated as the publisher or speaker of any information  provided by another information content provider."" 47  U.S.C. § 230(c)(1) (1998).  [*566]  As we have said repeatedly, Section 230(c)(1)  ""does not create an 'immunity' of any kind."" City of  Chicago v. StubHub!, Inc., 624 F.3d 363, 366 (7th Cir.  2010), citing Chicago Lawyers' Comm. for Civil Rights  Under Law, Inc. v. Craigslist, Inc., 519 F.3d 666, 669-71  (7th Cir. 2008); GTE Corp., 347 F.3d at 660. Rather,  Section 230(c)(1) ""limits who may be called the  publisher of [**40]  information that appears online.""  StubHub, 624 F.3d at 366. In this way, it functions as an  affirmative defense. GTE Corp., 347 F.3d at 657. That  affirmative defense requires a civil defendant to  establish three elements: (1) the defendant is the  ""provider or user of an interactive computer service,""  and (2) the defendant is being ""treated as the publisher  or speaker"" of (3) ""information provided by another  information content provider."" 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1). A plaintiff ""ordinarily need not anticipate and attempt to  plead around affirmative defenses,"" but dismissal may  be appropriate if ""the factual allegations in the complaint  unambiguously establish all the elements of the            Page 15 of 17 defense."" Hyson USA, Inc. v. Hyson 2U, Ltd., 821 F.3d  935, 939 (7th Cir. 2016). The district court found that  plaintiffs had pled themselves out of court with factual  allegations that satisfied all three elements. First, the  court found that plaintiffs' allegations showed that  Salesforce qualified as an ""interactive computer  service."" G.G., 603 F. Supp. 3d at 634. Because  Salesforce—in the course of ""managing ... relationships""  between ""Backpage and its customers""—was required  ""to analyze ... content provided by Backpage about its  customers,"" the district court found that Salesforce was  ""an access software provider."" Id. at 635 (emphasis in  original). We need not resolve whether Salesforce [**41]   qualifies as a ""provider ... of an interactive computer  service."" The allegations do not support the second and  third  elements  of  Section  230(c)(1)'s  affirmative  defense. Plaintiffs' claim does not treat Salesforce as (2)  ""the publisher or speaker"" of (3) ""information provided  by another information content provider."" 47 U.S.C. §  230(c)(1). Section 230(c) ""might matter to liability for"" claims that  ""depend on who 'publishes' ... information or is a  'speaker'""—for, say, ""defamation, obscenity, or copyright  infringement""—but where the claim does not depend on  publishing or speaking, Section 230(c) ""is irrelevant.""  StubHub, 624 F.3d at 366; accord, Huon v. Denton, 841  F.3d 733, 741 (7th Cir. 2016) (defendant could be  treated as publisher ""for purposes of defamation and  other related theories of liability""); Craigslist, Inc., 519  F.3d at 668, 671 (finding that ""only in  [*567]  a capacity  as publisher could craigslist be liable under"" 42 U.S.C. §  3604(c), which prohibits only conduct that amounts to  publishing); GTE Corp., 347 F.3d at 660 (Section  230(c)(1) potentially ""forecloses any liability that  depends on deeming [the party] a 'publisher'"").               Here, plaintiffs' allegations simply do not seek to treat  Salesforce as a publisher or speaker. Plaintiffs' claim  does not depend on Salesforce having published or  spoken anything. Rather, plaintiffs seek to hold  Salesforce accountable for supporting Backpage, for  expanding Backpage's business, [**42]  for providing  Backpage with technology, for designing custom  software for Backpage, for facilitating the trafficking of  G.G., for helping Backpage with managing its customer  relationships, streamlining its business practices, and  improving its profitability, and for enabling Backpage ""to  scale its operations and increase the trafficking  conducted on Backpage."" Dkt. 85, ¶¶ 1-3, 33, 29-30, &  41. In other words, plaintiffs are seeking to hold  Salesforce ""liable under [Section 1595] for its own ...  acts or practices, rather than for publishing content  created by another."" See Federal Trade Comm'n v.  LeadClick Media, LLC, 838 F.3d 158, 175-76 (2d Cir.  2016) (civil defendant not protected by Section 230(c)(1)  where substantive statute, Section 5 of FTC Act,  imposed liability for far more conduct than publishing or  speaking  and  defendant  was  charged  with  ""participating"" in scheme that violated Act). We are not saying that ""the name of the cause of  action""—defamation versus participation and so on— determines whether a defendant can be treated as a  publisher or speaker. See Barnes v. Yahoo!, Inc., 570  F.3d 1096, 1101-02 (9th Cir. 2009). We agree with the  Ninth Circuit that we must focus on ""whether the duty  that the plaintiff alleges the defendant violated derives  from the defendant's status or conduct as a 'publisher or  speaker.'"" Id. at 1102. In this case, plaintiffs allege that Salesforce [**43]  had  a duty not to benefit knowingly from participating in  Backpage's venture while knowing or having reason to  know that the venture was engaged in sex trafficking.  That duty does not depend in any way on Salesforce's  supposed ""status or conduct as a 'publisher or  speaker.'"" See id. To be sure, Backpage itself was a publisher. But the           Page 16 of 17 fact that publishing was involved somewhere in G.G.'s  trafficking  does  not  mean  that  Salesforce  can  successfully use Section 230(c) to shield itself from  liability for having participated in Backpage's venture.  Publishing activity was ""a but-for cause of just about  everything"" Backpage was involved in. See Doe v.  Internet Brands, Inc., 824 F.3d 846, 853 (9th Cir. 2016).  It was an online marketplace. ""Without publishing user  content,"" Backpage would not have existed. See id. But Section 230 ""does not provide a general immunity  against all claims derived from third-party content."" Id.  Salesforce was simply not involved in any publishing.  Salesforce's job was, in part, to help Backpage reach  more customers, both in the form of sex traffickers and  purchasers of commercial sex. In a sense, Salesforce  helped Backpage find more sex-trafficking contractors.  Plaintiffs' allegations  [*568]  therefore do not treat  Salesforce as a publisher or speaker even if [**44]   Backpage's publishing played a critical role in causing  G.G.'s ultimate injury at the hands of her trafficker. Plaintiffs also have not alleged that Salesforce ever  ""published"" any third-party content. The only audience  for the data Salesforce put online was Backpage itself,  and Backpage provided Salesforce with that data. G.G.,  603 F. Supp. 3d at 635. It does not make sense to treat  Salesforce as ""publishing"" to Backpage itself content  that came from Backpage. With respect to any content  that was provided by Backpage, Salesforce fails Section  230's ""publisher or speaker"" element. To the extent that  Salesforce might have ""published"" its own data to  Backpage's employees, Salesforce fails Section 230's  third element, which requires that the published content  be ""provided by another information content provider.""  47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1) (emphasis added). The judgment of the district court is REVERSED, and  this case is REMANDED for proceedings consistent with  this opinion. Dissent by: KIRSCH  K, Circuit Judge, dissenting. The majority and I  agree that Salesforce lacked constructive knowledge  that G.G. had been trafficked on Backpage.com in  violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. The majority nevertheless    concludes that the plaintiffs may hold Salesforce civilly  liable under 18 U.S.C. § 1595 as a participant in [**45]   sex trafficking because Salesforce sold customized  software to Backpage when it should have known that  Backpage violated § 1591 as to some individual at some  point in time, but not necessarily G.G. That broad  reading of § 1595 would extend civil liability to nearly  every company and individual who did regular and  personalized business with Backpage after it faced  public allegations of sex trafficking. It also renders  meaningless § 1595's requirement that the defendant  have constructive knowledge of a § 1591 violation.  Because the plaintiffs have not alleged that Salesforce  should have known of G.G.'s particular trafficking, they  have failed to allege a § 1595 violation. I respectfully  dissent. Section 1595 authorizes victims of sex trafficking to  bring damages suits against ""the perpetrator [ ]or  whoever knowingly benefits ... from participation in a  venture which that person knew or should have known  has engaged in an act in violation of this chapter."" §  1595(a). The ""act in violation"" here is § 1591, which  makes it a crime to knowingly advertise ""a person"" or to  benefit from participation in a venture that does so,  ""knowing ... that means of force, threats of force, fraud,  coercion ..., or any combination of such means will be  used to cause [**46]  the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or ... that [a minor] ... will be caused  to engage in a commercial sex act."" The majority and I  agree that to be civilly liable as a participant in a venture  that violated § 1591, by the plain language of § 1595,  Salesforce must have had constructive knowledge of a  § 1591 violation. But to the majority, a defendant can  violate § 1595 so as long as it had ""constructive  knowledge that a venture generally has violated Section  1591."" Ante, at 22. But there is no such thing as a  general violation of § 1591. A violation depends on  whether the elements of § 1591 are satisfied (or in this  case, whether they are pled). To plead a § 1595 violation, the plaintiffs must allege  that Salesforce had constructive knowledge of G.G.'s  trafficking. This is because § 1591's use of the terms ""a  person"" and ""the person"" is victim-specific, meaning an  individual is not guilty of the crime unless the  government can prove that his actions were tied to a  specific  [*569]  victim. Knowledge of a specific victim  (not just general sex trafficking) is an element of § 1591.  Thus, because § 1595 requires constructive knowledge  of a § 1591 violation and a § 1591 violation requires  knowledge of a specific victim, damages suits are  available only when a plaintiff [**47]  plausibly alleges  Page 17 of 17 that the defendant should have known that the venture  engaged in her particular sex trafficking. See Doe #1 v.  Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 726 (11th Cir. 2021)  (defining the elements of a § 1595 claim as ""the  defendant (1) knowingly benefited (2) from taking part in  a common undertaking or enterprise involving risk and  potential profit, (3) that the undertaking or enterprise  violated  the  [Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act] as to the plaintiff, and (4) that the  defendant had constructive or actual knowledge that the  undertaking or enterprise violated the TVPRA as to the  plaintiff"") (emphasis added). So, for the plaintiffs to bring  a civil § 1595 claim against Salesforce, Salesforce must  have had constructive knowledge of G.G.'s specific sex  trafficking. By holding that a defendant may be liable under § 1595  even if the plaintiff cannot plead the elements of a §  1591 violation, countless companies and individuals  doing business with Backpage in 2008 or later could  face liability so long as a plaintiff could allege a  defendant's constructive knowledge of Backpage's sex  trafficking and a beneficial, tailored relationship that  assisted Backpage's growth. But the text of § 1595 does  not support that result. Without constructive knowledge of [**48]  G.G.'s identity  and the trafficking offense committed against her (in  other words, a § 1591 violation), the plaintiffs cannot  bring a civil § 1595 claim against Salesforce. Because  they have not alleged that Salesforce should have had  such knowledge (or that Salesforce avoided learning of  it), I would hold that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim  for relief under § 1595. Thus, I would not reach the  issue of whether Salesforce is entitled to dismissal  under 47 U.S.C. § 230. I respectfully dissent.",1
"Gaines v. Jefferson Cnty. Sch. Dist., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217813","[*1] MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER Before the Court is a Motion for Judgment on the  Pleadings Based on Qualified Immunity [ECF No. 30]  (the ""Motion for Judgment""), which defendants Adrian  Hammitte (""Hammitte"") and Shameka Woods (""Woods"";  collectively with Hammitte, the ""Individual Defendants"")  filed against plaintiff Nathaniel Gaines (""Plaintiff""). The  Individual Defendants also filed a Memorandum of  Authorities in Support thereof. [ECF No. 31]. Discovery  is stayed pending a decision on the Motion for  Judgment. See text-only order issued 9/25/2023.  Plaintiff opposed the Motion for Judgment, [ECF Nos.  32 & 33], and the Individual Defendants filed their reply.  [ECF No. 34]. This is the second motion for judgment that the  Individual Defendants have filed. [ECF Nos. 12 & 13].  The Court denied the initial motion without prejudice and  gave Plaintiff the 1 opportunity to file a Rule 7(a)(7) Schultea reply. [ECF  No. 25]. Plaintiff took advantage of that opportunity,  [ECF No. 26], and the Individual Defendants responded  in opposition. [ECF No. 29]. Having provided the parties with multiple opportunities  to present their positions and having carefully reviewed  the pleadings, all submissions of the parties, and the  applicable [*2]  law, the Court finds as follows: BACKGROUND 1 Following his termination as a Jefferson County  Elementary School employee, Plaintiff brought this  action under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for sex  discrimination and retaliation (Counts I & II), First  Amendment retaliation (Count III), and breach of  contract (Count IV). Plaintiff sued the Individual  Defendants solely for First Amendment retaliation in  Count III. Hammitte is sued in both his individual and  official capacities; Woods is sued only in her individual  capacity. [ECF No. 1] ¶¶ 6 & 8. Prior to his termination, Plaintiff worked as a non- certified interventionist at Jefferson County Elementary  School. Plaintiff attained his teaching certification during  his 1 The Court presented in detail the background of this  case in its prior opinion, which was issued on June 20,  2023. [ECF No. 25]. 2 employment at Jefferson County Elementary and  Page 2 of 9 applied for over a dozen certified teaching positions. He was not hired for  any of those positions. [ECF No. 1] ¶¶ 20-23; 34-35. The  school's athletic director offered Plaintiff a coaching position,  which Plaintiff did not accept. After having been turned down for multiple certified teaching  positions,  Plaintiff  posted  the  following  comment on Facebook: I'm [*3]  going to say what's on alot of people I know  minds. We tired of being underpaid & unappreciated.  This some pure [f******] on so many levels. Ion care who  don't like my hometown full of [excrement emoji]. Then  act dumb to the fact like they don't know the bull[****]  they doing to some hardworking people I swear we  deserve better than this. [ECF No. 1-3] (redacted; see Exhibit 2 to Complaint for unredacted  version).  His  post  generated  three  responses on Facebook from a person who commented on the school administrators' misallocation of COVID relief funds and  air purifiers that did not make it to the classrooms. [ECF  No. 19- 1,-2,-3]. Four days after Plaintiff posted on Facebook,  Woods recommended to Hammitte that Plaintiff should be fired.  [ECF No. 1] ¶ 54; [ECF No. 1-4]. Two days later, Hammitte  notified Plaintiff by letter that he was terminated. [ECF No. 1] ¶  56; [ECF No. 1-5]. According to the Complaint, Plaintiff called Hammitte regarding his termination, and the superintendent told  Plaintiff 3 he was fired for not executing a coaching contract that  had been offered to him, for violating the school's cell  phone policy, and for his Facebook post. [ECF No. 1] ¶¶  60-68. Plaintiff subsequently filed [*4]  a charge with the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. [ECF No.  1] ¶ 14. In its Position Statement in response to  Plaintiff's EEOC charge, the Jefferson County School  District (the ""District"") denied having discriminated  against Plaintiff based on sex or retaliation and stated:  ""Mr. Gaines went on social talking negatively about the  school district, which caused a distraction and disruption  to the district's learning environment."" [ECF No. 19-4].  The EEOC issued a Right to Sue letter [ECF No. 1-2],  and Plaintiff affirms that he filed this lawsuit within ninety  (90) days of his receipt of the EEOC letter. [ECF No. 1]  ¶ 17. In his Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that his Facebook post  ""expressed his belief that Jefferson County was treating  its employees poorly"" and that he ""was speaking as a  private citizen on a matter of public concern."" [ECF No.  1] ¶¶ 51-52. The Individual Defendants counter that:  ""Since the Plaintiff's post conveys no information  beyond the Plaintiff's displeasure with his pay and the  lack of appreciation shown to him, the Plaintiff's post  amounts only to an airing of his personal opinions,  nothing more."" [ECF No. 34] at 10. 4 STANDARD OF REVIEW Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  governs a motion for [*5]  judgment on the pleadings.  The standard for addressing a Rule 12(c) motion is the  same as that for addressing a motion to dismiss under  Rule 12(b)(6). In re GreatLakes Dredge & Co., 624 F.3d  201, 209-10 (5th Cir. 2010); Doe v.MySpace, Inc., 528  F.3d 413, 418 (5th Cir. 2008). To avoid dismissal, ""a  complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,  accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is  plausible on its face.'"" Great Lakes Dredge, 624 F.3d at  210 (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570  (2007)). ""A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff  pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the  reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the  misconduct alleged."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,  Page 3 of 9 678 (2009). The factual allegations in a complaint must  be enough to raise the right to relief above the  speculative level. E.g., Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555; Great  Lakes Dredge, 624 F.3d at 210. The Court must ""accept  all well-pleaded facts as true and construe the complaint  in the light most favorable to the plaintiff."" GreatLakes  Dredge, 624 F.3d at 210. 5 ANALYSIS Qualified Immunity At issue in this Rule 12(c) motion is whether the  Individual Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity  and to have the claims against them in their individual  capacities in Count III dismissed. The Individual  Defendants generally would be shielded from suit when  performing discretionary functions, unless Plaintiff  shows by specific allegations that they violated ""clearly  established statutory or constitutional rights of which a  reasonable [*6]  person would have known."" Harlow  v.Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). ""Qualified  immunity gives government officials breathing room to  make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open  legal questions."" Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.S. 731, 743  (2011). It is Plaintiff's burden to show through  nonconclusory factual averments that the qualified  immunity defense does not apply. Williams v. City of  Jackson,  No.  3:20-CV-785-DPJ-FKB,  2021  WL  4485865, at *4 (S.D. Miss. Sept. 29, 2021) (relying on  Khan v. Normand, 683 F.3d 192, 194 (5th Cir. 2012)). A two-pronged test determines whether defendants are  entitled to qualified immunity: 6 (1) Did the plaintiff allege the violation of a constitutional  right? (2) Was the conduct objectively reasonable in light of  clearly established law at the time the challenged  conduct occurred? Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001), overruled in  part by Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009). ""If no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established, there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity."" Saucier, 533  U.S. at 201. In  Pearson  v.  Callahan,  the  Supreme  Court  reconsidered Saucier's mandated sequence of applying the two  prongs in the qualified immunity analysis and held that district courts  and the courts of appeals may exercise their sound  discretion in deciding which of the two prongs should be addressed  first. Pearson, 555 U.S. at 236. The Court explained: On reconsidering the procedure required in Saucier, we  conclude that, while the sequence set forth there is  often appropriate, it should no longer [*7]  be regarded  as mandatory. The judges of the district courts and the  courts of appeals should be permitted to exercise their  sound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of  the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed  first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at  hand. Id. Based on a review of the facts alleged in this case, and further based on the status of controlling case law at the  time 7 that the challenged conduct occurred, the Court will  render its ruling on this motion under the second prong of the  Saucier test. See Morgan v. Swanson, 659 F.3d 359, 384-85  (5th Cir.2011) (discussing the Supreme Court's ongoing  retreat from Saucier's mandatory order of battle and active  discouragement of district courts from ""unnecessarily deciding the merits of  a Page 4 of 9 constitutional issue""). So as to render a thorough  decision, the Court will initially discuss below the factual  allegations as applied to clearly established First Amendment  retaliation law at the time that Plaintiff's employment was  terminated. A. First Amendment Retaliation Plaintiff claims that the constitutional right at issue is his First Amendment right to speak ""as a private citizen  on a matter of public concern."" [ECF No. 1] ¶ 84. It is well- established that a cognizable employee free speech  retaliation claim [*8]  must satisfy four elements: (1) the employee suffered an adverse employment  action; (2) the speech involved a matter of public concern; 2 (3) the interest in commenting on matters of public  concern outweigh the employer's interest in promoting  efficiency; and 2As explained in Dixon v. Alcorn Cnty., Mississippi, No.  1:19-CV-167-SA-DAS, 2020 WL 5765202, at *5 (N.D.  Miss. Sept. 28, 2020), the second element has been  modified by courts to include the requirement that the  speech was delivered by a private citizen on a matter of  public concern. 8 (4) the speech motivated the employer's adverse  employment action. E.g., Salge v. Edna Indep. Sch. Dist., 411 F.3d 178, 184  (5th Cir. 2005). 1. Adverse Employment Action. In this case, there is no dispute that the first element is  satisfied. Plaintiff suffered an adverse employment  action when he was terminated. [ECF No. 1] ¶ 56; [ECF  No. 1-5]. 2. Private Citizen and Public Concern. The second element is more complex. Plaintiff states in  his Complaint that ""… Mr. Gaines was speaking as a  private citizen on a matter of public concern."" Id. ¶ 52.  But such conclusory statements are not sufficient to  meet his burden. An initial question is whether Plaintiff was speaking as a  private citizen or whether he was speaking in his role as  a school employee and made his Facebook statements  pursuant to his official duties. E.g. [*9] , Garcetti v.  Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 421 (2006) (""We hold that when  public employees make statements pursuant to their  official duties, the employees are not speaking as  citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the  Constitution does not insulate their communications  from employer discipline.""); Williams v. Dallas Indep.  Sch. Dist., 9 480 F.3d 689, 694 (5th Cir. 2007) (athletic director's  memoranda to the office manager and principal were  written in the course of performing his job and therefore  not protected by the First Amendment); Teague v. City  of Flower Mound, Tex., 179 F.3d 377, 382 (5th Cir.  1999)(""citizen  versus  employee""  test  must  be  considered in conjunction with the more lengthy three- factor balancing test of content, context, and form). In  his Schultea reply, [ECF No. 26] ¶¶ 1-3, Plaintiff  informed the Court that his speech was posted directly  to the public on his own time and device and was made  ""outside the chain of command."" The Court is satisfied  under existing law that Plaintiff did not make his  Facebook post as part of his official duties. The inquiry is not over because Plaintiff also must  demonstrate that he was speaking on a matter of public  concern. Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 147 (1983)  (when a public employee speaks upon matters only of  personal  interest,  absent  the  most  unusual  circumstances, a federal court is not the appropriate  forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel  decision taken by a public agency); [*10]  Dixon v.  Alcorn Cnty.,Mississippi, No. 1:19-CV-167-SA-DAS,  2020 WL 5765202, at *5 (N.D. Miss. Sept. 28, 2020) (to  defeat a qualified immunity defense, the plaintiff must  plead sufficient facts to show that, in addition to  speaking as a private citizen, the plaintiff also 10 Page 5 of 9 was speaking on a matter of public concern). The  United States Supreme Court has offered this guidance: Speech involves matters of public concern ""when it can  'be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political,  social, or other concern to the community,' or when it 'is  a subject of legitimate news interest; that is, a subject of  general interest and of value and concern to the public.'""  Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S. ----, ----, 131 S.Ct. 1207,  1216, 179 L.Ed.2d 172 (2011) (citation omitted). Lane v. Franks, 573 U.S. 228, 241 (2014). ""The  arguably 'inappropriate or controversial character of a statement  is irrelevant to the question whether it deals with a matter  of public concern.'"" Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S. 443, 453,  (2011) (quoting Rankin v. McPherson, 483 U.S. 378, 387  (1987)); accord United States v. Cook, 472 F. Supp. 3d 326, 335 (N.D.  Miss. 2020). The Individual Defendants claim to have viewed  Plaintiff's Facebook post as ""merely a private concern reflecting  personal interest, aired publicly,"" [ECF No. 31] at 4, which  conveyed ""no information beyond the Plaintiff's displeasure with his  pay and the lack of appreciation shown to him ... ."" Id. at 6; see  also [ECF No. 34] at 10. The gist of their defense is that Plaintiff's post reflects a personal employer-employee  dispute and is not a matter [*11]  of public concern that merits  First Amendment protection. Salge v. Edna Indep. Sch. Dist.,  411 F.3d 178, 187 (5th Cir. 2005). 11 Plaintiff claims that his Facebook post ""expressed his  belief that the employees of Jefferson County were  being 'under paid & unappreciated'"" and that ""Jefferson  County was treating its employees poorly."" [ECF No. 1]  ¶¶ 50-51. Plaintiff argues that he was voicing a  ""collective grievance"" about budget and education  policy, dishonesty, mismanagement of funds, improper  Board policies, and underpayment of teachers - all  topics of protected speech under Supreme Court and  Fifth Circuit precedent. [ECF No. 33] at 12-14; see, e.g.,  Pickering v. Bd.of Ed. of Tp. High Sch. Dist. 205, Will  Cnty., Illinois, 391 U.S. 563, 571-73 (1968). The true  nature of Plaintiff's speech no doubt lies somewhere in  between the parties' diametrically opposed positions. Our controlling precedent contains many examples of  ""mixed speech"" cases in which ""[a]n employee's speech  may contain an element of personal interest and yet still  qualify as speech on a matter of public concern."" Harris  v. Victoria Ind. Sch.Dist., 168 F.3d 216, 222 (5th Cir.  1999). In mixed speech cases, ""Whether an employee's  speech addresses a matter of public concern must be  determined by the content, form, and context of a given  statement, as revealed by the whole record."" Connick v.  Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 147-48 (1983); Teague v. City  ofFlower Mound, Tex., 179 F.3d 377, 382 (5th Cir.  1999) (""In cases [*12]  involving mixed speech, we are  bound to consider the Connick 12 factors of content, context, and form, and determine  whether the speech is public or private based on these  factors.""). Under Fifth Circuit precedent, none of these  three factors is dispositive, Bell v. Itawamba Cty. Sch.  Bd., 799 F.3d 379, 407 (5th Cir. 2015), but context and  form are to be weighed more heavily than content.  Gibson v. Kilpatrick, 838 F.3d 476, 487 (5th Cir. 2016)  (""Within this balancing, we weigh context and form  'more heavily.'""); Teague, 179 F.3d at 383. i. Content. Applying these principles to Plaintiff's Facebook post,  the Court finds itself at a disadvantage when it comes to  construing the content of Plaintiff's speech. This is so  because the writing is unclear, as Plaintiff admits in part.  [ECF No. 33] at 13. What is clear from the post is that  Page 6 of 9 Plaintiff wishes to speak for a group of people (e.g., ""I'm  going to say what's on alot of people I know minds"") and  not just for himself. His post makes no reference to his  personal employment dispute with the Jefferson County  School District. Fifth Circuit precedent instructs that '""if  releasing the speech to the public would inform the  populace of more than the fact of an employee's  employment grievance, the content of the speech may  be public in nature.""' Salge, 411 F.3d at 187 (5th Cir.  2005) (quoting Kennedy v. Tangipahoa Par. Library Bd.  of Control, 224 F.3d 359, 13 372 (5th Cir.2000), abrogated [*13]  on other grounds  as explained inCuvillier v. Taylor, 503 F.3d 397, 401 n.4  (5th Cir. 2007). While Plaintiff's Facebook post - as written - might not  appear particularly informative to the populace, it does  seem to have sparked informative comments on topics  of public concern from some members of the  community. In his Schultea reply, Plaintiff alleges that  ""[t]en members of the local community - members of the  public - reacted to the post to express their interest in it  and their support of Gaines' views."" [ECF No. 26] ¶ 22.  One of these community members, who was not  employed by the Jefferson County School District,  shared Plaintiff's post ""as part of her allegations that  JCPS was poorly allocating public ESSER [Elementary  and Secondary School Emergency Relief] funds  provided in Biden's American Rescue Plan, including  the specific allegation that JCPS administrators paid  themselves bonuses from funds earmarked to combat  the COVID-19 pandemic, and that they should have  spent more on air purifiers for the classrooms and  bonuses for the teachers."" Id. ¶¶ 30, 35. Relying on two United States Supreme Court cases and  a Fifth Circuit decision, 3 Plaintiff argues that ""what  matters is 3 Heffernan v. City of Paterson, N.J., 578 U.S. 266, 270  (2016); Waters v. Churchill, 511 U.S. 661, 677-78  (1994); Salge, 411 F.3d at 185. 14 not what Plaintiff said, but how he was understood by  his [*14]  audience … ."" [ECF No. 33] at 10 (emphasis  added and in the original). The Court finds this  interpretation of our precedent to be overly broad. As  explained by the Fifth Circuit in Salge, the Churchill  decision held that ""when a plaintiff-employee's First  Amendment retaliation claim rests on a disputed version  of his speech, a court applying the Supreme Court's  Connick v.Myers test to determine whether the speech  was on a matter of public concern must examine the  speech as the defendant-employer reasonably believed  it to be."" Salge, 411 F.3d at 185. Likewise, in Heffernan,  the Supreme Court considered the consequences of an  employer's mistaken belief that an employee had  engaged in protected speech and concluded that the  government employer's reason for demoting the plaintiff  is what counted. Heffernan, 578 U.S. at 272-73. The  Court does not find these cases to be helpful to  Plaintiff's position. If the Court were to determine  whether Plaintiff's speech was a matter of public  concern by examining it as the defendant-employer  reasonably believed it to be, then the Court would most  likely find Plaintiff's speech to reflect a personal  employer-employee dispute, which, under our caselaw,  would not be deemed a matter of public concern  protected by the First Amendment. In any event,  the [*15]  Court finds the cited cases to be factually  distinguishable from Plaintiff's case and none holds that  a non- 15 employer's response to, or interpretation of, an  employee's ambiguous speech determines the public  nature of such speech for the purposes of the Connick  test. No party has cited such a case to the Court in its  briefing, and the Court's research has not uncovered  such precedent. The Court views the evaluation of the  content of Plaintiff's ambiguous speech under Connick  to be an open question that remains subject to debate. ii. Form. The second factor - the form of Plaintiff's speech - is  less problematic and weighs in favor of a finding that  Plaintiff spoke on a matter of public concern, as the  Individual Defendants concede in their briefs. [ECF No.  29] at 6; [ECF No. 31] at 6. Plaintiff asserts that his post  was made to the public and was available to anyone  with an internet connection. [ECF No. 26] ¶¶ 8, 10. The  Fifth Circuit has found that a Facebook page was a form  of speech accessible by the community, served as a  community bulletin board, and weighed in favor of  finding that the plaintiff spoke on a matter of public  concern. Graziosi v. City of Greenville Miss., 775 F.3d  731, 739 (5th Cir. 2015). While the form of speech is not  a dispositive [*16]  factor in the Court's analysis, it is  weighed more heavily than the content of the speech.  E.g., Gibson, 838 F.3d at 487. Page 7 of 9 16 iii. Context. The final factor, which is the context of Plaintiff's  speech, likely weighs at least narrowly in favor of a  finding that Plaintiff spoke on a matter of public concern.  The Individual Defendants are of a different view and  argue that Plaintiff has failed to allege any widespread  public debate regarding District employee pay or the  District's hiring decisions. [ECF No. 31] at 7. In  opposition, Plaintiff presented in his Schultea reply new  factual allegations regarding the persons in the  community who responded to or shared Plaintiff's post  with others. [ECF No. 26] ¶¶ 22-26, 30-35. Plaintiff also  cites three specific news articles regarding ESSER  funding and American Rescue Plan spending. Id. ¶¶ 38- 40. ""'[S]peech made against the backdrop of ongoing  commentary and debate in the press involves the public  concern.'"" Wetherbe v.Texas Tech Univ. Sys., 699 F.  App'x 297, 301 (5th Cir. 2017), quoting Kennedy, 224  F.3d at 373 (5th Cir. 2000). The  Individual  Defendants  take  issue  with  the  publication dates of the cited articles because two  postdate Plaintiff's Facebook post and one predates the  post by five months. [ECF No. 31] at 8. The Individual  Defendants further criticize the content of [*17]  the  earliest written article because it relays 17 general information that they claim does not create ""a  backdrop of ongoing debate."" Recognizing that both sides have made perceptive  points, the Court believes that Plaintiff has alleged  enough supporting facts at this early stage of the  litigation to tip the balance in his favor on the issue of  context. Considering that the factors of form and context  seem to favor Plaintiff, and provided that those two  factors are afforded the greatest weight in the legal  analysis, e.g., Gibson, 838 F.3d at 487, then there is an  argument, subject to the Court's reservations explained  above, that Plaintiff's factual allegations are sufficient to  satisfy the second element of a First Amendment  retaliation claim. 3. Balancing. The Individual Defendants argue that, even if Plaintiff  satisfies the first two elements of a First Amendment  retaliation claim, he fails to satisfy the Pickering  balancing test in the third element. [ECF No. 13] at 13- 14; seePickering, 391 U.S. at 568. In Pickering, the  United States Supreme Court described a need to strike  ""a balance between the interests of the teacher, as a  citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern  and the interest of the State, as an employer, in  promoting the efficiency of the public services it [*18]   performs through its employees."" Id.; see also Connick,  461 18 U.S. at 138. The Individual Defendants urge the Court to  find that the District's interest in promoting efficiency  outweighs Plaintiff's interest in commenting on matters  of public concern. The Court, however, must decline to  do so. The Fifth Circuit has held that the balancing  analysis, while appropriate on summary judgment, is not  appropriate at this stage of the litigation. Cox v. Kaelin,  577 F. App'x 306, 313 (5th Cir. 2014), relying on  Kennedy, 224 F.3d at 366 n. 9. The balancing element  must remain unresolved for now. 4. Causation. The parties present antithetical positions regarding the  final element of the First Amendment retaliation claim --  whether Plaintiff's speech was a substantial or  motivating factor in the adverse employment action. As  evidence that he was fired because of his Facebook  post, Plaintiff emphasizes the timing of his firing, which  was within days of his posting of the Facebook  comment. [ECF No. 33] at 3. Plaintiff further alleges that  Hammitte told him that he was fired for, among other  things, his Facebook post. [ECF No. 1] ¶¶ 60-68.  Finally, Plaintiff points to the District's Position  Statement in the EEOC proceedings in which the  District stated: ""Mr. Gaines went on social talking  negatively about the [*19]  school district, which caused  a distraction and disruption to the district's learning 19 environment."" [ECF No. 19-4]. Viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, these factual allegations are  sufficient to satisfy the First Amendment retaliation causation  element on a Rule 12(c) motion to dismiss. 4 B. Objectively Reasonable Conduct Returning to the second prong of the qualified immunity Page 8 of 9 test, the Court must decide whether the Individual  Defendants' conduct was objectively reasonable in light of clearly established law at the time that Plaintiff's employment  was terminated. Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201. A constitutional  right 4The Individual Defendants further argue under the  Mount Healthy decision that Plaintiff would have been  fired whether or not his Facebook post was protected  speech. [ECF No. 31] at 11; see Mt.Healthy City Sch.  Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977)  (after plaintiff carries his burden of establishing that the  protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor  in the adverse employment action, employer may show  by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have  reached the same adverse decision even in the  absence of the protected conduct). Typically, it is for a  jury to resolve any remaining factual disputes regarding  causation  and  an  employer's  MountHealthy  affirmative [*20]  defense. Branton v. City of Dallas, 272  F.3d 730, 739 (5th Cir. 2001); Brown v. Leflore  Cnty.,Mississippi, 150 F. Supp. 3d 753, 760-61 (N.D.  Miss. 2015) (last element of First Amendment retaliation  claim analysis and the Mount Healthy affirmative  defense are typically questions for the jury); Smith v.  Coll. of the Mainland, 63 F. Supp. 3d 712, 716 (S.D.  Tex. 2014) (the final element - whether plaintiff's  protected speech was a substantial or motivating factor  in the adverse employment decision - is typically a jury  question). It is the Court's view that consideration of the  Mount Healthy defense and factual disputes regarding  causation would be more appropriately addressed later  in this litigation. 20 is clearly established when it is ""sufficiently clear that  every reasonable official would have understood that  what he is doing violates that right."" Rivas-Villegas v.  Cortesluna, 595 U.S. 1, 5-6, (2021) (quoting Mullenix v.  Luna, 577 U.S. 7, 11, (2015) (internal quotation marks  omitted). ""Rights are 'clearly established' when 'existing  precedent squarely governs the specific facts at issue,'  … not when a rule is merely 'suggested by then-existing  precedent'… ."" Henderson v. Harris Cnty.,Texas, 51  F.4th 125, 132 (5th Cir. 2022), cert. denied sub  nom.Henderson v. Harris Cnty., 143 S. Ct. 2661 (2023)  (internal citations omitted). A case directly on point is  not required for a right to be clearly established, but  ""existing  precedent  must  have  placed  the  …  constitutional question beyond debate."" White v. Pauly,  580 U.S. 73, 78-79, (2017) (internal quotation marks  omitted). Whether Plaintiff's ambiguous speech was of  public concern is not beyond debate. The Court [*21]  finds that there is an absence of case  law which addresses Plaintiff's theory of protected public  speech. As the Court appreciates it, Plaintiff's theory is  that his own words - no matter how vague - do not  determine whether his speech is a matter of public  concern protected by the First Amendment; rather, it is  how non-employer ""audience"" members understood his  speech that determines First Amendment protection.  [ECF No. 33] 21 at 10. The Court is of the opinion that this theory of First  Amendment law is not now, and was not when Plaintiff's  employment was terminated, clearly established. The  Individual Defendants could not have been expected to  conclude  that  Plaintiff's  Facebook  post  was  constitutionally protected public speech. The Court finds  that the Individual Defendants' conduct was objectively  reasonable given clearly established law at the relevant  time and that the Individual Defendants are entitled to  qualified immunity with respect to the Count III First  Amendment retaliation claims against them in their  individual capacities. See Keim v. City of El Paso, 162  F.3d 1159 (5th Cir. 1998) (the individual defense of  qualified immunity does not apply to an official-capacity  claim); Hunter v. Town of Edwards, 871 F. Supp. 2d  558, 562 (S.D. Miss. 2012) (the defense of qualified  immunity only applies to claims alleged against officials  in their individual, but [*22]  not their official, capacities). Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED THAT the Motion for Judgment on the  Pleadings Based on Qualified Immunity [ECF No. 30] is  GRANTED to the extent expressly set forth in this order; IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT the claims asserted  in Count III of the Complaint against the Individual  Defendants in their individual capacities are dismissed;  and 22 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT the stay on  discovery in this case is lifted.

"Greene v. State, 2023 Ind. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1393","[*1] Appeal from the Vigo Superior Court The Honorable Matthew A. Sheehan, Judge Trial Court Cause Nos. 84D05-1803-F5-890 84D05- 2112-F5-4228 Memorandum Decision by Judge Kenworthy Judges Bailey and Tavitas concur. Kenworthy, Judge. Case Summary [1] Michael P. Greene appeals his six-year aggregate  sentence, raising one issue for our review: Does his  sentence warrant revision under Indiana Appellate Rule  7(B)?  Concluding  Greene's  sentence  is  not  inappropriate in light of the nature of his offense and his  character, we affirm. Facts and Procedural History [2] In 2007, Greene was convicted of Class C felony  child molesting. Based on this conviction, Greene was  required to register as a sex offender. In 2018, Greene  was convicted of Level 5 felony failure to register as a  sex offender and placed on probation. A couple of years  later, the State petitioned to revoke Greene's probation  and charged Greene in this case with two counts of  failure to register as a sex offender-one as a Level 5  felony and one as a Level 6 felony. The State also  alleged Greene was a habitual offender. In late  February 2023, Greene and the State entered into a  plea agreement. Under the terms of the agreement,  Greene pleaded guilty to Level 5 felony failure [*2]  to  register as a sex offender, 1 admitted he was a habitual  offender, 2 admitted to a probation violation, and agreed  to a six-year cap on his sentence. The trial court  accepted the plea agreement, dismissed Greene's Level  6 felony charge, and terminated his probation as  unsatisfactorily completed. 1 Ind. Code § 11-8-8-17(b) (2020). 2 I.C. § 35-50-2-8(i)(2) (2017). [3] Prior to sentencing, Greene was evaluated by a  licensed clinical social worker. The social worker  reported Greene suffered from childhood trauma  because he ""saw his mother shot and killed when he  was like three (3) years old."" Tr. Vol. 2 at 43. Further,  Greene  was  diagnosed  with  schizophrenia,  ""schizoaffective disorder,"" PTSD, and ADHD. Id. at 44.  Greene also has a history of abusing illegal substances  like  methamphetamine,  marijuana,  mushrooms,  oxycontin, and LSD. Due to his condition, Greene was  treated at the Hamilton Center and Options Behavioral  Health Center on several occasions. Overall, Greene  failed to adhere to recommendations and did not  engage in treatment. [4] The trial court sentenced Greene to an aggregate  sentence of six years executed in the Department of  Correction-three years for Level 5 felony failure to  Page 2 of 3 register as a sex offender with a three-year [*3]  habitual  offender enhancement. When sentencing Greene, the  trial court acknowledged Greene's ""significant mental  health issues"" as a ""significant mitigating factor."" Id. at  58. Yet the trial court determined Greene's criminal  history-including five prior felony convictions for failure  to register as a sex offender-and several probation  violations warranted the imposed sentence. Greene's Sentence Does Not Warrant 7(B) Revision [5] Greene asks us to review and revise his sentence.  The Indiana Constitution authorizes this Court to review  and revise a trial court's sentencing decision as  provided by rule. Ind. Const. art. 7, § 6. Indiana  Appellate Rule 7(B) provides we may revise a sentence  authorized by statute if, ""after due consideration of the trial court's decision, the Court finds that the  sentence is inappropriate in light of the nature of the offense and the character of the  offender."" The principal role of appellate review is to  leaven the outliers, not to achieve a perceived correct  sentence in each case. Conley v. State, 183 N.E.3d  276, 288 (Ind. 2022). Thus, ""we reserve our 7(B)  authority for exceptional cases."" Faith v. State, 131 N.E.3d 158, 160 (Ind. 2019) (per curiam).  [6] ""[S]entencing is principally a discretionary function in  which the trial court's judgment should receive  considerable deference."" Cardwell v. State, 895 N.E.2d  1219, 1222 (Ind. 2008). ""Such [*4]  deference should  prevail unless overcome by compelling evidence  portraying in a positive light the nature of the offense  (such as accompanied by restraint, regard, and lack of  brutality) and the defendant's character (such as  substantial virtuous traits or persistent examples of good  character)."" Stephenson v. State, 29 N.E.3d 111, 122  (Ind. 2015). The question ""is not whether another  sentence is more appropriate; rather, the question is  whether the sentence imposed is inappropriate."" Helsley  v. State, 43 N.E.3d 225, 228 (Ind. 2015) (quoting King v.  State, 894 N.E.2d 265, 268 (Ind. Ct. App. 2008))  (emphasis omitted). Whether we regard a sentence as  inappropriate ""turns on our sense of the culpability of the  defendant, the severity of the crime, the damage done  to others, and myriad other factors that come to light in  a given case."" Cardwell, 895 N.E.2d at 1224. [7] The defendant bears the burden of persuading us a  revised sentence is warranted. Harris v. State, 165  N.E.3d 91, 99 (Ind. 2021). And because our legislature  has selected the advisory sentence as the ""starting  point"" for ""an appropriate sentence for the crime  committed,"" the defendant bears a ""particularly heavy burden"" when the trial court imposes  the advisory sentence. Fernbach v. State, 954 N.E.2d 1080, 1089 (Ind. Ct. App.  2011), trans. denied. [8] Here, the trial court sentenced Greene to three years  for Level 5 felony failure to register as a sex offender,  enhanced by three years for being a habitual  offender. [*5]  See I.C. § 35-50-2-6(b) (2014) (providing  for a sentence of one to six years for a Level 5 felony,  with a three-year advisory sentence); see also I.C. § 35- 50-2-8(i)(2) (2017) (providing for an additional sentence  of two to six years for a habitual offender convicted of a  Level 5 felony). Thus, Greene received the advisory  term for his Level 5 felony offense. And Greene's  habitual offender enhancement was toward the bottom  of the applicable range. Therefore, Greene bears a  ""particularly heavy burden"" to show his sentence  warrants 7(B) revision. See Fernbach, 954 N.E.2d at  1089. [9] Beginning with the nature of Greene's offense, we  note this is Greene's sixth conviction for failing to  register as a sex offender. See Appellant's App. Vol. 2  at 49-52. Thus, Greene has demonstrated a continuous  disregard for his legal obligation to register. As such, the  nature of Greene's offense weighs against revision. 3 3 Greene argues he was homeless at the time of his  conduct underlying this offense, and thus unable to  register a home address. See Appellant's Br. at 13. But  the record reveals otherwise. See Appellant's App. Vol.  2 at 38-39 (indicating the charges underlying this case  were based upon Greene failing to register his change  of address while living on Maple [*6]  Avenue in Terre  Haute, Indiana for a period of about three weeks).  Nonetheless, Indiana Code Section 11-8-8-12 requires  a sex offender who resides in a temporary residence or  who does not have a principal or temporary residence to  register or report with the local law enforcement  authority. [10] As to Greene's character, his criminal history is  significant. See Smoots v. State, 172 N.E.3d 1279, 1290  (Ind. Ct. App. 2021) (explaining a defendant's criminal  history is one relevant factor in analyzing character). In  addition to his previous five felony convictions for failure  to register as a sex offender, Greene has convictions for  Class C child molesting, misdemeanor reckless driving,  Page 3 of 3 and misdemeanor disorderly conduct. And Greene has  violated the terms of his probation on at least six  separate occasions. Although Greene's guilty plea  saved the State the expense of trial, it also benefited  Greene in the form of a dismissal of his Level 6 felony  failure to register charge and a sentence capped at six  years. And to the extent Greene contends his mental  health issues favor revision, the trial court considered  his struggles a ""significant mitigating factor."" Tr. Vol. 2 at  58. But the trial court determined the aggravating factors  outweighed the mitigating factors and warranted [*7]   the imposed sentence. As the trial court explained:  ""Greene's continuous inability to follow the law and to  follow the requirements of probation, give this court no  assurance or faith that Mr. Greene can be successful in  any sentence that would not be executed fully in the  Department of Corrections."" Id. at 58-59. Put simply,  Greene's repeated inability to abide by the laws and  rules placed upon him reflect poorly on his character  and weigh against 7(B) revision. Conclusion [11] Greene's six-year aggregate sentence is not  inappropriate in light of the nature of his offense and his  character. His sentence therefore does not warrant 7(B)  revision. Accordingly, we affirm. [12] Affirmed. Bailey, J., and Tavitas, J., concur.",0
"Hertzfeld v. Hertzfeld, 2023-Ohio-4411","[*1] JUDGMENT: AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED  IN PART, AND REMANDED RELEASED AND JOURNALIZED: December 7, 2023 Civil Appeal from the Cuyahoga County Court of  Common Pleas Domestic Relations Division Case No. DR-20-381506 Appearances: Paul M. Friedman, for appellee. McCarthy Lebit Crystal & Liffman Co., LPA, Richard A. Rabb, and Rebekah A. Cline, for appellant. EILEEN T. GALLAGHER, J.:  Defendant-appellant, Robert Hertzfeld, Jr. (""Husband""),  appeals from the judgment entry of divorce issued by the Cuyahoga  County Common Pleas Court, Division of Domestic Relations. He raises the following  assignments of error for review: 1. The trial court erred and abused its discretion in  failing to award husband his one-half share of the  marital residence and thereby dividing marital property  unequally without reference to the factors in R.C.  3105.171. 2. The trial court erred and abused its discretion in its  allocation of wife's student loans. 3. The trial court erred and abused its discretion by  failing to make a finding as to either party's income for  support purposes. 4. The trial court erred and abused its discretion by  imputing income to Husband. 5. The trial court erred and abused its discretion in its  calculation of Wife's income. [*2]  6. The trial court abused its discretion in determining the  amount of spousal support and making it non- modifiable. 7. The trial court erred and abused its discretion in its  determination of child support.  After careful review of the record and relevant case law,  we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further  proceedings consistent with this opinion. Page 2 of 14 I. Factual and Procedural History  Husband and plaintiff-appellee, Zsuzsanna Hertzfeld  (""Wife""), were married on August 27, 2002. Two children  were born of the marriage, I.H. (d.o.b. 03/02/2010) and  Z.H. (d.o.b. 04/04/2013). On May 28, 2020, the parties  separated. On June 15, 2020, Wife filed for divorce. On  July 1, 2020, Husband answered and counterclaimed.  The matter proceeded to trial in March 2022, where the  following facts were adduced.  When the parties were married in 2002, Wife was  employed as a waitress. Subsequently, Wife began  attending Cuyahoga Community College, and earned an  associate degree in nursing in 2008. Upon obtaining her  associate degree, Wife began working as a registered  nurse at the Cleveland Clinic. Wife continued her  education and obtained a bachelor's degree in nursing.  In the summer of 2016, Wife left [*3]  her nursing  position to pursue a master's degree in nursing on a full- time basis. Wife remained unemployed while she  attended the master's program pursuant to the  requirements of the program. Following her graduation  in 2019, Wife obtained a nurse anesthetist position with  the Cleveland Clinic in March 2020. Wife took out  student loans while working on her associate and  master's degrees that she subsequently consolidated.  At the time of trial, the outstanding balance of the  student loans was $159,802.18. (Joint exhibit No. 2.)  The parties stipulated that a portion of the student loans,  or $98,448, was used to pay for various marital  expenses while Wife was enrolled in graduate school.  (Tr. vol. II at 28-29; plaintiff's exhibit No. 10.)  Wife confirmed that her starting salary with the  Cleveland Clinic in 2020 was $157,000 annually. (Tr.  vol. II at 135.) Because Wife started her position in the  middle of the year, her tax documents reflect that she  earned $108,682.33 in 2020, and $153,057.81 in 2021. (Plaintiff's exhibit No.  16.) Husband, however, introduced Wife's final paystub  from 2021, which reflected that her year-to-date ""gross pay"" was $158,964.69. (Defendant's exhibit Y.)  Wife's [*4]  latest pay stub, dated February 28, 2022, indicated that her year-to-date  earnings was $28,068.32. (Tr. vol. IV at 31; Defendant's  exhibit AA.)  Prior to the parties' marriage, Husband attended John  Carroll University for approximately three years, but did not  complete his degree. He later continued his education  while married to Wife, and earned his bachelor's degree  in communications from Cleveland State University in  2007.  In 2000, Husband gained employment at Swagelok  Corporation, where he worked for approximately 20  years. In his most recent role with the corporation,  Husband served as a ""business-process analyst"" and  was responsible for monitoring the distribution of  inventory. The record reflects that in 2017, Husband  earned $66,739.16; in 2018 he earned $74,519.96; in  2019 he earned $69,780.04; and in the ""first six months  of 202o"" he earned $39,736.80. (Tr. vol. II at 19-21.;  plaintiff's exhibit Nos. 4-5.) Husband clarified, however,  that his listed salary for the year 2020 was $72,779.16.  (Tr. vol. IV at 73.; defendant's exhibit E.)  In May 2020, Wife discovered pornography on  Husband's computer and reported it to the police.  Husband was arrested and indicted for pandering  sexually [*5]  oriented material involving a minor and  possession of criminal tools. During the pendency of the  criminal proceedings, Husband borrowed money from  his father in the amount of $107,737.00 to cover the  costs of living and attorney fees. (Tr. vol IV at 71;  defendant's exhibit FF.) In June 2021, Husband was  convicted of two counts of pandering sexually oriented material  involving a minor in violation of R.C. 2907.322. In  addition, Husband was classified as a Tier II sex  offender.  The parties separated on May 28, 2020, the day of  Husband's arrest. Husband was placed on unpaid administrative leave by  his employer in June 2020, the same month that Wife  filed for divorce. In June 2021, Husband was terminated  by Swagelok due to his criminal convictions. Husband is  currently employed by AML RightSource and earns  approximately $52,000 annually. (Tr. vol. II at 21.)  Mark Anderson, a professional licensed counsellor and  board-certified vocational expert, testified on behalf of  Wife. In relevant part, Anderson was asked to determine  Husband's earning capacity based upon his age,  education, and work experience. (Tr. vol. I at 86.) He  researched comparable jobs available in Northeast Ohio  and determined that someone [*6]  who held Husband's  position with Swagelok at the time he was fired should  earn an annual salary of $81,444.00 locally, and  Page 3 of 14 $93,030.00 nationally. (Tr. vol. I at 93.) Anderson  confirmed that Husband's current salary is $52,000.00.  (Tr. vol. I at 98.) He estimated, however, that had  Husband remained employed at Swagelok, he would be  earning $79,472.00. (Tr. vol. I at 113.) Thus, Anderson  opined to a reasonable degree of vocational certainty  that Husband is ""absolutely"" underemployed. (Tr. vol. I  at 98.)  Approximately three years into their marriage, the  parties purchased a home located in University Heights,  Ohio. The marital property is encumbered by a  mortgage  that  had  an  outstanding  balance  of  $113,450.26 as of February 16, 2022. (Joint exhibit No. 2.) The total appraised value of the  marital property is $137,600. (Tr. vol. II at 156.)  At the time of trial, both children were attending school.  In June 2021, Wife hired an au pair to serve as a nanny  for the children while she was at work. Wife conceded  that the annual cost to employ the au pair is  approximately $20,000. (Tr. vol II at 191.)  On June 14, 2022, the trial court issued a written  judgment, granting the parties a divorce. [*7]  Relevant  to this appeal, the trial court (1) determined that the ""equitable de facto termination date of the marriage"" is  May 28, 2020, (2) awarded Wife exclusive ownership and possession of the parties'  marital home, (3) ordered Wife to pay Husband $12,223.46 for marital debts  associated with the parties' 2020 tax returns and Wife's  transfer of money from a joint bank account, (4)  determined that $98,484 of Wife's student loan balance  is marital debt, (5) determined that Husband is  exclusively responsible for the seven promissory notes  issued to his father after the de facto termination date,  (6) divided the parties' retirement assets equally, (7)  denied Husband's request for attorney fees and litigation  expenses, (8) determined that ""spousal support is  neither appropriate nor reasonable,"" (9) designated Wife  as the residential parent for the children, and (10)  ordered Husband to pay ""$965.74 per month ($482.87  per month per child) as child support plus $20.35 per  month ($10.17 per month per child) as cash medical  support, for a total of $986.07 per month.""  Husband now appeals from the trial court's judgment. II. Law and Analysis Standard of review  The Ohio Supreme Court has long recognized [*8]  that  a trial court must have discretion to do what is equitable  upon the facts and circumstances of each divorce case.  Booth v. Booth, 44 Ohio St.3d 142, 144, 541 N.E.2d  1028 (1989). For that reason, when reviewing a trial  court's determination in a domestic-relations case, an  appellate court generally applies an abuse of discretion  standard. Holcomb v. Holcomb, 44 Ohio St.3d 128, 130, 541  N.E.2d 597 (1989).  ""A court abuses its discretion when a legal rule entrusts  a decision to a judge's discretion and the judge's  exercise of that discretion is outside of the legally  permissible range of choices."" State v. Hackett, 164  Ohio St.3d 74, 2020-Ohio-6699, 172 N.E.3d 75, ¶ 19.  See also Johnson v. Abdullah, 166 Ohio St.3d 427,  2021-Ohio-3304, 187 N.E.3d 463, ¶ 39 (""[C]ourts lack  the discretion to make errors of law, particularly when  the trial court's decision goes against the plain language  of a statute or rule."").  There is no abuse of discretion where the record  contains competent, credible evidence to support the  trial court's decision. Trolli v. Trolli, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga  No. 101980, 2015-Ohio-4487, ¶ 29, citing Kapadia v.  Kapadia, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94456, 2011-Ohio- 2255, ¶ 24. Under this deferential standard, we may not  freely substitute our judgment for that of the trial court.  Feldman v.Feldman, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 92015,  2009-Ohio-4202, ¶ 12, citing Soulsby v. Soulsby, 4th  Dist. Meigs No. 07CA1, 2008-Ohio-1019. A. Marital Home  In the first assignment of error, Husband argues the  trial court erred and abused its discretion by failing to  award him a one-half share of the equity in the parties'  marital home. He contends that the trial court's decision  to award Wife exclusive ownership of the marital home  constitutes [*9]  ""an unjustified punishment * * * as it is grossly inequitable and not supported by the  facts and circumstances of the case."" In contrast, Wife  asserts that the trial court's division of the parties'  marital assets, including the allocation of the marital  home, was equitable.  In divorce proceedings, the trial court is required to  determine what constitutes marital property and what  constitutes  separate  property.  R.C.  3105.171(B).  Page 4 of 14 Property acquired during a marriage is generally  presumed to be marital property, unless it can be shown  to be separate. Victor v. Kaplan, 2020-Ohio-3116, 155  N.E.3d 110, ¶ 33 (8th Dist.), citing Johnson v. Mills, 8th  Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102241, 2015-Ohio-4273, ¶ 18. The  party seeking to have certain property classified as  ""separate property"" has the burden of proof, by a  preponderance of the evidence, in tracing the separate  property. Strauss v. Strauss, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.  95377, 2011-Ohio-3831, ¶ 49, citing Peck v. Peck, 96  Ohio App.3d 731, 734, 645 N.E.2d 1300 (12th  Dist.1994).  Marital property includes, in relevant part: (i) All real and personal property that currently is owned  by either or both of the spouses, including, but not  limited to, the retirement benefits of the spouses, and  that was acquired by either or both of the spouses  during the marriage; (ii) All interest that either or both of the spouses  currently has in any real or personal property, including,  but not limited to, the retirement benefits of the spouses,  and that was acquired [*10]  by either or both of the  spouses during the marriage; (iii) Except as otherwise provided in this section, all  income and appreciation on separate property, due to  the labor, monetary, or in-kind contribution of either or  both of the spouses that occurred during the marriage *  * *. R.C. 3105.171(A)(3)(a)(i)-(iii). Marital property does not,  however,  include  separate  property.  R.C.  3105.171(A)(3)(b).  Relevant to this appeal, it is well established that the  increased equity in a marital home during a marriage is  appropriately treated as marital property. See, e.g., Hornbeck v. Hornbeck, 2019-Ohio-2035, 136  N.E.3d 966, ¶ 63 (2d Dist.); Wright v. Cramer, 2018-Ohio-764, 107 N.E.3d 836, ¶ 15  (2d Dist.); Spicer v. Spicer, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA95- 06-115, 1996 Ohio App. LEXIS 1733, *2 (Apr. 29, 1996); Goebel v. Werling, 9th Dist. Summit No. 19385, 1999  Ohio App. LEXIS 3443, *1 (July 28, 1999) (""reduction in  a mortgage during a marriage is equivalent to a marital  investment and is considered part of the marital equity"");  Scott v. Scott, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2007-T-0059,  2008-Ohio-530, ¶ 21.  Once the characterization of property is made, the trial  court must divide the marital and separate property  equitably between the spouses, in accordance with R.C.  3105.171(B). Generally, marital property shall be  divided equally, unless an equal division would be  inequitable, in which case the property shall be divided  in the manner the trial court determines equitable. R.C. 3105.171(C)(1). When dividing marital property, the  court shall consider various factors, including: (1) The duration of the marriage; (2) The assets and liabilities of the spouses; (3) The desirability of [*11]  awarding the family home,  or the right to reside in the family home for reasonable  periods of time, to the spouse with custody of the  children of the marriage; (4) The liquidity of the property to be distributed; (5) The economic desirability of retaining intact an asset  or an interest in an asset; (6) The tax consequences of the property division upon  the respective awards to be made to each spouse; (7) The costs of sale, if it is necessary that an asset be  sold to effectuate an equitable distribution of property; (8) Any division or disbursement of property made in a  separation agreement that was voluntarily entered into  by the spouses; (9) Any retirement benefits of the spouses, excluding  the social security benefits of a spouse except as may  be relevant for purposes of dividing a public pension; (10) Any other factor that the court expressly finds to be  relevant and equitable. R.C. 3105.171(F).  The determination of whether property is marital or  separate is a mixed question of law and fact that will not  be reversed unless it is against the manifest weight of  the evidence. Kobal v. Kobal, 2018-Ohio-1755, 111  N.E.3d 804, ¶ 27 (8th Dist.). Once the characterization  of the property is made, the reviewing court will not  disturb the trial court's distribution of the property [*12]   absent an abuse of discretion. Id.; Williams v. Williams, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga  Page 5 of 14 No. 95346, 2011-Ohio-939, ¶ 8.  In this case, there is no dispute that the equity in the  marital  home  constitutes  marital  property  as  contemplated under R.C. 3105.171(A)(3)(a). The parties  purchased the marital home during their marriage and  jointly owned the property, which was encumbered by a  mortgage with a balance of $113,450.26 as of February  16, 2022. (Joint exhibit No. 1.) Based on the certified  copy of the county property information report from the  Cuyahoga County Auditor's Office introduced into  evidence during Wife's testimony, the listed residential  value is $137,600. (Tr. vol. II at 156.) Thus, as set forth  in the parties' joint exhibit No. 2, the equity in the marital  home was approximately $24,149.74, as of February  16, 2022. Divided equally, Husband's alleged interest in  the home's equity would amount to $12,074.87.  Regarding the division of property, the record reflects  that the trial court attempted to effectuate an equal  division of all marital property. Specifically, the trial court  expressed at the conclusion of the ""Division of Property""  section of the divorce decree that ""the above discussion  constitutes an equal division of the property."" (Emphasis  added.) There is no indication [*13]  that the court  believed that an equal division of marital property would  be inequitable under the circumstances presented in  this case. Rather, it is clear the court believed that  awarding Wife exclusive ownership of the property  constituted an equal division of the property. In reaching this conclusion, the court briefly noted that  Wife had been allocated the ""majority of the marital debt in regard to her assumption  of the mortgage.""  After careful consideration, we find the trial court  abused its discretion by failing to award Husband an  equal share of the equity in the parties' marital home.  Upon consideration of the factors listed under R.C.  3105.171(F), we find the record is devoid of credible  evidence to conclude that it would be inequitable to  apply the presumption of an equal division of the marital  home. There was, for instance, no testimony or  documentary evidence to suggest that awarding  Husband a share of the equity in the marital home  would result in unfavorable costs or tax consequences.  Furthermore, Wife's decision to remain in the home and,  therefore, assume the remaining balance of the  mortgage was premised on her own desires to retain  possession of the home for the sake of her  children. [*14]  Wife's resistance to Husband's repeated  requests for the court to order the sale of the home is  understandable. However, it was improper for the trial  court to characterize Wife's assumption of the mortgage  as an allocation of a marital debt for the purposes of  awarding her the entire equity in the home.  Here, an equal division of marital property would entitle  Husband to one-half of the equity in the marital home as  of February 16, 2022, minus the value of the mortgage  payments made by Wife since the de facto termination  date of May 28, 2020. Because the terms of the divorce  decree required Wife to individually ""assume the mortgage of the real property,"" Husband is  not entitled to any equity created by Wife's mortgage  payments following the termination of the parties' marriage because such payments related to what is now  considered Wife's personal debt.  Because nearly 21 months passed between the de  facto termination date and the date used to establish the  outstanding balance of the mortgage at trial, it is  probable that Husband's interest in the home's equity is  substantially less than the amount he asserts on appeal.  In this regard, we recognize that consideration of Wife's mortgage [*15]  payments since May 28, 2020,  may have contributed to the trial court's determination  that awarding Wife the full equity in the marital home  constituted an equal division of marital property.  However, in the absence of clear and convincing  evidence establishing the amount of equity Wife's  individual mortgage payments have created in the  marital residence since the termination of the marriage,  we find it necessary to remand this matter for the trial  court to (1) declare the market value of the home as of  June 14, 2022,1 (2) determine the value of the equity in  the property as of May 28, 2020, and (3) to award  Husband an equal share of this equity, if such equity  exists.  The first assignment of error is sustained. B. Wife's Student Loan Debt  In the second assignment of error, Husband argues the  trial court erred and abused its discretion in its allocation  of Wife's student loans. 1 As a practical matter, the trial court must place a value  on each contested item of property in order to divide the  property equitably. Pawlowski v. Pawlowski, 83 Ohio  App.3d 794, 799, 615 N.E.2d 1071 (10th Dist.1992).  As with the division of marital property, this court  Page 6 of 14 reviews the trial court's division of marital debt under an  abuse of discretion standard. Trolli, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga  No. 101980, 2015-Ohio-4487, at ¶ 31, citing Banjoko v.  Banjoko, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25406, 2013-Ohio- 2566, ¶ 18. ""'Marital debt has [*16]  been defined as any  debt incurred during the marriage for the joint benefit of  the parties or for a valid marital purpose.'"" Id. at ¶ 32,  quoting Lucas v. Lucas, 7th Dist. Noble No. 11No382,  2011-Ohio-6411, ¶ 33. As such, debts incurred during  the marriage are generally presumed to be marital  unless it can be proved they are separate. Vergitz v. Vergitz, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 05 JE 52,  2007-Ohio-1395, ¶ 12. The party seeking to establish  that the debt is separate rather than marital must  establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that  such debt was the separate obligation of the other  spouse. Walpole v. Walpole, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.  99231, 2013-Ohio-3529, ¶ 110.  With respect to student loan obligations, ""[t]he  determinative factor is whether the loan was incurred  during the marriage."" Kehoe v. Kehoe, 2012-Ohio-3357,  974 N.E.2d 1229, ¶ 14 (8th Dist.), citing Nemeth v.  Nemeth, 11th Dist. Geauga No. 2007-G-2791, 2008- Ohio-3263. See also Shoenfelt v. Shoenfelt, 3d Dist.  Shelby No. 17-14-13, 2015-Ohio-225, ¶ 55 (""Student  loans obtained by one spouse during the marriage may  be categorized as marital debt subject to equal  distribution.""), citing Harris v. Harris, 5th Dist. Licking  No. 2006-CA-00003, 2007-Ohio-1232, ¶ 34; Webb v.  Webb, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA97-09-167, 1998 Ohio  App. LEXIS 5615, *4 (Nov. 30, 1998).  Nevertheless, even if student loans are deemed marital  debt, the debt may properly be allocated to the party  who incurs the debt. Webb at *4. Courts have  considered different factors when determining the  allocation of student loan debt. Such factors include  when the income generated by the degree was realized;  whether the spouse undertaking the degree was not  working while obtaining the degree, thus, depriving the  family of additional income; and whether the [*17]   student loans were used to pay for family expenses. Id.  at *4-5.  In this case, Wife was questioned at length about the  student loans she used to finance her continued  education during the marriage. Wife estimated that she  took out approximately $180,000 in student loans while  obtaining her associate and master's degrees. Of that  total amount, approximately $98,484 was deposited into  the parties' joint checking account and used for  household expenses from the summer of 2017 through  2019. Wife explained that the parties were forced to use  a substantial portion of the loans to pay for household  expenses because the master's program did not permit  students to gain employment while completing the  program. The parties stipulated that the student loan  balance was $159,802.18 as of January 27, 2022.  Based on the foregoing evidence, the trial court  concluded that the loans deposited into the parties' joint  bank account during the marriage constituted marital  debt. The remaining balance was declared Wife's  separate debt. The court summarized its judgment as  follows: The court finds that $98,484 of the student loan was  deposited into the parties' joint checking account. That  portion of the loan [*18]  is marital. The outstanding  balance minus ($61,318.18) is [Wife's] separate debt  because the income generated by Plaintiffs degree was  realized after the de facto termination date. * * * It is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed that  [Husband] shall pay and hold [Wife] harmless on the  following marital debts: * * *one half of the marital  portion ($49,242) of the Earnest Student loan debt used  to pay for household expenses.  On appeal, Husband argues the trial court committed  reversible error by failing to conclude that Wife is solely responsible for  her student loan debt. He contends  that  the  courts  judgment  created  an  inequitable windfall to Wife where (1) the benefit of Wife's degree was not realized until after  the divorce, (2) Wife did not work while obtaining her degree ""thereby depriving the  family of additional income,"" and (3) approximately $20,000 of marital funds  were paid towards the outstanding balance of the loans during the marriage.  Alternatively, Husband argues the trial court's decision to demand that Husband  make a lump sum distributive payment of the student loan amount though  Wife made monthly Page 7 of 14 payments was arbitrary, punitive, and inequitable.  Viewing the trial court's [*19]  allocation of marital  property and debts collectively, we are unable to conclude that the trial  court arbitrarily required Husband to share in the marital debt associated with the  loans used to pay for household expenses during the marriage. Contrary to  Husband's assertion on appeal, ""[t]he notion that the degree-earning spouse is  the sole beneficiary of the earned degree, and hence should shoulder all of the  student-loan debt"" is ""inherently flawed."" See Polacheck v. Polacheck, 2013-Ohio-5788,  5 N.E.3d 1088, ¶ 28 (9th Dist.). In this case, extensive  evidence was introduced at trial relating to the student  loan debt, including Wife's period of unemployment  during the completion of the master's program, Wife's  substantially increased income since the de facto  termination date, the outstanding balance of the loan,  and the parties' stipulation to the amount of the loan  used for marital expenses. In this regard, there can be  no dispute that the portion of the student loans used to  pay for household costs during the marriage served a  valid marital purpose that benefited both parties equally.  Balancing the foregoing factors in totality, we find  competent, credible evidence supports the trial court's  decision to divide the marital debt equally. Accordingly,  we find [*20]  no abuse of discretion in this instance.  Trolli, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101980, 2015-Ohio-4487,  at ¶ 29, citing Kapadia, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94456,  2011-Ohio-2255, at ¶ 24. See also Polacheck at ¶ 30  (Noting that ""it is inequitable to require the spouse  earning a degree toward the end of the marriage to  shoulder the entire burden of the debt simply because  debt was incurred toward the end of the marriage."").  We agree, however, that the divorce decree is silent on  the time frame in which Husband must pay half of the  $98,484 marital debt to Wife. This is in stark contrast to  the specific time parameters used to dictate payment  schedules in other portions of the divorce decree.  Although trial courts have broad discretion in dividing  marital property in a manner the court determines  equitable, we decline to speculate that the court  intended to effectuate a lump-sum payment to Wife in  the amount of $42,242. We, therefore, remand this matter  for the trial court to set forth the time parameters for  payment in sufficient detail so as to enable a reviewing  court to determine whether the award is equitable and  fair according to law. See Johnsonv. Johnson, 2d Dist.  Greene No. 2018-CA-36, 2019-Ohio-1024, ¶ 31 (""[T]he  trial court must provide sufficient detail about its  property division."").  The second assignment of error is overruled in part,  sustained in part. C. Designation and Calculation [*21]  of Income  In the third assignment of error, Husband argues the  trial court erred and abused its discretion ""by failing to  make a finding as to either party's income for support  purposes."" Husband contends that because the trial  court failed to explain how it arrived at an income that  exceeds the amount he is currently earning, it is clear  the court ""made certain assumptions which are neither  in the record nor contained in the judgment entry.""  In the fifth assignment of error, Husband argues the  trial court erred and abused its discretion in its  calculation of Wife's income. Husband contends that the  trial court's calculation of Wife's income as $158,964.69  ""is an understatement of [her] income which is against  the manifest weight of the evidence and is not contained  anywhere in the record."" Because the third and fifth  assignments of error concern related issues of  procedure and fact, we address them together for the  ease of discussion.  Husband correctly states that when calculating child  support, the trial court must first determine the annual  income of each parent, including the gross and potential income of a parent the court determines to  be voluntarily unemployed or underemployed. [*22]   See R.C. 3119.01(C)(10)(a)-(b). The spousal support  statute similarly requires the trial court to ""consider"" the  parties' actual income and their respective earning  abilities. R.C. 3105.18(C)(1)(a)-(b).  Firstly, we find no merit to Husband's suggestion that  the divorce decree failed to designate the parties'  income for the purposes of calculating the applicable  support obligations. In this case, the divorce decree  expressly  incorporated  the  income  computations  contained in the attached child-support worksheet by  reference. (Divorce decree at pg. 13.) (""The worksheet  used to compute child support and cash medical  support under Ohio Revised Code 3119.022 or  Page 8 of 14 3119.023 is attached hereto as Exhibit B."") The  attached worksheet, marked as exhibit B, designates  Husband's ""Annual Gross Income"" as $72,779.19. This  income figure directly correlates to the documentary  evidence introduced at trial, including a copy of an  internal document from Swagelok, titled ""Associate  Performance and Rewards,"" which demonstrated that, but for Husband's  termination following his criminal conviction, his gross  salary for the year 2020 was set to be $72,779.16. (Defendant's exhibit E.) The court did not guess or  otherwise make certain assumptions in calculating  Husband's  gross  income.  Rather,  it [*23]   relied  exclusively on the documentary evidence introduced by  Husband at trial.  Similarly, the child-support worksheet incorporated into  the divorce decree expressly designated Wife's ""Annual  Gross Income"" as $158,964.69. Again, this is not the  case where the child support orders and calculations  are based on the lack of documentary evidence. See In re K.R.B., 2017- Ohio-7071, 95 N.E.3d 799, ¶ 26 (8th Dist.) (finding an  abuse of discretion because ""[t]he child support  worksheet * * * [does] not indicate upon what  information the figures listed in the worksheet were  based""). Rather, the income reflected in the child  support worksheet for Wife specifically derived from  documentary evidence introduced at trial, namely a  copy of Wife's final paystub for the year 2021. See R.C.  3119.05(A) (""The parents' current and past income and personal  earnings shall be verified by electronic means or with  suitable documents, including, but not limited to,  paystubs * * *[.]""). This document, marked Defendant's exhibit Y,  reflects that Wife's year-to-date ""gross pay"" for 2021  totaled $158,964.69.  Next, to the extent Husband challenges the court's  calculation of Wife's income, this court has explained  that while ""'""the standard of review for a trial court's  support determination is [*24]  abuse of discretion,  challenges to factual determinations upon which the  support order is based are reviewed using the 'some  competent credible evidence' standard.""'"" Jajola v.  Jajola, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 83141, 2004-Ohio-370, ¶  8, quoting Bender v. Bender, 9th Dist. Summit No.  20157, 2001 Ohio App. LEXIS 3212, *9 (July 18, 2001).  Thus, ""because a determination of gross income for  support purposes is a factual finding, we must review  the trial court's decision to determine whether it is  supported by competent, credible evidence."" Trolli, 8th  Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101980, 2015-Ohio-4487, ¶ 45,  citing Jajola at ¶ 8, and Fallang v. Fallang, 109 Ohio App.3d  543, 548, 672 N.E.2d 730 (12th Dist.1996). In  performing this review, we note that ""[a]s trier of fact, the  trial court [is] in the best position to weigh the evidence and  assign appropriate credibility."" Onyshko v. Onyshko,  11th Dist. Portage No. 2008-P-0035, 2010-Ohio-969, ¶  88.  The calculation of the parties' gross incomes in this  case presented unique obstacles given the implications  of Husband's felony conviction and Wife's substantial  increase in annual income upon obtaining employment  as a nurse anesthetist just months before the de facto  date of termination of the marriage. Throughout the trial, Wife maintained that ""in light of her  contractual salary of $157,000, and her 2021 W-2 for  the year 2021 ($153,057.81), there is no reason to  believe and certainly no preponderance of evidence to  show that her income for the year 2022 will exceed  $157,000."" (Plaintiff's closing brief, pg. 13-14.) In  contrast, [*25]  Husband argued that Wife's paystubs more accurately  reflected that her current income is $168,409.92 based  on the amount she earned during the first two months of  2022. (Defendant's exhibit AA.)  After careful consideration, we find the trial court's use  of Wife's gross income from 2021 in the amount of  $158,964.69  was  reasonable  and  supported  by  competent and credible evidence. Here, it is undisputed  that Wife began her employment in the middle of 2020.  Thus, 2021 was the only year Wife earned a full, annual  income before the trial commenced in March 2022.  While the documentary evidence presented at trial  demonstrated that Wife earned bonuses and overtime  pay in excess of her stated base salary of $157,000, it is  evident that these amounts are inconsistent from  paycheck to paycheck. It was, therefore, reasonable for  the court to rely exclusively on Wife's ""gross pay"" for the  year 2021, which included her total overtime and bonus  earnings for that year, rather than to speculate about Page 9 of 14 Wife's potential gross income for the year 2022 based  on the amount she earned during the first two months of  that stated year.  Whether the trial court erred in imputing Husband's  preconviction income for [*26]  the purposes of support  is a separate issue that will be addressed in further  detail below. However, viewing the divorce decree and  the evidence introduced at trial collectively, we are  unable to conclude that the trial court failed to make  findings as to the parties' incomes. We further find the  trial court's calculation of Wife's gross income is  supported by competent, credible evidence.  The third and fifth assignments of error are overruled. D. Husband's Income Calculation  In this fourth assignment of error, Husband argues the  trial court erred and abused its discretion by imputing  income to him in the amount of $72,779.16. Husband  contends that the documentary evidence introduced at  trial established that he currently earns an annual salary  of $52,000, and ""the reality is that the opportunity to  earn what he was once making before simply does not  exist, and to impute such income to [him] for support  purposes is an abuse of discretion.""

As previously mentioned, the trial court is required to  determine the parents' annual income for the purposes  of calculating child support. Sweeney v.Sweeney, 2019- Ohio-1750, 135 N.E.3d 1189, ¶ 24 (1st Dist.). R.C.  3119.01 defines ""income"" as either (1) the gross income of a parent  employed to full capacity, or (2) the sum of the gross income of the parent and any  potential income of an unemployed or underemployed  parent. R.C. 3119.01(C)(10)(a)-(b). See Yenni v.Yenni,  8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 111058, 2022-Ohio-2867, ¶ 26,  citing N.W., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 107503, 2019-Ohio- 1775, at ¶ 29. (""Pursuant to R.C. 3119.01(C)([10])(b) and 3119.01(C)([18]), the trial court  is permitted to impute potential income to a parent who  is voluntarily unemployed or voluntarily underemployed for the purpose of determining the  parent's child support obligation."").  To determine the potential income for a parent who the  court finds is voluntarily [*28]  unemployed or voluntarily  underemployed, the trial court must consider the  following criteria: (i) The parent's prior employment experience; (ii) The parent's education; (iii) The parent's physical and mental disabilities, if any; (iv) The availability of employment in the geographic  area in which the parent resides; (v) The prevailing wage and salary levels in the  geographic area in which the parent resides; (vi) The parent's special skills and training; (vii) Whether there is evidence that the parent has the  ability to earn the imputed income; (viii) The age and special needs of the child for whom  child support is being calculated under this section; (ix) The parent's increased earning capacity because of  experience; (x) The parent's decreased earning capacity because of  a felony conviction; Page 10 of 14 (xi) Any other relevant factor.

First, the trial court must  determine whether the parent is voluntarily unemployed  or underemployed. In re M.C.M., 2018-Ohio-1307, 110 N.E.3d 694, ¶ 22  (8th Dist.). Once the court makes such a finding, the  court must then determine the amount of income to  impute, based upon the factors in R.C. 3119.01(C)(18).  Id. at ¶ 23. See also Misrav. Mishra, 2018-Ohio-5139,  126 N.E.3d 367, ¶ 17 (10th Dist.).

Thus, a trial court's decision to impute income  will be overturned only upon a showing of an abuse of  discretion. Rock at 112.  Preliminarily, we find no merit to Husband's assertion  that the court erred by failing to make express  ""references to the factors set forth in R.C. 3119.01(C)([18])."" In this case, the trial court found  that Husband was voluntarily underemployed for  support purposes. Viewed in its entirety, the divorce  decree reflects that the court's judgment relied on  various  factors  contemplated  under  R.C.  3119.01(C)(18),  including  Husband's  employment  history, his education and training level, his lack of  physical, mental, or emotional condition, and his  decreased earning potential due to his criminal  conviction. Given these relevant considerations, we can  discern from the record that the court complied with the  procedural requirements of R.C. 3119.01(C)(18). See  A.L.D. v. L.N.S., 2d Dist. Clark No. 2021-CA-49, 2022-Ohio-959, ¶ 19 (""[A]n express  determination  as  to  every  factor  under  R.C.  3119.01(C)([18]) is not required[.]"").  Turning to the first step of the process for imputing  income, we find the trial court properly determined that  Husband  is [*30]   voluntarily  underemployed  as  contemplated under R.C. 3119.01. In this case, the  evidence introduced at trial established that Husband  was terminated from his position at Swagelok based on  his criminal conviction for pandering sexually oriented  material involving a minor. (Tr. vol. I at 50.) Although  Husband's annual income was substantially diminished  following  his  termination,  courts  have  routinely  recognized that ""misbehavior that results in the  termination of employment is a voluntary act that allows  a trial court to find a party voluntarily unemployed or  underemployed."" Todd v. Todd, 12th Dist. Butler Nos.  CA2022-12-115 and CA2023-03-02, 2023-Ohio-3677, ¶  12. See alsoHurley v. Austin, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.  99992, 2013-Ohio-5592, ¶ 16, citing Drucker v. Drucker, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 76139,  2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 2471 (June 8, 2000); Groves v.  Groves, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2008-06-059, 2009- Ohio-931 (recognizing that a criminal conviction is a  voluntary act that should not relieve individuals of their  child-support obligations). Under these circumstances,  we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision  finding Husband was voluntarily underemployed.  Turning to the second step of the analysis, however, we  find the record lacks competent and credible evidence  supporting  the  trial  court's  decision  to  impute  $72,779.16 in potential income to Husband, the same  amount he was set to make while working as a business-process analyst for  Swagelok in 2020. Although the record indicates that  Husband is [*31]  well educated and trained in the area  of inventory distribution, his convictions and status as a  Tier II sex offender have rendered his ability to earn the  imputed  income  highly  unlikely.  See  Courtney  v.Courtney, 12th Dist. Warren Nos. CA2013-09-087 and  CA2013-10-096, 2014-Ohio-4281, ¶ 15 (finding the  court erred by imputing the husband's former income  where his ""earning capacity is greatly reduced due to his  felony conviction for aggravated theft""). Although Wife  presented expert testimony at trial indicating that a  person with Husband's education and employment  history should be earning $81,444 locally, the evidence  failed to demonstrate that the prevailing wages and  availability of employment for a person with Husband's  qualifications would equally apply to a person with a  criminal conviction for pandering sexually oriented  material involving a minor. Under the narrow and  specific circumstances of this case, imputing the same  amount of income to Husband that he earned in 2020 is  not reasonable and amounts to an abuse of discretion.  In the interests of equity, we remand this matter for the  trial court to impute an income that more accurately  Page 11 of 14 reflects Husband's full earning potential as a convicted  felon. Our judgment is not intended to diminish Husband's criminal conduct but [*32]  is necessary to  avoid future conflicts between the parties, thereby  protecting the best interests of the children.  The fourth assignment of error is sustained in part,  overruled in part. E. Spousal-Support Calculation  In the sixth assignment of error, Husband argues the  trial court abused its discretion by denying his request for spousal  support. Husband contends that the trial court's judgment failed to appropriately  consider several factors of R.C. 3105.18(C), including the parties' relative earning  potential, the length of the marriage, his contributions to Wife's education, and his  lost income production resulting from his marital responsibilities.  The trial court has broad discretion in determining  whether an award of spousal support is proper based on the facts and  circumstances of each case. Smith v. Smith, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 110214,  110245 and 110274, 2022-Ohio- 299, ¶ 33, citing Wojanowski v. Wojanowski, 8th Dist.  Cuyahoga No. 99751, 2014- Ohio-697, ¶ 43, citing Kunkle v. Kunkle, 51 Ohio St.3d  64, 67, 554 N.E.2d 83 (1990). Therefore, we will not disturb the trial court's spousal  support order absent an abuse of discretion.  When  determining  whether  spousal  support  is  appropriate and reasonable, the trial court must consider the factors set  forth in R.C. 3105.18(C)(1). Kaletta v. Kaletta, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 98821, 2013- Ohio-1667, ¶ 22. These [*33]  factors include, but are not limited to (1) the relative earning abilities of the parties; (2) the  ages and physical, mental, and emotional conditions of  the parties; (3) the retirement benefits of the parties; (4)  the duration of the marriage; (5) the standard of living of  the parties established during the marriage; (6) the  relative education of the parties; (7) the relative assets  and debts of the parties, including but not limited to any  court-ordered payments by the parties; (8) the time and  expense necessary of the spouse seeking support to  acquire education, training, or job experience; (9) the  tax consequences for each party of an award of spousal  support; and (10) any other factor that the court  expressly finds to be relevant and equitable. R.C. 3105.18(C)(1).  The goal of spousal support is to reach an equitable  result. Hloska v. Hloska, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101690, 2015-Ohio- 2153, ¶ 10. And while there is no set mathematical formula to reach this goal, the Ohio  Supreme Court requires the trial court to consider each factor set forth under  R.C. 3105.18(C) and ""not base its determination upon any one of those factors taken in  isolation."" Id. at ¶ 11.  In this case, the divorce decree reflects that the trial  court carefully considered the applicable factors set forth under [*34]   R.C. 3105.18(C), including those factors Husband suggests support his request for  spousal support. The court summarized its application of the spousal-support  statute as follows: Presently,  [Wife]  earns  significantly  more  than  [Husband] as a Nurse Anesthetist. However, the court  finds that [Husband] is under-employed in his current  position and able to earn more than he is currently  earning. In addition, [Husband] is solely responsible for  his termination and the reduction to his income over the  last two years. Both parties in this matter are in their  forties and have not demonstrated any physical, mental,  or emotional condition that would necessitate support.  Page 12 of 14 Parties' retirement assets are largely marginal. Parties were married for approximately eighteen years  before they separated in May 2020. It would be  inappropriate to consider [Wife's] salary as a nurse  anesthetist in examining the standard of living of the  parties during the marriage as she was only employed  in this capacity for two months before the parties'  separation. Prior to their separation, the parties' joint  income was less than what [Wife] is now earning. The  court finds that it is inappropriate and inequitable to  consider [Wife's] current [*35]  salary in determining the  standard of living of the parties during the marriage. While [Husband] asserts that he should receive spousal  support due to his contribution to [Wife's] education, the  court finds that both parties contributed to the other's  education. In fact, [Husband] credited [Wife] with his return to school to complete his  bachelor's degree in communication. Defendant's  Exhibit F. [Wife] holds the following degrees: associate's  degree in nursing, bachelor's degree in nursing, and a  master's degree in nursing. There is no evidence before  the court to suggest that [Husband] needs more  education, training, or further job experience to obtain  appropriate employment. [Husband] argues that as the primary caregiver during  eighteen years of marriage, [Husband] was unable to  pursue higher education during this time, therefore,  [Husband] lost income production capacity resulting  from his marital responsibilities. [Husband's] argument  fails to consider that [Husband] could have sought  additional education during the other fifteen years of the  parties' marriage and before their separation. [Husband]  did not demonstrate that his caretaking lost income  production capacity aside from [*36]  his inability to  pursue  further  education.  [Husband]  did  not  demonstrate that he was an engaged caretaker, as  evidenced by the criminal conduct he engaged in while  the children were in his care. The court finds this  argument lacks merit. The court finds, upon consideration of the factors set  forth in Ohio Revised Code 3105.18(C)(1), that spousal  support is neither appropriate nor reasonable.  Viewing the trial court's discussion in its entirety, we  find the trial court sufficiently considered the statutory factors  outlined in R.C. 3105.18(C)(1)(a)- (n). Moreover, by commenting on each factor that was  relevant to the parties with a thoughtful and lengthy analysis, we find the divorce  decree contained sufficient details for this court to determine whether the denial of  spousal support was fair and equitable. We further find competent and credible evidence  supports the trial court's balancing of the relevant factors and its  conclusion that an award of spousal support in favor of Husband would not be equitable or  reasonable. Here, the trial court carefully considered the circumstances of the  parties' marriage and relied exclusively on the testimony  and documentary evidence introduced at trial in  applying R.C. 3105.18(C). Mindful of the principle that  ""[w]hen applying [*37]  the abuse of discretion standard,  a reviewing court is not free to merely substitute its  judgment for that of the trial court,"" we find no basis in  the record to conclude that trial court's spousal-support  order was unreasonable or arbitrary. In re Jane Doe 1,  57 Ohio St.3d 135, 138, 566 N.E.2d 1181 (1991); see  also Allan v. Allan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 107142,  2019-Ohio-2111, ¶ 95.  Briefly, we note that our resolution of the fourth  assignment of error does not alter our assessment of  the evidence supporting the trial court's denial of  spousal support. While Husband's potential income is  less than the amount imputed to him in the divorce  decree, we find the trial court's spousal-support order  appropriately focused on the parties' earnings and  standard of living during the duration of the marriage. In  this regard, the court astutely recognized that spousal  support was not reasonable where the disparity  between the parties' current incomes is premised on  circumstances occurring near or after the de facto  termination date of marriage. Thus, our conclusion that  Husband is entitled to a reduction in the imputation of  income for child support purposes does not require the  trial court to revisit his entitlement to spousal support  under the circumstances presented in this case.  Similarly, we are unable to conclude that [*38]  the  court abused its discretion by declining to retain  jurisdiction to modify the spousal-support order Page 13 of 14 where the greater weight of the evidence demonstrates  that future circumstances will not alter Husband's ability  to seek support given the timing of the de facto date of  termination and Wife's subsequent increase in annual  income. Moreover, given the nature of the court's  spousal-support judgment, Husband has not established  that the circumstances warranting a reservation of  jurisdiction under R.C. 3105.18(E) is applicable to this  case. See Ware v. Ware, 5th Dist. Licking No. 12CA91,  2014-Ohio-2606, ¶ 38 (""A trial court errs in reserving  jurisdiction over the issue of spousal support after  finding that spousal support was not appropriate or  reasonable."").  The sixth assignment of error is overruled. G. Child-Support Calculation  In this seventh assignment of error, Husband argues  the trial court erred and abused its discretion in its  determination of child support. Because the trial court's  calculation of child support relied on the court's  determination of each parent's annual income, we find  our resolution of the fourth assignment of error renders  Husband's challenges to the trial court's calculation of  child support to be moot. Husband's child-support  obligation [*39]  will be redetermined on remand.  Accordingly, the seventh assignment of error is moot.  Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and  remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. It is ordered that the parties share equally the costs  herein taxed. The court finds there were reasonable  grounds for this appeal. It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this  court directing the common pleas court, domestic relations division, to  carry this judgment into execution. A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the  mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure. EILEEN T. GALLAGHER JUDGE MICHELLE J.

I concur with the majority's  resolution of the first, second, sixth, and seventh  assignments of error regarding the marital home,  student loan, spousal support, and child respectively.  I respectfully dissent from the majority's finding on the  third assignment of error regarding the [*40]  trial court's  failure to state its findings for income attributed to  Husband and Wife for child support and the fifth  assignment of error contending that the income  calculation for Wife was incorrect. I would sustain the  assigned errors and remand to the trial court to specify  the grounds for the child support income findings.  In this case, both Husband and Wife contended that  their income was stated incorrectly though Wife did not  assign the issue as error. The trial court provided the  requisite child support worksheet pursuant to R.C.  3119.02. A child support worksheet must be provided to  assure the appellate court that the applicable statutes  have been followed and to ensure ""'meaningful  appellate review.'"" In re J-L.H., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.  100469, 2014-Ohio-1245, ¶ 14, quoting Marker v.  Grimm, 65 Ohio St.3d 139, 142, 601 N.E.2d 496 (1992).  It is true that a trial court's explanation of its child  support determination is not required to ""be so specific  or detailed as to support, dollar-by-dollar, the particular  child support obligation imposed by the court."" In re  K.R.B., 2017-Ohio-7071, 95 N.E.3d 799, ¶ 26 (8th Dist.),  citing Lopez-Ruiz v. Botta, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 11AP- 577, 2012-Ohio-718, ¶ 7.  Nevertheless ""there must be sufficient information in  the trial court's supporting 'journal entry' (or otherwise in  the record) to allow a reviewing court to discern why the  juvenile court did what it did and why it determined its  decision was in [*41]  the best interest of the child."" Id.  ""Without such information, we are unable to properly  assess whether"" the trial court's ""decision was the  product of a sound reasoning process or was  unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable."" Id., citing Mahlerwein v. Mahlerwein, 160 Ohio App.3d 564, 2005- Ohio-1835, 828 N.E.2d 153, ¶ 24 (4th Dist.); see also  Green v. Tarkington, 3d Dist.

I suggest that the phrase ""or otherwise in the record""  has been too broadly construed where the result is to  require an appellate court to comb through the  sometimes voluminous record to support the trial court's  decision and defeats the purpose of having the trial  court support the findings by statute. I respectfully  advocate that the goal of meaningful appellate review as  well as judicial economy would be best served by  specificity by the trial court in the journal entry as  required by law. Thus the reason for my dissent.  I concur in judgment only with the majority's resolution  of the fourth assignment of error challenging [*42]   Husband's imputed income finding for child support. I  would also find that the factors cited under R.C.  3105.18(C) for spousal support should not be deemed  sufficient to satisfy the statements required for child  support under R.C. Chapter 3119.",0
"In re A.F., 2023-Ohio-4423","[*1] JUDGMENT: AFFIRMED RELEASED AND JOURNALIZED: December 7, 2023 Civil Appeal from the Cuyahoga County Court of  Common Pleas Juvenile Division Case  Nos.  AD20905510,  AD20905511,  and  AD20905512 Appearances: David S. Bartos, for appellant. Michael C. O'Malley, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and Zachary J. LaFleur, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee CCDCFS. EILEEN T. GALLAGHER, J.:  Appellant, A.A. (""Mother""), appeals a juvenile court  judgment granting permanent custody of her children, A.F., A.M., and R.F.  (collectively ""the children"") to the Cuyahoga County Division of Children and Family  Services (""CCDCFS"" or ""the agency""). She claims the following errors: 1. The court erred in holding CCDFS used ""reasonable  efforts"" when granting permanent custody to CCDCFS. 2. It is against the manifest weight of the evidence that  the trial court held it was in the best interest of the  children to be placed in the permanent custody of  CCDCFS. 3. The court erred in allowing the foster parent to  provide testimony without being under oath or cross- examined. 4. The trial court abused its discretion by failing to  consider the children as separate children when  determining the best interest.  For the reasons [*2]  that follow, we affirm. I. Facts and Procedural History  In June 2020, CCDCFS filed a complaint alleging the  children were abused and neglected and requesting an  order granting temporary custody of the children to  CCDCFS. CCDCFS simultaneously filed a motion for  emergency predispositional custody of the children, and  the emergency motion was granted that same day. In  October 2020, the court adjudicated the children abused  and neglected and placed them in the temporary  custody of CCDCFS. In its judgment entries dated  Page 2 of 11 October 8, 2020, filed in each child's case, the juvenile  court found that the agency had made reasonable  efforts to prevent removal of the children. By entries  journalized October 20, 2021, the juvenile court again  found that the agency made reasonable efforts to  finalize the permanency plan of reunification. In  November 2021, the agency filed a motion to modify  temporary custody of the children to permanent custody.  Mother also filed a motion for legal custody of the  children.  The court held a permanent custody hearing in May  2023. Becky Sawyers (""Sawyers""), an extended case  worker with CCDCFS, testified that at the time of trial,  A.F. was nine years old; A.M. was eight [*3]  years old;  and R.F was seven years old. Mother has a fourth child,  who was five-years old at the time of trial and lives with  her in Michigan. That child is not a party to this case.  The three older children had been in agency custody  since June 2020, a period of almost three years at the  time of trial. However, A.F. had also previously been in  the custody of Michigan Child Protective Services  (""CPS"") from the time she was four and one-half months  old until she was two and one-half years old as a result  of domestic violence between Mother and the children's  father (""Father""). Sometime after A.F. was returned to  Mother and the two younger children were born, Father  took the children without permission or court order and  moved with them to Ohio. Mother contacted the local  police and CPS to report the alleged kidnapping, but  there was nothing they could do because the alleged  kidnapper was the children's father and her complaint  involved a civil dispute.  Mother did not know Father's Ohio address and,  therefore, was unable to reunite with the children until  CCDCFS removed the children from Father's custody  approximately two years later.1 CCDCFS contacted  Mother and informed her that the [*4]  agency had her  children in custody. The agency developed a case plan  for Mother with the goal of reunifying her with the  children. The case plan included 1 Since 2021, the children's father has not engaged in  any services, has not visited the children, and his  whereabouts were unknown. (Tr. 13.) He is not a party  to this appeal. parenting services, and Mother completed a series of  nine supervised visits with a parenting coach through  Michigan Health and Human Services. At that time, the  children were in the custody of their maternal  grandmother and step-grandfather, who lived near  Mother in Michigan. On her own initiative, Mother also  engaged in mental-health services through Team  Wellness in Michigan in anticipation of the need for  family counseling when the children were returned to  her. (Tr. 15, 199.) Mother completed parenting services  in Michigan in November 2021 and received positive  reports from her parenting class provider. (Tr. 40.)  Since CCDCFS obtained emergency custody of the  children in June 2020, A.F. has been placed in seven  foster care homes. The children were together in a  foster home in Ohio before being placed with their  maternal  grandmother.  The  children  were  subsequently [*5]  removed from their grandmother's  home because A.F. alleged that her step-grandfather  physically abused her. (Tr. 72.) Although the children  were initially placed together in foster homes, A.F. was  removed because she exhibited sexualized behaviors  toward her younger siblings. She also displayed  parentified behaviors, meaning she assumed the role of  caregiver to her younger siblings by caring for and  disciplining them. (Tr. 92, 95.) A.F. alleged that Father  and others sexually abused her. And because she  exhibited sexualized and parentified behaviors, A.F. was  engaged in psychotherapy with several therapists and  has been on medication during the years she has been  in agency custody.  Mother consistently visited the children in Ohio even  though she continued to reside in Michigan. Although  Mother has never had a valid driver's license, she drove herself to visits in Sandusky, Ohio  until she was charged with driving without a license. (Tr.  195-196.) Thereafter, Sandra Tedford (""Tedford""), who  fostered A.F. when she was a baby drove Mother to her  visits. In late 2022, Mother began overnight visits with  the children in her Michigan home. There were three  weekend visits in November 2022, and [*6]  one week- long visit from December 27, 2022, to January 2, 2023.  (Tr. 28.)  Following the week-long visit, A.F. reported that  Mother's boyfriend, later identified as Chris Davis  (""Davis""), sexually assaulted her while she was sleeping  in Mother's home. Shannon Hanrahan (""Hanrahan""), a  sex-abuse intake worker with CCDCFS, investigated the  allegation and determined it was ""indicated,"" meaning  the agency had cause to believe that the abuse likely  occurred.  (Tr.  126-127.)  Hanrahan  conducted  a  videorecorded forensic interview of A.F., which was  admitted into evidence. During the interview, A.F.  provided a detailed description of Davis's conduct.  Page 3 of 11 When  Hanrahan  questioned  Mother  about  the  allegation, Mother denied it could be true, claiming  ""Chris was never in the home during the children's visit.""  (Tr. 129.)  Mother indicated that Davis was a neighbor who only  comes to her house to do his laundry. (Tr. 129.)  However, Hanrahan interviewed each of the children  separately, and each of the children independently  confirmed that Davis slept over in Mother's house while  they were there. (Tr. 129.) They also separately and  independently told her that they knew Davis because he  was often in Mother's [*7]  home. (Tr. 130.) Indeed, they  separately and independently identified him in a photograph and indicated that he was Mother's  ""boyfriend."" (Tr. 130.) A.F. also states in the recorded  interview that Davis was at Mother's home ""all the time."" (Exhibit No. 4.)  Hanrahan also questioned Davis regarding the sex- abuse allegation. Davis denied ever being in Mother's home and denied  ever being around the children. However, Hanrahan  reported the allegation to local police and provided the  police with a copy of the recorded interview. As a result  of this information, a warrant was issued for Davis's  arrest.  Hanrahan confronted Mother about the inconsistencies  between her claim that Davis was just a neighbor who  occasionally does laundry at her house, the children's  claim that Davis sleeps over at her house, and Davis's  claim that he never goes to Mother's house and that he  has never been around her children. According to  Hanrahan, Mother ""still maintained [Davis] was not  there"" and did not provide any explanation for the  differing claims. (Tr. 135.) As a result, Hanrahan did not  think Mother took the sex-abuse allegation seriously,  particularly because she would not allow authorities to  interview [*8]  her youngest daughter as part of the  investigation. (Tr. 136.)  Tedford testified on behalf of Mother and stated that  she babysat the children during the week-long visit while  Mother was at work. (Tr. 156.) She also indicated she  did not know whether Davis was present in Mother's  home while the children were there. (Tr. 180-181.)  Tedford lives 20 miles from Mother's home. (Tr. 175.)  Tiffaney Mahoney (""Mahoney""), an extended-case  supervisor with CCDCFS, testified that the sexual-abuse  allegation against Davis was a serious concern.  However, she also stated that the agency would have  requested permanent custody even if the allegation had  never been made because it had other concerns  regarding Mother's parenting. (Tr. 91, 111.) According to  Mahoney, there was no significant bond between  Mother and the children. The lack of bond and  attachment was due in part to the fact that Father  absconded with the children and Mother had no contact  with them for two years. But the lack of meaningful  attachment was also due to Mother's inability to meet  the children's ongoing behavioral- and mental-health  needs. (Tr. 87-88.) Mahoney explained that every time  the children returned from extended, unsupervised [*9]   visits with Mother, they regressed in their behaviors. (Tr.  88.) Mother also failed to properly ensure the children  take their prescribed medications. (Tr. 92.)  The agency was also concerned about Mother's  decision-making. The agency instructed Mother to have  A.F. sleep in a separate bedroom away from her  siblings because she exhibited sexualized behaviors  toward them. Yet Mother allowed A.F. to sleep in the  same bedroom with her younger sister A.M. A.F. also  reported to the agency that she cooked for her younger  siblings when they were at Mother's home and that Mother left them home alone.  (Tr. 33.) The children reported that their step- grandfather had been present in the home with them  even though he was not permitted to be there due to  prior physical-abuse allegations against him. When the agency confronted Mother about  him being present with the children, she claimed she did not know he was not  allowed to be there. (Tr. 35-36.)  Mahoney  further  stated  that  despite  having  unsupervised visits and parent coaching, Mother had not learned to manage the  children on her own. (Tr. 100.) Mahoney explained: [Mother]'s been made aware of her children's behavioral  needs, she's aware that they have [*10]  prescribed  medication, she's aware of the sexualized behaviors  that [A.F.] has demonstrated towards her siblings, we  have suggested to prevent further issues when they're  having overnight weekend visits and extended visits that  Page 4 of 11 mom implement a plan, and creating a plan for example  meant not allowing [A.F.] to sleep with her siblings on  their own. You know, a plan would be in place, and so [A.F.] was  to sleep in her mother's room. Mother did not follow that plan. Again, with the children  acting out, mom failed to be able to demonstrate being  able to meet their behavioral needs on their own  regularly and consistently, again relying on [A.F.] to do  so or having to reach out to the foster parents for  assistance in how to meet her children's needs. (Tr. 115.) Mahoney was also concerned that Mother  minimized the seriousness of the children's behavioral needs. Thus, despite the fact  that Mother has an appropriate home and has demonstrated the ability to  provide basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter, the agency believed  permanent custody was in the children's best interests.  The guardian ad litem (""GAL"") also recommended that  the court grant permanent custody of the children to CCDCFS  due [*11]  to Mother's inability to adequately parent them. (Tr. 241, GAL report and  recommendation at 3.) The GAL shared the agency's concern that ""Mother has shown  both poor judgment and parental decision making.""  (GAL report and recommendation at 4.)  Based on the evidence presented, the juvenile court  denied Mother's motion for legal custody and granted  permanent custody of the children to CCDCFS. Mother now appeals the juvenile court's judgment. II. Law and Analysis  In the first assignment of error, Mother argues the  juvenile court abused its discretion when it found that  CCDCFS used ""reasonable efforts"" to reunite Mother  with her children before it granted permanent custody of  the children to the agency. She contends the agency  should have done more, including either placing the  children in a foster home closer to Mother's Michigan  home or paying her travel expenses for visiting the  children in Ohio.  A parent has a ""fundamental liberty interest * * * in the  care, custody, and management of [his or her child].""  Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753, 102 S.Ct. 1388,  71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982). The termination of parental  rights is regarded as ""'the family law equivalent of the death penalty in a  criminal case.'"" In re J.B., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.  98546, 2013-Ohio-1704, ¶ 66, quoting In re Hoffman, 97  Ohio St.3d 92, 2002-Ohio-5368, 776 N.E.2d 485, ¶ 14.  Consequently, parents ""'must be afforded every  procedural [*12]  and substantive protection the law  allows.'"" In re Hayes, 79 Ohio St.3d 46, 48, 679 N.E.2d  680 (1997), quoting In re Smith, 77 Ohio App.3d 1, 16,  601 N.E.2d 45 (6th Dist.1991).  However, a parent's right to the care and custody of his  or her child is not absolute. In re L.G., 8th Dist.  Cuyahoga No. 110789, 2022-Ohio-529, ¶ 49. ""'[T]he natural rights of a parent * * * are always subject  to the ultimate welfare of the child, which is the polestar  or controlling principal to be observed.'"" In re L.D., 2017- Ohio-1037, 86 N.E.3d 1012, ¶ 29 (8th Dist.), quoting In  re Cunningham, 59 Ohio St.2d 100, 106, 391 N.E.2d  1034 (1979).  Ohio statutes governing child custody and protection  ""appropriately reflect the need to balance * * * [the]  parents' * * * interest in the custody, care, nurturing, and  rearing of their own children, and the state's parens  patriae interest in providing for the security and welfare  of children under its jurisdiction[.]"" In reThompson, 10th  Dist. Franklin Nos. 00AP-1358 and 00AP-1359, 2001  Ohio App. LEXIS 1890, ¶ 19 (Apr. 26, 2001).  A public children's services agency has a duty to make  reasonable efforts to preserve or reunify a family unit,  including preparing and maintaining a case plan to bring  the children back home. R.C. 2151.412. However, a  reasonable efforts determination is not required at a  permanent-custody  hearing  on  a  complaint  for  permanent custody under R.C. 2151.353(A)(4) when the  record  demonstrates  that  a  reasonable-efforts  determination was previously made in the proceedings.  In re N.R., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 110144, 2021-Ohio- 1589, ¶ 38, citing In re A.R., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.  109482, 2020-Ohio-5005, ¶ 32. If the agency has not  demonstrated that reasonable efforts have been made  prior to the permanent custody hearing, [*13]  then the  agency must demonstrate such efforts at the Page 5 of 11 hearing. Id., citing In re C.F., 113 Ohio St.3d 73, 2007- Ohio-1104, 862 N.E.2d 816, ¶ 43.  The juvenile court found that the agency made  reasonable efforts to prevent the continued removal of the children from  Mother's home and to make it possible for them to safely return to Mother's home in its  judgment entry granting the agency temporary custody of the children in October  2020, and again in its October 20 2021 judgment entry, when it found that the  agency made reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan of reunification.  The juvenile court was, therefore, not required to make a reasonable-efforts  determination at the permanent-custody hearing.  Although not required to do so, the juvenile court again  found that the agency had made reasonable efforts to return the  children to Mother's custody in the judgment entry granting the agency permanent  custody of the children. Pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(E)(1), the court found: Following the placement of the child outside the child's  home and notwithstanding reasonable case planning  and diligent efforts by the agency to assist the parents  to remedy the problems that initially caused the child to  be placed outside the home, the parent has failed  continuously and repeatedly [*14]  to substantially  remedy the conditions causing the children to be placed  outside the child's home. (June 5, 2023 journal entry granting permanent custody  at 2.) Still, Mother asserts the record does not support the court's reasonable- efforts findings because the record shows that CCDCFS obstructed rather than  assisted Mother's efforts at reunification.  R.C. 2151.419(A) does not specify the evidentiary  standard of proof required for a public children's  services agency to satisfy the reasonable-efforts  requirement. However, the standard of proof applied to  judgments awarding permanent custody is that of clear  and convincing evidence. R.C. 2151.414(B)(1). And this  court has previously applied the clear and convincing  evidence standard of proof to the juvenile court's  reasonable-efforts determination. See, e.g., In re L.G.,  8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 110789, 2022-Ohio-529, at ¶  55. We, therefore, apply the clear-and-convincing- evidence standard of proof to this issue.  ""'Clear and convincing evidence' is evidence that 'will  produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or  conviction as  to  the allegations sought to be  established.'"" In re T.B., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99931,  2014-Ohio-2051, ¶ 28, quoting Cross v. Ledford, 161  Ohio St. 469, 477, 120 N.E.2d 118 (1954). The clear- and-convincing-evidence standard is an intermediate  standard, ""being more than a mere preponderance, but  not to the extent of such [*15]  certainty as is required  beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal cases. It does  not mean clear and unequivocal."" (Emphasis deleted.)  Cross at 477.  ""'Reasonable efforts means that a children's services  agency must act diligently and provide services  appropriate to the family's need to prevent the child's  removal or as a predicate to reunification.'"" In re H.M.K.,  3d Dist. Wyandot Nos. 16-12-15 and 16-12-16, 2013- Ohio-4317, ¶ 95, quoting In re D.A., 6th Dist. Lucas No.  L-11-1197, 2012-Ohio-1104, ¶ 30. ""In other words, the  agency must use reasonable efforts to help remove the  obstacles preventing family reunification."" In re L.G. at ¶ 60, citing In re C.B.C., 4th Dist. Lawrence Nos.  15CA18 and 15CA19, 2016-Ohio- 916, ¶ 76, citing Bean, Reasonable Efforts: What State  Courts Think, 36 U.Tol.L.Rev. 321, 366 (2005). When  considering  whether  the  agency  made  reasonable efforts to prevent the continued removal, the  issue is not whether the agency could have done more,  but whether it did enough to satisfy the reasonableness  standard under the statute. In re Davidson-Rush, 5th  Dist. Stark No. 2006 CA 00121, 2006-Ohio-4873, ¶ 50.  ""'Reasonable efforts' does not mean all available  efforts."" In re Lewis, 4th Dist. Athens No. 03CA12, 2003- Page 6 of 11 Ohio-5262, ¶ 16. ""In determining whether reasonable  efforts were made, the child's health and safety shall be  paramount."" R.C. 2151.419(A)(1). In re J.B., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 109039, 2020-Ohio- 3675, ¶ 21.  Mother's poor judgment and parenting skills were the  primary obstacles preventing Mother's reunification with the  children. The agency provided Mother with [*16]  a case plan that included parenting.  Pursuant to the plan and the agency's referral, Mother completed a series of  supervised visits with a parenting coach. The agency also allowed Mother to have  extended, unsupervised visits with the children to develop her skills. Despite the completion  of services and visiting opportunities, the concerns regarding Mother's decision  making persisted. The agency specifically required that Mother keep A.F. in a  separate bedroom from her siblings because A.F. tended to exhibit sexualized  behaviors toward them. Mother ignored this concern and placed A.F. and her sister in  the same room. Mother was aware that the children have behavioral issues and that  they require prescription medications, yet she failed to properly address the  behaviors and failed to administer the medications.  Mother was also told not to allow the children's step- grandfather into the house when the children are there  because A.F. had previously accused him of physically  abusing  her.  Although  the  accusation  was  unsubstantiated, Mother disregarded the instruction and  allowed the step-grandfather into the home with the  children. Moreover, all three children separately and  independently reported [*17]  that Davis slept in Mother's home while they were there, and  A.F. reported that he sexually assaulted her.  Mother nevertheless argues the agency failed to do  enough to help her reunite with her children because  they failed to place the children in a foster home closer  to her Michigan residence. However, the agency placed  the children with their maternal grandmother in  Michigan, but they had to be removed when A.F alleged  that her step-grandfather physically abused her. Thus,  the record clearly and convincingly shows the agency  made great efforts to reunite the children with Mother,  but Mother failed to do her part to remedy the obstacles  to reunification.  The first assignment of error is overruled. A. Best Interest of the Child  In the second assignment of error, Mother asserts that  the juvenile court's finding that permanent custody was  in the children's best interests is against the manifest  weight of the evidence.  R.C. 2151.414 provides a two-prong analysis to be  applied by a juvenile court in adjudicating a motion for  permanent custody. In re S.C., 2018-Ohio-2523, 115  N.E.3d 813, ¶ 20 (8th Dist.), citing R.C. 2151.414(B).  The first prong authorizes the juvenile court to grant permanent custody of a child  to the public agency if, after a hearing, the court  determines, by [*18]  clear and convincing evidence,  that any of the following factors apply: (a) the child is not  abandoned or orphaned, but the child cannot be placed  with either parent within a reasonable time or should not  be placed with the child's parents; (b) the child is  abandoned; (c) the child is orphaned, and there are no  relatives of the child who are able to take permanent  custody; (d) the child has been in the temporary custody  of one or more public children services agencies or  private child placing agencies for 12 or more months of  a consecutive 22-month period; or (e) the child or  another child in the custody of the parent or parents  from whose custody the child has been removed has  been adjudicated an abused, neglected, or dependent  child on three separate occasions by any court in this  state or another state. R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a)-(e).  Only one of the factors listed in R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a)- (e) must be established to satisfy the first prong of the  two-part analysis for granting permanent custody of a  child to an agency. In re D.H., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.  110505, 2021-Ohio-3821, ¶ 27, citing In re L.W., 8th  Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104881, 2017-Ohio-657. If any one  of the factors listed in R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a)-(e) is  established, the court may move to the second prong of  Page 7 of 11 the analysis, which requires the juvenile court to  determine, by clear and convincing evidence, whether it  is in [*19]  the best interest of the child to grant  permanent custody to the agency pursuant to R.C.  2151.414(D).  A juvenile court's decision to grant permanent custody  will not be reversed as being against the manifest  weight of the evidence ""'if the record contains some competent, credible evidence from which the  court could have found that the essential statutory  elements for permanent custody had been established  by clear and convincing evidence.'"" In re G.W., 8th Dist.  Cuyahoga No. 107512, 2019-Ohio-1533, ¶ 62, quoting  In re A.P., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104130, 2016-Ohio- 5849, ¶ 16.  With respect to the first prong of the permanent-custody  analysis, it is undisputed that, at the time of trial, the  children had been in the temporary custody of a public  children services agency or private child placing agency  for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-month  period. Indeed, the children had been in agency custody  for nearly three years. Therefore, the first prong of the  two-part analysis is satisfied and we now turn to the  second prong of the analysis, which requires us to  determine, by clear and convincing evidence, whether  granting permanent custody of the children was in the  children's best interests.  We recognize that, given the nature of the proceeding  and the impact the court's decision will have on the lives  of the parties concerned, [*20]  the juvenile court enjoys  broad discretion in determining whether an order of  permanent custody is in the child's best interest. In re  Awkal, 95 Ohio App.3d 309, 316, 642 N.E.2d 424 (8th  Dist.1994). We, therefore, review a juvenile court's  determination of a child's best interests under R.C.  2151.414(D) for an abuse of discretion. In re D.A., 8th  Dist. Cuyahoga No. 95188, 2010-Ohio-5618, ¶ 47.  An abuse of discretion occurs when a court exercises  its judgment in an unwarranted way regarding a matter  over which it has discretionary authority. Johnson v. Abdullah, 166 Ohio St.3d 427, 2021-Ohio- 3304, 187 N.E.3d 463, ¶ 35. A court also abuses its discretion ""when a legal rule  entrusts a decision to a judge's discretion and the  judge's exercise of that discretion is outside of the  legally permissible range of choices."" State v. Hackett,  164 Ohio St.3d 74, 2020-Ohio-6699, 172 N.E.3d 75, ¶  19.  This court has held that an abuse of discretion may be  found where a trial court ""applies the wrong legal  standard, misapplies the correct legal standard, or relies  on clearly erroneous findings of fact."" Thomas v.  Cleveland, 176 Ohio App.3d 401, 2008-Ohio-1720, 892  N.E.2d 454, ¶ 15 (8th Dist.). When applying the abuse- of-discretion standard, a reviewing court may not  substitute its judgment for that of the trial court.  Vannucci v. Schneider, 2018-Ohio-1294, 110 N.E.3d  716, ¶ 22 (8th Dist.).  In determining the best interest of a child, a juvenile  court may apply one of two different tests set forth in  R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) and (D)(2). In re S.C., 10th Dist.  Franklin No. 21AP-203, 2022-Ohio-356, ¶ 38, quoting In  re J.P., 10th Dist. Franklin No. 18AP-834, 2019-Ohio- 1619, ¶ 39. In determining the best interest of the child  under R.C. 2151.414(D)(1), the juvenile court must  consider  all  relevant  factors,  including  but  not  limited [*21]  to: (1) the interaction and interrelationship  of the child with the child's parents, siblings, relatives,  foster parents, and out-of-home providers, and any  other person who may significantly affect the child; (2)  the wishes of the child as expressed directly by the child  or through the child's guardian ad litem; (3) the custodial  history of the child; (4) the child's need for a legally  secure placement and whether that type of placement  can be achieved without a grant of permanent custody to the agency; and (5) whether any  factors in R.C. 2151.414(E)(7) through (11) are  applicable. Although a trial court is required to consider each of the R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) factors in making its permanent  custody determination, ""there is not one element that is  given greater weight than the others pursuant to the  statute."" In re Schaefer, 111 Ohio St.3d 498, 2006-Ohio- 5513, 857 N.E.2d 532, ¶ 56. Moreover, only one factor  needs to be resolved in favor of permanent custody in  order to find that permanent custody is in the child's best  interest. In re S.C., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102350,  2015-Ohio-2410, ¶ 30.  Alternatively, the court may apply the test set forth in  R.C. 2151.414(D)(2), which provides as follows: If all of the following apply, permanent custody is in the  best interest of the child, and the court shall commit the  child to the permanent custody of a public children  services agency or private [*22]  child placing agency: Page 8 of 11 (a) The court determines by clear and convincing  evidence that one or more of the factors in division (E)  of this section exist and the child cannot be placed with  one of the child's parents within a reasonable time or  should not be placed with either parent. (b) The child has been in an agency's custody for two  years or longer, and no longer qualifies for temporary  custody pursuant to division (D) of section 2151.415 of  the Revised Code. (c) The child does not meet the requirements for a  planned permanent living arrangement pursuant to  division (A)(5) of section 2151.353 of the Revised Code. (d) Prior to the dispositional hearing, no relative or other  interested person has filed, or has been identified in, a  motion for legal custody of the child. (Emphasis added.) If all the factors enumerated under  R.C. 2151.414(D)(2) are applicable, permanent custody  is per se in the child's best interest, and the juvenile  court must commit the child to the permanent custody of  the agency. In re G.A., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 108932,  2020-Ohio-2949, ¶ 61, citing In re J.R., 10th Dist.  Franklin No. 17AP-698, 2018-Ohio-1474, ¶ 41.  The juvenile court made alternative findings under both R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) and (D)(2). However, it is not  necessary to determine if the court correctly applied the  R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) factors if the findings under R.C.  2151.414(D)(2) are supported by clear and convincing  evidence because ""[a] finding under section (D)(2) of  R.C. 2151.414 mandates that the trial court find it is in a  child's best interest [*23]  to be placed in the agency's  permanent custody."" In re A.S., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos.  110422 and 110472, 2021-Ohio-3829, ¶ 42, citing In re  G.A.  at ¶ 59. We, therefore, focus our review on the court's  findings under   R.C. 2151.414(D)(2).   The juvenile court found that all the factors enumerated  in  R.C. 2151.414(D)(2) were applicable. The court found,  in relevant part: With respect to the best interest of the child, the Court  finds that pursuant to O.R.C. 2151.414(D)(2) that all of  the following apply: (a) The Court determines by clear and convincing  evidence that one or more of the factors in division (E)  of this section exist and the child cannot be placed with  one of the child's parents within a reasonable time or  should not be placed with either parent. (b) The child has been in the agency's custody for two  years or longer and no longer qualifies for temporary  custody pursuant to division (D) of section 2151.415 of  the Ohio Revised Code. (c) The child does not meet the requirements for a  planned permanent living arrangement pursuant to  division (A)(5) of Section 2151.353 of the Ohio Revised  Code. (d) Prior to the dispositional hearing, no relative or other  interested person has filed, or has been identified in a  motion for legal Custody.  In determining whether R.C. 2151.414(D)(2)(a) applies,  we must look to R.C. 215 1.414(E) because determining ""that a child  cannot be placed with the parents within a reasonable time or should not be  placed with them, the court must find, by clear [*24]  and convincing evidence, that at  least one of the factors in R.C. 2151.414(E)(1)-(16) is present."" In re G.A., 8th  Dist. Cuyahoga No. 108932, 2020-Ohio-2949, at ¶ 62, citing In re S.C., 8th Dist.  Cuyahoga No. 108036, 2019- Ohio-3664, citing In re S.W., 11th Dist. Ashtabula No.  2017-A-0089, 2018-Ohio- 1672.  The juvenile court found that the children cannot be  placed with either of their parents within a reasonable time or should not  be placed with either parent pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(E)(1), (4), (10), (14), and  (16). The court's judgment entry states, in relevant part: The Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that  the child cannot be placed with one of the child's  Page 9 of 11 parents within a reasonable time or should not be  placed with either parent, pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(E): (1) Following the placement of the child outside the  child's home and notwithstanding reasonable case  planning and diligent efforts by the agency to assist the  parents to remedy the problems that initially caused the  child to be placed outside the home, the parent has  failed continuously and repeatedly to substantially  remedy the conditions causing the child to be placed  outside the child's home. (4) The parent has demonstrated a lack of commitment  toward the child by failing to regularly support, visit, or  communicate [*25]  with the child when able to do so, or by other actions showing an  unwillingness to provide an adequate permanent home. (10) The parent (alleged Father) has abandoned the  child. (14) The parent for any reason is unwilling to provide  food, clothing, shelter, and other basic necessities for  the child or to prevent the child from suffering physical,  emotional, or sexual abuse or physical, emotional, or  mental neglect. (16) Any other factor the Court finds relevant: Mother  was receiving overnight visits, but they were suspended  after allegations of sexual abuse occurred in her home,  which were indicated by CCDCFS.  The court found that Father abandoned the children,  but he is not a party to this case, and there is no evidence that Mother  abandoned the children. However, there is also clear and convincing evidence to  support the trial court's findings under R.C. 2151.414(E)(1), (14), and (16). As  previously determined in the first assignment of error, Mother failed to remedy the  conditions that prevented the children from being reunited with her despite the  agency's reasonable efforts to assist Mother in removing the barriers to reunification.  R.C. 2151.414(E)(1). There is also evidence that Mother was unwilling to take  appropriate action to prevent [*26]  sexual or physical abuse and neglect of the children.  R.C. 2151.414(E)(14). She admittedly allowed the children's step-grandfather to be  present in her home with the children even though they were removed from  custody in his home after A.F. alleged that he physically abused her and the agency  told Mother that the children's step-grandfather was not permitted to be around the  children.  There is also evidence that Mother allowed Davis to  spend nights in her home with the children and that he sexually  assaulted A.F. during one of those nights. Although the sex-abuse allegation was indicated  rather than substantiated, all three children separately and independently told  Hanrahan that Davis slept in the home and that he was Mother's ""boyfriend"" despite  Mother's claims to the contrary. When Hanrahan confronted Mother about the  allegation, she failed to take it seriously. The trial court found that this evidence  also supports the court's finding under R.C. 2151.414(E)(16), which allows the  court to find ""any other factor."" Thus, there is clear and convincing evidence to support  the court's finding under R.C. 2151.414(D)(2)(a).  R.C. 2151.414(D)(2)(b) requires the court to find that  the children have been in agency custody for over two years and no  longer qualified for temporary custody. [*27]   R.C.  2151.415(D)(4)  governs  the  permissible amount of time children may remain in temporary custody and states: No court shall grant an agency more than two  extensions of temporary custody pursuant to division (D)  Page 10 of 11 of this section and the court shall not order an existing  temporary custody order to continue beyond two years  after the date on which the complaint was filed or the  child was first placed into shelter care, whichever date is  earlier, regardless of whether any extensions have been  previously ordered pursuant to division (D) of this  section. It is undisputed that the children have been in agency  custody for almost three years and that they were no longer eligible for extension of  temporary custody. Therefore, there is clear and convincing evidence to support the  court's finding under R.C. 2151.415(D)(4)(b).  The factor listed in R.C. 2151.414(D)(2)(c) is satisfied if  the child ""does not meet the requirements for a planned permanent  living arrangement pursuant to division (A)(5) of Section 2151.353 of the Revised  Code."" To qualify for a planned permanent-living  arrangement under R.C. 2151.353, the child must,  among other things, be ""sixteen years of age or older[.]""  R.C. 2153.353(A)(5)(b). Because none of the children  are 16 years of age or older, the factor listed in R.C.  2151.414(D)(2)(c) is satisfied.  Finally, the factor in R.C. 2151.414(D)(2)(d) is  established if ""[p]rior [*28]  to the dispositional hearing,  no relative or other interested person has filed, or has  been identified in, a motion for legal custody."" A review  of the juvenile court record reveals that no such motion  was filed in this case. Therefore, all the factors outlined  in R.C. 2151.414(D)(2) were satisfied and the juvenile  court had no choice but to find that granting permanent  custody of the children to CCDCFS was in the children's  best interests.  Accordingly, the second assignment of error is  overruled. B. Foster Parent Testimony  In the third assignment of error, Mother argues the trial  court erred by allowing a foster parent to provide a  statement to the court even though the foster parent  was not under oath and was not subject to cross- examination. Mother contends the foster parent's  statement should not be deemed evidence and should  not have been considered in the permanent-custody  analysis.  At the permanent-custody hearing, before closing  arguments, the younger children's foster mother made a  brief statement regarding her home and the younger  children's education. Mother did not object to the  statement and, therefore, forfeited all but plain error. In re De.D., 8th  Dist. Cuyahoga No. 108760, 2020-Ohio-906, ¶ 13  (holding that failure to object to an issue in the  lower [*29]  court waives a party's right to challenge that  issue on appeal absent plain error). ""Plain error exists  only when it can be determined that the outcome of the  trial would have been different."" In re S.F., 8th Dist.  Cuyahoga No. 112327, 2023-Ohio-1900, ¶ 15, citing In  re Z.T., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 88009, 2007-Ohio-827,  ¶ 19, citing Statev. Moreland, 50 Ohio St.3d 58, 62, 552  N.E.2d 894 (1990).  Throughout our analysis and review of this case, we  have not once mentioned the foster parent's statement  because the juvenile court's decision would have been  no different had the foster parent remained silent.  Therefore, Mother cannot establish plain error as a  result of the statement, and the third assignment of error  is overruled. C. Separate Children  In the fourth assignment of error, Mother argues the  juvenile court abused its discretion by failing to consider  the children as separate children when making the best- interest determination. She contends that each child is  different, has different needs, and should be addressed  separately.  We agree that each child is unique. However, the  children in this case are close in age and share many of  the same special needs. The evidence shows that all  the  children  require  psychotherapy  to  address  behavioral issues resulting from abuse and neglect.  They are all under ten years of age and require  protection from the threat of physical, [*30]  sexual, and  emotional harm from adults. Thus, the juvenile court's findings that Mother failed to make appropriate  decisions to protect the health and safety of the children  applied equally to all the children. We, therefore, find no  error in the juvenile court's analysis of the children's  best interest.  The fourth assignment of error is overruled. Page 11 of 11  Judgment affirmed. It is ordered that appellee recover from appellant costs  herein taxed. The court finds there were reasonable  grounds for this appeal. It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this  court directing the common pleas court, juvenile  division, to carry this judgment into execution. A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the  mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate  Procedure. EILEEN T. GALLAGHER, JUDGE MICHELLE J. SHEEHAN, P.J., and LISA B.

My true name is:     I am also known as:    . 2. My age is    . Date of Birth:    . 3. I have been informed and fully understand that I have  the right to a lawyer, and that if I cannot afford to pay for  a lawyer, the judge will provide me with one at no cost. I  understand that a lawyer can look at the social and legal  files in my case, talk to the [*3]  police, probation  counselor, and prosecuting attorney, tell me about the  law, help me understand my rights, and help me at trial. 4. I understand that I am charged with count 1     , the  elements of which are    ; Count 2    , the elements of  which are    . [ ] Count(s)     was(were) committed  against a family or household member. [ ] Count(s)      was(were) committed against an intimate partner. I have been given a copy of the charge(s). 5. I UNDERSTAND I HAVE THE FOLLOWING  IMPORTANT RIGHTS, AND I GIVE THEM ALL UP BY  PLEADING GUILTY: a. I have the right to a speedy and public trial in the  county where the offense(s) allegedly occurred. b. I have the right to remain silent before and during  trial and I need not testify against myself. c. I have the right to hear and question witnesses  who might testify against me. d. I have the right to testify and to have witnesses  testify for me. These witnesses may be required to  appear at no cost to me. e. I am presumed innocent unless the charge is  proven beyond a reasonable doubt or I enter a plea  of guilty. f. I have the right to appeal a finding of guilty after  trial. 6. I have been informed that, in order to determine an  appropriate sentence regarding [*4]  the charges to  which I plead guilty in this matter, the judge will take into  consideration my criminal history, which is as follows: a.     b.     c.     d.     e.     f.     7. The Standard Sentencing Range, which was  calculated using my criminal history as referenced in  Paragraph 6 above, is as follows: [ ] LOCAL SANCTIONS: Go to table1 I understand that if community supervision is  imposed, I will be required to comply with various  rules which could include school attendance,  curfew,  law  abiding  behavior,  associational  restrictions,  counseling,  treatment,  urinalysis,  and/or other conditions deemed appropriate by the  judge. Failure to comply with the conditions of  supervision could result in a violation being found  and further confinement imposed for the violation,  up to 30 days. [  ]  COMMITMENT  TO  DEPARTMENT  OF  CHILDREN, YOUTH, AND FAMILIES JUVENILE  REHABILITATION (DCYFJR): Go to table2 I understand that if I am committed to a DCYFJR  rehabilitation facility following my release, I may be  required to comply with a program of parole for a  Page 3 of 9 number of months. I understand that if placed on  parole, I will be under the supervision of a parole  officer. The conditions of parole will restrict my  actions and may require me to participate in  activities and programs including, but not limited to,  evaluation,  treatment,  education,  employment,  community  service,  electronic  monitoring,  or  urinalysis, and, if I am adjudicated of certain  offenses, a program applicable to juvenile firearm  offenders. Failure to comply with the conditions of  parole may result in parole revocation and further  confinement. If the offense to which I am pleading  guilty is a sex offense, failure to comply with the  conditions  of  parole  may  result  in  further  confinement of up to 24 weeks. [*6]  I understand that if I am pleading guilty to 2 or more  offenses,  the  disposition  terms  shall  run  consecutively (1 term after the other) subject to the  limitations in RCW 13.40.180. I understand that if any additional criminal history is  discovered, both the standard sentence range and  the prosecuting attorney's recommendation may  increase. Even so, my plea of guilty to this charge  is binding. 8. RIGHT TO APPEAL SENTENCE: I understand that  the judge must impose a sentence within the standard  range unless the judge finds by clear and convincing  evidence that the standard range sentence would  amount to a manifest injustice. If the judge goes outside  the standard range, either the state or I can appeal that  sentence. If the sentence is within the standard range,  no one can appeal the sentence. 9. MAXIMUM PUNISHMENT: I have been informed and  fully understand that the maximum punishment I can  receive is commitment until I am [ ] 21 years old [ ] 25  years old, but that I may be incarcerated for no longer  than the adult maximum sentence for this offense. 10. COUNTS AS CRIMINAL HISTORY: I understand  that my plea of guilty and the judge's acceptance of my  plea will become part of my criminal history. [*7]  I  understand that if I am pleading guilty to 2 or more  offenses that arise out of the same course of conduct,  only the most serious offense will count as an offense in  my criminal history. I understand that my guilty plea will  remain part of my criminal history when I am an adult  and may affect my ability to remain in the Juvenile  Justice System should I re-offend. I understand that the  judge will consider my criminal history,  if I committed murder in the 1st or 2nd degree or a class  A sex offense, when sentencing me for any offense that  I commit in the future as an adult or juvenile, except  juvenile adjudications of guilt which are not murder in  the 1st or 2nd degree or a class A sex offense cannot  be included in my adult offender score later. 11. GROUNDS FOR DEPORTATION: If I am not a  citizen of the United States, a plea of guilty to an offense  punishable as a crime under state law may be grounds  for deportation, exclusion from admission to the United  States, or denial of naturalization pursuant to the laws of  the United States. 12.  NOTIFICATION  RELATING  TO  SPECIFIC  CRIMES:  IF  ANY  OF  THE  FOLLOWING  PARAGRAPHS DO NOT APPLY, THEY SHOULD BE  STRICKEN AND INITIALED BY THE DEFENDANT  AND THE [*8]  JUDGE.

See RCW 13.40.265.

See RCW 9.41.040(5). Certain Motor Vehicle Offenses: If the court  finds me guilty of 1 of the following offenses:  DUI; physical control; DWLS 1&2; vehicular  assault/homicide;  hit  and  run  attended;  reckless driving; any felony offense where a  vehicle was used in a manner that endangered  persons or property (except ""TMVOOP2""  (taking a motor vehicle without owner's  permission) where the court finds I was a  passenger only in committing the offense);  false statements under Title 46 RCW; felony  elude; unattended child in running vehicle  (second or subsequent conviction); reckless  endangerment of road workers; and/or theft of  motor vehicle fuel. See RCW 46.20.285,  46.61.5055(9),  46.20.342(2),  46.61.524,  46.52.020(6),  46.61.500(2),  46.61.024(3),  46.61.685(2), 46.61.527(5), 46.61.740(2), and  46.20.270. [B] Offender Registration for Sex Offense or  Kidnapping Offense: One or more of the offenses  I am pleading guilty to involve a sex or kidnapping  offense and meets the requirements [*10]  of RCW  9A.44.130 for registration. The specific registration  requirements  are  located  in  the  ""Offender  Registration"" Attachment. Because I am a non-adult  and the offense involves one or more of the  following offense conditions as checked below, I will  be required to register unless I qualify for and am  granted a Special Sexual Offender Disposition  Alternative (SSODA) under RCW 13.40.162, and I  complete the SSODA without being revoked: [ ] Kidnapping Offense - I committed  Kidnapping in the First or Second Degree, or  Unlawful Imprisonment, as defined in RCW  Title 9A.40, where the victim is a minor and I  am not the minor's parent, or any criminal  attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy to commit  the same under RCW Title 9A.28 RCW  9A.44.130 (b)(vi). [ ] Sex Offense - RCW 9A.44.130 (b)(i-v) [ ] Class A or B Sex Offense when 16 or  17 - I was 16 or 17 years of age when I  committed a Class A or B sex offense.

[ ] Rape in the Second Degree when 14  or 15 - I was 14 or 15 years old when I  committed Rape in the Second Degree. [ ] Prior Sex Offense - I committed a sex  offense and at the time [*11]  of the  offense I had a prior conviction for a sex  offense or a deferred disposition for a sex  offense, including any out of state, tribal,  or federal conviction for a sex offense. REGISTRATION WARNING FOR MULTIPLE  SEX OFFENSE ADJUDICATIONS I understand that anytime I have been  adjudicated of multiple sex offenses, a court  could require me to register as a sex offender if  the court finds by clear, cogent, and convincing  evidence that: (i) I was 14 through 17 years of  age at the time I committed a sex offense; (ii) I  did not receive a Special Sexual Offender  Disposition  Alternative  (SSODA)  under  13.40.162 for the sex offense committed, or,  that SSODA is revoked; (iii) I have been  adjudicated of multiple sex offenses involving  two or more distinct victims and in separate  counts or causes; (iv) I present a serious threat  to public safety after my last date of release  from confinement, including full-time residential  treatment, if any, or entry of disposition; and (v)  registration will lessen the serious threat to  public safety. [C] DNA TESTING: Pursuant to RCW 43.43.754, if  this crime involves a felony, an offense which  requires sex or kidnapping offender registration, or  any of the following [*12]  offenses: stalking,  harassment, communication with a minor for  immoral purposes, assault in the fourth degree  where domestic violence was pleaded and proved,  assault in the fourth degree with sexual motivation,  custodial sexual misconduct in the second degree,  failure to register as a sex or kidnapping offender,  patronizing a prostitute, sexual misconduct with a  minor in the second degree, indecent exposure, or  violation of a sexual assault protection order, I will  be required to have a biological sample collected  for purposes of DNA identification analysis. This  paragraph does not apply if it is established that the  Washington State Patrol crime laboratory already  has a sample from me for a qualifying offense. Page 5 of 9 [D] SCHOOL NOTIFICATION: I understand that if 1  or more of the offenses for which I am pleading  guilty is a violent offense as defined in RCW  9.94A.030, a sex offense as defined in RCW  9.94A.030, an offense under RCW chapter 9.41  (firearms/weapons), or unlawful possession or  delivery, or both, of a controlled substance in  violation of RCW chapter 69.50, then following my  adjudication of guilt, the court will provide written  notification of the adjudication to any school in  which [*13]  I was enrolled prior to adjudication, or  in which I express an intent to enroll following  adjudication, unless: (1) I have already received a  high school diploma or its equivalent; or, (2) I am  over the age of 18 and my enrollment information  cannot be obtained or I assert no intention of  enrolling in any educational program. [E]  SCHOOL  ATTENDANCE  WITH  VICTIM  PROHIBITED: I understand that if I am pleading  guilty to a sex offense, I will not be allowed to  attend any school attended by the victim or victim's  siblings. RCW 13.40.162. [F] MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE: The  crime of     has a mandatory minimum sentence of  at least     weeks of total confinement. The law does  not allow any reduction of this sentence. [G] RIGHT TO POSSESS FIREARMS: [JUDGE  MUST  READ  THE  FOLLOWING  TO  THE  OFFENDER]: I have been informed that if I am  pleading guilty to any offense that is classified as:  (1) a felony, or (2) any of the following crimes when  committed by 1 family or household member  against another or by 1 intimate partner against  another: assault in the fourth degree, coercion,  stalking, reckless endangerment, criminal trespass  in the first degree, or violation of the provisions of a  protection  order [*14]   or  no-contact  order  restraining the person or excluding the person from  a residence, or (3) harassment committed by 1  family or household member against another or by  1 intimate partner against another, committed on or  after June 7, 2018; that I may not possess, own, or  have under my control any firearm and, under  federal law, any firearm or ammunition, unless my  right to do so has been restored by the court in  which I am adjudicated or the superior court in  Washington State where I live, and by a federal  court if required. [H] FIREARMS POSSESSION OR COMMISSION  WHILE ARMED: [i] Minimum 10 Days for Possession under Age  18: I understand that since the offense I am  pleading guilty to includes possession of a  firearm in violation of RCW 9.41.040(2)(a)(v),  and pursuant to RCW 13.40.193, the judge will  impose a mandatory minimum disposition of 10  days of confinement which must be served in  total confinement, without possibility of release,  until a minimum of 10 days has been served. [ii] Unlawful Possession with Stolen Firearm: I  understand that if the offenses I am pleading  guilty to include both a conviction under RCW  9.41.040 for unlawful possession of a firearm in  the first or second degree [*15]  and 1 or more  convictions for the felony crimes of theft of a  firearm or possession of a stolen firearm, that  the sentences imposed for these crimes shall  be served consecutively to each other. A  consecutive sentence will also be imposed for  each firearm unlawfully possessed. [iii] Armed During Commission of Any Offense:  I understand that if the offense I am pleading  guilty to includes a finding that either I or my  accomplice was armed with a firearm during  the commission of the offense, that the  standard range disposition shall be determined  pursuant to RCW 13.40.160, unless the judge  finds a manifest injustice, in which case the  disposition shall be determined pursuant to  RCW 13.40.193(3). Such confinement will run  consecutive to any other sentence that may be  imposed. [iv] Armed During Commission of a Felony: I  further understand that the offense I am  pleading guilty to includes a finding that either  myself or my accomplice was armed with a  firearm during the commission of a felony  (other than possession of a machine gun,  possession of a stolen firearm, drive-by  shooting,  theft  of  a  firearm,  unlawful  possession of a firearm in the first or second  degree, or use of a machine gun in [*16]  a  felony) and, therefore, unless the felony is a  ""violent offense"" as defined in RCW 9.94A.030,  committed when I was 16 or 17 years old, the  following  mandatory  periods  of  total  confinement will be added to my sentence: For  a class A felony, six (6) months; for a class B  felony, four (4) months; and for a class C  felony, two (2) months. If the felony is a ""violent  offense"" as defined in RCW 9.94A.030,  Page 6 of 9 committed when I was 16 or 17 years old, then  a period of 12 months will be added to my  sentence.  Such  confinement  will  run  consecutive to any other sentence that may be  imposed. [v] Armed During Violent Offense at Age 16 or  17 with Gang Involvement: I further understand  that the offense I am pleading guilty to includes  a finding that (a) I was 16 or 17 years old  during the commission of a robbery in the first  degree, drive-by shooting, burglary in the first  degree, or any ""violent offense"" as defined in  RCW 9.94A.030, (b) during commission of the  offense, I was armed with a firearm, and (c) my  participation in the offense was related to  membership in a criminal street gang or  advanced the benefit, aggrandizement, gain,  profit, or other advantage for a criminal street  gang; therefore, [*17]  a period of 3 months will  be added to my sentence. Such confinement  will run consecutive to any other sentence that  may be imposed. [vi] Unlawful Possession of a Firearm in the 1st  or 2nd degree: I understand that if I am  pleading guilty to unlawful possession of a  firearm in the 1st or 2nd degree, I must  participate in a ""qualifying program,"" unless  there is no such program available or the court  makes a written finding based on the juvenile  court risk assessment that participation in the  program would not be appropriate. A qualifying  program means an aggression replacement  training program, a functional family therapy  program, or another cost-beneficial, evidence,  or  research-based  approved  program  applicable to the juvenile firearm offender  population. [I]  FELONY  FIREARM  OFFENDER  REGISTRATION: I am subject to court-ordered  felony firearm offender registration pursuant to  RCW  9.41.330.  The  specific  registration  requirements are located in the ""Felony Firearm  Offender Registration"" attachment. 13. I understand that the prosecuting attorney will make  the following recommendation to the judge:     14. I understand that the probation counselor will make  the following recommendation to the [*18]  judge:     15. Although the judge will consider recommendations  of the prosecuting attorney and the probation officer, the  judge may impose any sentence that they feel is  appropriate, up to the maximum allowed by law. 16. I plead guilty to count     in the     Information. I have  received a copy of that Information. 17. I make this plea freely and voluntarily. No one has  threatened to harm me or anyone else to get me to  plead guilty. 18. No one has made any promises to make me plead  guilty, except as written in this statement. 19.

[ ] The crime(s) was (were) committed against  intimate partner(s):     (name(s)). [ ] [No statement made.] Instead of making a  statement, I agree that the judge may review the  police reports and/or a statement of probable cause  supplied by the prosecution to establish a factual  basis for the plea, including a determination of my  relationship to each victim as: [ ] family or household member(s):       (name(s)). [ ] intimate partner(s): [*19]      (name(s)). 20. I have read or someone has read to me everything  printed above, and in Attachment ""A,"" if applicable, and I  understand it in full.

"J.G. v. Northbrook Indus., 619 F. Supp. 3d 1228","[*1231]  ORDER This case is before the Court on Defendant's Second  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint for Damages  (Doc. 37). Having carefully considered the parties'  positions and the applicable law, the Court enters the  following order. I. Background Plaintiff, proceeding anonymously as J.G., alleges that  in 2018 and 2019, she was trafficked for sex as a minor  while residing at the United Inn, a hotel owned,  operated, maintained, controlled, and managed by  Defendant Northbrook Industries, Inc. (""Northbrook"").  (Compl. ¶¶ 8-10, 20.) Plaintiff contends that while  staying at the United Inn, she exhibited numerous well- known and visible signs, characteristics, and behaviors  common to minor sex trafficking [**2]  victims, including  her age and appearance, ""physical deterioration, poor  hygiene, fatigue, sleep deprivation, injuries, a failure to  make eye contact with others . . . loitering, and soliciting  male patrons."" (Id. ¶ 23.) She allegedly stayed at the  United  [*1232]  Inn for up to two weeks at a time in the  company of various, adult men. (Id. ¶¶ 28, 31.) She  allegedly lacked ""control of or possession of money.""  (Id. ¶ 23.) Plaintiff would also allegedly interact with  United Inn staff while wearing ""little clothing"" in ""rooms  replete with evidence of sex trafficking."" (Id. ¶ 29.) Plaintiff alleges that dozens of adult men—sometimes  more than eight in one day—visited the rooms in which  Plaintiff was trafficked to purchase sex. (Id. ¶¶ 23, 25.)  These men allegedly arrived at the hotel in view of the  hotel's lobby, which had a large window facing the  parking lot. (Id. ¶ 25.) According to Plaintiff, other  women and minors were also sex trafficked at the  United Inn while Plaintiff was there. (Id. ¶ 24.) Plaintiff  Page 2 of 8 further alleges that her sex traffickers ""carried weapons  and operated openly"" on the hotel's premises, common  areas, and approaches. (Id. ¶ 20.) Throughout her stays  at the United Inn, Plaintiff [**3]  allegedly walked around  the hotel premises and common area, (again) ""often""  wearing ""little clothing,"" even during periods when  school was in session for children of Plaintiff's age. (Id.  ¶ 31.) Plaintiff's rooms at the United Inn allegedly contained  condoms, drugs, weapons, and a large number of  towels, sheets, and tissues. (Id. ¶ 26.) Plaintiff contends  that on more than one occasion, Northbrook employees  entered  Plaintiff's  room  (for  example,  when  housekeeping staff cleaned the room) and knew or  should have known that the contents of her room were  indicative of commercial sex activity. (Id. ¶ 27.) Plaintiff further alleges that the persons involved in  trafficking her for sex had previously rented rooms at the  United Inn for sex trafficking purposes. (Id. ¶ 37.)  Moreover, Plaintiff asserts that Northbrook's employees  acted as lookouts for Plaintiff's sex traffickers, alerting  them to police activity at the hotel as well as warning  about guest complaints and high visitor traffic drawing  unwanted attention. (Id. ¶ 39.) Plaintiff alleges at least  one of her sex traffickers paid Northbrook's employees  to act as lookouts. (Id. ¶ 40.) Ultimately, Plaintiff alleges  that Northbrook, which [**4]  received revenue from  room rentals, knew or should have known that she was  a victim of trafficking based on her appearance, her  behavior, and the number of adult men coming and  going from her hotel room. (Id. ¶¶ 41, 43.) II. Procedural History On December 28, 2020, Plaintiff filed this suit against  Northbrook alleging two causes of action: (1) violation of  the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act  (""TVPRA""), and (2) common law negligence. (Doc. 1.)  On February 12, 2021, Northbrook filed a motion to  dismiss Plaintiff's claims. (Doc. 15.) On July 30, 2021,  the Court stayed the case while the Eleventh Circuit  Court of Appeals considered a case with similar  allegations, Doe #1 v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714  (11th Cir. 2021). (Doc. 31.) On December 22, 2021, the  Eleventh Circuit issued its decision, and, on December  30, 2021, the Court reopened this case and directed  Northbrook  to  re-file  its  motion  to  dismiss  in  consideration of the Eleventh Circuit's decision. (Doc.  36.) Northbrook then filed its second motion to dismiss  on January 12, 2022. (Doc. 37.) Plaintiff submitted a  response (Doc. 39) to which Northbrook replied (Doc.  41). The motion is now ripe for review. III. Legal Standard In evaluating a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of  Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the [**5]  Court ""accept[s] the  allegations in the complaint as true and constru[es]  them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff."" Traylor  v. P'ship Title Co., 491 F. App'x 988, 989 (11th Cir.  2012). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2)  [*1233]   provides that a pleading must contain ""a short and plain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief."" Although detailed factual allegations  are not required, the pleading must contain more than  ""labels and conclusions"" or a ""formulaic recitation of the  elements of a cause of action."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556  U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868  (2009). Importantly, ""a complaint must contain sufficient  factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to  relief that is plausible on its face.'"" Id. (quoting Bell Atl.  Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955,  167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). For a complaint to be  ""plausible on its face,"" the facts alleged must ""allo[w] the  court to draw the reasonable inference that the  defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged."" Wooten  v. Quicken Loans, Inc. 626 F.3d 1187, 1196 (11th Cir.  2010). While all well-pleaded facts must be accepted as  true and construed in the light most favorable to the  plaintiff, Powell v. Thomas, 643 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th  Cir. 2011), a court need not accept as true the plaintiff's  legal conclusions, including those couched as factual  allegations, Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Accordingly, evaluation of a motion to dismiss entails a  two-pronged approach: (1) a court must identify any  allegations in the pleading that are merely legal  conclusions to which the [**6]  ""assumption of truth""  should not apply, and (2) where there are remaining  well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should ""assume  their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly  give rise to an entitlement to relief."" Id. at 679. IV. Discussion In its motion, Northbrook contends that Plaintiff's  TVPRA and negligence claims fail as a matter of law  and should be dismissed. The Court addresses these  claims in turn. Page 3 of 8 A. TVPRA Claim The Trafficking Victims Protections Reauthorization Act  (""TVPRA"") offers a civil remedy to people who have  experienced certain types of human trafficking. 18  U.S.C. § 1595(a). The statute states in part: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. Under the TVRPA, therefore, a victim of sex trafficking  may bring either (a) a direct civil claim against the  perpetrator of their trafficking or (b) a ""beneficiary"" [**7]   civil  claim  against  ""whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in violation of  [the TVPRA]."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). In this case, Plaintiff  is not suing the perpetrator of her trafficking; instead,  she  seeks  to  establish  beneficiary  liability  on  Northbrook, a business that she claims knowingly  benefited from sex trafficking. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, in Doe #1 v. Red  Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714 (11th Cir. 2021),  articulated the elements of a TVPRA beneficiary claim.  To state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that the  defendant:  [*1234]  (1) knowingly benefited, (2) from taking  part in a common undertaking or enterprise  involving  risk  and  potential  profit,  (3)  that  undertaking or enterprise violated the TVPRA as to  the plaintiff, and (4) the defendant had constructive  or actual knowledge that the undertaking or  enterprise violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff. Id. at 726. In order for Plaintiff's TVPRA beneficiary claim to  survive Northbrook's motion to dismiss, Plaintiff must  plausibly allege facts sufficient to satisfy each of these  four elements. For the following reasons, the Court  finds [**8]  that her complaint does so. 1. Element One: ""Knowingly Benefited"" To satisfy the first element of a TVPRA beneficiary  claim, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant ""knew it  was receiving some value from participating in the  alleged venture."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 724. Here,  Plaintiff's complaint alleges that Northbrook collected  revenue from the rental of the rooms in which Plaintiff  was trafficked for sex. (Compl. ¶ 36.) Specifically,  Plaintiff alleges that Northbrook, as the owner and  operator of the United Inn, knowingly received a  percentage of the revenue generated from the rate  charged and paid for the rooms in which Plaintiff was  trafficked. (Id. ¶ 75.) Several district courts, including  this one, have found that the rental of a room constitutes  a financial benefit from a relationship with the trafficker  sufficient to meet this element of the § 1595(a)  standard. A.G. v. Northbrook Indus., Inc, 2022 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 93264., 1:20-CV-05231-JPB, 2022 U.S. Dist.  Lexis 93264, 2022 WL 1644921, at *2 (N.D. Ga.) G.W.  v. Northbrook Indus., Inc., 1:20-CV-05232-JPB, 2022  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93263, 2022 WL 1644923, at *2 (N.D.  Ga.); M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F.  Supp.3d 959, 965 (S.D. Ohio 2019); S.Y. v. Naples  Hotel Co., 476 F. Supp.3d 1251, 1257 (M.D. Fla. 2020)  (collecting cases). The Court agrees that such an  allegation is sufficient to satisfy this element. Therefore,  Plaintiff plausibly alleges the first element of her TVPRA  beneficiary claim. 2. Element Two: Participation in a Venture Next, Plaintiff must allege that Northbrook ""participat[ed]  in a venture"" [**9]  under circumstances that would  violate the TVPRA. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). In the context  of a civil suit, the Eleventh Circuit has defined  ""participation in a venture"" as ""t[aking] part in a common  undertaking or enterprise involving risk and potential  profit."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Unlike in the  criminal provisions of the TVPRA, there is no scienter  requirement for civil TVPRA beneficiary claims. Id. at  724. In other words, a plaintiff need not show that the  defendant ""knowingly facilitated a violation"" under the  TVPRA. Id. To determine what conduct does and does not reach  the level of ""participation in a venture,"" the Court looks  to the Eleventh Circuit's analysis in Red Roof Inns. In  that case, the plaintiffs were sex trafficking victims who  sued the franchisors of the hotels at which they were  trafficked. Id. at 719. To show that the franchisors  participated in a sex trafficking venture with the plaintiffs'  sex traffickers, the plaintiffs alleged that the franchisors  received revenue from renting rooms to the sex  Page 4 of 8 traffickers, oversaw operations and hotel policies,  controlled the training of managers, and ""took remedial  action when revenue was down."" Id. at 726-27. The only  allegations the plaintiffs made as to the franchisors'  knowledge or participation [**10]  in the sex trafficking  venture were that ""the franchisors sent inspectors to the  hotels who would have seen signs of sex trafficking"" and  the franchisors ""received reviews mentioning sex work  occurring at the hotels.""  [*1235]  Id. at 727. The  Eleventh Circuit deemed these allegations to be  insufficient to establish the franchisors' participation in a  common undertaking or enterprise with the plaintiffs' sex  traffickers, stating that ""observing something is not the  same as participating in it."" Id. Although plaintiffs in Red Roof Inns failed plausibly to  allege facts that satisfied the second element of a  TVPRA beneficiary claim, the Eleventh Circuit in that  case provided insight into the kind of conduct that, if  alleged, would pass muster under the TVPRA. For  example, the court endorsed the holding in Ricchio v.  McLean, 853 F.3d 553 (1st Cir. 2017), a First Circuit  case in which a sex trafficking victim's suit against the  operators of the hotel where she was held hostage and  sexually abused survived a motion to dismiss. In  Ricchio, the First Circuit concluded that the plaintiff had  adequately alleged the hotel operators' association with  a sex trafficking venture because the plaintiff's abuser  ""had prior commercial dealings with the [operators],  which the [**11]  parties wished to reinstate for profit.""  Id. at 555. Further, the Ricchio plaintiff alleged that, by  renting a room to her abuser, the hotel operators were  ""associating with him in an effort to force [the plaintiff] to  serve their business objective."" Id. The Eleventh Circuit  in Red Roof Inns determined that ""these kinds of  allegations  would  establish  a  hotel  operator's  participation in a venture with a sex trafficker."" 21 F.4th  at 725-26. This Court additionally finds persuasive the concurring  opinion in Red Roof Inns, in which Judge Jordan drew a  distinction between a franchisor and a hotel operator in  the context of a TVPRA case. Id. at 729-30. Specifically,  the concurring opinion underscored that the Eleventh  Circuit's ""opinion addresses the plaintiffs' TVPRA  'beneficiary' claims against franchisors, which do not  operate or manage the hotels at which sex trafficking  allegedly occurred."" Id. at 729. But, ""similar claims  against those who own, operate, or manage the hotels  in question . . . would withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion  to dismiss."" Id. Courts in other districts have similarly grappled with the  question of what conduct constitutes a defendant's  participation in a venture under § 1595(a). In reviewing  these  cases,  the  factor  that  appears  to  differentiate [**12]  plaintiffs who adequately state  TVPRA beneficiary claims from those who do not is that  the successful plaintiffs ""connect the dots"" between the  plaintiff's particular experience as a victim of trafficking  and the specific defendant in the case. See, e.g., > G.G.  v. Salesforce.com, Inc. No. 20-cv-02335, 2022 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 87616, 2022 WL 1541408, at *12 (N.D. Ill.  May 16, 2022); B.M. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.  No. 20-cv-00656-BLF, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494,  2020 WL 4368214, at *5 (N.D. Cal. July 30, 2020). One way to connect the dots is to allege a ""direct  association"" between the beneficiary and the plaintiff's  trafficker. See G.G., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87616, 2022  WL 1541408, at *12; J.B. v. G6 Hosp., LLC, No. 19-cv- 07848-HSG, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151213, 2020 WL  4901196, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 20, 2020). Another way  is to show a ""continuous business relationship"" between  a defendant hotel and a sex trafficker where the  defendants rented rooms to people it knew or should  have known were engaged in sex trafficking. See  Northbrook, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93264, 2022 WL  1644921, at *3 (finding such conduct sufficient to show  participation in a venture); S.Y. v. Best Western Int'l,  Inc., 2:20-cv-616-JES-MRM, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  106139, 2021 WL 2315073, at *4 (M.D. Fla. June 7,  2021) (same); M.A., 425 F. Supp.3d at 971 (same); H.H.  v. G6 Hosp., LLC, No. 2:19-cv-755, 2019 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *5 (S.D. Ohio  Dec. 6, 2019) (same); Ricchio, 853 F.3d at 555 (looking  to ""prior commercial dealings . . . which the parties  wished to reinstate for profit"" as evidence of the hotel  defendant's participation in a venture).  [*1236]   Here,  Plaintiff  has  plausibly  alleged  Northbrook's participation in a venture with the persons  who were engaged in trafficking Plaintiff for sex. Unlike  in Red Roof Inns (which involved defendant hotel  franchisors), Plaintiff brings her TVPRA beneficiary  claim against the operator of the hotel [**13]  in which  she was allegedly trafficked—an operator that was  closely involved with the daily management of the hotel  and allegedly did far more than simply receive revenue  and reviews mentioning sex work. (See Compl. ¶ 10.) Further, Plaintiff has asserted facts sufficient to allege  both a ""direct association"" and a ""continuous business  relationship"" between Northbrook and her traffickers.  (See id. ¶¶ 11, 37, 39-40.) As for the ""direct  association,""  Plaintiff  alleges  that  ""Northbrook's  Page 5 of 8 employees, agents, and/or representatives"" assisted  those who trafficked Plaintiff by ""acting as lookouts for  Plaintiff's traffickers and informing the traffickers of  police activity at the hotel as well as warning Plaintiff's  traffickers about guest complaints and high visitor traffic  drawing unwanted attention."" (Id. ¶ 39.) Plaintiff further  alleges that at least one of her traffickers paid  Northbrook's employees, agents, and/or representatives  to act as lookouts and to notify the trafficker of police  activity at the hotel. (Id. ¶ 40.) These allegations directly  link specific conduct of Northbrook employees to the  advancement of the sex trafficking operation and, as  such, are sufficient to satisfy the [**14]  second element  of the TVPRA beneficiary claim. Plaintiff, however, goes further. She also alleges a  ""continuous business relationship"" akin to the one  described in Ricchio. Plaintiff alleges that her traffickers  had previously rented rooms at the United Inn to traffic  women for sex, and Northbrook should have known that  the traffickers were back again to engage in sex  trafficking with Plaintiff. (Id. ¶¶ 11, 37.) In support of the  ""continuous business relationship"" theory, Plaintiff  specifically asserts that: she and other sex trafficking  victims at the United Inn exhibited obvious signs,  characteristics, and behaviors of minor victims of sex  trafficking such as ""inappropriate"" appearance, physical  deterioration, poor hygiene, fatigue, sleep deprivation,  injuries, loitering, and soliciting male patrons (Id. ¶¶ 23- 24); her sex traffickers carried weapons and ""operated  openly"" on the hotel's premises, common areas, and  approaches (Id. ¶ 20); dozens of adult men—and  sometimes more than eight in one day—came to  Plaintiff's room ""in view of the hotel's lobby"" to purchase  sex (Id. ¶¶ 22-25); Plaintiff would interact with United Inn  staff while wearing ""little clothing"" (Id. ¶ 29); and, on  multiple [**15]  occasions, United Inn staff entered  Plaintiff's room, which contained condoms, drugs,  weapons, and a large number of towels, sheets, and  tissues (Id. ¶¶ 26-27). As in Northbrook, >S.Y., >M.A.,  >H.H., and Ricchio (cited above), these allegations are  sufficient to plausibly allege at this stage of the case that  Northbrook participated in a venture with Plaintiff's  traffickers by renting rooms to people it knew or should  have known were engaging in sex trafficking. The foregoing allegations, which are indicative of  Northbrook's  alleged  common  undertaking  with  Plaintiff's sex traffickers, distinguish this case from a  recent case in this district in which a plaintiff failed to  state a TVPRA beneficiary claim. In A.B. v. H.K. Grp. of  Co., 1:21-cv-1344-TCB, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29214,  2022 WL 467786 (N.D. Ga.), a plaintiff failed to plausibly  allege a hotel owner/manager's participation in a sex  trafficking venture. In that case, the plaintiff alleged  only that the defendants  [*1237]  observed the plaintiff's  physical appearance and the condition of her room, and  that by failing to assist her or alert authorities, the  defendants participated in a sex trafficking venture.  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29214, 2022 WL 467786, at *10- 11. The Court dismissed the plaintiff's TVPRA claim,  finding  that,  at  most,  plaintiff  alleged [**16]   ""[d]efendants  observed  and/or  had  actual  or  constructive knowledge of the illegality of sex trafficking  allegedly occurring in its hotels."" 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  29214, 2022 WL 467786, at *10-11. Here, by contrast,  Plaintiff's  allegations—namely,  that  Northbrook  employees were paid to assist Plaintiff's sex traffickers  by acting as lookouts, and that Northbrook previously  rented rooms to Plaintiff's sex traffickers and rented to  them again despite having constructive knowledge of  their intent to traffic Plaintiff—go far beyond mere  observation of potential sex trafficking. Notwithstanding these allegations, Northbrook believes  the Court should discount Plaintiff's alleged facts with  respect to the ""participation in a venture"" element for  two reasons. First, Northbrook contends that Plaintiff  makes only ""boilerplate allegations,"" and does so ""on  'information and belief,' without any factual basis."" (Doc.  37-1 at 12.) The Court is not convinced by this  argument. On the contrary, the allegations discussed  above contain specific details of Northbrook's alleged  conduct that are not mere formulaic recitations of  elements—especially when viewing all allegations in the  light most favorable to Plaintiff, as the Court [**17]  must  do on a 12(b)(6) motion. Further, as stated in a case  Northbrook cites in favor of its position, ""Twombly's  'plausibility' standard d[oes] not prevent a plaintiff from  pleading facts based upon information and belief, 'where  the facts are peculiarly within the possession and  control of the defendant.'"" Boateng v. Retirement Corp.  of Am. Partners, L.P., No. 1:12-cv-01959-JOF, 2013  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 197898, 2013 WL 12061901, at *4  (N.D. Ga. March 5, 2013) (quoting Arista Records, LLC  v. Doe 3, 604 F.3d 110, 120 (2d. Cir. 2010)). Here,  Plaintiff, a victim of underage sex trafficking, likely has  uniquely inferior access to the facts in Northbrook's  possession at this point in the litigation. Accordingly, it       Page 6 of 8 would be inconsistent with the Twombly framework to  discount Plaintiff's allegations solely on account of some  of them being based ""on information and belief."" Second, Northbrook contends that, to the extent  Northbrook employees took part in a common enterprise  with Plaintiff's sex traffickers, such conduct was outside  the scope of their employment and cannot be imputed to  Northbrook. Northbrook may ultimately be correct in this  assertion, but discovery will be necessary to elucidate  the relevant facts. It would be premature at the 12(b)(6)  stage for the Court to dismiss on these grounds. See  Johnson St. Props., LLC v. Clure, 302 Ga. 51, 805  S.E.2d 60, 66 (Ga. 2017) (""Typically, questions of the  existence and extent of an agent's authority are  generally for the triers of [**18]  fact"") (internal quotation  marks omitted); see also Amin v. Mercedes-Benz USA,  LLC, 349 F. Supp.3d 1338, 1357 (N.D. Ga. 2018). Because Plaintiff asserts specific facts as to Northbrook  taking part in a common undertaking or enterprise  involving risk or potential profit with her sex traffickers,  she has plausibly alleged the second element of her  TVPRA claim.  [*1238]  3. Element Three: The Venture Violated the  TVPRA as to Plaintiff To satisfy the third element, the plaintiff must allege that  ""the venture in which the defendant participated and  from which it knowingly benefited must have violated the  TVPRA as to the plaintiff."" Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at  725. The TVPRA criminalizes various acts of human  trafficking. 18 U.S.C. § 1591. In this case, Plaintiff  specifically alleges that she was trafficked in violation of  § 1591(a), which makes it a crime to ""caus[e]"" a person  under 18 years old to ""engage in a commercial sex act.""  (Compl. ¶ 8); 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Consequently,  Plaintiff must plausibly allege that the venture in which              Northbrook participated caused Plaintiff to engage in a  commercial sex act. 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a); Northbrook,  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93264, 2022 WL 1644921, at *3. The Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations are more than  sufficient to show that the venture alleged in the  complaint violated the TVPRA as to Plaintiff. Plaintiff  alleges, and Northbrook does not dispute, [**19]  that  she was sex trafficked as a minor and was caused to  engage in commercial sex acts with dozens of adult  men from 2018 to 2019. (Compl. ¶¶ 17, 25.) As a result,  Plaintiff has satisfied the third element of her TVPRA  beneficiary claim. See Northbrook, 2022 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 93264, 2022 WL 1644921, at *3 (finding  substantially similar allegations sufficient to satisfy the  third TVPRA element). 4. Element Four: Defendant Knew or Should Have  Known the Venture Violated the TVPRA as to  Plaintiff The final element of a TVPRA beneficiary claim comes  from the statutory requirement that the defendant ""knew  or should have known [that the venture] has engaged in  an act in violation of this chapter."" 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a).  This requires the plaintiff to allege that the defendant  had either actual or constructive knowledge that the  venture violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff. Red Roof  Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. Knowledge is defined as ""a[n]  awareness or understanding of a fact or circumstance.""  Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725 (quoting Knowledge,  Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019)). Constructive  knowledge, on the other hand, is ""that knowledge which  'one using reasonable care or diligence should have.'""  Id. (quoting Constructive Knowledge, Black's Law  Dictionary (11th ed. 2019)). Thus, Plaintiff must  plausibly allege that Northbrook had [**20]  at least  constructive knowledge that the venture in which it  participated and from which it benefited violated the  TVPRA as to Plaintiff. Red Roof Inns, 21 F.4th at 725. The Court finds that Plaintiff has adequately alleged that  Northbrook had actual or constructive knowledge of  Plaintiff's sex trafficking at the United Inn. In Plaintiff's  complaint, she alleges that Northbrook knew or should  have known about the sex trafficking venture based on  the following: ""[Plaintiff's] age and inappropriate  appearance, physical deterioration, poor hygiene,  fatigue, sleep deprivation, injuries, a failure to make eye  contact with others, no control of or possession of  money, loitering, and soliciting male patrons."" (Compl. ¶  23.) Also relevant to this element are Plaintiff's  Page 7 of 8 allegations that she interacted with United Inn staff while  exhibiting the above signs and characteristics of  trafficking (Id. ¶ 29); dozens of adult men visited  Plaintiff's room (Id. ¶ 25); Plaintiff's sex traffickers  ""carried weapons and operated openly and brazenly on  the hotel's premises, common areas, and approaches""  (Id. ¶ 20); and Plaintiff's room,  [*1239]  which  Northbrook employees entered on more than one  occasion,  contained  condoms,  drugs,  weapons,  and [**21]  many towels, sheets, and tissues (Id. ¶¶ 26- 27). Significantly, Plaintiff also alleges that her sex  traffickers had previously trafficked victims at the United  Inn and some of Northbrook's employees acted as  lookouts for Plaintiff's traffickers. (Id. ¶¶ 37, 39.) Courts  considering similar allegations have found them  sufficient to infer at this stage of the case that a  defendant knew or should have known of the sex  trafficking venture, and this Court finds these allegations  sufficient as well. Northbrook, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  93264, 2022 WL 1644921, at *4; S.Y., 476 F. Supp.3d  at 1257 (collecting cases). As explained in the preceding paragraphs, Plaintiff has  sufficiently alleged facts to support each element of her  TVPRA beneficiary claim. B. Negligence Claim Plaintiff brings a negligence claim against Northbrook,  alleging that she was an invitee on Northbrook's  premises and that Northbrook breached its duty to her  by failing to exercise reasonable care in the operation of  the United Inn. (Compl. ¶¶ 84-111.) Northbrook  contends it owed no duty to Plaintiff and seeks to  dismiss Plaintiff's negligence claim on two grounds: (1)  Plaintiff fails to plausibly allege that she was an invitee  on Northbrook's premises, and (2) Plaintiff was not on  Northbrook's premises ""for any lawful [**22]  purpose."" 1. Whether Plaintiff Was an Invitee on Northbrook's  Premises With respect to Northbrook's invitee argument, the Court  finds at this preliminary stage of the litigation that  Plaintiff has plausibly alleged her status as an invitee on  Northbrook's premises. The duty of an owner or  occupier of land to invitees on its premises is prescribed  by O.C.G.A. § 51-3-1 which states as follows: Duty of owner or occupier of land to invitee. Where  an owner or occupier of land, by express or implied  invitation, induces or leads others to come upon his  premises for any lawful purpose, he is liable in  damages to such persons for injuries caused by his  failure to exercise ordinary care in keeping the  premises and approaches safe. O.C.G.A. § 51-3-1. The test to determine whether one is an invitee is  ""whether the party coming onto the business premises  had present business relations with the owner or  occupier which would render his presence of mutual  benefit to both, or whether his presence was for his own  convenience, or was for business with one other than  the owner or occupier."" Freeman v. Eicholz, 705 S.E.2d  919, 923 (Ga. App. 2011). The facts in this case as averred in Plaintiff's complaint  do not make for a straightforward determination of  Plaintiff's status on Northbrook's premises. [**23]  See  A.B., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29214, 2022 WL 467786, at  *5. Plaintiff alleges that, although her traffickers were  the ones who rented the rooms in which she stayed,  Northbrook owed Plaintiff a duty as an invitee on its  premises. (Compl. ¶¶ 35, 86.) There is no question that  one who rents a hotel room is an invitee on the hotel's  premises. See, e.g., Briddle v. Cornerstone Lodge of  Am., LLC, 288 Ga. App. 353, 654 S.E.2d 188, 189 (Ga.  App. 2007). However, Georgia law appears at best  unsettled as to whether a hotel invitee's guest is an  invitee, licensee, or something else. This classification is  of paramount importance because it dictates the scope  of the duty owed to the guest. See Martin v. Six Flags  Over Ga. II, L.P., 301 Ga. 323, 801 S.E.2d 24, 29 (Ga.  2017). The Court observes that in most circumstances, an  invitee's guest stands in the invitee's shoes and is  herself an invitee. See 43A C.J.S. Inns, Hotels, and  Eating  [*1240]  Places § 47 (2021) (""Persons who  respond to an invitation, either express or implied, to  visit or call on registered guests of an inn at proper  times are invitees . . . .""); Anderson v. Cooper, 214 Ga.  164, 104 S.E.2d 90 (Ga. 1958) (holding that parent- customer's infant child was an invitee because the  parent would not have been present at the business if  she could not bring her child—thus the business owner  benefitted from the child's presence); Cham v. ECI  Mgmt. Corp., 311 Ga. 170, 856 S.E.2d 267, 279 (Ga.  2021) (Peterson, J., dissenting) (noting that similar to  Anderson, where it was ""'obvious' that a store owner  would [**24]  receive a benefit from permitting an  invitee's guest to be present,"" in the case under  consideration, ""when renters are allowed to host guests,  the guests are thus implicitly invited by the landlord"");  Page 8 of 8 Ortner v. Linch, 128 So.2d 152, 153 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.  1960) (""a guest of a guest in the hotel"" has ""the status of  . . . an invitee."" (citing Steinberg v. Irwin Operating Co.,  90 So.2d 460, 461 (Fla. 1956))); Corinaldi v. Columbia  Courtyard, Inc., 162 Md. App. 207, 873 A.2d 483, 491  (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2005) (""Generally, a property owner  owes the same duty to the guest of an invitee as it owes  to the invitee himself.""); Mackey v. Allen, 396 S.W.2d  55, 58 (Ky. Ct. App. 1965) (""[B]ecause her visit to the  premises was 'for the convenience or arose out of the  necessities' of another person who definitely was in the  [business] for purposes of the possessor's business,"" ""a  business invitee's guest is also an invitee.""). Considering Georgia law and the settled law of other  jurisdictions, the Court holds that at this preliminary  stage, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that—as the  guest of an invitee—she was herself an invitee. 2. Whether Plaintiff Was Induced Onto Northbrook's  Premises ""For Any Lawful Purpose"" Northbrook argues that O.C.G.A. § 51-3-1 requires that,  in order to be an invitee entitled to a duty of care, a  person must be on the subject premises ""for any lawful  purpose."" Because Plaintiff was on Northbrook's  premises for sex trafficking (i.e., an unlawful purpose),  Northbrook [**25]  posits, Plaintiff was not entitled to the  duty of care owed to invitees. Northbrook misconstrues O.C.G.A. § 51-3-1. The  statute does not preclude those who commit—or are  victims of—unlawful acts from being invitees; rather, the  plain language of the statute applies when the ""owner or  occupier of land, by express or implied invitation,  induces or leads others to come upon his premises for  any lawful purpose."" O.C.G.A. § 51-3-1 (emphasis  added); see Stephens v. Clairmont Ctr., Inc., 230 Ga.  App. 793, 498 S.E.2d 307, 309 (Ga. App. 1998) (noting  that assailants ""posing as customers"" had ""entered the  shop as business invitees, not intruders""). Thus, the  question is not whether Plaintiff engaged in unlawful  activity while on Northbrook's property. Instead, the  relevant inquiry is whether Northbrook induced or led  Plaintiff to come upon its property for a lawful purpose. Plaintiff, in alleging her status as an invitee, suggests  Northbrook invited her onto its property for a lawful  purpose. Northbrook, however, believes that this invitee  argument is irreconcilable with Plaintiff's contention that  Northbrook participated in a venture with Plaintiff's  traffickers and ""Northbrook knew or should have known  the venture engaged in acts in violation of the TVPRA.""  (Compl. ¶ 78.) The Court acknowledges the potential  inconsistency [**26]   between  these  positions.  Nonetheless, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 provides  that, ""[a] party may state as many separate claims or  defenses as it has, regardless of consistency."" FED. R.  CIV. P. 8(d)(3); see Smith v. Haynes & Haynes P.C.,  940 F.3d 635, 647 (11th Cir. 2019) (""[W]e explicitly  permit litigants to assert  [*1241]  inconsistent positions  when pleading their case.""). As such, the Court is  unwilling to dismiss Plaintiff's negligence claim pursuant  to O.C.G.A. § 51-3-1 before the record has been  developed. Discovery will shed light on facts pertinent to  the relationships between Plaintiff, Northbrook, and  Plaintiff's traffickers, and those facts will guide the  ultimate determination of whether an invitor-invitee  relationship existed between Northbrook and Plaintiff.  The Court declines, at this early point in the litigation, to  find Plaintiff's negligence claim deficient as a matter of  law.",0
"J.M. v. Choice Hotels Int_l, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84861","ORDER Defendant Red Roof Inns, Inc., a hotel franchisor,  moves to dismiss plaintiff J.M.'s perpetrator and direct  beneficiary  claims  under  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), 18 U.S.C. §  1595. For the reasons below, the court denies the  motion to dismiss. I. BACKGROUND The court has summarized the history of this case in a  prior order, Prior Order (Oct. 17, 2022), ECF No. 42,  and incorporates that summary by reference in this  order. As relevant here, plaintiff alleges she was [*2]   trafficked at a franchisee hotel over the span of multiple  weeks. See generally Second Am. Compl. (SAC), ECF  No. 52. She claims hotel staff not only witnessed her  being trafficked but helped her trafficker perpetrate the  crime. Id. In its prior order, the court dismissed plaintiff's  direct beneficiary liability claim with leave to amend and  allowed plaintiff to bring a perpetrator liability claim in an  amended complaint. Prior Order (Oct. 17, 2022) at 12. Plaintiff then filed a second amended complaint  containing similar facts and allegations to the first  amended complaint. Compare SAC with First Am.  Compl. (FAC), ECF No. 10. This complaint also includes  new allegations regarding defendant's relationship with  the franchisee hotel. Plaintiff claims defendant was the  primary facilitator in renting rooms at the franchisee  hotel, SAC ¶¶ 66-67; controlled data gathered from  customer Wi-Fi use, id. ¶ 68; monitored public reviews  of the hotel, id. ¶ 76; and mandated hotel employees  report criminal activity to the upper levels of defendant's  management, id. ¶¶ 80-85, 56-64. Defendant moves to  dismiss plaintiff's claims for direct beneficiary and  perpetrator liability. Notice of Mot., ECF No. [*3]  53;  Mot., ECF No. 53-1. The motion is fully briefed, Opp'n, ECF No. 61; Reply,  ECF No. 63, and the court submitted the motion on the  papers, Min. Order, ECF No. 68. II. LEGAL STANDARD A party may move to dismiss for ""failure to state a claim  upon which relief can be granted."" Fed. R. Civ. P.  12(b)(6). The motion may be granted if the complaint  lacks a ""cognizable legal theory"" or if its factual  allegations do not support a cognizable legal theory.  Godecke v. Kinetic Concepts, Inc., 937 F.3d 1201, 1208  (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting Balistreri v. Pacifica Police  Page 2 of 5 Dep't, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988)). The court  assumes all factual allegations are true and construes  ""them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving  party."" Steinle v. City of San Francisco, 919 F.3d 1154,  1160 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting Parks Sch. of Bus., Inc. v.  Symington, 51 F.3d 1480, 1484 (9th Cir. 1995)). If the  complaint's allegations do not ""plausibly give rise to an  entitlement to relief,"" the motion must be granted.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679, 129 S. Ct. 1937,  173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). A complaint need contain only a ""short and plain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief,"" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), not ""detailed  factual allegations,"" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.  544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007).  But  this  rule  demands  more  than  unadorned  accusations; ""sufficient factual matter"" must make the  claim at least plausible. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. In the  same vein, conclusory or formulaic recitations of  elements do not alone suffice. Id. (citing Twombly, 550  U.S. at 555). III. ANALYSIS The TVPRA provides both criminal and civil penalties for  sex trafficking. See 18 U.S.C. § 1591, § 1595. Section  ""1595(a) creates civil liability [*4]  for two categories of  defendants: (1) those who have themselves committed  a criminal offense under § 1591 of the TVPRA (i.e.,  perpetrator liability), and (2) those who are not  themselves subject to criminal liability but who  knowingly benefitted from participation in a venture that  they knew or should have known was committing an  offense under § 1591 of the TVPRA (i.e., beneficiary  liability)."" A.D., v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., No.  19-120, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 250759, 2020 WL  8674205, at *2 (E.D. Va. July 22, 2020) (emphasis  omitted). Plaintiffs may bring either direct or indirect  beneficiary liability claims. See J.C. v. Choice Hotels  Int'l, Inc., No. 20-00155, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073,  2020 WL 6318707, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 28, 2020). This  court previously found plaintiff pleaded a claim for  indirect, or vicarious, beneficiary liability, see Prior Order  (Oct. 17, 2022) at 8, and plaintiff again pleads this claim  again without defendant's objection. Defendant now  moves to dismiss plaintiff's claims for perpetrator and  direct beneficiary liability. A. Perpetrator Liability Civil perpetrator liability under section 1595 imputes  section 1951's elements for criminal liability. See 18  U.S.C. § 1595. Section 1951 imposes criminal sanctions  on ""whoever knowingly"" ""recruits, entices, harbors,  transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains,  patronizes, or solicits by any means a person with  knowledge that ""means of force, threats of force, fraud,  coercion described in subsection (e)(2), or any  combination of such means will be used [*5]  to cause  the person to engage in a commercial sex act."" 18  U.S.C. § 1591(a); see also Noble v. Weinstein, 335 F.  Supp. 3d 504, 514-15 (S.D.N.Y. 2018); Doe v.  FitzGerald, No. 20-10713, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  130445, 2022 WL 2784805, at *3 (C.D. Cal. May 13,  2022). As a result, plaintiffs must allege defendants  knowingly harbored or maintained a person ""with  knowledge that fraud or force would be used to cause  her to engage in a commercial sex act."" Fitzgerald, 2022  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130445, 2022 WL 2784805, at *4;  A.D., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 250759, 2020 WL 8674205,  at *2 n.1 (""Section 1591 imposes an actual knowledge  requirement""). While courts have examined civil  perpetrator liability claims, see, e.g., Fitzgerald, 2022  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130445, 2022 WL 2784805, the court  has not located any other decision interpreting the  statute's perpetrator liability provisions against a  franchisor hotel. Defendant argues plaintiff has not alleged actual  knowledge. ECF No. 55; Reply at 9. Knowledge does  not require ""certainty as to a future act"" but rather ""is a  state of mind in which the knower is familiar with a  pattern of conduct."" United States v. Todd, 627 F.3d  329, 334 (9th Cir. 2010). ""What the statute requires is  that the defendant kn[ew] in the sense of being aware of  an established modus operandi that will in the future  cause a person to engage in prostitution."" Id.; see also  Noble, 335 F. Supp. 3d at 517-18 (""Defendant enticed  Plaintiff with knowledge that means of force or fraud  would be used to cause a commercial sex act to take  place.""). Plaintiff plausibly pleads defendant's actual knowledge  of her trafficking. See Opp'n at 16. Specifically,  plaintiff [*6]  alleges franchisee hotel staff: • Took cash payments from her trafficker, SAC ¶  62;      2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84861, *3 Page 3 of 5 • Rented plaintiff and her trafficker rooms away  from other guests, id. ¶ 58; • Witnessed ""lots of male visitors coming in and out  of [her] room"" and heard ""loud noises of abuse or  other  emergency  [sic]""  including  noises  of  ""beatings, banging, crying, and screaming for help,""  id. ¶¶ 61, 62; • Witnessed ""large numbers of male visitors asking  for [her] and her trafficker at the front desk,"" id. ¶  62; • Instructed ""johns"" to ""hurry up"" as they entered  and left her room, id. ¶ 60; • Noticed ""unusual numbers of used condoms in the  garbage bins"" and signs of drug use in plaintiff's  rooms, id.¶ 62; • Saw ""visible signs of prior physical abuse"" on her  body, id.; and • Saw plaintiff solicit ""johns"" ""from the [hotel] lobby  and the parking lot,"" id. ¶ 59. These allegations make it plausible the franchisee hotel  staff knew plaintiff was being trafficked. Plaintiff says  she resided at the franchisee hotel for weeks at a time,  and the trafficking behavior was ""open and obvious to  anyone working"" there. Id. ¶¶ 37, 64. Moreover, plaintiff's allegations link the franchisee staff's  knowledge to defendant because plaintiff alleges [*7]   defendant required all employees of franchisee hotels to  report potential criminal activity or ""indices of human  trafficking"" to ""[d]efendant['s] corporate executives and  upper-level management."" Id. ¶¶ 80, 83. Based on these  allegations, the court can reasonably conclude—and  plaintiff has ""sufficiently put defendant on notice"" that  she alleges—staff followed this protocol and reported  plaintiff's trafficking to defendant. SAC ¶ 83 (""employees  . . . would have reported suspected red flags of human  trafficking to [d]efendant['s] corporate executives""); see  also Opp'n at 16; Cutera, Inc. v. Lutronic Aesthetics,  Inc., No. 2:20-00235, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153424,  2020 WL 4937129, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 24, 2020).  Taking the allegations in the light most favorable to  plaintiff and drawing reasonable inferences in her favor,  as the court must do at this early stage, plaintiff has pled  the knowledge requirement of perpetrator liability:  defendant was aware of the trafficker's ""modus  operandi,"" including the use of force, and was familiar  with the trafficker's conduct. Todd, 627 F.3d at 334. As  such, the court denies defendant's motion to dismiss  plaintiff's claim based on perpetrator liability. B. Beneficiary Liability To state a direct beneficiary claim under section 1595,  plaintiff must allege defendant (1) knowingly benefitted  (2) ""from participation in [*8]  a venture"" (3) that it ""'knew  or should have known has engaged in'"" trafficking the  plaintiff. J.C., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL  6318707, at *4 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a)). In its prior  order, the court found plaintiff plausibly alleged the first  element of this claim. Prior Order (Oct. 17, 2022) at 5-6.  The court now addresses whether plaintiff sufficiently  alleges the second and third elements. 1. Participation in a Venture In its prior order, this court applied the plain meaning of  ""participation in a venture,"" which requires plaintiffs to  ""allege that the franchisors took part in a common  undertaking or enterprise involving risk and potential  profit."" Doe #1 v. Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 725  (11th Cir. 2021). The court found plaintiff's complaint  contained  allegations  describing  only  a  general  franchisor-franchisee venture without allegations that  defendant directly participated in the sex-trafficking  venture, but observed plaintiff might be able to cure this  deficiency. Prior Order (Oct 17, 2022) at 7-8. Plaintiff's  operative complaint now specifically alleges defendant's  participation. See SAC ¶¶ 66-67, 80, 83; J.C., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at *7 (""She  therefore plausibly pleads that defendant[] directly  'participated in a venture' by providing lodging to people  it knew or should have known were engaged in her sex  trafficking."" (emphasis [*9]  in original)). As reviewed above, plaintiff alleges defendant required  franchisee hotels to report sex trafficking to upper-level  management, SAC ¶ 80, and hotel employees  ""witnessed the obvious signs of [her] trafficking,"" and  ""would have reported suspected red flags"" to defendant,  id. ¶ 83. Plaintiff plausibly pleads defendant's full  participation because she alleges ""defendant[] w[as] the  primary facilitator or participant in the renting of rooms.""  Id. ¶¶ 66-67. Defendant ""controlled booking and  payment processing for the renting of rooms at [its]  branded  properties""  and  ""required  [its]  branded  properties to use software operated and controlled by [it]  for room booking and reservations"" and credit card  processing. Id. ¶ 67. Defendant also ""fixed the price of  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84861, *6 Page 4 of 5 room rentals"" for its franchisees. Id. Thus, plaintiff  alleges defendant, in controlling the booking and  payment processing, was the entity directly renting  rooms to plaintiff's trafficker and has ""allege[d] at least a  showing of a continuous business relationship between  the trafficker and [defendant] such that it would appear  that the trafficker and [defendant] have established a  pattern of conduct or could be said to have [*10]  a tacit  agreement."" H.H v. G6 Hosp., LLC, No. 2:19-755, 2019  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *4 (S.D.  Ohio Dec. 6, 2019); see also M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels &  Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959, 971 (S.D. Ohio  2019). In response, defendant argues ""observing something is  not the same as participating in it,"" and suggests plaintiff  has not sufficiently alleged active participation in the  venture. See Mot. at 7 (citing Doe #1, 21 F.4th at 727).  It argues, for instance, its ownership of the booking  software is similar to that of the ""simple act of renting a  room to a trafficker without knowledge of his activity,""  Reply at 1-3, and cites cases in which courts have  refused to hold the TVPRA requires hotels to  affirmatively stop trafficking, see id. at 6-7 (collecting  cases). But plaintiff does not just claim defendant failed  to prevent her trafficking. She alleges defendant actively  participated in facilitating the operation, as explained  above. See SAC ¶¶ 66-67, 80-85. Those allegations,  taken in the light most favorable to plaintiff, show it is  plausible defendant actively participated in the operation  through its rental of rooms to her trafficker. See J.C.,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at  *7. Because plaintiff has ""connect[ed] the dots"" between  herself and defendant, she has now met the second  element of her direct beneficiary liability claim. B.M. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., No. 20-00656, 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *5 (N.D.  Cal. July 30, 2020). 2. Knew or Should Have Known Lastly, plaintiff must allege defendant knew, or should  have [*11]  known, about plaintiff's sex-trafficking;  allegations  about  sex  trafficking  generally  are  insufficient. See S.J. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 473 F.  Supp. 3d 147, 154-55 (E.D.N.Y. 2020); J.C., 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at *4 (""[Plaintiff]  must allege facts to support that defendants, at the very  least, rented rooms to people they should have known  were engaging in her sex trafficking.""). While plaintiff  had previously pled sufficient facts to the effect the  franchisee hotels knew or should have known plaintiff  was being trafficked, the court found the complaint did  not allege defendant possessed this knowledge. Prior  Order (Oct. 18, 2022) at 8-9. In the amended complaint, plaintiff has added specific  allegations regarding defendant's actual knowledge, as  reviewed in section A above. J.C., 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 201073, 2020 WL 6318707, at *5. These factual  allegations closely mirror those in J.C., in which the  court denied a motion to dismiss a TVPRA direct  beneficiary claim against hotel franchisors because the  plaintiff adequately alleged the defendants knew of the  tracking of her individually, monitored criminal activity at  franchisee hotels and implemented policies for reporting  and tracking sex trafficking, among other details. 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073, [WL] at *6. Plaintiff's allegations that defendant had exclusive  knowledge of certain information, including what  defendant knew, are [*12]  enough to satisfy the ""knew  or should have known"" prong at this stage. See Park v.  Thompson, 851 F.3d 910, 928-29 (9th Cir. 2017)  (""Because many of the relevant facts here are known  only to the defendant, . . . we conclude that [plaintiff] has  pleaded sufficient facts to state a plausible claim . . ."");  Concha v. London, 62 F.3d 1493, 1503 (9th Cir. 1995).  Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the second and third  prong of her direct beneficiary claim. The court denies  defendant's motion to dismiss.",1

She appeals the District  Court's grant of the Secretary of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs' motion for  summary judgment on her claims of sex and age  discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of  the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Age Discrimination  in Employment Act. For the reasons set forth below, we  will affirm.1 I. Kocher contends that the District Court erred in granting  summary judgment on her claims. While the District  improperly applied the private-sector antidiscrimination  and antiretaliation standards2 to Kocher, a federal  employee, we will affirm the District Court because  Kocher cannot establish her claims under either the  federal-sector provision of Title VII or the ADEA. 1 We [*2]  have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We  review a district court's grant of summary judgment de  novo. Cranbury Brick Yard, LLC v. United States, 943  F.3d 701, 708 (3d Cir. 2019). Summary judgment is only  appropriate ""if the movant shows that there is no  genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ.  P. 56(a). In making this determination, we ""view the  facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party  and make all reasonable inferences in that party's  Page 2 of 3 favor."" Scheidemantle v. Slippery Rock Univ. State Sys.  ofHigher Educ., 470 F.3d 535, 538 (3d Cir. 2006).  2 See Babb v. Wilkie, 140 S. Ct. 1168, 1172, 1176-77  (2020) (distinguishing between private-sector and  federal-sector provisions of the ADEA). 2 ""The ADEA federal-sector provision was patterned  'directly after' Title VII's federal-sector discrimination  ban.""3 These provisions are nearly identical.4 The  ADEA provides: ""All personnel actions affecting [federal]  employees . . . who are at least 40 years of age . . .  shall be made free from any discrimination based on  age.""5 Similarly, Title VII provides: ""All personnel  actions affecting [federal] employees . . . shall be made  free from any discrimination based on race, color,  religion, sex, or national origin.""6 In Babb v. Wilkie, the Supreme Court interpreted the  ADEA federal sector-provision to require that ""personnel  actions be untainted by any [*3]  consideration of  age.""7Because the federal-sector provisions of the  ADEA and Title VII are essentially identical, the Supreme Court's interpretation of the ADEA federal- sector provision controls our analysis of the Title VII  federal-sector provision.8 Thus, under both the federal- sector 3 Gomez-Perez v. Potter, 553 U.S. 474, 487 (2008)  (quoting Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U.S. 156, 167 n.15  (1981)). 4Both federal-sector provisions provide that ""[a]ll  personnel actions affecting [federal] employees . . . shall  be made free from any discrimination."" 29 U.S.C. §  633a(a); 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(a). 5 29 U.S.C. § 633a(a). 6 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16(a). 7 140 S.

Sec'y of United  States Dep't of Lab., 918 F.3d 289, 295 (3d Cir. 2019)  (recognizing that because the ADEA and Title VII  federal-sector provisions are ""nearly identical,"" the  Supreme Court's holding that the ADEA's federal-sector  provision bars retaliation leads to the conclusion that  Title VII's federal-sector provision also bars retaliation);  Huff v. Buttigieg, 42 F.4th 638, 645 (7th Cir. 2022)  (recognizing that ""[t]he federal-sector provisions in the  ADEA and Title VII are identical, so . . . Babb's causation standard applies equally to [Title VII]""). 3 provision of the ADEA and Title VII, ""a personnel action  must be made 'untainted' by discrimination.""9 [*4]  Although  these  federal-sector  provisions  do  not  specifically reference retaliation, they provide federal  employees with the right to bring retaliation claims.10  This is because when an employee experiences  retaliation for complaining about age, race, color,  religion, sex, or national origin discrimination, the  employee experiences a form of ""discrimination based on"" age, race, color, religion, sex,  or national origin.11""[T]he phrase 'based on' indicates a  but-for causal relationship.""12 Thus, in order to succeed  on a retaliation claim, a federal employee must show  that a complaint about discrimination is ""the but-for cause of differential treatment.""13 Kocher argues that the VA discriminated and retaliated  against her by (1) giving her lower than desired ratings  on two annual evaluations, (2) providing her with  performance counseling, (3) denying her the opportunity  to submit her self-evaluation on an official VA form, (4)  including her medical diagnosis in an annual evaluation,  and (5) disclosing her personal information over  unencrypted email.14 9 Babb, 140 S. Ct. at 1173. 10 Gomez-Perez, 553 U.S. at 491; Komis, 918 F.3d at  294.  11 See Gomez-Perez, 553 U.S. at 488 (explaining that  ""retaliation for complaining about age discrimination is  'discrimination based on age'""). 12 Babb, 140 S. Ct. at 1173 (quoting Safeco Ins. Co. of  Am. v. Burr, 551 U.S. 47, 63,(2007)). 13 [*5] See id. at 1174 (emphasis omitted).  14The record reveals that Kocher received an overall  rating of ""low satisfactory"" on her evaluations, the VA  Page 3 of 3 allowed Kocher to submit her self-evaluation but did not  transfer it onto the official form, and the VA responded  to her request and removed all references to her  medical diagnosis in her evaluation. 4 On Kocher's discrimination claims, the District Court  concluded that there was no evidence that Kocher was  ""treated  any  differently""  than  similarly  situated  employees.15 Accordingly, the District Court held that Kocher could  not succeed on her discrimination claims because  Kocher  presented  ""no  evidence  of  disparate  treatment.""16 On appeal, Kocher does not identify any  instances of differential treatment. Rather, she generally  contends that the VA's actions towards her ""can only be  explained by discrimination, given their highly unusual  nature.""17 We will affirm the District Court's grant of  summary judgment on Kocher's discrimination claims  because Kocher fails to identify any evidence to  contradict the District Court's conclusion that the VA's  actions were untainted by discrimination. On Kocher's retaliation claims, the District Court  concluded that Kocher [*6]  had not identified any prior  complaints that she made about discrimination and  instead only vaguely mentioned that she engaged in  ""prior EEO activity.""18Accordingly, the District Court  held that Kocher could not succeed on her retaliation  claims because Kocher failed to establish a causal  connection between any prior EEO activity and the VA's  actions. On appeal, Kocher continues to vaguely argue  that she was retaliated against for ""prior EEO activity""  without identifying any specific prior complaints that she  made about discrimination.19 We will affirm the District  Court's grant of summary judgment because 15 Kocher v.

II. For the above reasons, we will affirm the District Court's  order granting the VA's motion for summary judgment. 6",1
"L.H. v. Red Roof Inn, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 156293","MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER This matter is before the Court on Defendant Red Roof  Inn, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint [R. 14]  and  Defendant  Wyndham  Hotels  and  Resorts,  Inc.'s [*2]  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint [R.  20]. Both motions are fully briefed. See [R. 19; R. 27;  R. 28; R. 32]. For the following reasons, Red Roof's  Motion [R. 14] will be GRANTED in part and DENIED in  part, and Wyndham's Motion [R. 20] will be GRANTED. I. Background Plaintiff L.H. filed her Complaint in this action on  November 28, 2022. [R. 1]. The Complaint describes  L.H. as ""a survivor of sex trafficking under the federal  William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008 (hereinafter 'TVPRA')."" See  id. at 2 ¶ 3. She has named Red Roof, Wyndham, and  Club NO, Inc., as Defendants and alleges that she was  abused at these hotels' properties from January 2018 to  February 2018. See id. at 1, 3-6. Through her  Complaint, L.H. seeks to hold the Defendant hotels  liable for ""ignor[ing] the open and obvious presence of  sex trafficking on their properties, [and] enjoying the  profit from rooms rented for this explicit and apparent  purpose"" in violation of the TVPRA. See id. at 1 ¶ 2. By way of background, the Complaint alleges that, in  approximately January 2018, L.H. was 16 years old and  that she ran away from a group home at which she was  residing. Id. at 28 ¶ 58. After running away and walking  for quite some time, L.H. sat down to take a break, at  which time [*3]  she was approached by an adult male  who identified himself as ""Q."" Id. at ¶ 59. Q would later  be identified as Quentin J. Burris. Id. at ¶ 60. Burris  struck up a conversation with L.H. and advised that he  had somewhere warm they could go. Id. at ¶ 59. Given  the cold temperatures and because L.H. had nowhere  else to go, she accepted Burris's offer. Id. at ¶ 61. Burris transported L.H. back to his house, where he  furnished her with marijuana and alcohol. Id. at ¶ 62. He      Page 2 of 10 then advised her that he wanted to take L.H. to his  ""homegirl's"" house, emphasizing that she ""knew how to  make money."" Id. at ¶ 63. Burris took L.H. to Abigail  Varney's home. Id. at 28 ¶ 63, 34 ¶ 113. Varney told  L.H. she could make money, but that L.H. would first  need to pose naked for photographs. Id. at 28 ¶ 64.  Varney took the photographs and then posted them to  Backpage.com, ""a website formerly known for sex  trafficking and other illicit purposes before being seized  and shut down by federal authorities in mid-2018."" Id. at  ¶ 65. Varney introduced L.H. to another associate, Nigel  Nicholas, at a Red Roof property, which, to the best of  L.H.'s recollection, was located at 4704 Preston  Highway. Id. at 29 ¶ 66. Nicholas [*4]  told L.H. that  before he would ""invest"" in her, L.H. would have to  ""show [Nicholas] what she could do."" Id. at ¶ 67. L.H.  was then forced to have sex with numerous commercial  sex buyers at the Red Roof property that night. Id. at ¶  68. Burris arrived later that evening, and L.H. alleges  that he, Varney, and Nicholas shared financial gain as a  result of the sex trafficking activity at that Red Roof  property. Id. at ¶ 69. L.H. was kept at that Red Roof property for several  days. Id. at ¶ 70. During that time, she heard Nicholas  and Varney discussing money and believes Nicholas  may have paid for L.H.'s accommodations with a credit  card. Id. at ¶ 71. While she was at this Red Roof  property, L.H. was forced to engage in commercial sex  with a least ten to twelve johns per day, which she  alleges ""creat[ed] a clear and unusually high volume of  foot traffic into and out of her room."" Id. at ¶ 72. Varney  did not have cellular service at this property, so she  used the hotel's Wi-Fi connection to continue uploading  pictures of L.H. and advertisements for commercial sex  to Backpage.com and escorts.com. Id. at ¶ 73. After a few days, Varney expressed to L.H. that the Red  Roof property [*5]  was becoming ""too hot,"" meaning  Varney felt they were starting to arouse suspicion due to  noise complaints and the smell of cigarette and  marijuana smoke. Id. at 29-30 ¶ 74. Thus, the         individuals left the Red Roof property to go to the  Louisville Manor Adult Hotel (a Club NO property)  located at 4600 Dixie Highway in Shively, Kentucky. Id.  at 25 ¶ 56(a), 30 ¶ 75. L.H. alleges that ""the Louisville  Manor Adult Hotel is notorious among the community for  prostitution and commercial sex activity"" and that the  hotel offered rooms that could be purchased by the  hour. Id. at 30 ¶ 76. Either Varney or Nicholas may have  paid for the room in cash. Id. at ¶ 77. L.H. was at the  Louisville Manor Adult Hotel for only a few hours, but  during  that  time,  she  was  forced  to  service  approximately five or six johns in her room. Id. at ¶ 79.  At one point, Varney went to the front desk to book a  room for an extra hour because she herself was  engaged in commercial sex and needed the room for an  appointment with a different john. Id. at ¶ 80. While L.H. was at the Louisville Manor Adult Hotel, she  expressed to Varney that she wanted to leave the hotel  because she did not want to continue to be forced [*6]   to service commercial sex buyers. Id. at ¶ 81. Varney  responded by physically blocking the door with her body  and getting into a loud, profane shouting argument with  L.H. Id. at ¶ 82. Soon after this loud and conspicuous  altercation, a hotel staff member approached the room  and spoke with Varney to let her know about a noise  complaint and that they would have to ""keep it down or  leave."" Id. at 30-31 ¶ 83 . During the hours L.H. was kept at the Louisville Manor  Adult Hotel, Varney used the hotel's Wi-Fi to continue  uploading  pictures  and  advertisements  to  Backpage.com and escorts.com. Id. at 31 ¶ 84.  Eventually, while Varney was engaged in commercial  sex with a john, a hotel staff member informed them that  they were making too much noise and would have to  leave. Id. at ¶ 85. After being kicked out of the Louisville  Manor Adult Hotel, L.H. was taken to a residential  property Varney had been renting from Nicholas. Id. at ¶  86. At this property, L.H. was again trafficked for  commercial sex by Varney and Nicholas. Id. She was  also taken to Goodwill to shop for new clothes to  increase her appeal to commercial sex buyers in the  advertisements her traffickers were posting online. Id. at  ¶ 87. [*7]  Varney and Nicholas then took L.H. to a Baymont Hotel       Page 3 of 10 (a Wyndham property) located at 6515 Signature Drive  in Louisville. Id. at 21 ¶ 55(a), 31 ¶ 88. L.H. believes  Nicholas paid for one night's stay with a credit card. Id.  at 31 ¶ 89. Then, Varney and Nicholas took L.H. up to  their room to take and upload more photographs and  advertisements to Backpage.com and escorts.com,  using the hotel's Wi-Fi connection. Id. at ¶ 91. At this time, L.H. again expressed a desire to leave, and  Varney again physically blocked L.H.'s exit and became  loud and confrontational with her. Id. at ¶ 91. A short  time later, a hotel employee came to the room and said  he had received a complaint about the smell of cigarette  and marijuana smoke and that they would have to leave  if another such complaint were received. Id. at ¶ 92. L.H.  was kept at the Baymont hotel for approximately five  hours. Id. at 32 ¶ 93. During that time, she was forced to  provide commercial sex to three to four johns. Id. at ¶  94. While L.H. was being trafficked, other people  entered the room and smoked marijuana while engaging  Varney in conversation. Id. at ¶ 95. About twenty  minutes later, the same hotel staff member returned and  asked [*8]  them to leave based on complaints about  the smell of marijuana use. Id. at ¶ 96. After the Baymont hotel, L.H. was taken to a second  Red Roof property, this one located at 3322 Red Roof  Inn Place in Louisville. Id. She does not know how this  room was paid for. Id. at ¶ 97. L.H. noted that used  condoms, tourniquets, and syringes were strewn  throughout the property, which she claims are  ""indicative of high amounts of illicit drug and commercial  sex activity."" Id. at ¶ 98. At check-in, towels were pre- ordered for the room, so that hotel housekeeping staff  would not need to enter the room. Id. at ¶ 99. Soon after checking in, L.H.'s traffickers posted pictures  of her on Backpage.com and escorts.com using the  hotel  Wi-Fi  connection  and  advertised  her  for  commercial sex. Id. at ¶ 100. L.H. was kept at this Red  Roof property for two to three days, during which time  she was forced to perform commercial sex acts with  approximately 30 johns, all of whom she alleges ""had to  pass through the lobby and front desk, as well as  numerous hotel rooms, in order to access Plaintiff's  room located at the back of the hotel."" Id. at ¶ 101. L.H. was tasked with collecting the payment from the  johns and then [*9]  giving all the money to her trafficker  by placing it in the hotel nightstand for the trafficker to  retrieve. Id. at ¶ 102. She was not allowed to keep any  of the funds and was never given any of the funds. Id. at  33 ¶ 103. On one occasion, a john stole his money back  while L.H. was getting dressed and left without payment,  causing L.H.'s trafficker to become enraged and berate  L.H. in a loud, profane fashion. Id. at ¶ 104. On another  occasion, a female housekeeping worker was permitted  to enter L.H.'s room and observed L.H. looking pale and  sick, prompting the worker to look at L.H. curiously. Id.  at ¶ 105. However, the worker did not inquire as to  L.H.'s wellbeing and, to L.H.'s knowledge, did not make  any type of report to anyone regarding L.H.'s condition  or activity. Id. After a few days at the second Red Roof property, L.H.'s  traffickers stated the hotel was getting ""hot,"" so they  took her to several private residences and an unknown  hotel in Indiana, where she was sexually assaulted by  one of her trafficker's friends. Id. at ¶ 106. During this  time, L.H.'s physical condition continued to worsen. Id.  at ¶ 107. One day, L.H. awoke to hotel staff knocking on  her door, telling her [*10]  she had to leave because the  rest of her party had checked out. Id. at ¶ 108. After L.H.  could not reach anyone by phone and experienced  difficulty maintaining consciousness, she called 911 and  disclosed that she was a sex trafficking victim in need of  help. Id. at ¶ 109. L.H. was transported by EMS to an unknown hospital in  Indiana, where she was treated for sepsis and  dehydration and for chemical dependency relating to her  use of marijuana and crack cocaine furnished to her by  her traffickers, ""who used the common sex trafficker  tactic of fostering chemical dependency within their  victims as a means of establishing control and  compliance."" Id. at ¶ 110. Police arrived within five to  ten minutes of L.H.'s arrival at the hospital, but she was  too sick and weak to give an interview at that time. Id. at  34 ¶ 111. Subsequently, L.H. was transferred to another unknown  hospital in Kentucky, where her condition improved  enough for her to give a statement to law enforcement.  Id. at ¶ 112. By April 2018, Burris, Nicholas, and Varney  were arrested and charged with various crimes,  including sexual abuse and sex trafficking of minors. Id.  at ¶ 113. In November 2021, they each were sentenced  to [*11]  five years in prison for their crimes. Id. at ¶ 114. L.H.'s Complaint contains three causes of action, each  alleging a respective violation of the TVPRA by Red  Roof, Wyndham, and Club NO. See id. at 36-40.  Through these causes of action, L.H. claims that the  Defendant hotels failed to take reasonable measures to  stop sex trafficking at their properties and that they  ""profited from the sex trafficking of L.H. and knowingly  Page 4 of 10 or negligently aided and engaged with her traffickers in  his sex trafficking venture"" in violation of federal law. Id.  at 34 ¶ 115. Notably, L.H. has not sued the individual hotel locations  at which she was trafficked, but the ""parent hotel  brand[s]."" See id. at 15 ¶¶ 50-51 (describing Red Roof  as owning and controlling the ""Red Roof Inn® brand,""  Wyndham as owning and controlling the ""Baymont®  brand,"" and Club NO as owning and controlling the  Louisville Manor Adult Hotel). In this regard, she alleges  that the Defendant hotels were in actual or apparent  agency relationships with their local ""hotels offering  public lodging services in the hotel."" Id. at 16 ¶ 54(f), 21- 22 ¶ 55(e), 26 ¶ 56(e). Further, she alleges that these  agency relationships were created through the [*12]   companies' ""exercise of an ongoing and systemic right  of control over"" their local hotels through certain actions,  including hosting online bookings on the Defendant  hotels' domains, requiring local hotels to use brand  loyalty programs, setting employee wages, making  employment decisions, advertising for employment,  sharing profits, standardized training methods for  employees, building and maintaining the facility in a  manner specified by the owner, standardized or strict  rules of operation, regular inspection of the facility and  operation by the owner, fixing prices, or other actions  that deprive the local hotels of independence in  business operations. See, e.g., id. Additionally, the Complaint alleges that the Defendant  hotels control the training and policies for their hotels  and that, through their relationships with staff at the  properties at which L.H. was trafficked and with the  hotel guest perpetrator, they ""knowingly benefitted, or  received something of value, from [their] facilitation of,  or participation in, a venture which [they] knew or should  have known to engage in sex trafficking."" Id. at 3 ¶  11(d), 5 ¶ 12(e), 6 ¶ 13(c). The Complaint describes the  percentage of revenue [*13]  the Defendant hotels  obtained from their properties and alleges that the  Defendant hotels have all ""been on notice of repeated  incidences of sex trafficking occurring at their hotels yet  failed to take the necessary action to prevent sex  trafficking and still persist in failing to take the necessary  action to prevent sex trafficking at their hotels."" Id. at 15  ¶ 53; see also id. at 4 ¶ 11(e), 5 ¶ 12(f), 6 ¶ 13(d)  (revenue allegations); id. at 18, 23, 27 (alleging the  Defendant hotels failed to take certain actions, including  training their employees in identifying human trafficking,  providing a process for escalating human trafficking  concerns within the organizations, and monitoring usage  of the hotels' Wi-Fi). The Complaint ascribes notice to the Defendant hotels  through various methods, including news stories about  prostitution at local hotels, customer reviews, and, in the  case of Red Roof, corporate policies that require local  hotels and staff to report signs of human trafficking.  See, e.g., id. at 18-27. Additionally, L.H. alleges that the  Defendant hotels: knew, or should have known, that L.H. was being  trafficked because L.H.'s traffickers paid for her  room using cash, refused [*14]  housekeeping  services and/or requested services to dispose of  trash filled with condoms, frequently requested  extra towels and sheets, constantly entertained an  absurd amount of foot traffic from male visitors  every day, and checked in with an underage girl;  behavior that indicated that Defendants' hotels were  being used for an illegal sex trafficking venture. Id. at 34 ¶ 117. Procedurally, the Defendants each filed separate  responsive pleadings or motions to L.H.'s Complaint.  Defendant Club NO filed an Answer [R. 10], and  Defendants Red Roof and Wyndham each filed Motions  to Dismiss [R. 14; R. 20]. The Motions to Dismiss are  fully briefed and ripe for review. II. Legal Standard Red Roof's and Wyndham's Motions to Dismiss are  based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  When ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6),  the Court ""must (1) view the complaint in the light most  favorable to the plaintiff and (2) take all well-pleaded  factual allegations as true."" Tackett v. M & G Polymers,  USA, LLC, 561 F.3d 478, 488 (6th Cir. 2009) (per  curiam). Under Rule 12(b)(6), ""a complaint must contain  sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a  claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'"" Ashcroft v.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d  868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S.  544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)).  Relatedly, under Rule 8(a)(2), a complaint must contain  ""a short and plain statement of the claim showing that  the [*15]  pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P.  8(a)(2). ""A pleading that offers labels and conclusions or  a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of  action will not do. Nor does a complaint suffice if it  tenders naked assertions devoid of further factual  enhancement."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (cleaned up). Page 5 of 10 III. Analysis L.H.'s Complaint states that this action has been  brought ""pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act 18 U.S.C. §1595, against the  Defendants who enabled, harbored, held, facilitated,  and financially benefited from a sex trafficking venture in  which L.H. was trafficked for the purpose of commercial  sex, sexually exploited, and brutally victimized in  violation of 18 U.S.C. §1591(a)."" [R. 1, p. 2 ¶ 8]. As an  initial observation, there is little binding precedent to  guide the Court's consideration of L.H.'s TVPRA claims.  See J.M. v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., No. 2:22-CV-00672- KJM-JDP, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190054, 2022 WL  10626493, at *1 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 18, 2022) (""[F]ederal  district courts across the country are tackling these suits  and interpreting the TVPRA on a case-by-case basis."").  Similarly, courts take widely different approaches when  deciding whether claims such as those presented in  L.H.'s Complaint can survive a motion to dismiss, even  when  presented  with  substantially  similar  facts.  Compare, e.g., id. with H.G. v. Inter-Cont'l Hotels Corp.,  489 F. Supp. 3d 697, 703-04 (E.D. Mich. 2020). ""The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act,  18 U.S.C. § 1591, prohibits the sex trafficking [*16]  of  children or adults by force, fraud, or coercion."" Doe #1 v.  Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 723 (11th Cir. 2021).  ""In addition to that criminal prohibition, the Act provides  sex-trafficking victims with a civil cause of action against  'the perpetrator (or whoever knowingly benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in violation of  this chapter).'"" Id. (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a)). In this  case, L.H. ""does not allege that Defendants are  perpetrators of sex-trafficking. Rather, she seeks relief  under the beneficiary theory."" C.T. v. Red Roof Inns,  Inc., No. 2:22-CV-834-JES-KCD, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  87727, 2023 WL 3510879, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 11,  2023); see [R. 1, p. 34 ¶ 115 (""Defendants RRI,  Wyndham, and Club NO profited from the sex trafficking  of L.H. and knowingly or negligently aided and engaged  with her traffickers in his sex trafficking venture. The  Defendants leased rooms to L.H.'s traffickers for hours  to days at a time, when they knew, or should have  known, that they were using the hotel room to imprison  L.H. and subject her to repeated exploitation by forcing  her into sexual servitude."")]. ""[T]o state a claim for beneficiary liability under the  TVPRA, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that the  defendant (1) knowingly benefited (2) from taking part in  a common undertaking [*17]  or enterprise involving risk  and potential profit, (3) that the undertaking or  enterprise violated the TVPRA as to the plaintiff, and (4)  that the defendant had constructive or actual knowledge  that the undertaking or enterprise violated the TVPRA  as to the plaintiff."" Doe #1, 21 F.4th at 719; see also,  e.g., G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., ___ F.4th ___, 2023  U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *5 n.5  (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023) (""reorganiz[ing] the most  common summaries of these elements to follow a  logical sequence rather than the sequence of the  phrases in Section 1595""); H.G., 489 F. Supp. 3d at 704  (describing a claim under the financial beneficiary prong  of the TVPRA as having three elements: (1) that the  defendant knowingly benefitted, (2) from participation in  a venture, (3) which the defendant knew or should have  known has engaged in sex trafficking). A plaintiff may satisfy the elements of a TVPRA claim ""in  one of two ways."" H.G., 489 F. Supp. 3d at 704. First,  ""[s]he may show that the defendant's own acts,  omissions, and state of mind establish each element.""  Id. ""Alternatively, she may impute to the defendant the  acts, omissions, and state of mind of an agent of the  defendant."" Id. ""The former is referred to as 'direct  liability' and the latter as 'indirect liability.'"" Id.; see also  J.M., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190054, 2022 WL  10626493, at *3 (describing the former as ""direct  beneficiary liability"" and the latter as ""vicarious  beneficiary [*18]  liability""). A. Direct Beneficiary Liability Claims L.H. first alleges a theory of direct liability against Red  Roof and Wyndham. See, e.g., [R. 1, p. 2 ¶ 7 (""As a  direct and proximate result of Defendants' consistent  refusals to prevent human trafficking on their hotel  properties, L.H. was sex trafficked, sexually exploited,  and victimized repeatedly at the Red Roof Inn®,  Louisville Manor Adult Hotel, and the Baymont Hotel."")].  For this theory, L.H. highlights these Defendant hotels'  training and policies for their hotel properties, their  general knowledge that sex trafficking occurs at their  properties and in the hotel industry, and their  ""demonstrated deeply entrenched apathy to the real risk  of sex trafficking and pervasive willful blindness to the  role"" their local hotels ""play in sex trafficking."" See, e.g.,  id. 8-13 ¶¶ 20-45, 16 ¶ 54(a)-(j), 18-20 ¶ 54(j)-(n), 21 ¶  55(a)-(i). These general allegations are insufficient. As explained by the court in J.M., for a direct liability  claim, a plaintiff must ""connect the dots"" between her  Page 6 of 10 and a franchisor to satisfy the ""participation in a venture""  element and she must allege more than ""general  knowledge of sex trafficking problems in the [*19]  hotel  industry, or even at defendants' franchisee hotels"" for  the knowledge element. See J.M., 2022 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 190054, 2022 WL 10626493, at *4-5. In this  case, L.H.'s allegations are insufficient. Indeed, although  her  factual  allegations  would  sufficiently  allege  circumstances supporting direct liability against the  franchisee hotels or potentially vicarious liability claims  against the Defendant hotels, they do not support a  theory of direct liability against Red Roof or Wyndham. When courts have permitted direct liability claims to  proceed, they were presented with stronger facts  ""connecting the dots"" than those presented here. For  example, in T.P. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, the  plaintiff alleged she was trafficked at various hotel  properties in Columbus, Ohio, from 1993 to 2016. T.P.  v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., No 2:21-CV-04933,  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217315, 2022 WL 17363234, at  *1 (S.D. Ohio Dec. 1, 2022). Additionally, she alleged  behavior that hotel staff should have recognized as  clear signs of her trafficking, that the owner of two local  hotels traded free or discounted rooms to her traffickers  in exchange for sex acts from her, that one of the  properties had been declared a ""public nuisance"" by the  Columbus City Attorney for being a ""haven for  prostitution,"" and that online reviews specifically  referenced several of the local hotels as being full of  drug [*20]  dealers, pimps, and hookers. See id. On  these facts, the Southern District of Ohio found the  plaintiff had plausibly alleged each element of a direct  liability TVPRA claim against the franchisor defendants.  See 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217315, [WL] at *11; see  also M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F.  Supp. 3d 959, 971 (S.D. Ohio 2019) (finding plaintiff  sufficiently  alleged  direct  liability  claims  against  franchisor defendants). In this case, by contrast, the allegations L.H. has  presented do not sufficiently connect the actions of the  Defendant hotels to each element of her TVPRA direct  liability claims. In this regard, both the general  allegations regarding sex trafficking in the hospitality  industry and the specific allegations of L.H.'s own  trafficking fail to plausibly establish a direct liability claim       against either Red Roof or Wyndham. For instance,  although she alleges the Louisville Metro Council was  informed in February 2022 of the high percentage of  calls received by the Louisville Metro Police Department  for incidents occurring at the two Red Roof properties in  this case, those calls were from January 2020 to  January 2021, two to three years after L.H.'s trafficking  is alleged to have occurred in 2018. See [R. 1, p. 25 ¶  55(i)(iii)]. Relatedly, the limited duration of time that  L.H. [*21]  alleges she was held at the Baymont  property does not sufficiently tie Wyndham's own  actions to the elements of her direct liability TVPRA  claim. On this Complaint, the Court finds that L.H. has failed to  plausibly allege that these Defendant hotels' ""own acts,  omissions, and state of mind establish each element.""  H.G., 489 F. Supp. 3d at 704. By way of example, she  has not plausibly alleged that ""the franchisor defendants  directly rented rooms and Wi-Fi to her buyers and sex  traffickers"" or that they ignored internal reports of her  own sex-trafficking. See J.M., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  190054, 2022 WL 10626493, at *4. Therefore, to the  extent L.H. bases her TVPRA claims against Red Roof  and Wyndham on a theory of direct liability, the  Defendant hotels' Motions to Dismiss will be granted.  Still, as will be explained below, her factual allegations  support a theory of vicarious liability, at least as to Red  Roof. B. Vicarious Beneficiary Liability Claims Having disposed of L.H.'s claims against Red Roof and  Wyndham based on a theory of direct liability, the Court  considers her vicarious liability claims against these  Defendant hotels. Here, L.H. ascribes liability to the  Defendant hotels based on their actual or apparent  agency relationships with their local hotels. See  [R. [*22]  1 pp. 16-17, 21-22]. As a preliminary matter, ""[t]here is a split of authority  with respect to whether state common law or federal  common law applies to the question of whether a party  can be held indirectly liable under the TVPRA based on  an agency relationship."" H.G., 489 F. Supp. 3d at 708  n.6. Under Kentucky law, ""[a] franchisor is vicariously  liable for the tortious conduct of the franchisee when it,  in fact, has control or right of control over the daily  operation of the specific aspect of the franchisee's  business that is alleged to have caused the harm."" Papa  John's Int'l., Inc. v. McCoy, 244 S.W.3d 44, 56 (Ky.  2008). And courts, like those in the Ninth Circuit, have  Page 7 of 10 applied federal common law agency principles from the  Restatement (Third) of Agency to TVPRA claims. See  A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., 484 F. Supp. 3d  921, 940 (D. Or. 2020) (""An actual agency relationship  requires (1) a manifestation by the principal that the  agent shall act for him; (2) that the agent has accepted  the undertaking; and (3) that there is an understanding  between the parties that the principal is to be in control  of the undertaking."") (internal quotation marks omitted).  The parties in this case did not brief this split of  authority. Nonetheless, the Court finds that L.H. has plausibly  alleged an agency relationship under both sources of  law. Indeed, the Complaint contains multiple allegations  regarding [*23]  L.H.'s agency theory, including that  franchisor hotels provide their local hotels with brand  recognition, marketing organization, listing in travel  agency  databases,  an  800  number,  revenue  management tools, world-class loyalty programs, and a  website, and that, through their actions, the Defendant  hotels hold out their local hotels ""to the public as  possessing authority to act on [their] behalf."" See [R. 1,  pp. 3-4 ¶ 11, 4-5 ¶ 12, 14 ¶ 48, 15-17 ¶¶ 53-54, 20 ¶  55]. Further, the Complaint included specific allegations  regarding Red Roof's and Wyndham's control over how  their local hotels ""conduct[ed] daily business"" through  various actions, including by setting employee wages,  fixing profits, and making employment decisions. See id.  at 17 ¶ 54(f) , 22 ¶ 55(e). Notably, similar allegations ""have been found sufficient  to support a plausible inference of an agency  relationship"" by other courts. See C.T. v. Red Roof Inns,  Inc., 2:22-CV-834-JES-KCD, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  87727, 2023 WL 3510879, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 11,  2023) (collecting cases); see also J.M., 2022 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 190054, 2022 WL 10626493, at *5 (""Here, J.M.  alleges defendants exercised control over the day-to- day operations of the hotels by hosting online bookings,  setting hotel employee wages, making employment  decisions for the hotels, providing standardized training  methods for hotel employees, and [*24]  fixing hotel  room rent prices. A majority of district courts have found  nearly identical allegations sufficient to plead an agency  relationship.""). But see H.G., 489 F. Supp. 3d at 704-09  (finding plaintiff had ""not plausibly alleged that the  franchisees were agents of Defendants""). Having  concluded that L.H. has plausibly alleged an agency  relationship, the Court will consider the elements of her  vicarious liability claims against Red Roof and  Wyndham. 1. Existence of a Venture Through their Motions, Red Roof and Wyndham  primarily argue that L.H. cannot show their ""participation  in a venture."" See [R. 14, pp. 5-10; R. 20, pp. 4-10]. In  their briefing, Red Roof and Wyndham first ask the  Court to use the definition of ""venture"" found in §  1591(e)(6) (regarding criminal liability), informed by the  RICO statute, for interpreting § 1595(a) (regarding civil  liability). See [R. 14, p. 5; R. 20, pp. 4-5]. However,  courts have routinely rejected imposing definitions from  § 1591 to interpretation of § 1595. See Doe #1, 21 F.4th  at 725 (""But most district courts, like us, have rejected  the idea that a court can transpose the definition of  'participation in a venture' from the criminal section to  the civil cause of action.""). The rejection by other courts of the arguments made  by [*25]  Red Roof and Wyndham in this regard  compels the Court to follow suit. See id. at 724  (interpreting ""participation in a venture"" under § 1595  ""according to its plain meaning"" rather than the phrase  ""participation in a venture"" from § 1591(e)(4)); G.G.,  2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *10  (""We agree with the Eleventh Circuit that we should not  import [§ 1591's] definition into Section 1595.""); C.T.,  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87727, 2023 WL 3510879, at *4  (rejecting argument that definition from § 1591(e)(6)  should apply to § 1595); Doe v. Rickey Patel, LLC, No.  0:20-60683-WPD-CIV, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811,  2020 WL 6121939, at *4 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 30, 2020)  (""[T]he Court is not prepared to impose requirements to  plead a RICO claim onto Plaintiff who is here pleading a  claim for civil liability under the TVPRA.""). Instead, the  Court looks to the plain meaning of the statutory text. In  doing so, the Court observes that other courts have  interpreted ""participation in a venture"" in different ways.  See generally J.M., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190054,  2022 WL 10626493, at *3 (observing that ""district courts  are all over the map on the meaning of ['participation in  a venture']"") (quoting Doe #1, 21 F.4th at 726). In this case, the Court finds it helpful to first consider  whether L.H. has plausibly alleged a ""venture"" before  determining whether she has alleged ""participation"" in  that venture. See G.G., 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031,  2023 WL 4944015, at *5 (""The first element is the  existence of a venture which has engaged in an act in  violation of Section 1591."") (cleaned up). The Seventh  Circuit has explained that ""'venture' under [*26]  Section  1595 need not be 'specifically a sex trafficking venture,""  and that, ""[w]hile a 'venture' can certainly run the gamut  Page 8 of 10 from an isolated act of sex trafficking to an international  sex-trafficking enterprise, it can also be a business  whose primary focus is not on sex trafficking."" 2023 U.S.  App. LEXIS 20031, [WL] at *6. And in Doe #1, the  Eleventh  Circuit  determined  that  the  plaintiffs'  allegations regarding a ""sex trafficking venture"" were  insufficient to state a claim because the plaintiffs had  not ""plausibly alleged that the franchisors took part in  the common undertaking of sex trafficking with hotel  employees, management, owners, and sex traffickers.""  Doe #1, 21 F.4th at 726. However, courts have  distinguished the ""narrow"" holding of Doe #1 and  permitted claims to survive dismissal when plaintiffs  have  alleged  that  ""Defendants  participated  in  commercial ventures to operate hotels that violated the  TVPRA."" See C.T., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87727, 2023  WL 3510879, at *2. On this Complaint, the Court concludes that L.H. has  sufficiently plead a ""venture"" because she substantively  alleges a commercial business venture by the  Defendant hotels that violated the TVPRA. Indeed, the  Complaint highlights the revenues the Defendant hotels  obtained from their properties' operations, ""including a  percentage of the revenue generated [*27]  from the  rate charged for the rooms in which the Plaintiff was sex  trafficked."" [R. 1, pp. 4-5 ¶¶ 11(e), 12(f)]. Additionally,  the Complaint alleges ""[t]he Defendants leased rooms to  L.H.'s traffickers for hours to days at a time, when they  knew, or should have known, that they were using the  hotel room to imprison L.H. and subject her to repeated  exploitation by forcing her into sexual servitude,"" and it  alleges a ""relationship"" by the Defendants with the staff  at the hotel ""properties where L.H. was trafficked and  the hotel guest perpetrator who trafficked her"" at those  properties. Id. at 3 ¶ 11(d), 5 ¶ 12(e), 34 ¶ 115. These  allegations focus on the business nature of the  Defendants' actions and ""plausibly allege that the  venture in which the franchisors participated committed  [crimes prohibited by the TVPRA] against [her]."" Doe #1,  21 F.4th at 725. Although L.H. repeatedly refers to a ""sex trafficking  venture"" in her Complaint, see, e.g., [R. 1, p. 2 ¶ 8], the  Court must view the Complaint in the light most  favorable to her. In doing so, the Court finds that L.H.'s  allegations focus on the nature of the hotels' business  operations, which are sufficient at this stage of the  proceedings to satisfy the ""venture"" [*28]  element. See  generally id. at 34 ¶ 117 (referencing ""behavior that  indicated that Defendants' hotels were being used for an  illegal sex trafficking venture"") (emphasis added). 2. Participation in a Venture Next, the Court must consider whether L.H. has  plausibly alleged participation by Red Roof and  Wyndham in the venture described above. Courts,  again, phrase this element differently, with certain  standards appearing more lenient than others. For  example, the Eleventh Circuit has ""conclude[d] that the  phrase 'participation in a venture' requires that [a  plaintiff] allege that the franchisors took part in a  common undertaking or enterprise involving risk and  potential profit."" Doe #1, 21 F.4th at 725. In M.A., the Southern District of Ohio used a  (potentially) heightened standard and concluded that,  ""[i]n the absence of a direct association, [a] Plaintiff  must allege at least a showing of a continuous business  relationship between the trafficker and the hotels such  that it would appear that the trafficker and the hotels  have established a pattern of conduct or could be said  to have a tacit agreement."" M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at  970. Recently, the Seventh Circuit relied on M.A. in  finding that ""[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, all that is  necessary [*29]  is for a plaintiff to allege such a  'continuous business relationship,' which gives rise to an  inference, drawn in the plaintiff's favor, that the civil  defendant facilitated the venture's success."" See G.G.,  2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *11  (""Where the participant provides assistance, support, or  facilitation to the trafficker through such a 'continuous  business relationship,' a court or jury may infer that the  participant and trafficker have a 'tacit agreement' that is  sufficient for 'participation' under Section 1595."") (citing  M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 970-71; Ricchio v. McLean,  853 F.3d 553, 555 (1st Cir. 2017)). Although ""participation in a venture"" is not clearly  defined by legal precedent, the Court is guided by the  standard announced in M.A. Therefore, the Court  considers whether L.H. has plausibly alleged a  ""continuous business relationship"" or ""tacit agreement""  between the Defendant hotels and her traffickers. At this  point, the Court's consideration of Red Roof's and  Wyndham's Motions to Dismiss diverges. The Court will  address L.H.'s allegations against Wyndham first. Here, the Complaint alleges that L.H. was only at the  Baymont hotel for a period of five hours, that she was  forced to provide commercial sex to three to four johns  during that time, that her traffickers used hotel Wi-Fi to  upload pictures of [*30]  her to advertise her for  commercial sex, that a hotel staff member warned the  Page 9 of 10 party about the smell of cigarette and marijuana smoke,  and that the same staff member returned about twenty  minutes later and directed the party to leave because of  other individuals' complaints about the smell of  marijuana. See [R. 1, pp. 31-32 ¶¶ 86-96]. The limited  duration of L.H.'s time at the Baymont hotel coupled with  the staff member's warning and subsequent and quick  action to direct the party to leave do not show a  continuous business relationship or tacit agreement  between Wyndham and her traffickers. See M.A., 925 F.  Supp. 3d at 970; see also G.G., 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS  20031, 2023 WL 4944015, at *11. Accordingly, L.H. has  failed to sufficiently plead that Wyndham ""participated in  a venture"" as required to support her vicarious TVPRA  claim against this company. Wyndham's Motion to  Dismiss will therefore be granted. L.H.'s allegations against Red Roof, however, present a  different story. Here, the Complaint alleges that L.H.'s  traffickers took her to multiple Red Roof hotels for  several days each time. Specifically, she alleges that  she was held at the first Red Roof property by her  traffickers for a ""period of a few days"" and at the second  Red Roof property for ""two to three days,"" [*31]  that her  traffickers chose to return to the second Red Roof  property after being kicked out of other hotels, that one  of her traffickers used the hotel's Wi-Fi connection to  upload pictures of L.H. to advertise her for commercial  sex, that she was forced to provide commercial sex to  dozens of johns at these properties, that the second  Red Roof property was littered with used condoms,  syringes, and tourniquets, and that a housekeeping staff  member at the second property saw her looking pale  and sick but took no action. See [R. 1, pp. 29-30, 32- 40]. The repeated interactions between L.H.'s traffickers  and the two Red Roof properties within the span of  about a month are sufficient, at the pleading stage, to  show a ""continuous business relationship"" between Red  Roof and her traffickers. See M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at  970; G.G., 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 20031, 2023 WL  4944015, at *11. 3. Knowing Benefit The Court must now consider the other elements of  L.H.'s vicarious TVPRA claim against Red Roof. First,  regarding the ""knowing benefit"" element, L.H. has  sufficiently alleged that Red Roof ""knew it was receiving     some value from participating in the alleged venture,""  namely the money from the rented rooms. See Doe #1,  21 F.4th at 724; M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 965 (""M.A. has  alleged  that  Defendants  rented  rooms  to  the  trafficker, [*32]  and therefore benefited financially. This  Court finds that the rental of a room constitutes a  financial benefit from a relationship with the trafficker  sufficient to meet this element of the § 1595(a)  standard.""); see [R. 1, p. 4 ¶ 11(e) (""Upon information  and belief, RRI receives a percentage of the gross room  revenue from the money generated by the operations of  all Red Roof Inn® hotels, including a percentage of the  revenue generated from the rate charged for the rooms  in which the Plaintiff was sex trafficked."")]. 4. Knowledge of Plaintiff's Trafficking Similarly, the Court concludes L.H. has satisfied the final  element regarding whether Red Roof had ""knowledge  that the undertaking or enterprise violated the TVPRA  as to the plaintiff."" Doe #1, 21 F.4th at 719. The  knowledge element is informed by the allegations L.H.  has included in her Complaint suggesting an agency  relationship between Red Roof and its local hotels at  which she was trafficked. See [R. 1, p. 17 ¶ 54(f)]; see  also C.T., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87727, 2023 WL  3510879, at *5 (""For example, Plaintiff alleges facts that  would have put Best Western, through its agency  relationship with the hotel, on notice as to her  trafficking[.]""). In her Complaint, L.H. globally claims that the  Defendants: knew, or should [*33]  have known, that L.H. was  being trafficked because L.H.'s traffickers paid for  her room using cash, refused housekeeping  services and/or requested services to dispose of  trash filled with condoms, frequently requested  extra towels and sheets, constantly entertained an  absurd amount of foot traffic from male visitors  every day, and checked in with an underage girl;  behavior that indicated that Defendants' hotels were  being used for an illegal sex trafficking venture. See [R. 1, p. 34 ¶ 117]. And she provides further  specific facts relating to her repeated stays at the Red  Roof hotels, including: that the number of johns she was  forced to provide commercial sex to would have led to  significant foot traffic to her rooms; that her traffickers  used the local hotel's Wi-Fi connection to upload  pictures to advertise her for commercial sex; that used  condoms, tourniquets, and syringes were strewn  Page 10 of 10 throughout the second Red Roof property, which she  claims are ""indicative of high amounts of illicit drug and  commercial sex activity""; that, at check-in at the second  Red Roof location, towels were pre-ordered for the  room, so hotel housekeeping staff would not need to  enter the room; and that a housekeeping [*34]  staff saw  L.H. looking pale and sick at the second Red Roof  property, but did not inquire as to her condition. Id. at  30-31 ¶¶ 75-85, 32-34 ¶¶ 97-105. Although the Court finds these allegations insufficient to  state a claim of actual knowledge by Red Roof, it  concludes that L.H. has sufficiently plead that Red Roof  should have known about the sex trafficking venture.  M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 968. To parrot the court in  M.A., L.H. has alleged that Red Roof was on notice,  through its local hotels (i.e., its agents), about the  prevalence of sex trafficking generally at its hotels and  failed to take adequate steps to train staff in order to  prevent its occurrence. Id. But more than that, she has  alleged ""facts specific to her own sex trafficking,  including a number of signs she alleges should have  alerted staff to her situation,"" including those just  discussed about the number of johns she was forced to  provide commercial sex to and the conditions of the Red  Roof properties at which she was trafficked. Id. Courts have found similar allegations ""sufficient to  survive a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss,"" and this Court will  as well. See id.; see also C.T., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  87727, 2023 WL 3510879, at *5 (finding allegations  detailing ""many signs of human trafficking and  commercial [*35]  sex activity,"" including ""physical  deterioration, no eye contact, and duration of stay and  bottles of lubricants, boxes of condoms, used condoms  in the trash, excessive requests for towels and linens,  cash payments"" as ""sufficient to show knowledge"").  Because L.H. has sufficiently alleged each element of  her vicarious TVPRA liability claim against Red Roof,  this claim will survive Red Roof's Motion to Dismiss.",0
"Lewis v. Senior Lifestyle, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217659","[*1] MEMORANDUM OPINION THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendant Senior  Lifestyle's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 11). The Motion  is ripe for disposition, and no hearing is necessary. See  Local Rule 105.6 (D.Md. 2023). For the reasons set  forth below, the Court will grant the Motion in part and  deny it in part. I. BACKGROUND A. Factual Background1 Self-represented Plaintiff Takia Lewis, a self-identified  African American woman, began working for Senior Lifestyle in human resources  in the Atrium Village on November 15, 2020. (Compl. at  9, ECF No. 1). 2 She alleges that Senior Lifestyle  discriminated against her on the basis of race, and that  she was fired in retaliation for her complaints of  disparate treatment. (See id. at 7). 1 Unless otherwise noted, the Court takes the following  facts from the Complaint (ECF No. 1) and accepts them  as true. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007). 2 Citations to page numbers refer to the pagination  assigned by the Court's Case Management/Electronic  Case Files (""CM/ECF"") system. On January 4, 2021, Todd Kalkstein, Senior Lifestyle's  Kitchen Director, had a ""rude[] outburst"" at Lewis for delays in the onboarding  process for new employees. (Id. at 9). He allegedly insulted Lewis by calling her slow. (Id.).  On January [*2]  13, 2021, Lewis became aware that Kalkstein and Molly Hall, the  Program Director, were ""spreading [r]umors about employees being covid positive"" and  identifying those employees. (Id.). Lewis wrote them up because their actions violated the  employee handbook and HIPPA. (Id.). After issuing the write up, Lewis was invited to a  zoom call with Kalkstein; Hall; Beth Ber, the Vice President of Senior Lifestyle; and  Denise Bucholz, 3 Lewis' supervisor. (Id.). Lewis was the only African American person on  the call. (Id.). Ber raised her voice and told Lewis she was disrespectful and she should not  have issued the write ups. (Id.). Bucholz later messaged Lewis to say that she agreed  Page 2 of 7 that Kalkstein and Hall were out of line but directed her to remove the write ups from  Kalkstein and Hall's files. (Id.). Kalkstein then allegedly told another employee to not trust Lewis.  (Id. at 10). On February 2, 2021, Stacy Buckley 4 told Lewis to call  employees to ask about their vaccination status, although Lewis had already done so  the previous day. (Id.). When Lewis 3 In her Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, Lewis  states that ""the [p]roper defendant to this action is  Senior Lifestyle, ('Denise Buchholz['])"". (Pl.'s [*3]  Mem.  Supp. Resp. Mot. Dismiss [""Opp'n""] at 1, ECF No. 19).  To the extent Lewis attempts to add Bucholz as a  defendant, she did not file a motion to amend her  Complaint, and she may not properly add a defendant in  a responsive briefing. Regardless, Lewis asserts Title  VII claims, and the only proper defendant in a Title VII  case is the employer, Senior Lifestyle, not its individual  employees. See Bradley v. Balt. Police Dep't , No. JKB- 11-1799, 2012 WL 4321738, at *2 (D.Md. Sept. 19,  2012) (""Supervisors sued in their individual capacities  may not be held liable under Title VII."") (citing Lissau v.  S. Food Serv., Inc., 159 F.3d 177, 181 (4th Cir. 1998)). 4 In the Complaint, Lewis refers to Buckley as ""Stacy""  and she only lists her full name in her Opposition. (See  Opp'n at 2). While the Complaint must ordinarily stand  alone, 2 informed her that she already made the calls, Buckley  loudly said ""do what I said now."" (Id.). In a different  meeting, Buckley ""got smart"" towards Lewis and said  that as the boss, she ran the meetings. (Id.). On February 3, 2021, Lewis and other employees  moved their offices to a different floor. (Id.). Kalkstein  helped white employees to set up their wifi and  equipment, but he did not help Lewis. (Id.). On February  8, 2021, Kalkstein pushed past Lewis after a meeting  without  acknowledging  her  or  excusing  himself.  (Id. [*4] ). Lewis informed Buckley, who said she would  handle it. (Id.). Lewis and other employees also  observed Kalkstein digging into food meant for residents  with his bare hands. (Id.). Lewis reported him to  Buckley, but nothing was done about it. (Id.). On February 13, 2021, Lewis received a complaint from  an African American employee about her white  supervisor. (Id. at 11). Buckley would not allow Lewis to  attend a meeting with the employee after the complaint,  and the situation was never addressed appropriately.  (Id.). On February 17, 2021, Lewis learned that Senior  Lifestyle held a management meeting but only invited  white managers. (Id.). On February 19, 2021, Kalkstein yelled at an African  American supervisor, Helen Lambert, for working from  home during a weather emergency. (Id.). Lewis reported  this to Buckley and asked why Senior Lifestyle had not  held Kalkstein accountable. (Id.). Buckley yelled at  Lewis to ""stay out of it."" (Id.). and the Court cannot permit Lewis to amend her  Complaint with facts contained in the Opposition, the  Court will refer to Buckley by her last name for  consistency. 3 On February 22, 2021, Lewis heard Kalkstein ""cussing  at an employee,"" who told Lewis that Kalkstein had  disrespected her and made her cry on previous  occasions. (Id.). This situation was never handled. (Id.).  On February 25, 2021, Lewis learned that an African  American employee [*5]  had quit because of Kalkstein  and his disrespectful behavior and that a white server  left her job because she did not want to take directions  from Lambert, who is an African American woman. (Id.  at 12). Lewis reported this information to Buckley, who  told her to ""stop supporting Black employees before  [you] end up in the hot seat."" (Id.). Lewis said that she  did not understand, and Buckley replied ""oh[,] you will.""  (Id.). Lewis told her that she needed to treat all  employees equally. (Id.). On March 2, 2021, Lambert told Lewis that Kalkstein  sent a text to a group chat of Senior Lifestyle employees  in which he blamed Lambert for a mistake that a white  employee had made. (Id.). Lewis submitted a statement  to Buckley, who told Lambert that she was Kalkstein's  boss and to ""stop putting energy in the situation."" (Id.).  That same day, Buckley told Lewis that her position was  being eliminated and that her last day of work would be  March 16, 2021. (Id.). On March 3 and 4, 2021, after Lewis had gone home,  Kalkstein and Buckley broke into her office and took her  office keys and several write ups, including the one she  wrote for Kalkstein and Hall. (Id. at 13). From March 5- 16, 2021, Lewis was [*6]  denied access to payroll, and  she was told to sit at her desk all day and not speak to  Page 3 of 7 employees. (Id.). B. Procedural History Lewis filed an administrative complaint on March 2,  2021, and she received a Right to Sue Letter on October 11, 2022. (See id. at 8). On  January 9, 2023, she filed her 4 Complaint, in which she claims racial discrimination and  retaliation under Title VII. (Id. at 7). Senior Lifestyle filed  the instant Motion to Dismiss on May 16, 2023. (ECF  No. 11). Lewis filed an Opposition on June 12, 2023,  (ECF No. 19), and Senior Lifestyle filed a Reply on June  26, 2023, (ECF No. 21). II. DISCUSSION A. Standard of Review The purpose of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is to ""test[] the  sufficiency of a complaint,"" not to ""resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits  of a claim, or the applicability of defenses."" King v.  Rubenstein, 825 F.3d 206, 214 (4th Cir. 2016) (quoting  Edwards v. Cityof Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 243 (4th  Cir. 1999)). A complaint fails to state a claim if it does  not contain ""a short and plain statement of the claim  showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,""  Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2), or does not ""state a claim to relief  that is plausible on its face,"" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.  662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v.Twombly, 550  U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). A claim is facially plausible  ""when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the  court to draw the reasonable inference that the  defendant [*7]  is liable for the misconduct alleged."" Id.  (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). ""Threadbare recitals  of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere  conclusory statements, do not suffice."" Id. (citing  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). Though the plaintiff is not  required to forecast evidence to prove the elements of  the claim, the complaint must allege sufficient facts to  establish each element. Goss v. Bank of Am., N.A., 917  F.Supp.2d 445, 449 (D.Md. 2013) (quoting Walters v.  McMahen, 684 F.3d 435, 439 (4th Cir. 2012)), aff'd, 546  F.App'x 165 (4th Cir. 2013). 5 In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court must  examine the complaint as a whole, consider the factual  allegations in the complaint as true, and construe the  factual allegations in the light most favorable to the  plaintiff. Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 268 (1994);  Lambeth v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 407 F.3d 266, 268 (4th Cir.  2005) (citing Scheuer v.Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236  (1974)). Complaints drafted by self-represented plaintiffs  are held to a less stringent standard than those drafted  by attorneys, and courts must liberally construe these  complaints. See Johnson v. Silver, 742 F.2d 823, 825  (4th Cir. 1984). But the court need not accept  unsupported or conclusory factual allegations devoid of  any reference to actual events, United Black Firefighters  v. Hirst, 604 F.2d 844, 847 (4th Cir. 1979), or legal  conclusions couched as factual allegations, Iqbal, 556  U.S. at 678. C. Analysis 1. Discrimination Senior Lifestyle argues Lewis has failed to state a  plausible claim for discrimination due to her race or  color. (Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss [""Mot.""] at 1,  ECF No. 11-2). Title VII prohibits an employer from  discriminating [*8]  against employees due to race,  color, religion, sex, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. §  2000e-2(a). A plaintiff may establish a Title VII claim  ""either 'through direct and indirect evidence of retaliatory  [or discriminatory] animus,' or through a burden-shifting  'pretext' framework."" Netter v. Barnes, 908 F.3d 932,  938 (4th Cir. 2018) (quoting Foster v. Univ. of Md.-E.  Shore, 787 F.3d 243, 249 (4th Cir. 2015)). The Complaint does not include allegations of direct  evidence of discrimination. See Cole v. Fam. Dollar  Stores of Md., Inc., 811 F.App'x 168, 175 (4th Cir. 2020)  (""Direct 6 evidence is 'evidence of conduct or statements that both  reflect directly the alleged discriminatory attitude and that bear directly on the  contested employment decision.'"" (quoting Taylor v. Va. Union Univ., 193 F.3d 219, 232  (4th Cir. 1999))). 5 Accordingly, the Court will evaluate Lewis' claim under the burden- shifting framework first articulated by Page 4 of 7 the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.  Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). To establish a discrimination or retaliation claim under  the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, Lewis must eventually put  forth a prima facie case by establishing that: (1) she belongs to a protected class; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; (3) at the time of the adverse action, she was  performing her job at a level that met her employer's  legitimate expectations . . . ; and (4)  she  was  rejected  [or  terminated]  under  circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful  discrimination. See Adams v. Trs. of the Univ. of N.C.-Wilmington, 640  F.3d 550, 558 (4th Cir. 2011). The precise formulation of [*9]  the required prima facie  showing will vary in ""differing factual situations,"" McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802 n.13,  and the elements were ""never intended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic,'""  Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U.S. 506, 512 (2002) (quoting Furnco Constr. Corp. v.  Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577 (1978)). If Lewis succeeds in establishing a prima facie case, the  burden shifts to the employer to 5 In her Complaint, Lewis alleges that Senior Lifestyle  discriminated against her directly by excluding her from  meetings and taking away job responsibilities. (Compl.  at 5). The Court finds that these actions could show  indirect discrimination in some circumstances, but alone  they do not evince a ""discriminatory attitude"" towards  Lewis based on her race. See Cole, 811 F.App'x at 175.  Thus, the Court finds that Lewis presents no evidence of  direct discrimination. 7 ""present a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its  employment action."" Mackey v.Shalala, 360 F.3d 463,  468 (4th Cir. 2004). If the employer does so, ""the burden  shifts back to the employee to show that the given  reason was just a pretext for discrimination."" Id. The Court is mindful that a Title VII plaintiff need not  satisfy all the elements set forth above to survive a  motion to dismiss. See Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 510  (""The prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas,  however, is an evidentiary standard, [*10]  not a  pleading requirement.""); accord Parker v. Child.'s Nat'l  Med. Ctr., Inc., No. ELH-20-3523, 2021 WL 5840949, at  *9 (D.Md. Dec. 9, 2021) (""At the motion to dismiss  stage, a plaintiff need not establish a prima facie case of  discrimination.""). Instead, at the motion to dismiss stage,  a plaintiff need only ""allege[] facts that plausibly state a  violation of Title VII 'above a speculative level.'"" Bing v.  Brivo Sys., LLC, 959 F.3d 605, 617 (4th Cir. 2020)  (quoting Coleman v. Md. Ct. of Appeals, 626 F.3d 187,  190 (4th Cir. 2010)), cert. denied, 141 S.Ct. 1376  (2021). Thus, the plaintiff must generally show that the  employer took adverse action against the plaintiff ""under  circumstances which give rise to an inference of  unlawful discrimination."" Tex. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v.  Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981); Adams, 640 F.3d at  558. This requirement can be met by showing that  ""similarly-situated employees outside the protected  class received more favorable treatment."" White v.  BFIWaste Servs., LLC, 375 F.3d 288, 295 (4th Cir.  2004). The Court considers the ""totality of the circumstances""  in determining whether Lewis has adequately alleged  discrimination. See Strothers v. City of Laurel, 895 F.3d  317, 330-31 (4th Cir. 2018) (""[T]he connection between  animus and conduct may be inferred from the totality of  the circumstances.""); see also Woods v. City of  Greensboro, 855 F.3d 8 639, 649 (4th Cir. 2017) (concluding that a court ""may  infer discriminatory intent from evidence of a general  pattern of . . . discrimination in the practices of a  defendant""); Guirkin v. CMH Physician Servs., LLC, No.  3:20CV59, 2020 WL 6829769, at *7 n.13 (E.D.Va. Nov.  20, 2020) (""Although [plaintiff's] individual allegations do  not by themselves prove discriminatory [*11]  animus,  the totality of circumstances surrounding his termination  gives rise to the inference that [plaintiff] was fired, at  least in part, because of his [protected status].""). Senior Lifestyle argues that Lewis' allegations do not  support a reasonable inference that she was terminated  Page 5 of 7 due to unlawful discrimination. (See Mot. at 6). The  Court agrees. Lewis alleges that managers treated her  with hostility, excluded her from meetings, took away job  responsibilities, belittled her, and ignored her efforts to  resolve employee complaints. (See Compl. at 5-13).  Even taking these allegations as true and construing  them in the light most favorable to Lewis, the Court  cannot  infer  that  Senior  Lifestyle  acted  with  discriminatory animus due to Lewis' race or color. Lewis argues that she has stated a claim for  discrimination by showing Senior Lifestyle's disparate  treatment of employees outside her protected class.  (See Opp'n at 4). Specifically, Lewis alleges that  Kalkstein helped other white employees to set up their  offices and equipment, but that he did not help her.  (Compl. at 10). To the extent they intend to rely on comparator  evidence,  plaintiffs  in  the  Fourth  Circuit  must  demonstrate that [*12]  they are similarly situated with a  comparator ""by showing that they both (1) 'dealt with the  same supervisor,' and (2) were 'subject to the same  standards and . . . engaged in the same conduct without  such differentiating or mitigating 9 circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or  the employer's treatment of them for it.'"" Tinsley v. City  of Charlotte, 854 F.App'x 495, 500-01 (4th Cir. 2021)  (quoting Haynesv. Waste Connections, Inc., 922 F.3d  219, 223-24 (4th Cir. 2019)). This Court has previously  dismissed Title VII complaints in which the only  allegations  of  discriminatory  intent  come  from  insufficient comparator evidence. See Chatelle v.  Maryland, No. GLR-21-1734, 2022 WL 2953042, at *8  (D.Md. July 25, 2022) (dismissing complaint when  comparator evidence fails to establish discriminatory  intent or causation); Price v. HowardCnty. Pub. Sch.  Sys., No. GLR-22-541, 2023 WL 170425, at *10 (D.Md.  Jan. 11, 2023) (same). Here, Lewis has failed to show either of the two  elements set forth above, and thus she cannot state a  claim for discrimination based on comparator evidence.  Accordingly,  Lewis'  discrimination  claim  will  be  dismissed. 2. Retaliation Lewis alleges that Senior Lifestyle terminated her in  retaliation for her advocacy regarding African American  employees and discrimination in the workplace. (Compl.  at 11-13). Specifically, Lewis reported several different  employee complaints to Buckley between February 13,  2021 and March 2, 2021: • On February 13, 2021, Lewis reported a concern  from [*13]  an African American employee regarding  their white supervisor, (id. at 11); • On February 18 and 19, 2021, Lewis reported that  Kalkstein yelled at and demeaned Lambert, an African  American employee. Buckley told Lewis to ""stay out of  it,"" (id.); • On February 22, 2021, Lewis reported that Kalkstein  had cursed at an employee, (id.); 10 • On February 25, 2021, Lewis reported that a Black  employee had quit because Kalkstein and another  supervisor had demeaned her with ""slurs"" and asked  her if she could read. She also told Buckley that a  former white employee quit because she did not want to  take direction from an African American supervisor. In  response, Buckley told her ""stop supporting Black  employees before [you] end up in the hot seat."" Lewis  said that she did not understand, and Buckley replied  ""oh[,] you will."" Lewis informed her that ""you need to  treat all your employees the same,"" (id. at 12); • On March 1, 2021, Lewis reported that Kalkstein  assumed that Lambert, an African American supervisor,  made a mistake, and he reprimanded her on a group  text, even though a white supervisor made the mistake,  (id.). Also on March 2, 2021, Buckley informed Lewis that her  position was being eliminated, [*14]  and Lewis' last day  would be March 16, 2021. (Id.). On March 5, 2021,  management confined Lewis to her desk and would not  allow her to access payroll or to answer employee  questions. (Id. at 13). Senior Lifestyle argues the retaliation claim must be  dismissed because Lewis did not engage in protected  activity and even if she did, there is no causal  connection between the activity and her termination.  (Mot. at 7-8). At bottom, the Court finds Lewis has  alleged sufficient facts to plead a prima facie case of  retaliation. Title VII prohibits an employer from retaliating against  an employee who exercises her Title VII rights. Hart v.  Lew, 973 F.Supp.2d 561, 582 (D.Md. 2013). In order to  establish a prima facie claim of retaliation under Title  Page 6 of 7 VII, Lewis ""must show that she engaged in protected  activity, that her employer took adverse action against  her, and that a causal relationship existed between the  protected activity and the adverse employment activity.""  Id. (cleaned up). If she succeeds in establishing a prima  facie case, the McDonnellDouglas framework applies,  just as it does for a discrimination claim: ""If a plaintiff  puts 11 forth sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case  of  retaliation  and  a  defendant  offers  a  non- discriminatory [*15]  explanation for the adverse action,  the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that the  employer's proffered explanation is pretext."" Id. (cleaned  up). Regarding the first element, Title VII makes it unlawful  for ""an employer to discriminate against any of [its]  employees . . . because [s]he has opposed any practice  made an unlawful practice by this subchapter, or  because [s]he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or  participated in any manner in an investigation,  proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter."" 42  U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). Protected activity, ""therefore, can  take the form of either opposing a practice prohibited  under Title VII ([under] the opposition clause) or making  a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in an  investigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII  ([under] the participation clause)."" Pitter v. Cmty.  ImagingPartners, Inc., 735 F.Supp.2d 379, 395 (D.Md.  2010). ""The opposition clause has been held to  encompass  informal  protests,  such  as  voicing  complaints to employers or using an employer's  grievance procedures."" Id. at 396. Senior Lifestyle argues that Lewis' reports to Buckley do  not constitute protected activity because ""there are no  facts to suggest that Mr. Kalkstein's behavior was in any  way discriminatory or on the basis of a protected [*16]   characteristic."" (Reply Supp. Def.'s Mot. Dismiss  [""Reply""] at 4, ECF No. 21). The Court agrees that some  of Lewis' reports, such as the February 13, 2021 report  of a concern regarding a white director and an African  American employee, are too vague and do not indicate  any discriminatory animus. Nevertheless, the Court  must consider the totality of the circumstances and view  the facts in the light most favorable to Lewis. Albright,  510 U.S. at 268. In doing so, the Court finds 12 that Lewis reported a pattern of Kalkstein singling out  African American employees for discipline. The Court further finds that even if these reports were,  by themselves, insufficient to show protected activity,  Lewis' conversation with Buckley on February 25, 2021,  establishes the first element of her claim. In that  conversation, Buckley told Lewis to ""stop supporting  Black employees,"" indicating that Lewis' reports were  based upon a protected characteristic. (Compl. at 12).  Further, when Lewis told her that she did not  understand, Buckley said ""oh[,] you will,"" and Lewis  informed her that ""you need to treat all your employees  the same."" (Id.). Lewis' plea that Buckley ""treat all []  employees the same"" can be construed as a  request [*17]  for Senior Lifestyle to address alleged  discriminatory conduct. Because protected activity  ""encompass[es] informal protests, such as voicing  complaints to employers or using an employer's  grievance procedures,"" Pitter, 735 F.Supp.2d at 396, the  Court finds that Lewis participated in protected activity. Senior Lifestyle does not contest that it took an adverse  action against Lewis, and thus the Court moves to the  third element-whether a causal relationship existed  between the protected activity and the adverse  employment activity. To satisfy this element, a plaintiff  must show that ""the employer [took] the adverse  employment action because the plaintiff engaged in a  protected activity."" Dowe v. Total Action Against Poverty  inRoanoke Valley, 145 F.3d 653, 657 (4th Cir.1998)  (emphasis in original). The Fourth Circuit ""has held that  evidence that the alleged adverse action occurred  shortly after the employer became aware of the  protected activity is sufficient to 'satisf[y] the less  onerous burden of making a prima facie case of  causa[tion].'"" Id. (quoting Williams v. Cerberonics, 13 Inc., 871 F.2d 452, 457 (4th Cir.1989)) (emphasis and  alterations in Dowe). Conversely, ""the opposite [is]  equally true,"" so that ""[a] lengthy time lapse between the  employer becoming aware of the protected activity and  the alleged adverse employment action . . . [*18]  negates any inference that a causal connection exists  between the two."" Dowe, 145 F.3d at 657 (finding a  period of time exceeding three years too lengthy to give  rise to the inference of a causal connection); Clarke v.  DynCorp Int'l LLC, 962 F.Supp.2d 781, 790 (D.Md.  2013) (""[A] lapse of as little as two months between the  protected activity and an adverse employment action is  sufficiently long so as to weaken significantly the  inference of causation."") (citation omitted); Pascual v.  Page 7 of 7 Lowe's Home Centers, Inc., 193 F.App'x 229, 233 (4th  Cir. 2006) (two to four month period between protected  activity and termination was ""too long to establish a  causal connection by temporal proximity alone.""). Lewis is a self-represented litigant, and she does not  directly discuss causation in her Opposition or  Complaint. Regardless, plaintiffs are not required to  plead a formulaic recitation of the elements, see  E.E.O.C. v. Performance Food Grp., Inc., 16 F.Supp.3d  584, 588 (D.Md. 2014), and the Court finds that her  alleged timeline establishes causation by temporal  proximity. Lewis participated in protected activity on  February 25, 2021 when she made a report of racial  discrimination to Buckley and asked that Buckley ""treat  all [] employees the same."" (Compl. at 12). Buckley told  her to stop advocating for Black employees, and when  Lewis said she did not understand, Buckley said ""oh[,]  you will."" (Id.). Just five days later on March [*19]  2,  2021, Buckley told Lewis that her position was being  eliminated. (Id.). On March 5, 2021, Senior Lifestyle  took away key job responsibilities, and Lewis' last day  was March 16, 2021. (Id. at 13). Accordingly, Lewis has  established 14 causation because the adverse action occurred ""shortly""  after Senior Lifestyle became aware of the protected  activity. See Dowe, 145 F.3d at 657. Lewis has plead of prima facie case of retaliation  because she has established all three elements. See  Hart, 973 F.Supp.2d at 582. Under the McDonnell- Douglas framework, the burden then shifts to Senior  Lifestyle to offer a non-discriminatory explanation for the  adverse action. See id. Senior Lifestyle offers no  explanation for why it eliminated Lewis' position and  took away key job responsibilities, and thus its Motion  will be denied as to the retaliation claim.",1
"Lundstrom v. Holiday Hosp. Franchising, LLC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119435","ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT CHOICE HOTEL'S  MOTION TO DISMISS Before  the  Court  is  Defendant  Choice  Hotels  International, Inc.'s motion to dismiss the Plaintiff's First  Amended Complaint, filed on June 17, 2022. See Doc.  No. 16. Choice Hotels International, Inc. supplemented  its motion with a memorandum in support. See Doc. No.  17. Plaintiff Megan Lundstrom filed a response in  opposition to the motion on July 8, 2022. See Doc. No.  24. [*2]  Defendant Choice Hotels filed a reply brief on  July 22, 2022. See Doc. No. 26. For the reasons set  forth below, the Defendant's motion to dismiss (Doc. No.  16) is granted. The Plaintiff's motion for hearing (Doc.  No. 25) and motion for judgment on the pleadings (Doc.  No. 37) are denied. I. BACKGROUND  The Plaintiff brings this action for damages under the  federal  William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (""TVPRA""). The  Plaintiff claims Holiday Hospitality Franchising LLC  (""HHF"") and Choice Hotels International, Inc. (""Choice Hotels"") knew or should have known that sex trafficking  repeatedly occurs at their hotels and chose to ignore the  presence of trafficking in the name of profit and fees  from room rentals. See Doc. No. 12, p. 2. Specifically,  the Plaintiff alleges that, as a direct and proximate result  of the Defendant's refusal to address sex trafficking  issues at their hotels, she was trafficked, sexually  exploited,  and  repeatedly  victimized  at  HHF's  Candlewood Suites, Choice's Clarion Hotel Convention  Center, and Choice's Comfort Inn. HHF's Candlewood  Suites is located at 3716 6th Avenue West in Williston,  North Dakota. Id. at p. 3. The Plaintiff [*3]  alleges HHF  Candlewood Suites is an HHF brand property, and HHF  owns, supervise, manages, controls, and/or operates  the HHF Candlewood Suites. The Plaintiff claims she  was trafficked, sexually exploited, and repeatedly  victimized at Choice's Clarion Hotel Convention Center  located at 2200 Burdick Expressway East in Minot,  North Dakota. Id. at p. 6. She alleges Choice Clarion  Hotel is a Choice brand property, and Choice owns,  supervise, manages, controls, and/or operates the     Page 2 of 9 Choice Clarion Hotel. Id. at p. 7. Finally, the Plaintiff  claims she was trafficked, sexually exploited, and  repeatedly victimized at Choice's Comfort Inn located at  493 Elks Drive in Dickinson, North Dakota. Id. at p. 6.  She alleges Comfort Inn is a Choice brand property, and  Choice owns, supervise, manages, controls, and/or  operates the Comfort Inn. Id. at p. 7. Beginning in 2011 and throughout 2012, the Plaintiff  alleges she was routinely harbored for commercial sex.  Id. at p. 29. She claims that her trafficker sold her for  commercial sex throughout North Dakota under brutal  attacks, psychological torment, and sexual abuse at the  Defendants' hotels. Id. at p. 2. The Plaintiff and other  victims were allegedly flown [*4]  to North Dakota twice  each month to stay at the Defendants' hotels for a week  or more. Id. at p. 29. The traffickers would rent one  room with a single bed for the Plaintiff and co-victims to  service buyers, which could total six to twenty  customers, each, per day. Id. The Plaintiff claims she  was  forced  against  her  will,  physically  and  psychologically tortured, and sexually exploited under  such duress at the Defendant's hotels in Williston,  Minot, and Dickinson, North Dakota. Id. The Plaintiff alleges there were clear and obvious signs  that reveal the Defendants knew or should have known  that sex trafficking was occurring within their hotels,  including but not limited to: a. Requests for single bedrooms, despite multiple  occupants and/or late checkout; b. Payments for rooms in cash, daily, and/or same  day; c. The Plaintiff and other co-victims' physical  appearance (visible abuse, deterioration) and  inappropriate attire; d. Continuous traffic of men coming to and leaving  from the room, rarely whom were registered guests; e. Excessive requests for towels, sheets, cleaning  supplies, and/or room service; f. Large quantities of used condoms, lube bottles,  lingerie, sex toys, bodily fluids on the [*5]  sheets or  towels, and other sex-related items in the hotel  rooms; g. Employee encounters of the Plaintiff and co- victims in and around the Defendants' hotels; h. A specific occasion in which an altercation  ensued between a trafficker and co-victim, causing  a loud disturbance and shouts for police assistance; i. Online reviews of the Defendants' properties  which described the presence of ""working girls"" and  ""prostitutes""; and j. History of arrests and prosecution of traffickers at  the Defendant's properties. Id. at p. 26-30. In addition, the Plaintiff claims the  Defendants had actual and/or constructive notice of  illegal activity, such as prostitution and drug dealing,  prior to, during, and after the above-described incidents  due to oral or written complaints of suspicious activity  and video surveillance of the properties. Id. The Plaintiff  argues the Defendants, who she claims were aware of  the illegal activity, did nothing to prevent this behavior  from continuing and, as a result, allowed the  victimization and exploitation of the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff  claims that if ""Defendants [had] been paying attention""  or ""if Defendants anti-trafficking efforts in training,  policies, and procedures [*6]  at the brand hotels were  enforced and/or effective,"" it would have been  ""impossible"" to miss these signs of trafficking and, in  turn, the victimization of the Plaintiff. Id. at p. 31. The Plaintiff brings one claim against Choice Hotels for  violating the TVPRA. Id. at p. 43. She seeks all available  compensatory  damages,  punitive  damages,  consequential damages, and restitution, and attorney's  fees. Id. at p. 44. II. STANDARD OF REVIEW Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  requires a pleading to contain a ""short and plain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Rule 12(b)(6)  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandates the  dismissal of a claim if there has been a failure to state a  claim upon which relief can be granted. In order to  survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), ""a  complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,  accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is  plausible on its face."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,  678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). A  plaintiff must show that success on the merits is more  than a ""sheer possibility."" Id. A complaint is sufficient if  its ""factual content . . . allows the court to draw the  reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the  misconduct alleged."" Id. The court must accept all  factual allegations as true, except for legal conclusions  or ""formulaic [*7]  recitation of the elements of a cause  of action."" Id. at 681. Detailed factual allegations are not  necessary under the Rule 8 pleading standard, rather a  plaintiff must set forth grounds of its entitlement to relief  which ""requires more than labels and conclusions, and a  Page 3 of 9 formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action  will not do."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,  555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). A  complaint does not ""suffice if it tenders a naked  assertion devoid of further factual enhancement.""  Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at 678 (2009). The determination of  whether a complaint states a claim upon which relief  can be granted is ""a context-specific task that requires  the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience  and common sense."" Id. at 679. Dismissal will not be  granted unless it appears beyond doubt the plaintiff can  prove no set of facts entitling plaintiff to relief. Ulrich v.  Pop Cnty, 715 F.3d 1054, 1058 (8th Cir. 2013). III. LEGAL DISCUSSION A. WILLIAM WILBERFORCE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS  PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008  (""TVPRA"") The TVPRA, 18 U.S.C. § 1591, prohibits the sex  trafficking of children or adults by force, fraud, or  coercion. In 2008, Congress amended the TVPRA to  permit victims to sue those who facilitate trafficking  ventures as a civil cause of action. Pub. L. No. 108-193,  117 Stat. 2875 (2003). The 2008 law provides: An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may [*8]  bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) (emphasis added). To state a claim under 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a) beneficiary  theory, a plaintiff must allege facts from which it can  reasonably inferred that a defendant (1) ""knowingly  benefit[ted] financially or by receiving anything of value""  (2) from participation in a venture that defendant ""knew  or should have known has engaged in"" sex trafficking.  18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 455 F.  Supp. 3d 171, 181 (E.D. Pa. 2020). A plaintiff may  satisfy these elements in one of two ways. She may  show that the defendant's own acts, omissions, and  state of mind establish each element. Alternatively, she  may impute to the defendant the acts, omissions, and  state of mind of an agent of the defendant. The former is  referred to as ""direct liability"" and the latter as ""indirect  liability."" See A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., 484  F. Supp. 3d 921, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163412, 2020  WL 5371459, at *6 (D. Ore. Sept. 8, 2020); B.M. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  135494, 2020 WL 4368214, at *4 (N.D. Cal. July 30,  2020). The Plaintiff asserts her TVPRA claims under  both direct liability and indirect liability theories. The Plaintiff alleges the Defendant Choice [*9]  Hotels is  liable  because  they  knowingly  benefited  from  participation in a business venture that they should have  known violated 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). The allegation can  be broken down into four component parts: that the  franchisor (1) knowingly benefited (2) from participating  in a venture; (3) that venture violated the TVPRA as to  the Plaintiff; and (4) the franchisor knew or should have  known that the venture violated the TVPRA as to the  Plaintiff. B. LEGAL ANALYSIS Choice Hotels moves to dismiss the Plaintiff's claim  under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure. See Doc. No. 16. Choice Hotels presents  numerous arguments in support of its position. First,  Choice Hotels argues that the Plaintiff's claim is barred  by the doctrine of res judicata. See Doc. No. 17, p. 4.  Choice Hotels contends the Plaintiff failed to plausibly  allege that Choice ""knew or should have known"" of the  sex trafficking venture as required for direct liability  under the TVPRA. Id. at p. 5. Third, Choice Hotels  argues the Plaintiff's allegations fail to plausibly allege  indirect liability. Id. at p. 7. Finally, Choice Hotels argues  the Plaintiff's claim is barred by the statute of limitations.  The Court will address each argument in turn. 1. RES JUDICATA Choice Hotels argues [*10]  that the Plaintiffs claim is  barred by the doctrine of res judicata because the  dismissal in a prior lawsuit in Colorado. was final, on          Page 4 of 9 the merits, and based on proper jurisdiction. See Doc.  No. 17, p. 5. In addition, Choice Hotels argues, because  the present complaint involves the same parties and  factual underpinnings, that the Plaintiff could have  brought this claim in that action. Id. Conversely, the  Plaintiff contends res judicata is entirely inapplicable  because Colorado was an inappropriate jurisdiction for  the current lawsuit, the causes of action and issues are  wholly different from the prior litigation and the Plaintiff  was not given a ""full and fair opportunity"" to litigate her  claims and issues in the previous case. See Doc. No.  24, p. 5-9. The Court agrees with the Plaintiff. Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue  preclusion, four criteria must be met before a  determination is conclusive in a subsequent proceeding:  (1) the issue sought to be precluded must be the same  as that involved in the prior litigation; (2) that issue must  have been actually litigated; (3) it must have been  determined by a valid and final judgment; and (4) the  determination [*11]  must have been essential to the  judgment. Lovell v. Mixon, 719 F.2d 1373, 1376 (8th Cir.  1983). The doctrine of res judicata or claim preclusion  bars a later suit when (1) the first suit resulted in a final  judgment on the merits; (2) the first suit was based on  proper jurisdiction; (3) both suits involved the same  cause of action; and (4) both suits involved the same  parties or their privies. Id. Thus, the application of  collateral estoppel or issue preclusion is limited to those  matters previously at issue which were directly and  necessarily adjudicated. Montana v. United States, 440  U.S. 147, 153, 99 S. Ct. 970, 59 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1979). In  contrast, res judicata or claim preclusion bars the  relitigation of issues which were actually litigated, or  which could have been litigated in the first suit.  Federated Department Stores v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394,  398, 101 S. Ct. 2424, 69 L. Ed. 2d 103 (1981); Allen v.  McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S. Ct. 411, 66 L. Ed. 2d  308 (1980). However, both doctrines are applied only  when the party against whom the earlier decision is  being asserted had a ""full and fair opportunity"" to litigate  the issues in question. Kremer v. Chemical Construction  Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 481, 102 S. Ct. 1883, 72 L. Ed. 2d  262 (1982). The Court finds the Plaintiff's argument availing and  refuses to dispose of the case on res judicata grounds.  First, the District of Colorado was not the proper  jurisdiction to bring the instant case. The appropriate  court to bring a civil TVPRA hotel sex trafficking case is    within the state where the alleged sex trafficking  occurred, and [*12]  where the physical hotel properties  are located. See Order on In re: Hotel Industry Sex  Trafficking Litigation, MDL No. 2928 (J.P.M.L. Feb. 5,  2020), ECF No. 235. The Plaintiff could not, and did not,  bring the current action in federal court in Colorado  because the proper jurisdiction to bring this action is the  District of North Dakota, considering the events  surrounding the alleged trafficking and the hotels used  to harbor the Plaintiff were all located in North Dakota.  Similarly, the Colorado court did not, and could not,  render an appropriate judgment on the Plaintiff's  factually distinct North Dakota sex trafficking claims. To better understand why separate forums are  necessary in these types of circumstances, the United  States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML)  explained why they do not centralize all hotel sex  trafficking cases: ""[E]ach action involves different  alleged sex trafficking ventures, different hotel brands,  different owners and employees, different geographic  locales, different witnesses, different indicia of sex  trafficking, and different times periods. Thus, unique  issues  concerning  each  plaintiff's  sex  trafficking  allegations predominate."" Order, MDL No. 2928 at 2-3  (J.P.M.L. Feb. 5, 2020). The differences on a case-by- case basis force a very fact-specific determination of  where a sex trafficking [*13]  case will be properly  brought. The facts that orientate this case certainly vary  from those offered in the case previously presented  before the District of Colorado. The JPML makes note of  differences in ""geographic locales."" In the previous  action, the Plaintiff was sex trafficked in and around  Denver, Colorado, including throughout the Denver  Tech  area.  See  Complaint  and  Jury  Demand,  Lundstrom v. Choice Hotels International, Inc., No. 1:21- cv-619 (D. Colo., March 2, 2021), ECF No. 1, p. 2.  Specifically, she was allegedly trafficked at the Quality  Inn located at 9799 E. Geddes Ave., Centennial,  Colorado 80112, and Sleep Inn located at 12101 Grant  St, Thornton, Colorado 80241. Id. at p. 4. This rendered  the District of Colorado an appropriate jurisdiction to  bring the previous action. Whereas in this case, the  Plaintiff was allegedly trafficked at HHF's Candlewood  Suites located at 3716 6th Avenue West in Williston,  North Dakota, Choice's Clarion Hotel Convention Center  located at 2200 Burdick Expressway East in Minot,  North Dakota, and Choice's Comfort Inn located at 493  Elks Drive in Dickinson, North Dakota. See Doc. No. 12,  p. 3-6. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs action in Colorado was  properly brought in the forum in which she suffered  harm — where she was brought to be [*14]  sex  trafficked and where the hotels are located, namely  Page 5 of 9 federal court in Colorado. According to the JPML, another reason for separating  sex trafficking cases into different forums is that different  ventures occur over different periods of time. The facts  and circumstances surrounding the previous action that  was brought in the District of Colorado began in the  spring of 2009 and lasted through 2011. See Complaint  and Jury Demand, Lundstrom v. Choice Hotels  International, Inc., No. 1:21-cv-619 (D. Colo., March 2,  2021), ECF No. 1, p. 7. Specific dates of the alleged sex  trafficking  were  never  cited.  The  facts  and  circumstances surrounding the current action brought in  the District of North Dakota were alleged to have arisen  between 2011 and continued into 2012. Beyond the Court establishing that Colorado was an  inappropriate district to bring the Plaintiff's current case,  the causes of action and issues in the cases are wholly  distinct from one another. The Eighth Circuit Court of  Appeals has adopted the position of the Restatement  (Second) of Judgments in determining whether two  causes of action are the same for res judicata purposes.  Generally, under this approach a claim is barred by res  judicata if it arises out of the same nucleus of operative  facts as the prior claim. [*15]  Lane v. Peterson, 899  F.2d 737, 742 (8th Cir. 1990). This can be determined  pragmatically, giving weight to such considerations as  whether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or  motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit. Id. With the ""same nucleus of operative facts"" approach in  mind, the Court can compare the claims asserted in the  District of Colorado with those presently brought before  this forum. The Plaintiff's case contains different causes  of action and issues from those previously litigated in  Colorado. The Plaintiffs case involved different factual  underpinnings, different geographical locations, different  environmental factors, different perpetrators, different  hotels,  different  cities,  different  states,  different  modalities of trafficking, and different time frames. See  Doc. No. 24, p. 12. Specifically, the Plaintiff's current  case involves hotels located in Minot, Williston, and  Dickinson, North Dakota as opposed to the prior action  involving hotels in and around Denver, Colorado;  correspondingly, different hotel staff were involved. Id.  The two actions also involved different sex traffickers,  different means of being trafficked, and different  trafficking experiences. While being trafficked by her  first [*16]  abuser in Colorado, she was trafficked  primarily for several hours during the day, as opposed to  multiple week-long stays like she had in North Dakota.  Id. at p. 13. Finally, the time frames of trafficking, as  noted above, are entirely different in the two cases. The  sex trafficking that was occurring in Colorado was  alleged to have occurred from 2009 to 2011. Id.  Conversely, the sex trafficking that allegedly occurred in  North Dakota took place from 2011 to 2012. Id. These  are two, separate timeframes from which sex trafficking  was allegedly occurring. Applying the Restatement (Second)'s definition of ""same  claim"", the Court finds it indisputable that the case  previously brought before the federal court in the District  of Colorado and this case present different, isolated  claims for res judicata purposes. The cases involve an  independent nucleus of operative facts, including but not  limited to: different geographical locations, different  environmental factors, different perpetrators, different  hotels,  different  cities,  different  states,  different  modalities of sex trafficking, and different time frames. Finally, for res judicata to apply a ""the party whom the  earlier decision is being [*17]  asserted [must have] had  a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues in  question."" Mixon, 719 F.2d at 1376. To accomplish this,  the factual precedent must be the same as previously  litigated. Simmons v. O'Brien, 77 F.3d 1093, 1097. As  mentioned above, the two cases present a different,  separate ""nucleus of operative facts"" that have not yet  been litigated. Thus, the Plaintiff was never afforded a  ""full and fair opportunity to litigate"" her claims and  issues in the case presented to the District of Colorado.  As such, res judicata does not bar the Plaintiffs claims. 2. DIRECT LIABILITY In her complaint, the Plaintiff contends the Defendant  Choice Hotels is directly liable for their role in the sex  trafficking of the Plaintiff. See Doc. No. 12, p. 32. First,  the  Plaintiff  alleges  the  Defendants  ""knowingly  benefited"" from participation in their commercial  business ventures with their hotels. Id. at p. 34. She  further states the Defendant knowingly benefited from  the sex trafficking of the Plaintiff and other victims  because the Defendant rented rooms to sex traffickers  and developed a business model that attracts and  fosters the commercial sex market for traffickers and  buyers. Id. Second, the Plaintiff claims that despite  having actual and/or [*18]  constructive knowledge of  sex trafficking allegedly occurring at the Defendant's  hotels, the Defendant has failed to stop or adequately  address sex trafficking at their hotels. Id. at p. 33. In  addition, the Plaintiff argues the Defendants' hotels  necessarily permit and facilitate sex trafficking, by  Page 6 of 9 design, through strategic business decisions. Id. at p.  36. In the motion to dismiss, Choice Hotels argues the  Plaintiff failed to plausibly allege that Choice Hotels  ""knew or should have known"" of the sex trafficking  venture as required for direct liability under the TVPRA.  See Doc. No. 17, p. 5. Choice Hotels does not address  the ""knowingly benefit"" allegations in its motion. In  response to Choice's motion to dismiss, the Plaintiff  reiterates her position from the complaint and argues  that she sufficiently alleged the Defendants knowingly  benefited from renting rooms to the Plaintiff's traffickers.  See Doc. No. 24, p. 11. She restates Choice Hotels  knew or should have known that its hotels ""harbor,""  ""provide,"" ""advertise,"" and ""maintain"" victims of sex  trafficking through force, threats, fraud, and/or coercion.  See Doc. No. 24, p. 12. In reply, Choice maintains that  the Plaintiff cannot [*19]  accurately allege that Choice  Hotels ""knowingly benefited"" from Plaintiff's trafficking or  that Choice ""knew or should have known"" about the sex  trafficking altogether. See Doc. No. 26, p. 4, 6. To more clearly evaluate whether the Defendants are  directly liable, the Court considers (1) whether the  Defendants knowingly benefited and (2) whether the  Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that Choice Hotels  participated in a business venture that knew or should  have known engaged in sex trafficking. Choice Hotels argues the only ""benefit"" the Plaintiff  alleges Choice received is ""franchise fees and  continuous royalties on their branded hotels."" Id.  However, the complaint directly contradicts that. The  complaint alleges Choice Hotels knowingly benefited  from ""royalty payments, licensing fees, and percentages  of the gross room revenue generated by the hotel  operations,"" including rates charged through the rental  of rooms where the Plaintiff was trafficked. See Doc.  No. 12, p. 2, 8, 23. Yet, Choice Hotels argues such  allegations are insufficient. Choice Hotels insists  revenue generated from the ordinary course of business  cannot support a reasonable inference that Choice  knowingly benefitted from [*20]  alleged crimes because  the revenue was derived from all operations. Id. The  Court disagrees. As the Court explained in J.L. v. Best  Western, several other district courts have found that  similar allegations are sufficient to plead the knowingly- benefited element. 521 F. Supp. 3d 1048, 1059. See  also E.S. v. Best W. Int'l, Inc., 510 F. Supp. 3d 420,  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3065, 2021 WL 37457, at *3  (N.D. Tex. Jan. 4, 2021); M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels &  Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959, 965 (S.D. Ohio  2019) (""[T]he rental of a room constitutes a financial  benefit from a relationship with the trafficker sufficient to  meet this element of the [§] 1595(a) standard.""); A.B. v.  Marriott Int'l, Inc., 455 F. Supp. 3d 171, 191 (same); H.H  v. G6 Hosp., LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019  WL 6682152, at *2 (S.D. Ohio Dec. 6, 2019) (same);  S.Y. v. Naples Hotel Co., 476 F. Supp. 3d 1251, 1256  (M.D. Fla. 2020) (same); A.B. v. Hilton Worldwide  holdings Inc., 484 F. Supp.3d 921, 936 (""The 'knowingly  benefits financially' element of § 1595 merely requires  that Defendant knowingly receive a financial benefit[,]  and the rental of a hotel room ... constitutes a financial  benefit sufficient to meet this element."" (internal  quotations omitted)). The Court agrees with these cases  and finds that the Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the  knowingly-benefited element under her direct liability  theory against the Defendant. The second portion of establishing direct liability in this  context requires the Court to determine whether the  Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that the hotel franchisor  (Choice Hotels International, Inc.) participated in a  venture that violated the TVPRA. Specifically, the  Plaintiff must establish that the hotel [*21]  franchisor  knew or should have known of the alleged sex  trafficking venture taking place in their hotels across the  nation. The Defendant argues the Plaintiff has not met  this burden and the Court agrees. The Plaintiff did not  establish that the hotel franchisor knew or should have  known about the sex trafficking at its hotels in North  Dakota. In determining whether Choice Hotels participated in a  venture which it knew or should have known engaged in  sex trafficking, the Court considers the two cases that  represent the ends of the spectrum on TVPRA civil  liability, Ricchio v. McLean, 853 F.3d 553 (1st Cir. 2017)  and Lawson v. Rubin, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71582  (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 29, 2018). Ricchio presents the heinous  end of the spectrum with more vulgar facts that clearly  establish the ""knowing"" element of direct liability. In  Ricchio, along with the allegations of ""high-fives""  between the trafficker and hotel owner while discussing  ""getting this thing [a past business relationship between  the trafficker and hotel owner] going again,"" the plaintiff  alleged that ""in plain daylight view of the front office of  the motel,"" her trafficker ""kick[ed] her and force[d] her  back toward the rented quarters when she had tried to  escape."" Ricchio, 853 F.3d at 555. The Plaintiff's allegations do not rise to the level of  obviousness present [*22]  in Ricchio. The Plaintiff's  facts do not suggest a direct agreement between her  Page 7 of 9 sex trafficker and Choice Hotels, the franchisor.  However, the Plaintiff does not need to prove reckless  disregard under Section 1595(a). The Plaintiff need only  show that the Defendant ""should have known"" about the  nature of the venture under a negligence standard. This  does not require evidence of actual knowledge or  conspiracy between the Defendant and the sex  trafficker. On the other end of the spectrum is Hillary Lawson v.  Howard Rubin, No. 1:17-cv-6404 (BMC), 2018 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 71582, 2018 WL 2012869 (E.D.N.Y. Apr.  29, 2018). There, the Plaintiffs sued Blue Icarus, the  owner of a condo leased to a sex trafficker, Howard  Rubin. Rubin procured women who he then sexually  assaulted and abused. Lawson, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  71582, 2018 WL 2012869, at *13. The court found the  Plaintiff's allegations insufficient to hold Blue Icarus  liable under Section 1595 because Blue Icarus did not  have reason to know about the sex trafficking. Id.  (""Plaintiffs did not claim that Blue Icarus had actual  notice of the alleged activity, only that it should have  known about alleged trafficking based on its duty to  monitor the premises.""). In this case, the Plaintiff's claims fall between Ricchio  and Lawson, somewhere much closer to the claims  outlined in M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 967 (the sex  trafficker refused housekeeping services, paid in cash,  and escorted [*23]  the plaintiff in view of the front desk;  hotel staff ignored the plaintiff's cries; plaintiff's  customers would enter and exit the hotel through the  front door) and J.L., 521 F. Supp. 3d at 1057 (trafficked  in multiple hotels, plaintiff arrived without luggage, left  wearing the same clothes as arrival, physically  appeared malnourished, deteriorated, and injured at  times). The federal court in M.A. held that these  allegations  were  insufficient  to  establish  actual  knowledge because the plaintiff did not allege that any  member of the hotel staff heard and ignored her pleas  or that she alerted any staff member to her need for  help. Id. at 968. Similarly, in J.L. v. Best W. Int'l, Inc.,  521 F. Supp. 3d 1048, the court found the claims failed  to show actual knowledge of the plaintiff's sex  trafficking. The Plaintiff in this case argues the sex trafficking was  ""anything but discrete."" See Doc. No. 24, p. 12. In her  Amended Complaint, the Plaintiff alleged ""obvious  signs"" existed that would have put the hotels (the  franchisee) on notice of the sex trafficking, such as: a. Requests for single bedrooms, despite multiple  occupants and/or late checkout; b. Payments for rooms in cash, daily, and/or same  day; c. The Plaintiff and other co-victims' physical  appearance (visible abuse, deterioration) [*24]  and  inappropriate attire; d. Continuous traffic of men coming to and leaving  from the room, rarely whom were registered guests; e. Excessive requests for towels, sheets, cleaning  supplies, and/or room service; f. Large quantities of used condoms, lube bottles,  lingerie, sex toys, bodily fluids on the sheets or  towels, and other sex-related items in the hotel  rooms; g. Employee encounters of the Plaintiff and co- victims in and around Defendants' hotels; h. A specific occasion in which an altercation  ensued between a trafficker and co-victim, causing  a loud disturbance and shouts for police assistance; i. Online reviews of the Defendants' properties  which described the presence of ""working girls"" and  ""prostitutes""; and j. History of arrests and prosecution of traffickers at  the Defendant's properties. Id. at p. 26-30. When construed in the light most favorable to the  Plaintiff, the Plaintiff's allegations do not plausibly  establish that the Defendant hotel (the franchisor)  should have known about sex trafficking at one of its  hotels located throughout the country. See A.B., 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163412, 2020 WL 5371459, at *9  (emphasis added). The Plaintiff alleges the Defendant  franchisor was on notice about the prevalence of sex  trafficking generally [*25]  at its hotels for years. See  Doc. No. 12, p. 24-28. However, this is not sufficient to  show that the Defendant franchisor should have known  about what happened to this particular plaintiff. S.J., 473  F. Supp. 3d 147, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127436, 2020  WL 4059569, *5 (noting that Section 1595 ""speaks in  singular terms - 'participation in a venture which that  person . . . should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter'"" means knowledge of a general  sex trafficking problem is not sufficient and thus finding  that hotel franchisor defendants could not be held  directly liable under the TVPRA). General knowledge of  commercial sex activity occurring at hotels across the  United States is insufficient on its own to demonstrate  that the Defendant/Franchisor participated in the sex  trafficking of the plaintiff. See A.B., 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 163412, 2020 WL 5371459, at *9. Page 8 of 9 Thus, the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts as to  how the Defendant Choice Hotels, the franchisor, was  aware or should have been aware of the sex trafficking.  A.B., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163412, 2020 WL 5371459,  at *9. Accordingly, the plaintiff has not alleged facts  sufficient to state a claim for direct liability under the  TVPRA  against  the  Defendant  Choice  Hotels  International, Inc., the franchisor. 3. INDIRECT LIABILITY The Plaintiff also alleges the Defendants are vicariously  liable for their role in the sex trafficking of the Plaintiff.  See Doc. No. 12, p. 37. The Plaintiff claims the  Defendant had an actual and apparent agency  relationship with the Candlewood Suites, Clarion Hotel,  and Comfort Inn where she was allegedly trafficked. Id.  at p. 40. In opposition, Choice Hotels argues the Plaintiff  proffered nothing more than conclusory and vague  allegations, and a claim under an agency theory fails  because the complaint does not plausibly allege the  hotel is liable under Section 1595. See Doc. No. 17, p.  7-8.  The  Court  finds  Choice  Hotels'  argument  persuasive and highlights Chief Judge Brimmer's  holding regarding actual agency in this context: Plaintiff has failed to show that the hotels knew or  should have known that plaintiff was being  trafficked. The deficiencies in plaintiff's complaint  are similar to those that the Court found in J.L.,  where the plaintiff did not allege that staff noticed  her physical state, traffic in and out of her room,  and state of her room to be signs of trafficking, let  alone that defendant was aware of the facts of  these signs. The Court notes that [*27]  many of the  allegations in this case appear to be copied word- for-word from the complaint in J.L. Moreover, in  J.L., the Court contrasted the plaintiff's allegations  with those where courts have found the allegations              to be sufficient. The Court observed the plaintiff's  allegations in A.B., 455 F. Supp. 3d at 189-90,  where the plaintiff alleged that staff were aware of  ""loud altercations"" as well as ""constant"" attacks on  the plaintiff, and in H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *1, where the  plaintiff alleged that hotel staff discovered her  chained up in the bathroom and ignored her plea  for help. Plaintiff does not allege that hotel staff  ""observed her trafficker forcefully bring her to a  hotel, attack her, restrain her, or argue with her.""  See A.B., 484 F. Supp. 3d at 921; H.H., 2019 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *1  (alleging signs of trafficking such as branding,  restraints, bruises, and physical deterioration);  B.M., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135494, 2020 WL  4368214, at *6 (alleging front desk staff had  personal  relationships  with  traffickers).  While  plaintiff alleges various indicia of trafficking, for  instance, that staff noticed her check-in and check- out patterns, the frequency of her visits, that there  were used condoms in the room, she does not  allege that hotel staff actually noticed these to be  signs of trafficking. Because these allegations are  not sufficient for the Court to [*28]  conclude that  the hotels, i.e., defendant's agents, knew of  plaintiff's trafficking, as opposed to her commercial  sex activity, plaintiff necessarily has not stated a  claim that defendant could be liable under an actual  agency theory. See J.L., 521 F. Supp. 3d at 1073;  A.B., 484 F. Supp. 3d at 940-941. Lundstrom, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 228651, 2021 WL  5579117, at *9. The Plaintiff contends she is relying upon an entirely  different theory of liability, which the federal court in the  District of Colorado did not rule on. See Doc. No. 24, p.  27. She argues the Defendants' staff should have  known to recognize the signs of the Plaintiffs trafficking  at the Defendant's hotels. Id. Further, she alleges the  Defendant failed to implement and enforce anti-sex  trafficking policies, procedures, and training and, as a  result, the Defendant is directly liable under Section  1595. Id. However, the Court's unwillingness to adopt  the Plaintiff's position does not automatically render the  Colorado court's holding unusable simply because she  has a strong conviction in her argument. The Plaintiff provides a blanket statement that seeks to  connect the franchisor-franchisee relationship to actual  agency: ""Defendant Choice owned, supervised, and/or  operated the Choice Clarion Hotel and Choice Comfort  Page 9 of 9 Inn. See Doc. No. 12, p. 39. Merely alleging [*29]  ""facts  tending to show that the franchisors' involvement was  limited to uniformity and standardization of the brand""  are ""insufficient to establish complete control over the  day-to-day operations of the franchisee's business.""  H.G., 489 F. Supp. 3d at 708-709; S.J., 473 F. Supp. 3d  at 156 (holding that allegations regarding uniformity and  standardization of the brand, even if proven true, ""would  fail to sufficiently demonstrate that the franchisor  defendants exercised such complete control over the  day-to-day operations of the franchisee's business that  its purported independence may be fairly dismissed as a  fiction""). In addition, the Plaintiff has failed to show that  Choice Hotels knew or should have known that the  Plaintiff  was  being  trafficked;  therefore,  plaintiff  necessarily has not stated a claim that defendant could  be liable under an agency theory. See J.L., 521 F.  Supp. 3d at 1073; A.B., 484 F. Supp. 3d at 940-941. Choice Hotels argues the Plaintiff fails to allege facts to  support an apparent agency theory. To establish liability  based on apparent agency, the Plaintiff must show that  manifestations by the Defendant led her to believe that  the hotels were agents of the Defendant, and that  Plaintiff relied on that belief when engaging with the  hotels. Restatement (Third) of Agency § 2.03 (2006).  See also at § 2.03 cmt. c. (""Apparent authority [*30]   holds a principal accountable for the results of third- party beliefs about an actor's authority to act as an  agent when the belief is reasonable and is traceable to  a manifestation of the principal.""). Nowhere in the  amended complaint does the Plaintiff claim she relied  on any representations of the Defendant when engaging  with the branded hotels operated by franchisees.  Therefore, an apparent agency theory of liability does  not comport with the underlying facts of this case, and  the Court finds Plaintiff has failed to allege the required  elements of apparent authority. 4. Statute of Limitations The TVPRA states that ""[n]o action may be maintained .  . . unless it is commenced not later than the later of . . .  10 years after the cause of action arose."" 18 U.S.C. §  1595(c)(1). The Plaintiff alleges that she was trafficked  ""[b]eginning in 2011 and throughout 2012,"" states that  she was ""flown to North Dakota twice each month to  stay...for a week or more at a time"". See Doc. No. 12, p.  29. She also states that she and other co-victims would  ""service a constant stream of buyers totaling sex to  twenty customers, each, per day. Id. The Defendant  argues the Plaintiff's claims are time-barred, or, at the  very least, [*31]  the portions of her claim that are  alleged to have occurred prior to April 4, 2012. See Doc.  No. 12, p. 24. In response, the Plaintiff emphasizes that  she was trafficked ""throughout 2012"" and therefore  alleges trafficking well within the 10-year TVPRA statute  of limitations. Id. She also argues that her sex trafficking  was a pattern of continuing wrongful conduct and the  ""continuing violation doctrine"" applies because she was  repeatedly assaulted, abused, and raped ""hundreds  upon hundreds of times at Defendant's hotels"" over two  years and ""at least one act occurred within the statutory  filing period."" Id. The Court will not consider this  argument because the Court has found that the Plaintiff  has not plausibly alleged that the Defendant/Franchisor  violated the TVPRA. However, the Court finds that, even  if the plaintiff had plausibly alleged the elements of a  TVPRA claim, the portions of her claims resting on sex  trafficking prior to April 4, 2012 (ten years prior to the  filing of her complaint) would be time-barred. See H.G.,  489 F. Supp. 3d at 710 (finding any claims arising from  more than ten years before the filing of the complaint to  be barred); Ardolf v. Weber, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  159289, 2020 WL 5209525, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 1,  2020)  (""Accordingly,  because  [p]laintiff  failed  to  commence this [*32]  action within ten years of the  accrual of the alleged cause of action, it is barred by the  statute of limitations."").",0
"McSean v. LeMons, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217918","[*1] MEMORANDUM AND ORDER Before the Court is the motion of Plaintiff Kelly McSean,  f/k/a Larry Bemboom, for leave to proceed in forma  pauperis in this civil action. The Court has reviewed the  motion and the financial information provided in support,  and has determined to grant the motion and assess an  initial partial filing fee of $7.95. In additional, the Court  will partially dismiss the Complaint and direct the Clerk  to effect service of process as to the non-frivolous  portions, and will deny without prejudice Plaintiff's  motion to appoint counsel. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(b)(1) Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(b)(1), a prisoner bringing  a civil action in forma pauperis is required to pay the full  amount of the filing fee. District courts ""shall assess  and, when funds exist, collect, as a partial payment of  any court fees required by law, an initial partial filing fee  of 20 percent of the greater of"" the average monthly  deposits to the prisoner's account, or the average  monthly balance in the prisoner's account for the prior  six-month period. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(b)(1). After payment  of the initial partial filing fee, the prisoner is required to  make monthly payments of 20 percent of the preceding  month's income credited to his account. 28 U.S.C. §  1915(b)(2). The agency having custody of [*2]  the  prisoner will forward these monthly payments to the Clerk of Court each time the amount in  the account exceeds $10, until the filing fee is fully paid.  Id. In support of the instant motion, Plaintiff filed an inmate  account statement that shows an average monthly  deposit of $39.73, and an average monthly balance of  $29.39. Therefore, the Court assesses an initial partial  filing fee of $7.95, which is twenty percent of Plaintiff's  average monthly deposit. Legal Standard on Initial Review This Court is required to review a complaint filed in  forma  pauperis  to  determine  whether  summary  dismissal is appropriate. See 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e). This  Court must dismiss a complaint or any portion of it that  states a frivolous or malicious claim, that fails to state a  claim upon which relief may be granted, or that seeks  monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from  such relief. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2). An action is frivolous  if it ""lacks an arguable basis in either law or fact.""  Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 328 (1989). An action  fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted if  it does not plead ""enough facts to state a claim to relief  that is plausible on its face."" Bell Atlantic Corp. v.  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). A claim is facially plausible when the plaintiff ""pleads  factual content that allows the court [*3]  to draw the  reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the  misconduct alleged."" Page 2 of 5 Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Determining  whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief is  a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court  to draw upon judicial experience and common sense. Id.  at 679. The court must assume the veracity of well- pleaded facts, but need not accept as true ""[t]hreadbare  recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported  by mere conclusory statements."" Id. at 678 (citing  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). Seealso Barton v. Taber,  820 F.3d 958, 964 (8th Cir. 2016) (courts must ""accept  as true the facts 2 alleged, but not legal conclusions or threadbare recitals  of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere  conclusory statements.""). This Court liberally construes complaints filed by  laypeople. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976).  ""Liberal construction"" means that ""if the essence of an  allegation is discernible,"" the court should ""construe the  complaint in a way that permits the layperson's claim to  be considered within the proper legal framework.""  Solomon v. Petray, 795 F.3d 777, 787 (8th Cir. 2015)  (quoting Stone v. Harry, 364 F.3d 912, 914 (8th Cir.  2004)). However, even complaints filed by self- represented persons must allege facts that, if true, state  a claim for relief as a matter of law. Martin v. Aubuchon,  623 F.2d 1282, 1286 (8th Cir. 1980). Federal courts are  not required to assume facts that are not alleged, Stone,  364 F.3d at 914-15, and are not required to  interpret [*4]  procedural rules to excuse mistakes by  those who proceed without counsel. See McNeilv.  United States, 508 U.S. 106, 113 (1993). The Complaint Plaintiff is a pretrial detainee at the St. Francois County  Detention Center (also ""Detention Center""). Because  Plaintiff identifies herself as a transgender female, the  Court will refer to her using feminine pronouns. Plaintiff  filed the Complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983  against  Officers  Jessica  Lemons  and  Unknown  Bainbridge. Plaintiff identifies both defendants as St.  Francois County Sheriff's Department employees, and  sues them in their official and individual capacities. She  alleges as follows. ""After being informed that the ACLU and an attorney  had contacted the St. Francois County Detention Center  of the Constitutional rights of transgender persons,""  Plaintiff ""submitted an Inmate Request Form as to the  status of ability to purchase and have female 3 undergarments."" (ECF No. 1 at 5). 1 Plaintiff references  her June 10, 2023 Inmate Request Form (also ""Form""),  and states she plans to file a copy of it as an exhibit. Id.  at 5, 21. On the afternoon of June 21, 2023, Lemons, ""who has  not been involved in this matter, used her authority and  position to retaliate, discriminate, and sexually harass  Ms. McSean"" [*5]  when she entered the pod and  yelled, ""what cell is he in."" Id. at 5. Lemons then went to  Plaintiff's cell door with six other officers, and began  yelling at Plaintiff ""in front of other inmates, for  exercising her First Amendment right by filing a request  form."" Id. Lemons waved her arms, told Plaintiff she was  making the canteen officer uncomfortable, yelled and  ""sexually harassed"" Plaintiff in a loud aggressive voice,  and said she ""was about to lose it."" Id. at 6. Lemons asked Plaintiff how many times she had been  told ""no,"" and Plaintiff replied ""several."" Id. Lemons  asked ""how many times"" again in a louder voice, and  Plaintiff repeated ""several."" Id. In a ""demanding voice,""  Lemons told Plaintiff to stop, and to not ask for the  undergarments  again.  Id.  Bainbridge  then  twice  demanded that Plaintiff tell Lemons ""yes ma'am,"" while  keeping his hand on his can of mace. Id. at 6-7. Plaintiff  alleges she feared she would be maced or assaulted.  She states she ""did not file a grievance on this issue  due to being told not to ask again. I fear their actions of  doing so."" Id. at 21. Plaintiff claims the Defendants violated her rights under  the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. She can  be  understood  to  claim  that  the  Defendants  retaliated [*6]  against her ""for exercising her First  Amendment right by filing"" the Form. Id. at 5. Plaintiff  also states that the Defendants sexually harassed her,  sexually assaulted her, verbally abused her, and  discriminated against her on the basis of sex. She  identifies her injuries as increased anxiety, emotional  and 1Plaintiff handwrote the Statement of Claim in all  uppercase letters. When quoting the Complaint, the  Court will use lowercase letters. 4 mental distress, undue worry and stress, sleep  disturbance, and fear of authority figures. She seeks  monetary relief. Page 3 of 5 Discussion The Court will dismiss Plaintiff's official-capacity claims.  An official-capacity claim against an individual is actually  ""against the governmental entity itself."" White v.  Jackson, 865 F.3d 1064, 1075 (8th Cir. 2017). Thus, a  ""suit against a public employee in his or her official  capacity is merely a suit against the public employer.""  Johnson v. Outboard Marine Corp., 172 F.3d 531, 535  (8th Cir. 1999). See also Elder-Keep v. Aksamit, 460  F.3d 979, 986 (8th Cir. 2006) (stating that a ""suit against  a public official in his official capacity is actually a suit  against the entity for which the official is an agent"");  Brewington v. Keener, 902 F.3d 796, 800 (8th Cir. 2018)  (explaining that an official capacity suit against sheriff  and his deputy ""must be treated as a suit against the  County""). To prevail on an official capacity claim, a  plaintiff must establish the [*7]  governmental entity's  liability for the alleged conduct. Kelly v. City of Omaha,  Neb., 813 F.3d 1070, 1075 (8th Cir. 2016). Plaintiff identifies both defendants as St. Francois  County Sheriff's Department employees. The St.  Francois County Sheriff's Department is not an entity  that is subject to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See  Ketchum v. City of West Memphis, Ark., 974 F.2d 81, 82  (8th  Cir.  1992)  (stating  that  ""departments  or  subdivisions"" of local government are not ""juridical  entities suable as such""). St. Francois County is an  entity that can be sued directly under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs. of City of New York, 436  U.S. 658, 690 (1978). Liability may attach if a  constitutional violation resulted from an official policy, an  unofficial custom, or a deliberately indifferent failure to  train or supervise. Mick v. Raines, 883 F.3d 1075, 1079  (8th 5 Cir. 2018). In this case, the Complaint contains no such  assertions. Therefore, the Court will dismiss Plaintiff's  official-capacity claims. The Court now addresses Plaintiff's individual-capacity  claims. Plaintiff can be understood to assert a First  Amendment retaliation claim against both defendants  under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. To establish such a claim, a  plaintiff must show (1) she engaged in a protected  activity, (2) the government official took adverse action  against her that would chill a person of ordinary  firmness from continuing in the activity, and (3) the  adverse action was motivated at least in part by the  exercise [*8]  of the protected activity. Revels v.  Vincenz, 382 F.3d 870, 876 (8th Cir. 2004). The  ""ordinary firmness"" test is an objective one. Garcia v.  City of Trenton, 348 F.3d 726, 728 (8th Cir. 2003). The  relevant inquiry is not whether the plaintiff was deterred;  although the plaintiff's actions might be evidence of what  a reasonable person would have done. Id. The inquiry  ""is usually best left to the judgment of a jury."" Santiago  v. Blair, 707 F.3d 984, 992 (8th Cir. 2013). In this case, the activity for which Plaintiff claims she  suffered retaliation was the filing of the June 10, 2023  Form. Therefore, the Court considers whether that  qualifies as activity that is protected under the First  Amendment. Prisoners have a First Amendment right to  ""petition for redress of grievances under a prison's  grievance procedure."" Nelson v. Shuffman, 603 F.3d  439, 449 (8th Cir. 2010). ""The filing of a prison  grievance, like the filing of an inmate lawsuit, is  protected First Amendment activity."" Lewis v. Jacks, 486  F.3d 1025, 1029 (8th Cir. 2007). Plaintiff identifies the June 10, 2023 filing as an ""Inmate  Request Form,"" and she initially states she filed it ""as to  the status of ability to purchase and have female  undergarments."" (ECF No. 1 at 5). Considered in  isolation, that does not characterize the Form as a  petition for redress of a grievance that would be  protected by the First Amendment. Based upon  Plaintiff's other 6 statements in the Complaint, however, it is clear that  Plaintiff previously requested the undergarments [*9]   ""several"" times, and had been told ""no."" Id. at 6. Also,  Plaintiff can be understood to explain that she filed the  Form after she learned new information that she thought  might allow her to challenge those past denials and  seek redress. Id. at 5. Therefore, liberally construing the  Complaint, the Court cannot conclude for purposes of  initial review that Plaintiff's filing of the Form did not  qualify as protected First Amendment activity. The right to be free from retaliation for availing oneself  of the grievance process is clearly established in the  Eighth Circuit. Santiago, 707 F.3d at 991. See also  Nelson, 603 F.3d at 450 (stating ""that actions taken in  retaliation for an inmate's filing of a grievance are  actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983""). Here, Plaintiff  alleges that Lemons and Bainbridge took adverse action  to retaliate against her for filing the Form, and to prevent  her from trying to obtain the undergarments. Plaintiff's  allegations are sufficient to establish, for purposes of  initial review, that the adverse action would chill a  person of ordinary firmness from continuing in that  Page 4 of 5 activity. See Santiago, 707 F.3d at 992 (stating that the question  of ordinary firmness ""is usually best left to the judgment  of a jury.""). To the extent Plaintiff can be understood to claim that  the [*10]  defendants violated her federally protected  rights by subjecting her to sexual harassment or sexual  assault, however, such claims fail. The only encounter  Plaintiff identifies is the June 21, 2023 incident. Plaintiff  does not allege that either Defendant made any  statement or gesture that could be construed as sexual  in nature, nor does she allege that either Defendant  made physical contact with her. While Plaintiff  characterizes the Defendants' actions as sexual  harassment or sexual assault, this Court need not  accept Plaintiff's speculation as true. See Twombly, 550  U.S. at 555 (citation omitted). In addition, the Eighth  Circuit has recognized that even verbal sexual  harassment without contact 7 or touching does not amount to a constitutional violation.  Howard v. Everett, 208 F.3d 218 (8th Cir. 2000)  (unpublished table decision); see also Burton v.  Livingston, 791 F.2d 97, 99 (8th Cir. 1986) (""mere  words, without more, do not invade a federally protected  right.""). Plaintiff also states that the Defendants subjected her to  sex discrimination. However, there are no allegations as  to either Defendant that can be construed as amounting  to discrimination on the basis of sex, and the Court is  not required to accept Plaintiff's speculation as true. See  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citation omitted). Plaintiff also claims that the Defendants [*11]  verbally  abused her. While retaliating against Plaintiff for  exercising her First Amendment rights is actionable  under § 1983, verbal abuse or verbal harassment alone  is not. See King v. Olmsted Cnty., 117 F.3d 1065, 1067  (8th Cir. 1997) (fear or emotional injury resulting ""solely  from verbal harassment or idle threats is generally not  sufficient to constitute an invasion of an identified liberty  interest""); McDowell v. Jones, 990 F.2d 433, 434 (8th  Cir. 1993) (""Verbal threats and name calling usually are  not actionable under § 1983""); Hopson v. Fredericksen, 961 F.2d 1374, 1378  (8th Cir. 1992) (""Generally, mere verbal threats made by  a state-actor do not constitute a § 1983 claim.""). A  ""threat is redressable under § 1983 if it caused severe injuries, was grossly  disproportionate to the need for action under the  circumstances and was inspired by malice rather than  merely careless or unwise excess of zeal so that it  amounted to an abuse of official power that shocks the  conscience."" Turner v. Mull, 784 F.3d 485, 492 (8th Cir.  2015). Here, Plaintiff's allegations fail to establish that  the Defendants' conduct rose to the level of actionable  verbal abuse, and the Court need not accept Plaintiff's  speculation as true. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555  (citation omitted). 8 In the Complaint, Plaintiff states that this Court has  supplemental jurisdiction over her state law claims.  However, she does not identify any particular state law  claim, and this Court cannot construct [*12]  a legal  theory on her behalf. See Stone, 364 F.3d at 914-15. For the foregoing reasons, the Court will direct the Clerk  to issue process upon the Defendants in their individual  capacities as to Plaintiff's First Amendment retaliation  claims. The Court will dismiss Plaintiff's official capacity  claims against the Defendants, and will dismiss the  claims of sexual harassment, sexual assault, sex  discrimination, and verbal abuse that Plaintiff purports to  bring pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiff has also filed a motion to appoint counsel. An  indigent litigant has ""neither a constitutional nor a  statutory right to appointed counsel in civil cases.""  Patterson v. Kelley, 902 F.3d 845, 850 (8th Cir. 2018)  (citing Phillips v. Jasper Cnty. Jail, 437 F.3d 791, 794  (8th Cir. 2006)). A district court may appoint counsel in a  civil case if it is ""convinced that an indigent plaintiff has  stated a non-frivolous claim . . . and where the nature of  the litigation is such that plaintiff as well as the court will  benefit from the assistance of counsel."" Id. (citing  Johnson v.Williams, 788 F.2d 1319, 1322 (8th Cir.  1986)). When determining whether to appoint counsel  for an indigent litigant, a court considers relevant factors  such as the factual complexity of the issues, the  litigant's ability to investigate the facts and present his or  her claims, the existence of conflicting testimony, and  the complexity of the legal arguments. [*13]  Id. (citing  Phillips, 437 F.3d at 794). In this case, there is no indication Plaintiff is incapable  of representing herself, and nothing in the instant motion  or in the record before the Court indicates that the  factual or legal issues are sufficiently complex to justify  the appointment of counsel. Moreover, the defendants  have yet to be served with process and discovery has  Page 5 of 5 not begun, so there is no conflicting 9 testimony. However, recognizing that circumstances  may change, the Court will deny the motion for  appointment of counsel without prejudice, and will  consider future such motions, if appropriate, as the case  progresses. Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff's motion  seeking leave to commence this action without  prepaying fees or costs (ECF No. 2) is GRANTED. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, by January 8, 2024,  plaintiff must pay an initial filing fee of $7.95. Plaintiff is  instructed to make her remittance payable to ""Clerk,  United States District Court,"" and to include upon it: (1)  her name; (2) her prison registration number; (3) this  case number; and (4) the statement that the remittance  is for an original proceeding. Plaintiff'sfailure to timely  pay the initial partial filing fee as ordered may [*14]   result in the dismissal of this case without prejudice and  without further notice. IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff's official  capacity claims against the Defendants, and Plaintiff's  claims of sexual harassment, sexual assault, sex  discrimination, and verbal abuse brought pursuant to 42  U.S.C. § 1983, are DISMISSED without prejudice. A  separate order of partial dismissal will be filed herewith. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiff's motion to  appoint counsel (ECF No. 4) is DENIED without prejudice. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of Court shall  issue process or cause process to issue upon the  Complaint as to Defendants Jessica Lemons and Officer  Unknown Bainbridge in their individual capacities.  Defendants shall be served by issuance of summons  and service by the U.S. Marshal's Service and  personally served at the address identified by 10 Plaintiff, which is the St. Francois County Sheriff's  Department, 1550 Doubet Road, Farmington, Missouri  63640. IT IS HEREBY CERTIFIED that an appeal from this  partial dismissal would not be taken in good faith. ____________________________________ RONNIE L.

Harwood Lloyd LLC 130 Main Street Hackensack, NJ 07601 Attorneys for Plaintiff Philip R. Sellinger, United States Attorney John T. Stinson, Jr., Assistant United States Attorney  Peter Vizcarrondo, Assistant United States Attorney  Office of the United States Attorney District of New Jersey 401 Market Street, Fourth Floor Camden, NJ 08101 Attorneys for Defendants HILLMAN, District Judge Plaintiff Ronaldo Muniz filed a complaint against the United States pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act  (""FTCA""), 28 U.S.C. § 2671 et seq., and Dr. Abigail Lopez de  Lasalle pursuant to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of  Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). ECF No. 1 (""Compl."").  The complaint alleged that Defendants violated the  Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual  punishment and were negligent in treating Plaintiff's  diabetes, resulting in a diabetic ulcer that led to the  amputation of one of his toes. Id. Defendants now move for dismissal of the complaint  under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and  12(b)(6). ECF No. 22. Plaintiff opposes the motion. ECF No. 29. For the reasons herein, the Court will grant the motion. The Eighth Amendment claims will be dismissed with  prejudice, and the FTCA claim will be dismissed without prejudice. I. BACKGROUND [*2]  Plaintiff has been in BOP custody since August 23,  Page 2 of 7 2011. Compl. at 11. He was diagnosed with diabetes around  that time. Id. ¶ 1. In 2014, Plaintiff ""was fully diabetic  and was on medication."" Id. He received Metformin  doses between 500 and 1000 mgs as necessary to  keep his A1C level under control. Id. ¶ 2. He received  ""soft shoe"" and ""bottom bunk"" passes from medical staff  at FCI Mariana due to the ulcers on his feet. Id. ¶¶ 3-4. Plaintiff was placed into FCI Mariana's special housing  unit (""SHU"") in September 2018. Id. ¶ 6. He was  transferred to FCI Yazoo's SHU a few months later. Id.  Plaintiff states he 2 remained in the SHU for about 10 months and was  ""practically starved."" Id. ¶ 7. As a result, his A1C level  dropped and his doctor reduced Plaintiff's Metformin  dosage to 500 mgs per day. Id. Plaintiff was transferred  to FCI Fairton, New Jersey, in July 2019. Id. ¶ 8. Defendant Lopez de Lasalle, Plaintiff's doctor at Fairton,  did not conduct a new blood test upon Plaintiff's arrival  at Fairton. Id. ¶¶ 9-10. Instead, she relied on Plaintiff's  A1C levels reported in his medical records and stopped  Plaintiff's Metformin ""as in her opinion Plaintiff was not  Diabetic."" Id. ¶ 10. Plaintiff tried [*3]  to explain the A1C  levels were low because he had not been eating in the  SHU prior to his transfer and asked to remain on  Metformin until a new blood test could be taken. Id. ¶  11. Defendant Lopez de Lasalle ""said that there was no  point for BOP to spend money for something Plaintiff did  not need."" Id. She also discontinued Plaintiff's soft shoe  and bottom bunk passes without examining Plaintiff's  feet, again stating that ""she will not let 'BOP pay for  something Plaintiff did not need.'"" Id. ¶ 14. By November 2019, ""Plaintiff's diabetes skyrocketed  and his diabetic blisters on [his] feet were full of puss  and were painful."" Id. ¶ 16. Plaintiff submitted verbal and  written complaints to medical staff. Id. ¶ 17. He was  examined on November 7, 2019 by medical staff who  took a culture and 3 prescribed daily wound care. Id. ¶ 18. ""However, on at  least 6 out of 10 days, medical staff refused the wound  care citing staff shortages and Plaintiff was sent back to  the Unit. As a result Plaintiff's wound got worse;  suppurating 24 hours a day where Plaintiff was in  extreme pain."" Id. Plaintiff requested medical attention for his wounds on  November 16 and 17, 2019 but was denied care. Id. ¶¶  19-20.  [*4] ""[O]n both of these days it was the medical who  denied Plaintiff['s] . . . requests for wound care, but the [sic]  medical falsely stated that Plaintiff had denied his  scheduled wound care."" Id. ¶ 20. On November 18, Plaintiff was examined by Dr. Magan,  who determined that Plaintiff needed to be taken to the  emergency room. Id. ¶ 21. Plaintiff was taken to Inspira  County  Hospital,  where  the  treating  physicians  immediately put Plaintiff on antibiotics after Plaintiff told  them he was diabetic. Id. ¶ 22. An MRI ""revealed that  Plaintiff's diabetic ulcers and infection had spread to the  bone and that his toe had to be [amputated]."" Id. ¶ 23.  Plaintiff's second toe on his left foot was removed on  November 21, 2019 and he was taken back to Fairton  on November 22. ECF No. 29 at 8-10. Defendant Lopez  de Lasalle restarted Plaintiff on Metformin on December  2, 2019. Compl. ¶ 25. 4 Plaintiff sent an administrative tort claim to the BOP's  Central Office in Washington, DC on October 12, 2021.  Declaration of Jonathan Kerr, ECF No. 22-2 (""Kerr  Dec."") ¶ 3. The Central Office forward the claim,  designated Administrative Tort Claim Number TRTNER- 2022-01040, to the BOP Northeast Regional Office  (""Regional [*5]  Office""). Id. The Regional Office rejected  the claim on November 22, 2021 because Plaintiff had  not signed the tort claim. ECF No. 22-2 at 11. Plaintiff  sent an amended tort claim on December 28, 2021. Id.  at 13. On January 14, 2022, the Regional Office  acknowledged receipt of the claim as of December 28,  2021 and informed Plaintiff that it had ""six months from  the date of receipt to review, consider, and adjudicate  [his] claim."" Id. at 18 (emphasis in original). Plaintiff submitted his complaint on February 15, 2022.  Compl. He also filed a motion for the appointment of pro  bono counsel. ECF No. 2. The Court permitted Plaintiff's  Bivens claim against Defendant Lopez de Lasalle and  John and Jane Does to proceed. ECF No. 4. The Court  also permitted the FTCA claim 5 against the United States to proceed. Id.1The Court also  granted Plaintiff's motion for counsel. Id.2ECF No. 4. Page 3 of 7 Defendants now move to dismiss the complaint under  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  ECF No. 22. Plaintiff opposes the motion. ECF No. 29. II. STANDARD OF REVIEW A. Standard for Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(1) A challenge to this Court's subject matter jurisdiction is  determined pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  12(b)(1). Gould Elecs., Inc. v. United States, 220 F.3d  169, 178 (3d Cir. 2000). A motion to dismiss pursuant to  Rule 12(b)(1) may attack subject-matter [*6]  jurisdiction  facially or factually. Davis v.Wells Fargo, 824 F.3d 333,  346 (3d Cir. 2016). A facial attack does not dispute the  facts as alleged in the complaint, id., and therefore  essentially applies the same standard as Rule 12(b)(6),  see Severa v. Solvay Specialty Polymers USA, LLC,  524 F. Supp. 3d 381, 389 (D.N.J. Mar. 10, 2021) (citing  In re 1 The Court dismissed Plaintiff's Bivens claim against  the United States and BOP; the FTCA claims against  the BOP, Defendant Lopez de Lasalle, and Defendants  Does; and the Rehabilitation Act claim. ECF No. 4 at 8  (citing 28 U.S.C. §§ 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)-(iii)). 2 The Court acknowledges and appreciates the  advocacy of Gregory James Irwin, Esq. of Harwood  Lloyd LLC, who accepted appointment as pro bono  counsel pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1) and this  Court's Plan for Appointment of Attorneys in Pro Se Civil  Actions, see App. H of the Local Civil Rules of the  District of New Jersey. 6 Schering Plough Corp. Intron/Temodar Consumer Class  Action, 678 F.3d 235, 243 (3d Cir. 2012)). A factual  attack, on the other hand, challenges the allegations by  which jurisdiction is asserted, permitting the Court to  weigh evidence outside the pleadings and placing a  burden of proof on Plaintiff to demonstrate that  jurisdiction indeed exists. See Davis, 824 F.3d at 346. Here, Defendants have asserted a direct factual attack,  arguing that Plaintiff failed to meet the jurisdictional  requirements for bringing tort claims against the United  States prior to filing this lawsuit. Accordingly, the Court  may consider [*7]  evidence presented by Defendants  that is outside the pleadings to determine whether it has  jurisdiction to hear Plaintiff's claims against the United  States. B. Standard for Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(6)  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6),  when deciding a motion to dismiss, a court accepts all well- pled facts as true, construes the complaint in the  plaintiff's favor, and determines ""whether, under any  reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be  entitled to relief."" Phillipsv. Cnty. of Allegheny, 515 F.3d  224, 233 (3d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks  omitted). ""Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2),  a complaint must contain a 'short and plain statement of  the claim showing that the pleader is 7 entitled to relief.'"" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 677- 78 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550  U.S. 544, 555 (2007)). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) challenge, the plaintiff's  claims must be facially plausible, meaning that the well- pled facts ""allow[] the court to draw the reasonable  inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct  alleged."" Id. at 678. The allegations must be ""more than labels and  conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of  action will not do."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. Finally,  ""[i]n deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court must  consider only the complaint, exhibits attached to the  complaint, matters of public record, as well as  undisputedly  authentic  documents  if  the  complainant's [*8]  claims are based upon these  documents."" Mayer v.Belichick, 605 F.3d 223, 230 (3d  Cir. 2010). III. DISCUSSION A. Eighth Amendment Claim Defendant Lopez de Lasalle moves for the dismissal of  the Eighth Amendment claim against her that alleges  she was deliberately indifferent to Plaintiff's serious  medical need. ECF No. 22. She argues that the Bivens  remedy does not extend to Plaintiff's allegations  because it is a ""new context."" ECF No. 22-1 at 19.  Alternatively, Defendant Lopez de Lasalle argues she is  entitled to qualified immunity and that the 8 statute of limitations for Plaintiff's claim has expired. Id.  at 30-35. Page 4 of 7 ""In Bivens, the Court held that it had authority to create 'a cause of action under the Fourth Amendment' against  federal agents who allegedly manacled the plaintiff and  threatened his family while arresting him for narcotics  violations."" Egbert v.Boule, 596 U.S. 482, 490 (2022)  (quoting Bivens v. Six UnknownNamed Agents of Fed.  Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 397 (1971)). ""Over the following decade, the Court twice  again fashioned new causes of action under the  Constitution - first, for a former congressional staffer's  Fifth Amendment sex-discrimination claim; and second,  for a federal prisoner's inadequate-care claim under the  Eighth Amendment."" Id. at 490-91 (citing Davis v.  Passman, 442 U.S. 228 (1979); Carlson v.Green, 446  U.S. 14 (1980)). ""In the fifty-two years since Bivens was  decided, however, the Supreme Court has pulled back  the reins to what appears to be a full stop and no  farther."" Xiv. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, 832 (3d Cir. 2023). In [*9]  2017, the Supreme Court concluded ""that  expanding the Bivensremedy is now a 'disfavored' judicial activity.""  Ziglarv. Abbasi, 582 U.S. 120, 135 (2017). See also  Hernández v.Mesa, 140 S. Ct. 735, 742 (2020) (""In both  statutory and constitutional cases, our watchword is  caution.""). ""These three cases - Bivens, Davis, and  Carlson - represent the only 9 instances in which the Court has approved of an implied  damages remedy under the Constitution itself."" Abbasi,  582 U.S. at 131. ""Indeed, in light of the changes to the Court's general  approach to recognizing implied damages remedies, it is  possible that the analysis in the Court's three Bivens  cases might have been different if they were decided  today."" Id. at 134. Abbasi""created a funnel through which plaintiffs alleging  constitutional violations by federal officials must pass.""  Alexander v. Ortiz, No. 15-6981, 2018 WL 1399302, at  *4 (D.N.J. Mar. 20, 2018). ""First, we ask whether the  case presents 'a new Bivens context' - i.e., is it  'meaningful[ly]' different from the three cases in which  the Court has implied a damages action."" Egbert, 596  U.S. at 492 (quoting Abbasi, 582 U.S. at 139-40). ""If a  case does not present a new Bivens context, the inquiry  ends there, and a Bivens remedy is available."" Shorterv.  United States, 12 F.4th 366, 372 (3d Cir. 2021). ""[I]f it is  a new context, we ask, second, whether there are  special factors' indicating that the Judiciary is at least  arguably less equipped than Congress to weigh the  costs and benefits [*10]  of allowing a damages action  to proceed."" Xi, 68 F.4th at 833 (internal quotation  marks omitted). The Supreme Court has ""observed that these steps 'often resolve to a single  question: whether there is any reason to think that  Congress might be better equipped to create a  damages remedy'; if so, [the court] 10 may not expand Bivens to cover the claim."" Id. (quoting  Abbasi, 582 U.S. at 136). 1. Plaintiff's Claim Presents a New Context Defendant Lopez de Lasalle argues Plaintiff's claims are  meaningfully different from Carlson, the most applicable  of the three Bivens remedy cases. ""Although Carlson  involved an Eighth Amendment claim, its allegations,  which centered on an alleged deliberate indifference to  plaintiff's acute asthma attack which resulted in the  inmate's death, do not resemble the claims in this case.""  ECF No. 22-1 at 21. ""In contrast to Carlson, Plaintiff  here alleges that Dr. Lopez de Lasalle discontinued his  diabetes medication, soft shoes, and low bunk pass,  and, approximately four months later, he developed a  diabetic ulcer that led to the amputation of his toe."" Id. at  22. Defendant Lopez de Lasalle argues that Plaintiff's  claims present a new context because they ""focus on a  long term and ongoing course of medical treatment  of [*11]  Plaintiff's chronic condition"" and not ""allegations  of extreme deliberate indifference to an acute medical  emergency . . . ."" Id. Plaintiff argues his claims do not present a new context  under Bivens because ""[t]he facts herein present the  very same context that Carlson did: a federal inmate  alleging that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated  by a prison doctor who failed to render proper medical  care for a chronic medical 11 condition."" ECF No. 29 at 16. He further argues that  Defendant Lopez de Lasalle has not presented any  ""reason why Carlson should be limited to acute medical  emergencies"" and that ""no court has ever suggested  that a Bivens claim is available only to an inmate who  dies because of an official's deliberate refusal to provide  life's necessities, and not to an inmate who survives  Page 5 of 7 mistreatment by the same officials, yet suffers only  serious, irreparable harm."" Id. (emphasis in original). Plaintiff's allegations are very similar to Carlson. There,  the Supreme Court recognized a Bivens cause of action  where federal prison officials failed to treat Joseph  Jones, Jr.'s chronic asthma which culminated in a fatal  attack. Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14 (1980). See also  Green v.Carlson, 581 F.2d 669, 670-71 (7th Cir. 1978)  (describing facts alleged in the complaint). Plaintiff  alleges [*12]  federal prison officials failed to provide  adequate medical care for his chronic diabetic condition.  Compl., passim. The plaintiff in Carlson alleged prison  officials did not give Jones proper medication or other  treatments that had been prescribed to him by a  physician. Green, 581 F.2d at 671. Plaintiff alleges  Defendant Lopez de Lasalle discontinued his Metformin  and other treatments, causing the ulcer on his toe and  subsequent amputation. Compl. ¶¶ 9-14. Both asthma and diabetes  are chronic medical conditions that may be fatal if left  untreated. 12 However, these similarities are not enough post-Egbert.  Egbert, 596 U.S. at 501 (""[A] plaintiff cannot justify a Bivens  extension based on 'parallel circumstances' with . . .  Carlson unless he also satisfies the 'analytic framework'  prescribed by the last four decades of intervening case  law.""). ""[T]he Supreme Court ha[s] made clear that the  category of 'new contexts' is 'broad,' and this threshold test is 'easily  satisfied.'"" Xi v. Haugen, 68 F.4th 824, 833 (3d Cir.  2023) (quoting Hernández v. Mesa, 140 S. Ct. 735, 743  (2020); Abbasi, 582 U.S. at 139). ""A context may be regarded as new if  it is different in any 'meaningful way' from the three  contexts where the Court has recognized a Bivens  remedy, and even 'a modest extension is still an  extension.'"" Id. (quoting Abbasi, 582 U.S. at 139, 142).  ""[T]he Carlson Court extended [*13]  an implied cause  of action for money damages pursuant to Bivens where  the alleged deliberate indifference of prison officials was  most serious; it resulted in a fatality of a prisoner.""  Peguero  v.Quay,  No.  1:22-CV-00057,  2023  WL  2410882, at *10 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 8, 2023) (declining to  extend Bivens remedy to claim of chronic low back  pain). See also Washington v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons,  No. CV 5:16-3913-BHH, 2022 WL 3701577, at *5  (D.S.C. Aug. 26, 2022) (""Plaintiff's Bivens claims do not  involve a medical emergency, as did Carlson, but rather  focus on a long term and ongoing course of medical  treatment of Plaintiff's chronic, non- 13 fatal condition.""). Although Plaintiff ""may have been  injured, the severity of his injuries have not proven to be  fatal."" Hurst v. Dayton, No. 22-CV-00171-DKW-RT, 2023 WL  2526460, at *5 (D. Haw. Mar. 15, 2023) (declining to  extend Bivens remedy to medical conditions brought on  by prison riot), appeal filed, No. 23-15523 (9th Cir. Apr.  5, 2023). While the Court does not minimize Plaintiff's injuries,  they are meaningfully different from the medical  emergency faced by the inmate in Carlson that  ultimately resulted in Jones' death. See Dongarra v.  Smith, 27 F.4th 174, 180-81 (3d Cir. 2022) (""Carlson  extended Bivens to remedy prison officers' failure to  give medical assistance. But there, the prisoner died  because of the officers' neglect. Put differently, the risk  that the prison officer ignored (death from not treating  the prisoner's chronic asthma) in fact resulted.""). ""This  difference [*14]  is significant for multiple reasons,  including that administrative and injunctive relief would  have a completely different application to Plaintiff's  claims than to the claims in Carlson . . . ."" Washington,  2022 WL 3701577, at *5. Therefore, Plaintiff's claim  presents a new Bivens context, and the Court must  proceed to the second step of review. 2. Special Factors Counsel Against Extending Bivens Step two requires the Court to consider ""whether special factors counsel hesitation in extending a Bivens  remedy."" Xi, 14 68 F.4th at 836 (cleaned up). ""The Bivens inquiry does  not invite federal courts to independently assess the  costs and benefits of implying a cause of action. A court  faces only one question: whether there is any rational  reason (even one) to think that Congress is better suited  to 'weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages  action to proceed.'"" Egbert, 596 U.S. at 496 (quoting  Abbasi, 582 U.S. at 136). ""If there is even a single  'reason to pause before applying Bivens in a new  Page 6 of 7 context,' a court may not recognize a Bivens remedy.""  Id. at 492 (quoting Hernández, 140 S. Ct. at 743). See  also Graber v.Doe II, 59 F.4th 603, 609 (3d Cir. 2023). The Supreme Court has held that ""a court may not  fashion a Bivens remedy if Congress already has provided, or has  authorized the Executive to provide, 'an alternative  remedial structure.'"" Egbert, 596 U.S. at 495 (quoting  Abbasi, 582 U.S. at 137). The [*15]  Supreme Court has  held that the BOP's administrative remedy program  satisfies this requirement. Id. at 497 (citing Corr. Servs.  Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 74 (2001)).3See also  Bulger v. Hurwitz, 62 F.4th 127, 140-41 (4th Cir. 2023)  (finding that BOP's administrative remedy is a sufficient  ""alternative remedial structure"" in special factors 3Plaintiff used the administrative remedy program, and  the BOP denied his requests for an investigation into his  medical care. ECF No. 1-2 at 82. 15 analysis); Silva v. United States, 45 F.4th 1134, 1141  (10th Cir. 2022) (same). It is irrelevant that monetary  damages are not available through the BOP's program.  ""So long as Congress or the Executive has created a  remedial process that it finds sufficient to secure an  adequate level of deterrence, the courts cannot second- guess that calibration by superimposing a Bivens  remedy."" Egbert, 596 U.S. at 498. The Court  ""recognize[s] this remedial scheme might prove to be  cold comfort to [Plaintiff], who seeks an adversarial  process and monetary damages, but the Supreme Court  has declared that the government's procedures need  not be as effective as an individual damages remedy to  foreclose Bivens relief."" Barry v. Anderson, et al., No.  22-3098, 2023 WL 8449246, at *4 (3d Cir. Dec. 6,  2023). Accordingly,  the  Court  must  dismiss  Plaintiff's  constitutional claims against Defendant Lopez de  Lasalle as Bivens does not afford him a remedy absent  Congressional  action.  Because  Plaintiff's  Eighth  Amendment claims [*16]  may not proceed under  Bivens, the Court will dismiss the claims against the  John and Jane Doe defendants, who have not been  identified or served, as well.4 4 The Court need not address Defendant Lopez de  Lasalle's qualified immunity or statute of limitations  arguments since it is dismissing the Eighth Amendment  claims for lack of a Bivens remedy. 16 B. Federal Tort Claims Act Defendant United States argues the Court lacks  jurisdiction over Plaintiff's FTCA claims as Plaintiff did  not exhaust his administrative remedies before filing  suit. ECF No. 22-1 at 35. Plaintiff responds that ""[t]he purpose of the FTCA claim  requirement was fulfilled"" when the BOP's Regional  Office received the unsigned notice of Plaintiff's claim.  ECF No. 29 at 35. ""If the agency intended to negotiate a  settlement with Plaintiff Muniz, it had both its allegations and monetary  demand at that point."" Id. ""The FTCA waives sovereign immunity and grants  district courts jurisdiction over tort claims against the  United States 'under circumstances where the United States, if a  private person, would be liable to the claimant in  accordance with the law of the place where the act or  omission occurred.'"" GouldElecs. Inc. v. United States,  220 F.3d 169, 179 (3d Cir. 2000) (quoting 28 U.S.C. §  1346(b)(1)) (emphasis omitted), modified [*17]  onother  grounds by Simon v. United States, 341 F.3d 193 (3d  Cir. 2003). This waiver of sovereign immunity is limited,  however. ""Because the Federal Tort Claims Act constitutes a  waiver of sovereign immunity, the Act's established  procedures have been strictly construed."" Livera v. First  Nat'l State Bank of N.J., 879 F.2d 1186, 1194 (3d Cir.  1989). 17 The FTCA ""provides that an 'action shall not be  instituted upon a claim against the United States for  money damages' unless the claimant  has first  exhausted his administrative remedies."" McNeil v. United States, 508 U.S. 106, 107 (1993)  (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a)). To exhaust his  administrative remedies, a plaintiff suing under the  FTCA must present the offending agency with notice of  the claim, including a ""sum certain"" demand for  monetary damages. White-Squire v. U.S. Postal Serv.,  592 F.3d 453, 457 (3d Cir. 2010). Exhaustion occurs  when either the agency denies the claim or six months  have passed without a written denial of the claim. 28  U.S.C. § 2675(a). ""This requirement is jurisdictional and  Page 7 of 7 cannot be waived."" Shelton v.Bledsoe, 775 F.3d 554,  569 (3d Cir. 2015). The exhaustion requirement applies  to all FTCA plaintiffs regardless of their pro se or  incarcerated status. Id.; Wadhwa v. Nicholson, 367 F.  App'x 322, 325 n.5 (3d Cir. 2010). The BOP Regional Office received Administrative Tort  Claim Number TRTNER-2022-01040 on December 28,  2021. ECF No. 22-2 at 18. The claim receipt sent to Plaintiff informed him that  the Regional Office had ""six months from the date of receipt  to review, consider, and adjudicate [his] claim."" [*18]  Id.  (emphasis in original). This review period would have  ended June 28, 2022; however, Plaintiff filed this  complaint on February 15, 2022. Compl., passim.  Plaintiff did not complete the exhaustion 18 process before filing the complaint, so the Court lacks  jurisdiction over Plaintiff's FTCA claim. The fact that the six-month period expired and the  exhaustion process was completed during the pendency  of this lawsuit does not cure the jurisdictional  error.5""McNeil clarified that administrative exhaustion  must be complete before instituting suit, and that this  procedural rule is a requirement to which all litigants  must adhere."" Wadhwa, 367 F. App'x at 325 n.5  (emphasis in original). ""[A]dministrative exhaustion must  be complete before a party may institute a civil action in District Court under the FTCA."" Id. at 325 (emphasis in  original). ""[T]he subsequent filing and denial of a claim  after suit has been commenced does not overcome the  failure  to  exhaust  administrative  remedies  and  premature filing of the complaint."" Priovolos v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 686 F. App'x  150, 152 (3d Cir. 2017). See also McNeil, 508 U.S. at  111-12 (holding that a court is without jurisdiction to rule  on a prematurely filed action even if an agency denies  the related administrative claim soon after the federal  lawsuit is filed); Accolla v. U.S.Gov't, 369 F. App'x 408,  410 (3d Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (holding [*19]  that ""because [plaintiff] filed his FTCA  action in federal court before"" he filed an amendment  with the agency ""and 5As of June 6, 2023, ""Plaintiff Muniz has not received a  final decision on his claim."" ECF No. 29 at 35. 19 before the expiration of the appropriate six month  period, the District Court was without jurisdiction to rule  on the FTCA claim""). The Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiff's FTCA claims  because Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit before the FTCA  exhaustion process was complete. The Court will  dismiss the FTCA claim without prejudice because the  Supreme Court has held that the filing dates under the  FTCA are not jurisdictional, unlike the exhaustion  requirement, and are subject to equitable tolling.

"People v. Calhoun, 38 Cal. App. 5th 275","[**630]  FYBEL, J.— 38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *279; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **623; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***1 Page 12 of 36 INTRODUCTION John Wayne Calhoun recruited 13-year-old D.T. into prostitution, acted as her pimp, treated her violently, and  engaged in sex acts with her. A jury convicted him of human trafficking of a minor, pimping a minor under the age of  16, pandering a minor under the age of 16, lewd and lascivious acts on a child under the age of 14,  [**631]   unlawful sexual intercourse, and oral copulation of a child under the age of 14. The jury found true an allegation that  Calhoun [*281]  unlawfully used force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, [***2]  menace, or threat of  unlawful injury in committing the crime of human trafficking. The trial court sentenced him to 15 years to life in  prison with a consecutive term of six years for one count of committing a lewd and lascivious act on a child under  the age of 14 and a consecutive term of two years for another count of the same offense. We affirm. As to each of Calhoun's contentions, we conclude: (1) the trial court did not err by excluding evidence of  D.T.'s acts of prostitution occurring after Calhoun was placed in custody; (2) the evidence at the preliminary hearing  imparted notice to Calhoun of the factual basis for counts 6 and 7 sufficient to satisfy due process; (3) venue in  Orange County was proper; (4) the trial court did not err by admitting evidence of certain text messages; (5) expert  testimony on statements made by D.T. during a police interview and on the content of text messages was  admissible and any error was harmless; and (6) the trial court did stay execution of sentence on counts 2, 3, and 5  pursuant to Penal Code section 654. FACTS I. Calhoun Turns 13-year-old D.T. into a Prostitute. D.T. was born in October 2002. She was placed in foster homes or group homes beginning in October 2015  because [***3]  her father physically and emotionally abused her and had a substance abuse problem. In May  2016, she ran away from a group home in Victorville and went with a friend to visit a man named Raymond, who  happened to be Calhoun's cousin. At Raymond's house, D.T. met Calhoun. She spent the night at Raymond's  house, and in the morning Calhoun gave D.T. and her friend a ride to a store. D.T. and Calhoun waited in the car  while her friend went inside the store. Calhoun asked D.T. how old she was. D.T. told him she was 21 years old. After returning to Raymond's house, D.T. and Calhoun talked for several hours. Calhoun said he was 30 years old.  He asked D.T. if she “had ever made money before.” D.T. did not know what he was talking about and answered  no. Calhoun asked D.T. to go with him to the home of Anntaneisha Louie, whom Calhoun called “Auntie,” in San  Bernardino. D.T. agreed. When they arrived at Louie's house, D.T. waited in the car while Calhoun went inside.  Calhoun returned with women's clothing, which he said were for D.T. While at Louie's house Calhoun again asked  D.T. if she “had ever made money.” [*282]  When she asked what he meant, he asked her if she “had ever slept  with people to get money.” [***4]  She told him no. After spending several nights at Louie's house, Calhoun drove D.T. to Ontario, California, where he picked up two  women at an apartment complex. Each woman carried a bag of clothing. Calhoun drove D.T. and the women to a  hotel in Los Angeles. The next morning, Calhoun told D.T. to get up and take a shower. When she got out of the  shower, some of the clothes the women had brought were laid out on the bed. Calhoun selected a dress and told  D.T. to put it on. D.T. did as she was told. Calhoun, along with D.T., took the two women back to Ontario. When  D.T. asked Calhoun who the women were, Calhoun said it was none of her business. 38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *280; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **630; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***1 Page 13 of 36 Calhoun and D.T. returned to Louie's house, where Calhoun told D.T. he wanted to take photographs of her and  post them  [**632]  on Backpage, an online website for advertising prostitution services. D.T. did not want to do it,  but she was scared of what Calhoun might do if she said no, so she agreed. Calhoun took photographs of D.T.  wearing lingerie and posted the photographs on Backpage. D.T. did not object because she did not want Calhoun  to believe she did not want to do it. About one hour later, Calhoun received a text message in response to the Backpage [***5]  posting. He drove D.T.  to a house in San Bernardino to meet the customer. On the way, Calhoun gave her a price list for various sex acts  and went over some of the rules of the trade. He gave D.T. a condom and told her to always use one. He asked her  to call him “Daddy” and told her to immediately delete any text messages they exchanged so the messages would  not be available if police ever looked through her phone. When they arrived, Calhoun parked down the street, said he would wait in the car, and told D.T. to text him when  she went inside. D.T. performed the requested sexual act and was paid $80. She did not want to do it but she did  not want Calhoun to be angry with her. She gave the money to Calhoun. Calhoun drove D.T. back to Louie's house, where D.T. was given some clothes. He then drove her to G Street,  known as a “track” or “blade” (an area frequented by prostitutes) in San Bernardino. Calhoun told her he was “going  to put her down on G Street” where she “was to make money for him.” He gave D.T. three condoms, ordered her  out of the car, and told her to complete three sex acts and give the money to him. She did as she was told and  turned the money over to Calhoun. Calhoun and [***6]  D.T. returned to Louie's house. Calhoun left and instructed D.T. to stay there until he returned.  D.T. did not want to be alone and [*283]  texted a friend named Michael. He picked up D.T. and took her to his  house. When D.T. arrived at Louie's house, Calhoun asked her where she went. She did not want to tell him the  truth because he had ordered her not to talk to any other African-American men (he had told her that any African- American man who tried to talk to her was likely another pimp). D.T. told Calhoun that she had gone to visit her  aunt. He accused her of lying and ordered her to go outside. D.T. and Calhoun left and got into his car. He punched  her in the left eye (giving her a black eye), and told her not to lie to him again. They spent the night at Louie's house  and had sexual intercourse with each other for the first time. Calhoun left Louie's house the next morning and again told D.T. to stay there until he got back. D.T. was angry with  Calhoun for leaving without saying where he was going. She sent a text message to her friend Markell Stewart and  asked him to come and get her. While D.T. was with Stewart, Calhoun sent her text messages instructing her to  return to Louie's house. [***7]  D.T. sent a text message to Calhoun that she was staying with her aunt but she  spent the night with Stewart in Victorville. The next day, Stewart dropped D.T. and another woman off along G  Street. D.T. walked G Street looking for customers so that she would have money to give Calhoun. II. D.T. Is Detained and Interviewed by Police Detectives. On May 10, 2016, San Bernardino Police Detective Kimberly Hernandez was driving a marked patrol car  westbound on 9th Street approaching G Street in the City of San Bernardino. She pulled over a vehicle driven by  Stewart because it had tinted windows. Hernandez searched the vehicle  [**633]  and found two cell phones in the  center console. One cell phone was a white HTC brand and the other was a black Vortex brand. Hernandez also  found, in the backseat of the car, women's clothing of the type typically worn by prostitutes in the area. Hernandez  confiscated the two cell phones. Once the traffic stop was concluded, Hernandez continued patrolling the area. While driving southbound on G  Street she saw a woman (K.V.) whom she recognized from an identification card found in Stewart's vehicle.  Hernandez also noticed that K.V. was walking with a very young girl whom [***8]  Hernandez had not seen before.  38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *282; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **631; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***4 Page 14 of 36 At trial, Hernandez identified the young girl as D.T. Hernandez believed that K.V. and D.T. were working as  prostitutes and made contact with them. D.T. identified herself by a false name and told Hernandez she was 20 years old. Hernandez observed D.T. had a  ZTE brand cell phone and two [*284]  condoms sticking out of her back pocket. Hernandez placed D.T. in the back  of the patrol car and took her to the police station. While in the patrol car, D.T. revealed her true name and age and  stated she had run away from a group home. At the police station, Hernandez and a sheriff's deputy interviewed D.T. for over five hours. During the interview,  D.T. identified Calhoun as her pimp and said she had been working for him for several months. She said Calhoun  had driven her to several blades in San Bernardino and Orange County to work as a prostitute for him. She had  been with Calhoun the previous day, but had left him and took his cell phones with her. Stewart had driven D.T. and  K.V. to San Bernardino that day. D.T. said Calhoun had “laid his hands on her” many times, recently had “socked  her in the jaw,” and was mean to her and did not respect her. Calhoun expected her [***9]  to earn $500 to $600 in  San Bernardino and $900 in Orange County and if she did not make her “trap” (quota), Calhoun would “whoop her  ass.” Calhoun would apologize after striking D.T. but he did not change his behavior. D.T. told Hernandez the two cell phones found in Stewart's vehicle belonged to Calhoun. She took the cell phones  from Calhoun because she was upset with him and had left them in Stewart's vehicle. The white HTC cell phone  was used to listen to music. The black Vortex cell phone was used for text messaging and had a contact with the  name “Daddy” with Calhoun's photograph. D.T. said she used the black Vortex cell phone to communicate with  Calhoun. Hernandez obtained permission to look through the Vortex cell phone and D.T.'s ZTE cell phone. Hernandez  reviewed the text messages and concluded they were consistent with pimping and prostitution. In the text  messages, D.T. referred to Calhoun as John. The ZTE cell phone had a contact for “Daddy” with a photograph of  Calhoun. Hernandez also noticed several text messages sent to Stewart's phone on May 10 and 11, 2016. Some of  the messages were consistent with pimping and prostitution. Hernandez noticed there were 90 calls made [***10]   between D.T. and Stewart from May 9 through May 11, 2016. D.T. said that, on the previous day, Calhoun had been repeatedly calling her and leaving threatening voicemail  messages. He demanded she return his cell phones, and called her a “ho,” a “slut,” and a “bitch.” At the conclusion of the interview, Hernandez released D.T., who was subject to a custody warrant, to Riverside  County Child Protective Services. The next day, Hernandez took photographs of D.T.'s Facebook messages [*285]   from May 12, 2016, which  [**634]  were depicted in exhibit 20. From the Facebook messages, it appeared D.T.  had contacted Calhoun and referred to him as Daddy. III. D.T. Returns to Prostitution with Calhoun as Her Pimp. D.T.'s social worker picked up D.T. from the police station. At some point, D.T. asked the social worker to stop the  car. When the car stopped, D.T. got out and ran to a gas station where Calhoun had agreed to pick her up. Calhoun  was angry and slapped D.T. in the face. He drove her to Louie's house and told her never to leave him again. Shortly after returning to Louie's, Calhoun and his cousin Joseph drove D.T. to Figueroa Street in Los Angeles, an  area known for prostitution activity. Calhoun had told D.T. [***11]  he was going to “put [her] down on Fig in L.A.” so  that she would “make money for him.” Calhoun gave D.T. three condoms and told her to complete three sex acts  and to text him before each one. D.T. completed oral sex with three customers and gave Calhoun the money she  had earned. 38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *283; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **633; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***8 Page 15 of 36 Calhoun and D.T. returned to Louie's house where, that night, they engaged in sexual intercourse. D.T. testified she  had sexual intercourse with Calhoun at least four times and oral sex with him twice. She was 13 years old at the  time. Calhoun told D.T. they would travel to San Francisco because it was easier to make money in San Francisco than it  was in San Bernardino or Los Angeles. D.T. did not want to prostitute herself in San Francisco, but she did not want  to say so to Calhoun for fear he would get angry and hit her. The next morning, Calhoun drove D.T. to San  Francisco, where they stayed for three days at his cousin's house. He posted two ads on Backpage and introduced  D.T. to another prostitute named “Heaven.” Calhoun and D.T. got into an argument while staying with his cousin. Calhoun put his hands around D.T.'s neck and  choked her. She had difficulty breathing, passed out, fell, and scratched her right [***12]  arm on a couch. When  she regained consciousness, Calhoun was standing over her. He said, “Look what you made me do” and ordered  D.T. to go to the car and clean up her arm. After the third night, Calhoun drove D.T. back to Louie's house. He left after telling her to stay at the house. While  Calhoun was gone, D.T. sent a text message to a friend, who came to the house and picked her up. When [*286]   Calhoun returned and found D.T. gone, he sent her text messages asking her why she had left. The next morning,  the friend drove D.T. back to Louie's house so that D.T. could retrieve some personal items. When D.T. went inside,  Calhoun told her to go to the bathroom, pulled her by the arm, and demanded to know where she had been. D.T.  said she had been at her aunt's house. Calhoun told D.T. to stop lying, backhanded her, and punched her several  times in the face. She fell backwards into the bathtub and, when she tried to get up, Calhoun struck her in the right  eye. D.T.'s nose started bleeding. Calhoun told her to clean up and get out. As D.T. walked outside, she received a telephone call from Calhoun's cousin Joseph. After she ended the call,  Calhoun stepped outside and asked who had called. D.T. responded, [***13]  “[N]obody.” Calhoun snatched the  phone from D.T., looked through it, and discovered text messages between her and Joseph. Calhoun threw the  phone to the ground, slapped D.T. in the face, and accused her of lying. She fell and, when she tried to get back up,  Calhoun  [**635]  slapped her again, threw her back down, and choked her. The next day, Calhoun told D.T. he had rented a room in San Bernardino from a friend so they would have a place  to stay. After they moved some boxes into the room, Calhoun left and told D.T. to stay there and unload boxes. That night, Calhoun picked up another woman and told D.T. the three of them were going to Orange County to  make money. D.T. agreed because she was afraid he would hit her again. Calhoun drove to Harbor Boulevard and  Hazard Avenue in Santa Ana, parked on a side street, gave D.T. three condoms, and told her to go out and make  money for him and call him when she was finished. The other woman stayed in the car with Calhoun. D.T. completed one act of vaginal intercourse and another act of oral sex. Calhoun had her charge $120 for the first  and $80 for the second. D.T. gave Calhoun the money. After taking D.T. to get something to eat, Calhoun drove  back to Harbor [***14]  Boulevard and Hazard Avenue, gave D.T. three more condoms, and ordered her out of the  car. As Calhoun had instructed, D.T. walked along Harbor Boulevard and waved at tricks to get their attention. IV. D.T. Is Detained in Santa Ana for Prostitution; Calhoun Is Arrested. On June 2, 2016, at about 3:06 a.m., Santa Ana Police Officer Robert Velasco was patrolling the area of Harbor  Boulevard and Hazard Avenue in [*287]  Santa Ana. The area is known as the Santa Ana Blade and is well known  for pimping and trafficking of juveniles. Velasco had conducted over 100 pimping and prostitution investigations  during his four and a half years as a police officer. 38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *285; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **634; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***11 Page 16 of 36 Velasco noticed a very young woman walking along Hazard Avenue just west of Harbor Boulevard. Because she  looked extremely young and the area was known for trafficking juveniles, Velasco pulled up and parked the patrol  car alongside her. He approached the young woman and asked her for her name and date of birth. She gave a  false last name and claimed she was born in October 1997. Velasco later learned the young woman was D.T.  When two records checks did not uncover any information for her name or date of birth, Velasco told D.T. he knew  she was a juvenile [***15]  and was lying to him. He asked her for proof of her name and birth date but D.T. had no  identification with her. Velasco asked D.T., who appeared nervous and scared, why she was out walking at 3:00 a.m. She said she was  walking home but said she did not know her home address. When Velasco asked her why she did not know her  home address, D.T. said she was going to her cousin's house. D.T. did not know the cousin's name or address. Velasco asked D.T. if he could look through her cell phone, which was a brand “BLU.” D.T. agreed and gave him  the phone. While Velasco was searching through the cell phone, a text message came through at 3:11 a.m. from a  contact named John saying, “WYA,” which means “where are you at?” Velasco told D.T. he knew she was working as a prostitute. D.T. then admitted she had been working as a  prostitute for a couple of months and was from San Bernardino, but had been to Santa Ana three to four times to  work as a prostitute. She said her friend named John, who had just texted her, had given her a ride from San  Bernardino to Santa Ana. Velasco examined the text message thread between D.T. and John and recognized several messages indicating a   [**636]  pimp/prostitute relationship. [***16]  One such message began with the words “Good morning, daddy,”  which is significant because it is common for a prostitute to call her pimp “daddy.” Other such messages were “Get  him for 200” and “He will if get try and fuck 250.” These messages suggested to Velasco that a pimp was helping  D.T. negotiate prices for services. Velasco saw text messages reading: (1) “Eating yo pussy extra”; (2) “Tell him he  do T.G.E. 250”; (3) “You can have a room available”; and (4) “He gave me 100.” According to Velasco, the first two  messages were the pimp helping to negotiate the price, the third message was the pimp telling the prostitute he  would provide a room to perform the sex [*288]  act, and the final message was the prostitute informing the pimp  she had completed the sex act and she had the money. Officer Velasco also saw a message thread reading: (1) “He want me to come to Long Beach he said if he got a  room”; (2) “He talking big money”; (3) “Okay”; and (4) “What's my name to him?” Velasco concluded the first two  messages were the pimp setting up a date for the prostitute. After reading these messages, Velasco and D.T. went to find John. D.T. told Velasco that John was driving a green  four-door Honda [***17]  Accord and that he might be in the area of Hazard Avenue and Bewley Street. Velasco  placed D.T. in the back of his patrol car and drove to that area. Velasco eventually found the green Honda Accord  in the area of Hazard Avenue and West Street in Santa Ana. Velasco parked directly behind the Honda, got out of his patrol car, and with his partner Officer Phan, made contact  with the two occupants. Calhoun was in the driver's seat. The passenger was released without being interviewed.  Velasco dialed the number listed for “John” in D.T.'s phone, and Calhoun's cell phone rang. During a search of  Calhoun's car, $99 was found. Velasco had Calhoun step out of the car and detained him. Calhoun was holding a blue, Samsung Galaxy cell  phone. Calhoun confirmed the phone belonged to him. After detaining Calhoun, Velasco further questioned D.T. She told Velasco she had been working in Santa Ana for  less than an hour. She confirmed that “John” was the man seated in the driver's side of the Honda, described him  as a friend, and said he drove her to Orange County from San Bernardino because she had no other way to get  here. She said Calhoun keeps track of and protects her, she gives him gas money, and [***18]  the $99 the officers  found was her money that she had given to Calhoun to hold. She claimed Calhoun was not her pimp and had done  nothing wrong, although he knew she was working in Santa Ana as a prostitute. 38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *287; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **635; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***14 Page 17 of 36 At the police station, an officer named Gibbons obtained D.T.'s correct age, name, and date of birth. D.T. was  arrested for lying to a peace officer and was sent to juvenile hall. Anaheim Police Investigator Happy Medina  interviewed D.T. at juvenile hall. She told him Calhoun was her pimp. V. Expert Testimony on Human Trafficking and Pimping Medina testified as an expert in pimping, pandering, and human trafficking. He also testified about the rules  governing the pimping and pandering [*289]  subculture. For instance, if the pimp is African-American, the prostitute  is prohibited from looking at other African-American men for they might also be pimps. The prostitute must do  whatever the customer asks her to do. Some services cost more than others. The  [**637]  pimp dictates everything  the prostitute does. A quota is an amount set by a trafficker or pimp which his prostitutes must earn in a day. A quota can be anywhere  from $250 to $2,000 a day. A prostitute is not permitted to stop working until she [***19]  has made the quota. The  earnings are called a “trap.” After the prostitute engages in a couple of sex acts, the pimp takes the trap to prevent  her from getting robbed or keeping some for herself. Pimps generally give the prostitutes condoms three at a time so the pimps can control the number of sex acts. After  every three sex acts, the prostitute must go back to the pimp's location, turn over the money, and get more  condoms. The prostitute will send a text message to the pimp when the sex act is starting and tell the pimp how  much the customer will be paying. The pimp waits nearby. If a prostitute comes into contact with police, the pimp  expects her “100 percent to lie” about their relationship. The prostitute is permitted to say she gives her pimp money  and he drives her to the track, but, even if arrested, is never to disclose that she has a pimp. Most communications between a prostitute and a pimp are made through text messaging. Medina has spoken to  prostitutes who were told to delete all text messages and believes that practice is common. Pimps post  advertisements for their prostitutes on various websites, such as Backpage and craigslist. The pimp will use a false  name for the prostitute [***20]  and, if she is a minor, lie about her age. The pimp will photograph the prostitute for  the advertisement and dictate what the prostitute wears and how she poses. The advertisement will ask the  potential customer to send a text message to the pimp, who is posing as the prostitute. All of the arrangements are  made through the pimp. There are several styles of pimping and recruitment of prostitutes. The most common style is called the “boyfriend  pimp” in which the pimp pretends to develop a normal boyfriend/girlfriend relationship with a girl, but the pimp's  motive is to turn her into a prostitute. This style is most successful on girls who have not been prostitutes in the  past. A “finesse pimp” is similar to a boyfriend pimp but uses charm to nurture young girls. By contrast, a “guerilla  pimp” is one who predominately engages in force and violence to control the prostitute. Pimps can use more than  one style; for example, at times, a boyfriend pimp may become violent.  [*290]  A majority of the girls who become prostitutes have no father figure or male role model in their lives and many also  have suffered personal trauma such as physical or sexual abuse. Most of girls who become prostitutes  have [***21]  a history of being in group homes or foster care, or running away from home. Girls have told Medina  they were recruited directly out of foster care, placement facilities, and juvenile hall, where they overall had bad  experiences. Girls who lived in those conditions are “longing for that attention, some kind of stability in their lives,”  and pimps will tell them “all the things they have been waiting to hear.” “Daddy” is a very common term used by prostitutes to refer to their pimps. It connotes a father figure, protector,  nurturer, and the person who lays down the rules and sets the boundaries. 38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *288; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **636; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***18 Page 18 of 36 A pimp expects a prostitute to have sex with him “on demand.” The prostitute is expected to view sex with the pimp  as “sort of a reward, something that you get to do with daddy.” Medina had spoken with prostitutes who do not want  to be in that trade but nevertheless stayed with the same pimp. The girl stays because she has  [**638]  nowhere  else to go and no other way to earn money, and accepts prostitution as her fate. She views the pimp, even if he is  abusive, as the only person who accepts her for who and what she is. Medina also looked at photographs downloaded from Calhoun's Samsung Galaxy cell phone. [***22]  One  photograph depicted Calhoun in a vehicle holding $100 bills. In more than one photograph, D.T. was in the  backseat of the car. These photographs were of a type commonly taken by pimps, panderers, and human  traffickers. VI. Expert Testimony on Cell Phone Records Expert testimony was offered on the subject of cell phone records and data. The following is a breakdown of the  various cell phones in this case: HTC: The white cell phone found in the center console of Stewart's vehicle. D.T. told Hernandez this phone  belonged to Calhoun. Vortex: The black cell phone found in the center console of Stewart's vehicle. It belonged to Calhoun but was used  by D.T. Hernandez identified the Cellebrite report for the Vortex cell phone as exhibit 19. Cellebrite is a forensic  download or collection of data from a cell phone.  [*291]  ZTE: The personal cell phone used by D.T. at the time she was detained by Hernandez in May 2016. The Cellebrite  download report is exhibit 34. Stewart's cell phone: The cell phone used by Stewart and apparently confiscated by police in May 2016. BLU: The personal cell phone used by D.T. at the time Calhoun was detained. Exhibit 21 is the Cellebrite download  of text messages from this [***23]  phone. Exhibit 22 identifies text messages on this cell phone to and from the  contact “my baby heaven.” Exhibit 23 identifies text messages on this phone to and from the number (xxx) xxx- 7157. Samsung Galaxy: The cell phone Calhoun was holding when he was detained by Velasco. Exhibit 24 is the  Cellebrite download report for this cell phone. In addition, there were messages and data pertaining to an unrecovered cell phone with the number (xxx) xxx-5542. Bruce Linn is an investigator with the Orange County District Attorney's Office and qualified as an expert in cell  phone technology. Linn is assigned to the “TRACKRS” unit, which stands for “task force review aimed at catching  killers, rapers [sic], and sexual offenders.” He conducted a forensic analysis of a Cellebrite download from the  Samsung Galaxy cell phone recovered from Calhoun. Linn is able to determine from data downloaded from a cell phone where it has been because the internal  components of a cell phone produce GPS coordinates. A photograph taken by a cell phone camera produces  metadata of the latitude and longitude lines identifying the camera's location when the photograph was taken. Linn was provided a Cellebrite download from [***24]  the Samsung Galaxy cell phone recovered from Calhoun. He  determined that only a portion of the photos had location data. Based upon the chronology of the photos from  earliest-dated to most recent, he inputted the latitude/longitude into Cell Hawk, which created the map showing  38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *290; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **637; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***21 Page 19 of 36 where the photographs were taken. Linn reviewed all the photographs in the Cellebrite download and noticed  Calhoun appeared in most of the photographs. Linn also noticed videos in the Cellebrite download depicting  Calhoun. At trial, Linn gave a presentation on PowerPoint showing a map, date, time,  [**639]  and latitude and longitude  coordinates of 61 photographs and two [*292]  videos. The presentation showed that during the relevant time  period, Calhoun was in San Bernardino, Riverside, Modesto, San Jose, San Francisco, Santa Ana, Los Angeles,  and Long Beach. During his investigation, Linn downloaded data from D.T.'s BLU cell phone using Cellebrite. He noticed two  separate photographs were take on May 17, 2016, at 11:52 a.m. on both D.T.'s cell phone and Calhoun's cell  phone at the same location near Richmond Point in the San Francisco Bay area. Detective Hernandez, who had detained D.T. in May 2016, testified about text messages [***25]  retrieved from the  two cell phones found in Stewart's car (the HTC cell phone and the Vortex cell phone), D.T.'s BLU cell phone, and  Stewart's own cell phone. Hernandez was familiar with Cellebrite downloads and had Cellebrite downloads  conducted on all of those cell phones. D.T. had told Hernandez that she used the Vortex cell phone to communicate with Calhoun. Hernandez testified the  Vortex cell phone had a contact under the name “Daddy” with a corresponding phone number of (xxx) xxx-5542.  Text messages exchanged between D.T. and Calhoun related to pimping and prostitution. For example, in one  message thread, D.T. sent a message advising Calhoun she had a customer. He replied, “Keep walking.” She then  asked Calhoun how long she had to remain on the blade and if she could take a break and talk to a friend of hers.  Calhoun ordered her immediately to stop talking to the friend. Hernandez was not sure to which cell phone the number (xxx) xxx-5542 was connected. She did not believe that  number was associated with either the HTC phone or the Vortex phone. D.T. saved that number under the contact  “Daddy.” On May 12, 2016, Calhoun had told D.T. he had a new phone number. Medina testified he [***26]  was familiar with Cellebrite downloads and reports and had reviewed the cell phone  downloads from the Samsung Galaxy, the BLU, the Vortex, the HTC, and the ZTE cell phones. Medina also  reviewed exhibit 35, which is a collection of text messages to or from the “Daddy” contact with the number (xxx)  xxx-5542. Medina read one incoming message from the Daddy contact: “Don't give no fuck. Give me my phones. I  need my white one. I'm not playing.” Medina identified text messages on the Vortex cell phone to or from the contact Daddy with the number (xxx) xxx- 5542. Outgoing messages are [*293]  addressed to “Daddy” or “John.” The messages relate to pimping and  prostitution activities. One incoming text message read, “Come get this condom” and an outgoing message read,  “Daddy, hows much long I got to be out here and OK.” Medina testified the question about how much longer she  had to be out was consistent with a pimp controlling the prostitutes working on the track and “okay” meant the girl  would meet the pimp to get condoms. The next message read, “We need at least 100,” and was significant because  it told the girl she had to make at least $100 before she could stop working. Medina identified and reviewed [***27]  exhibit 33, the Cellebrite report for the ZTE cell phone. Medina testified the  BLU cell phone had outgoing text messages that were consistent with pimping, pandering, and human trafficking. In  one message, D.T. texted, “Baby, I want to make up with you. Imma give you the best … sex ever, babe. I'm sorry  for today.” In another, she sent the following text message to the contact listed as John: “Good morning, Daddy. I  hope you have a great day today.  [**640]  I'm sorry for everything I have been doing wrong. You are the best thing  that ever happened to me. And when I say that I want to spend the rest of my life with you, I mean it Babe. Just  know that I love you so much.” Those messages were consistent with the common practice of a victim apologizing  to her pimp after a fight. Another message thread was between D.T. and her friend Heaven. D.T. sent a message stating, “Heaven, what  you doing? I'm in Oakland making my money. And it's for Daddy. Pockets.” Heaven responded, “Be safe tonight.  What part of Oakland you in?” D.T. replied back that she was on “International,” a well-known track in Oakland.  38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *291; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **638; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***24 Page 20 of 36 Later, D.T. texted Heaven and told her that she was about to get on the freeway and head back [***28]  to San  Bernardino. Heaven asked D.T. where “John” was. When D.T. sent a message back that he was “right here,”  Heaven's response was, “Tell him [to] answer my text. It's important.” Medina testified those communications were  consistent with contacts between two women working for the same pimp. SUMMARY OF VERDICT AND SENTENCES The jury found Calhoun guilty of one count of human trafficking of a minor under the age of 18 (count 1; Pen. Code,  § 236.1, subd. (c)(1)), one count of pimping of a minor under the age of 16 (count 2; § 266h, subd. (b)(2)), one  count of pandering a minor under the age of 16 by procuring (count 3; § 266i, subds. (a)(1) & (b)(2)), two counts of  lewd and lascivious acts on a child under the age of 14 (counts 4 & 6; § 288, subd. (a)), [*294]  unlawful sexual  intercourse (count 5; § 261.5, subd. (d)), and oral copulation with a child under the age of 14 (count 7; former §  288a, subd. (c)(1)). The jury found true the allegation under section 236.1, subdivision (c)(2), made with respect to  count 1, that Calhoun unlawfully used force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of  unlawful injury in committing the crime. Following a bench trial, the court found a prior conviction allegation to be  true. The court sentenced Calhoun as follows: (1) 15 years to life under count 1 as enhanced by the true finding on the  section 236.1 allegation; [***29]  (2) six years on count 4, consecutive to count 1; (3) two years on count 6,  consecutive to count 1; (4) two years on count 7, concurrent to count 1; (5) six years on count 2, concurrent to  count 1; (6) six years on count 3, concurrent to count 1; (7) three years on count 5, concurrent to count 1. The court  stayed execution of sentence on counts 2, 3, and 5 pursuant to section 654. DISCUSSION I. The Trial Court Did Not Err by Excluding Evidence of D.T.'s Acts of Prostitution Occurring After Calhoun  Was Placed in Custody. Calhoun contends the trial court erred by not permitting him to introduce evidence that D.T. continued to work as a  prostitute after he was placed in custody. The trial court concluded such evidence was inadmissible under Evidence  Code section 1161, subdivision (b) (Evidence Code section 1161(b)) and, if admissible, was subject to exclusion  under Evidence Code section 352. Evidence Code section 1161(b) reads: “Evidence of sexual history or history of  any commercial sexual act of a victim of human trafficking, as defined in Section 236.1 of the Penal Code, is  inadmissible to attack the credibility or impeach  [**641]  the character of the victim in any civil or criminal  proceeding.” Calhoun argues the evidence of D.T.'s subsequent prostitution activity was relevant and admissible because: (1)  Evidence Code section 1161(b) only excluded evidence of D.T.'s sexual history and history [***30]  of commercial  sexual acts that occurred before he was placed in custody and (2) he sought to admit evidence of D.T.'s  subsequent commercial sex acts and prostitution arrests not for credibility or impeachment purposes but to negate  an element of the [*295]  offense of human trafficking. Calhoun also contends the trial court never made an express  finding that D.T. was a victim of sex trafficking. A. Background  38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *293; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **640; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***27 Page 21 of 36 Before trial started, the prosecution moved to exclude evidence of D.T.'s prior or subsequent acts of prostitution for  purposes of impeachment. Defense counsel stated he wanted to impeach D.T. with evidence of acts of prostitution  committed after Calhoun was placed in custody. Defense counsel argued prostitution is a crime of moral turpitude,  there was no causal connection between Calhoun and the acts of prostitution committed by D.T. after Calhoun was  in custody, and Evidence Code section 1161(b) did not apply because the People had made no preliminary  showing that D.T. was a victim of human trafficking. The trial court ruled that Evidence Code section 1161(b) barred  the defense from introducing evidence of subsequent acts of prostitution for the purpose of impeaching D.T. or  challenging her credibility. During a break in D.T.'s cross-examination, [***31]  the trial court returned to the issue of evidence of D.T.'s acts of  prostitution after Calhoun had been placed in custody. The court stated: “There is so far uncontroverted testimony  that [D.T.] had not been a prostitute until the defendant brought her into the business, this is from direct examination  from the prosecution, the testimony that [Calhoun] caused it by having her make money, a term she stated that she  had never heard before. Going into her subsequent sexual history as a prostitute is not relevant to the case. It is  inflammatory. And even if [Evidence Code section] 1161 hypothetically did not exist, this would be a very simple  [Evidence Code section] 352 analysis which also applies here because any probative value is outweighed by the  prejudice. [¶] Now if that becomes an issue, we can talk about that. So far the only evidence that the witness  prostituted herself was because of how the defendant taught her to do that. That's after the fact, after the defendant  was arrested. According to her, he gave her the tools. The subsequent conduct does not become relevant at that  point.” After the prosecutor had completed redirect examination of D.T., defense counsel asked the court to reconsider its  ruling due to her testimony that [***32]  Calhoun had been her only pimp and was responsible for prostituting her to  20 customers. Defense counsel argued that D.T.'s testimony created the misleading impression that she ceased  engaging in prostitution once Calhoun was in custody. The trial court confirmed its ruling that evidence of D.T.'s  subsequent acts of prostitution was inadmissible under Evidence Code section 1161(b).  [*296]  B. The Evidence Was Inadmissible Under Evidence Code Section 1161(b) for Credibility or Impeachment of  Character. Calhoun was charged with and convicted of human trafficking in violation of  [**642]  section 236.1. In November  2012, the voters of the State of California passed the Californians Against Sexual Exploitation Act (the CASE Act)  with the purpose and intent “‘[t]o combat the crime of human trafficking’” and “‘[t]o recognize trafficked individuals as  victims and not criminals, and to protect the rights of trafficked victims.’” (In re M.D. (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 993,  998–999 [81 Cal. Rptr. 3d 761], quoting Prop. 35, § 3, as approved by voters Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) eff. Nov. 7,  2012.) “The CASE Act made various changes to state law regarding human trafficking, including expanding the  definition of the offense and increasing the punishment for such offenses.” (In re Aarica S. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th  1480, 1486 [168 Cal. Rptr. 3d 136] (Aarica S.).) Evidence Code section 1161 was enacted as part of the CASE Act. (In re M.D., supra, 231 Cal.App.4th at p. 998.)  The full text of Evidence Code section 1161 is: “(a) Evidence that a [***33]  victim of human trafficking, as defined in  Section 236.1 of the Penal Code, has engaged in any commercial sexual act as a result of being a victim of human  trafficking is inadmissible to prove the victim's criminal liability for the commercial sexual act. [¶] (b) Evidence of  sexual history or history of any commercial sexual act of a victim of human trafficking, as defined in Section 236.1 of         38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *295; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **641; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***30 Page 22 of 36 the Penal Code, is inadmissible to attack the credibility or impeach the character of the victim in any civil or criminal  proceeding.” HN1[ ] CA(1)[ ] (1) Evidence Code section 1161, subdivision (a) (Evidence Code section 1161(a)) in effect  means a victim of human trafficking cannot be prosecuted for an act of prostitution that is causally connected to the  victim's status as human trafficking victim. (See Aarica S., supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1487–1488.) Evidence  Code section 1161(a) is not directly relevant here because D.T. was not prosecuted. As we shall explain, it is  relevant to interpreting Evidence Code section 1161(b).  [*297]  The issue presented here is whether Evidence Code section 1161(b) applies only to the human trafficking victim's  sexual conduct and acts of prostitution committed before the alleged human trafficker was placed in custody.  Calhoun argues that Evidence Code section 1161(b), by referring to “sexual history” and “history of any commercial  sexual act,” only excludes evidence of D.T.'s conduct prior to his arrest. (Italics added.) The Attorney General  argues that nothing in the text of the CASE [***34]  Act limits the scope of Evidence Code section 1161(b) to sexual  acts and acts of prostitution committed before the alleged human trafficker was placed in custody. In resolving this  question, we work on a blank slate. No reported decision has addressed the scope of Evidence Code section  1161(b). HN2[ ] CA(2)[ ] (2) We review issues of statutory interpretation de novo (Kavanaugh v. West Sonoma County  Union High School Dist. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 911, 916 [129 Cal. Rptr. 2d 811, 62 P.3d 54])  [**643]  including statutes  added by the passage of a ballot initiative (People v. Park (2013) 56 Cal.4th 782, 796 [156 Cal. Rptr. 3d 307, 299  P.3d 1263]). HN3[ ] The primary purpose is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the voters who passed the  ballot initiative. (People v. Briceno (2004) 34 Cal.4th 451, 459 [20 Cal.Rptr.3d 418, 99 P.3d 1007].) “‘In interpreting  a voter initiative … we apply the same principles that govern statutory construction. [Citation.] Thus, “we turn first to  the language of the statute, giving the words their ordinary meaning.” [Citation.] The statutory language must also  be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme [in light of the electorate's  intent]. [Citation.] When the language is ambiguous, “we refer to other indicia of the voters' intent, particularly the  analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.”’” (Ibid.) HN4[ ] CA(3)[ ] (3) The language of Evidence Code section 1161(b) renders inadmissible for impeachment or  credibility purposes “[e]vidence of sexual history or history of any commercial sexual act of a victim [***35]  of  human trafficking.” (Italics added.) What does “history” mean? History, both formally and colloquially, has several meanings. Formally, it can mean a “narrative of events  connected with a real or imaginary object, person, or career” or “a systematic written account comprising a  chronological record” or the formal “branch of knowledge … of human activities.” (Webster's 3d New Internat. Dict.  (2002) pp. 1073–1074.) History can mean simply a “,.” (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th  ed. 2004) p. 590, capitalization omitted.) In everyday speech, history can mean events in the past or even  reputation. The various definitions of history all refer to events in the past, and Calhoun says history as used in Evidence Code  section 1161(b) has the same [*298]  meaning. But past of what? Calhoun says before he was taken into custody.  Evidence Code section 1161(b) does not include such a limitation or any temporal limitation except for the word  “history.” We conclude the more reasonable interpretation is that “history” means at any time before the victim  testifies at trial. Evidence Code section 1161(b) says history of “any commercial sexual act.” (Italics added.) Use of the word “any”  suggests the inadmissible evidence is not limited to commercial sexual acts committed [***36]  by the victim while  using the alleged human trafficker as the pimp. HN5[ ] CA(4)[ ] (4) Evidence Code section 1161(a) draws a causal connection between the sexual act and the  victim's status as human trafficking victim by making inadmissible evidence that the victim “has engaged in any  commercial sexual act as a result of being a victim of human trafficking.” (Italics added.) Evidence Code section  38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *296; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **642; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***33 Page 23 of 36 1161(a) applies “only when there is a specific causal connection between the victim's status as a victim of human  trafficking and the particular commercial sex act at issue.” (Aarica S., supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1487–1488.) No  similar language appears in Evidence Code section 1161(b). “If the Legislature has included one provision in one  part of a statute but excluded it from another, a court should not imply the omitted provision in the part of the statute  that does not contain it.” (People ex rel. Gwinn v. Kothari (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 759, 770 [100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 29].) The Legislative Analyst stated that ballot initiative 35 “makes evidence of sexual conduct by a victim of human  trafficking inadmissible for the purposes of attacking the victim's credibility or character in court.” (Voter Information  Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012)  [**644]  analysis of Prop. 35 by Legis. Analyst, p. 44.) As the Attorney General  argues, the language used by the Legislative Analyst encompasses all of the victim's sexual conduct. One purpose of the [***37]  CASE Act was to “‘ensure just and effective punishment of people who promote or  engage in the crime of human trafficking.’” (In re M.D., supra, 231 Cal.App.4th at p. 999.) At trial, Medina testified  that victims of human traffickers are typically runaways who often had bad experiences in the juvenile dependency  system. Once introduced to (or forced into) prostitution by the trafficker, the victim remains a prostitute because she  has nowhere else to go and no other way to earn a living. The human trafficker, having forced the victim into a life  of prostitution, should not be permitted to use the victim's sexual history and history of prostitution to discredit the  victim and exonerate himself. Calhoun argues Evidence Code section 1161(b) requires the prosecution to prove the witness was in fact a victim  of human trafficking before the sexual [*299]  history and commercial sex history evidence can be excluded.  Otherwise, he argues, Evidence Code section 1161(b) “would create a blanket privilege to all victims of human  trafficking without the prosecution having to prove that the minor was in fact a victim of human trafficking.” Calhoun  relies on In re M.D., supra, 231 Cal.App.4th 993, in which the court interpreted Evidence Code section 1161(a) as  placing the burden of proof on the minor defendant to prove she was a victim of human trafficking when she moved  to [***38]  exclude the evidence of her commercial sex acts. (In re M.D., at p. 1001.) The court stated, “Nothing in  the language of [Evidence Code] section 1161 suggests an intent to create an evidentiary presumption that all  minors charged with committing commercial sex acts are victims of human trafficking.” (Ibid., italics added.) CA(5)[ ] (5) D.T. was not charged with prostitution or any offense in this case. Evidence Code section 1161(b)  does not have the “as a result of language” found in Evidence Code section 1161(a). In People v. Brown (2017) 14  Cal.App.5th 320, 341 [221 Cal. Rptr. 3d 854], the court rejected the defendant's argument that by using the word  “victim,” Evidence Code section 1161(b) violated due process and the confrontation clause because, until a trial,  “‘no “victim” yet exists.’” The Court of Appeal concluded HN6[ ] the word “victim” as used in Evidence Code  section 1161(b) is synonymous with “‘complainant,’ ‘complaining witness,’ or the older term ‘prosecutrix.’” (Brown, at  p. 341.) “[A]ny rational trial court would understand the context of the term, and would not presume the defendant  was guilty before trial.” (Ibid.) In any case, the trial court did, in effect, make a preliminary finding that D.T. was a victim of human trafficking.  During D.T.'s cross-examination, the court stated, “[T]here is so far uncontroverted testimony that [D.T.] had not  been a prostitute until the defendant brought her into the business.” The evidence at trial was overwhelming [***39]   that D.T. was a victim of human trafficking and that Calhoun was the trafficker. D.T.'s own testimony to that effect  was bolstered by the percipient and expert testimony of Hernandez and Medina. There could be no question that  D.T. was a victim of human trafficking for purposes of Evidence Code section 1161(b). CA(6)[ ] (6) It might be, as Calhoun claims, that D.T. was not a human trafficking victim in the subsequent acts of  prostitution in the sense that she had no pimp or her pimp was not Calhoun. He argues that excluding evidence of  subsequent acts of prostitution would make section Evidence Code 1161(b)  [**645]  “an affirmative defense to  prostitution.” Because D.T. was not on trial for prostitution, we are not considering whether or under what  circumstances Evidence Code section 1161(b) evidence is admissible to challenge the credibility or impeach the  character of a defendant. The important point here [*300]  is D.T. was not the defendant but a witness testifying as  a human trafficking victim against the man who, as a human trafficker, induced or forced her into prostitution. In that  situation, Evidence Code section 1161(b) prohibited the introduction into evidence, for credibility or impeachment  purposes, “any” history of commercial sexual acts of the human trafficking victim. 38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *298; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **643; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***36 Page 24 of 36 C. The Evidence [***40]  Was Irrelevant To Negate an Element of Human Trafficking; Any Error in Excluding the  Evidence Was Harmless. Calhoun argues evidence of D.T.'s commercial sexual acts was admissible to negate an element of the crime of  human trafficking. The evidence, he argues, would negate the inducement, causation, and persuasion elements of  section 236.1: “[A]ny evidence that the victim, subsequent to [Calhoun]'s arrest, is using other people to conduct her  prostitution business would be relevant to whether the complaining witness is actually a victim of human trafficking  in this case. If the evidence showed that [D.T.] was an independent contractor and not the property of a pimp, it  would have been relevant to demonstrate that she was an independent contractor with [Calhoun] as well.” Calhoun undoes his own argument when, in his appellant's reply brief, he asserts that evidence of D.T.'s other  commercial sex acts “would have supported and corroborated her previous statements to law enforcement that  [Calhoun] was not her pimp but a friend.” That is a credibility or impeachment purpose intended to discredit D.T.'s  trial testimony. To the extent Calhoun had a legitimate purpose for introducing evidence of D.T.'s other [***41]  commercial sexual  acts, exclusion of the evidence was harmless. The evidence that D.T. was a victim of human trafficking and that  Calhoun was the trafficker was overwhelming. Evidence that D.T. might have later worked as an “independent  contractor” rather than for a pimp does not negate Calhoun's culpability as a sex trafficker who initially induced or  forced her into a life of prostitution. From evidence of subsequent acts of prostitution, it is not reasonably likely the  jury would have drawn the inference that D.T. was an “independent contractor” when she was with Calhoun  because such an inference would have been contrary to nearly all the other evidence. We conclude it was not  reasonably probable that a result more favorable to Calhoun would have been reached had he been permitted to  introduce evidence of D.T.'s commercial sex acts for a purpose other than credibility or impeachment. (People v.  Watson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243] (Watson).)  [*301]  D. The Trial Court Did Not Err by Excluding the Evidence Under Evidence Code Section 352. Evidence of D.T.'s subsequent commercial sex acts was subject to exclusion under Evidence Code section 352.  The trial court found that any probative value of the evidence was outweighed by prejudice. The trial court's section  352 ruling was not an abuse of discretion. [***42]  (People v. Brooks (2017) 3 Cal.5th 1, 40–41 [219 Cal. Rptr. 3d  331, 396 P.3d 480].) The relevance of evidence of D.T.'s subsequent commercial sexual acts was substantially  outweighed by probability it would focus attention on D.T.'s character and conduct and away from the issues of  Calhoun's  [**646]  culpability. Admission of the evidence had the distinct probability of misleading the jury into  believing D.T., and not Calhoun, was on trial. In addition, as the Attorney General argues, admission of evidence of  D.T.'s subsequent commercial sex acts would have led to a minitrial on all the circumstances surrounding D.T.'s  conduct. II. The Evidence at the Preliminary Hearing Imparted Notice to Calhoun of the Factual Basis for Counts 6 and  7 Sufficient To Satisfy Due Process. Calhoun was charged in count 6 with committing a lewd and lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 in  violation of section 288, subdivision (a) and was charged in count 7 with oral copulation of a child under the age of  14 in violation of former section 288a, subdivision (c)(1). Calhoun argues he was denied due process notice of the  charges in counts 6 and 7 because he was convicted of them based on evidence not adduced at the preliminary  hearing. A. Background 38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *300; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **645; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***39 Page 25 of 36 The initial felony complaint alleged six counts. Count 1 charged Calhoun with human trafficking of a minor, [***43]   count 2 charged him with pimping a minor, and count 3 charged him with pandering with a minor under the age of  16. Counts 4 and 6 charged Calhoun with violating former section 288a—committing a lewd and lascivious act on a  child under the age of 14—and count 5 charged him with violating section 261.5, subdivision (b)—engaging in  unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. At the preliminary hearing, D.T. testified she performed oral sex with Calhoun in Santa Ana on June 1, 2016. She  could not recall where in Santa Ana or at what time that happened. At the preliminary hearing, D.T. testified she had  sexual intercourse with Calhoun on June 1, 2016, at the home of his [*302]  friend Joe. She also testified she had  sexual intercourse with Calhoun at his friend's house in San Bernardino and, on two occasions while they were in  San Francisco, they had sexual intercourse at a cousin's house. D.T. testified that on June 1 and 2, she caught five  dates with customers. Based upon D.T.'s testimony, the prosecution requested the complaint be amended to add two more counts, count  7 and count 8, both alleging that between June 1 and June 2, 2016, Calhoun violated former section 288a,  subdivision (c)(1) by participating in an act of oral copulation with D.T. Count 7 was based on the theory  D.T. [***44]  orally copulated customers and Calhoun aided and abetted those offenses. Count 8 was based on  D.T.'s testimony that she orally copulated Calhoun on June 1 or 2, 2016. At the preliminary hearing, the prosecutor  confirmed that count 6 was also based on the theory Calhoun had aided and abetted customers in committing lewd  and lascivious acts upon D.T. The trial court granted the request to add counts 7 and 8. The court then found sufficient and probable cause and  held Calhoun to answer counts 1 through 8. Subsequently, the trial court granted Calhoun's motion under section 995 to dismiss newly added count 7. An  amended information removed the previously dismissed count 7 and renumbered count 8 as count 7. Count 6  remained count 6. When the case was tried, count 7 alleged that on or about June 1 and 2, 2016, Calhoun violated former section  288a, subdivision (c)(1) by engaging in oral sex with D.T., a child under 14 years of age and more than 10 years  younger than he was. Count 6 alleged that on or about June 1 and 2, 2016, Calhoun violated section 288,  subdivision (a) by committing a lewd and lascivious act on the body of D.T., a child under  [**647]  14 years of age.  Count 4 alleged the same offense as count 6 but for the time period from April 20 through June 2, 2016. [***45]  At trial, D.T. testified she had oral sex with Calhoun twice. D.T. could not recall where, when, or how the acts of oral  sex took place except to say they took place somewhere in California. She was certain she orally copulated  Calhoun twice. D.T. testified she had sexual intercourse with Calhoun at least four times, twice on two different  occasions at Louie's house. Later, during cross-examination, D.T. testified she did not know where or when she had  sexual intercourse with Calhoun. D.T. also testified that on the night of June 1 and 2, 2016, she caught only two  dates, rather than five. At trial, the prosecution did not argue, and the court never instructed the jury, that count 6 was based on an aiding  and abetting theory. Instead, the [*303]  prosecutor argued in closing argument that count 6 related to one of the  occasions when D.T. had sexual intercourse with Calhoun and count 7 related to an act of oral copulation between  her and Calhoun. The trial court gave a unanimity instruction directed to counts 4, 6, and 7. B. Relevant Law HN7[ ] CA(7)[ ] (7) Article I, section 14 of the California Constitution requires that “[f]elonies shall be prosecuted  as provided by law, either by indictment or, after examination and commitment by a magistrate, by information.”  This constitutional [***46]  requirement means a person may not be prosecuted “in the absence of a prior  determination of a magistrate or grand jury that such action is justified.” (Jones v. Superior Court (1971) 4 Cal.3d  660, 666 [94 Cal. Rptr. 289, 483 P.2d 1241].) “Before any accused person can be called upon to defend himself on  any charge prosecuted by information, he is entitled to a preliminary examination upon said charge, and the  judgment of the magistrate before whom such examination is held as to whether the crime for which it is sought to  38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *301; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **646; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***42 Page 26 of 36 prosecute him has been committed, and whether there is sufficient cause to believe him guilty thereof. These  proceedings are essential to confer jurisdiction upon the court before whom he is placed on trial.” (People v. Bomar  (1925) 73 Cal.App. 372, 378 [238 P. 758].) HN8[ ] CA(8)[ ] (8) Once a defendant has been held to answer on the offenses alleged in a complaint, the  People must within 15 days file an information alleging the offenses shown by the evidence presented at the  preliminary hearing. (§ 739.) Due process requires that “an accused be advised of the charges against him so that  he has a reasonable opportunity to prepare and present his defense and not be taken by surprise by evidence  offered at his trial.” (People v. Jones (1990) 51 Cal.3d 294, 317 [270 Cal. Rptr. 611, 792 P.2d 643].) A defendant  therefore cannot be prosecuted for an offense not shown by the evidence at the preliminary hearing [***47]  or not  arising out of the transaction upon which the commitment was based. (People v. McCoy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th  1510, 1531 [156 Cal. Rptr. 3d 382]; People v. Graff (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 345, 360 [87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 827] (Graff).)  Phrased somewhat differently, the rule is, “[a]n information which charges the commission of an offense not named  in the commitment order will not be upheld unless (1) the evidence before the magistrate shows that such offense  was committed [citation], and (2) that the offense ‘arose out of the transaction which was the basis for the  commitment’ on a related offense.” (Jones v. Superior Court, supra, 4 Cal.3d at pp. 664–665.)  [*304]   [**648]  C. There Was No Material Variance Between the Evidence at the Preliminary Hearing and the Evidence at  Trial for Counts 6 and 7. Calhoun argues his conviction under count 7 was based on evidence not elicited at the preliminary hearing. At the  preliminary hearing, D.T. testified that she engaged in oral sex once with Calhoun, in Santa Ana. At trial, D.T.  testified she orally copulated Calhoun twice, but could not remember where or when she did so other than to say it  was in California. CA(9)[ ] (9) The variance between D.T.'s preliminary hearing testimony and trial testimony was not material and  does not warrant dismissal of count 7. HN9[ ] “[U]nder normal circumstances, [a defendant's] opportunity to  prepare an effective defense would not be affected [***48]  merely because the evidence at trial showed the  offenses occurred at a different time (within the time frame alleged in the original information) or a different [place].  … [N]either the time [citation] nor the place at which an offense is committed [citation] is material, and an immaterial  variance will be disregarded.” (People v. Pitts (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 606, 906 [273 Cal. Rptr. 757] (Pitts).) The preliminary hearing placed Calhoun on notice he was being charged with one count of engaging in oral  copulation with D.T. Her trial testimony was that she orally copulated him twice. D.T. never recanted her preliminary  hearing testimony; she merely testified at trial she could not remember where or when the acts occurred. D.T.'s trial  testimony did not foreclose the possibility that at least one of the two acts was the one to which D.T. testified at the  preliminary hearing. Either act of oral copulation to which D.T. testified at trial would have supported a conviction  under count 7, and the trial court gave a unanimity instruction. Defendant does not demonstrate how he was misled  when mounting his defense to count 7. As to count 6, Calhoun argues: “The oral copulation events that [D.T.] testified to at trial and the evidence  supporting Count Six were [***49]  never the subject of a preliminary hearing … where it could be determined  whether there was probable cause to believe that the offense had occurred.” D.T.'s testimony at the preliminary  hearing supported binding over Calhoun under count 6 on a theory he directly committed lewd and lascivious acts  on D.T. At the preliminary hearing, D.T. testified Calhoun had sexual intercourse with her on at least four occasions  between April 20 and June 1, 2016. Any one of those acts would have supported a conviction under section 288,  subdivision (a) inasmuch as sexual intercourse when committed on a 13-year-old girl is a lewd and lascivious act. CA(10)[ ] (10) The preliminary hearing thus placed Calhoun on notice that he must be prepared to defend against  no less than four acts of committing a lewd and [*305]  lascivious act on a child. Count 4 covered the period from  April 20 through June 2, 2016, while count 6 covered the period June 1 and 2 of the same year. Although the  prosecutor stated at the preliminary hearing that count 6 was based on an aiding and abetting theory, the evidence  38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *303; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **647; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***46 Page 27 of 36 presented, and thus the transcript of the hearing, established he also could be held liable as a direct perpetrator.  HN10[ ] “[I]t is not the complaint but the totality [***50]  of the evidence produced at the preliminary hearing which  notifies the defendant of the potential charges he may have to face in the superior court.” (People v. Donnell (1976)  65 Cal.App.3d 227, 233 [135 Cal. Rptr. 217].) Calhoun contends the evidence at the preliminary hearing was insufficient to bind him over on counts 6 and 7  because at trial D.T. retracted her preliminary hearing  [**649]  testimony. She did no such thing. At trial, D.T.  testified she and Calhoun had oral sex twice and sexual intercourse at least four times; she simply could not  remember by the time of trial where or when they did so. D.T. did not retract or recant her preliminary hearing  testimony. Except for the number of customers she had on June 1 and 2, 2016, she did not testify she lied at the  preliminary hearing. The only variance in evidence between the preliminary hearing and the trial was at trial D.T.  could not recall where or when the acts of oral copulation or sexual intercourse took place. Instructive is People v. Gil (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 653 [4 Cal. Rptr. 2d 697], in which the defendant was convicted of  five counts of forcible lewd conduct on two girls under the age of 14. At trial, one girl testified to incidents of the  defendant touching her breasts and the defendant putting his penis in her vagina, and the other girl testified  to [***51]  acts of the defendant touching her breasts, putting his finger in her vagina, and putting his penis in her  vagina. (Id. at pp. 655–657.) The defendant testified he had not committed any of the offenses. On appeal, the  defendant argued he was denied notice of the charges because the evidence adduced at trial involved offenses not  shown at the preliminary hearing. He claimed the inconsistencies about the dates of offenses and other changes in  testimony at trial made the charges different than those shown at the preliminary hearing. (Id. at pp. 657–658.) In rejecting that argument, the Court of Appeal held the information charged the defendant with offenses shown by  the evidence at the preliminary hearing in that the evidence at the preliminary hearing clearly supported five counts  of lewd conduct however committed. (People v. Gil, supra, 3 Cal.App.4th at p. 658.) The court explained:  “Inconsistencies and contradictions during the course of thorough cross-examination of child witnesses at trial is not  persuasive of appellant's contention that the incidents at trial were completely different from the incidents described  at the preliminary hearing. The inconsistencies went to the weight and credibility of the testimony, not to the  question of notice claimed by appellant.” [***52]  (Id. at p. 659.) The court found [*306]  that even if there were  inconsistencies, “it is unlikely appellant's ability to defend was prejudiced; his defense was not a specific alibi but a  denial that molestations occurred at all.” (Ibid.) In this case, as in People v. Gil, the variations and inconsistencies between D.T.'s trial testimony and preliminary  hearing testimony did not make the offenses charged in count 6 and count 7 different from those shown at the  preliminary hearing. Instead, the inconsistencies and variances at most go to the weight and credibility of D.T.'s trial  testimony. We cannot see how Calhoun could have suffered any prejudice because his defense was, like that of the  defendant in People v. Gil, he never committed the offenses. The cases relied upon by Calhoun do not support dismissal of count 6 or 7. Pitts, supra, 223 Cal.App.3d at page  634, involved a 53-count information against one group of defendants, and a 58-count information against another  group of defendants. The two informations alleged numerous charges of sex abuse against many child victims.  (Ibid.) The Court of Appeal dismissed some of the counts because variances between the evidence at the  preliminary hearing and the evidence at trial denied the defendants [***53]  an opportunity to prepare a meaningful  defense. (Id. at p. 905.) The court noted that variances in the time and place at which specific acts occurred   [**650]  were not material. (Id. at p. 907.) But many counts charged the defendants with conduct for which no  evidence was adduced at the preliminary hearing; in others, the evidence at the preliminary hearing supported a  different count; and in others, evidence was adduced at one defendant's preliminary hearing that was not adduced  at the preliminary hearings for other defendants. (Id. at pp. 908–914.) The Court of Appeal noted that for some  counts as charged in an amended information “the specific act and/or actors changed from previous amendments,  and/or the specific act involving specific actors was not shown by evidence adduced at a particular preliminary  hearing.” (Id. at p. 907.) Such variances were material and, consequently, the preliminary hearing transcript did not  impart notice sufficient to satisfy due process. (Id. at pp. 907–908.) 38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *305; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **648; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***49 Page 28 of 36 In this case, in stark contrast to Pitts, the evidence at the preliminary hearing placed Calhoun on notice that, in  addition to human trafficking, pimping, and pandering, he would have to defend charges he orally copulated D.T.  once on June 1 or 2, 2016, engaged in sexual intercourse [***54]  with her at least four times between April 20 and  June 2, 2016, and aided and abetted her in engaging in sex acts with others on June 1 and 2, 2016. The  information and amended information charged Calhoun with committing the acts against D.T. adduced by the  evidence at the preliminary hearing. There were no changes in the specifics or actors from previous charging  documents or from the evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing. Unlike Pitts, here, there could be no confusion  about the actors, since Calhoun and D.T. were [*307]  the only actors, about the timeframe, which did not change  from April 20 to June 2, 2016, or about the charged sexual acts directly perpetrated against D.T. To the extent there  was a variance, Calhoun has not demonstrated how he might have been misled or suffered prejudice. In People v. Burnett (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 151, 155–156 [83 Cal. Rptr. 2d 629] (Burnett), the defendant was  charged with being a felon in possession of a weapon, which was specifically alleged to be a .38-caliber revolver.  During trial, a new witness described a second, entirely different incident involving a .357-caliber revolver. (Id. at p.  157.) The trial court permitted the prosecutor to amend the information to strike the .357-caliber allegation from the  information. (Id. at p. 164.) The [***55]  prosecutor argued the jury could convict the defendant based on either  incident. (Id. at p. 169.) The jury convicted the defendant of being a felon in possession. (Id. at p. 156.) On appeal, the defendant argued his conviction must be reversed because he was tried for the incident involving  possession of the .357-caliber revolver, an offense not shown by the evidence at the preliminary hearing. (Burnett,  supra, 71 Cal.App.4th at p. 164.) The Court of Appeal concluded the defendant could not have been prosecuted or  convicted for possession of the .357-caliber revolver because that incident was separate, distinct, and not  transactionally related to the incident shown by the evidence at the preliminary hearing. (Id. at p. 178.) The court  reversed the conviction because the defendant's trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing  to object when it became clear the jury was going to be asked to convict based either on the incident that was the  subject of the preliminary hearing or on the second incident described at trial. (Id. at pp. 179–183.)  [**651]  This case does not present the situation in which a new witness, who did not testify at the preliminary  hearing, testifies at trial about an incident separate, distinct and transactionally unrelated to the offense  shown [***56]  by the evidence at the preliminary hearing. Instead, in this case, the victim, D.T., testified at trial to a  greater number of offenses than the number charged. The unanimity instruction ensured the juror's agreement as to  the facts constituting the offense. (Burnett, supra, 71 Cal.App.4th at p. 173.) In Graff, supra, 170 Cal.App.4th at page 349, the Court of Appeal reversed the defendant's convictions on two  counts of violating section 288, subdivision (c)(1) (section 288(c)(1)) because the jury was permitted to convict  based on charges not established at the preliminary hearing. The defendant was initially charged with six counts of  violating section 288(c)(1). At the preliminary hearing, the victim testified to five incidents of lewd conduct committed  by the defendant, two of which involved the defendant watching her masturbate. Because the victim was not certain  whether the [*308]  masturbation incidents occurred before or after she turned 16 years old, the magistrate  dismissed the two counts that were based on those incidents. (Graff, at p. 351 & fn. 7.) After the preliminary  hearing, an information was filed charging the defendant with three counts of violating section 288(c)(1). (Graff, at  pp. 350–351.) At trial, the victim testified to the same five incidents of lewd conduct and was also allowed to testify concerning the  masturbation incidents “as indicative of motive or intent” [***57]  under Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision  (b). (Graff, supra, 170 Cal.App.4th at p. 353.) The victim testified she was 15 years old when the first masturbation  incident occurred, but was unsure of her age when the second incident occurred. (Id. at p. 354.) In closing  argument, defense counsel stated there were “‘[n]o charge[s] concerning the masturbation episodes.’” (Id. at p.  357.) In rebuttal, the prosecutor disagreed and argued the defendant could be convicted of “‘any lewd act that he  committed with [the victim] while she was 14 or 15 years old,’” including the masturbation incidents. (Id. at p. 358.)  The jury convicted the defendant of two counts of violating section 288(c)(1). (Graff, at p. 360.) The Court of Appeal, reversing, held “[the defendant's] due process rights to notice of the charges against him were  violated by the prosecution's decision to go forward with charges not established at the preliminary hearing.” (Graff,  38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *306; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **650; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***53 Page 29 of 36 supra, 170 Cal.App.4th at p. 360.) The court concluded the magistrate was correct in ruling the prosecution failed to  present evidence at the preliminary hearing to show the masturbation incidents fell within the timeframe necessary  to establish a section 288(c)(1) violation. (Graff, at p. 361.) The prosecution never sought, and the trial court never  granted, an amendment of the information to charge the defendant with violations of section 288(c) based on the  incidents of masturbation. [***58]  (Graff, at p. 362.) Thus, the defendant was wrongly convicted of offenses not  established at the preliminary hearing or charged in the information. The Court of Appeal concluded the defendant  suffered prejudice from the prosecution's delay in making its theory known because “[i]n cross-examining [the  victim], defense counsel had no reason to pin down the dates of the masturbation incidents or to impeach [the  victim] with her earlier testimony that she could not remember when either of the incidents occurred.” (Ibid.)  [**652]  Graff does not help Calhoun. In Graff, the defendant was convicted of violating section 288(c)(1) based on  the masturbation incidents even though the magistrate had dismissed the counts based on those incidents and the  prosecutor had never amended the information. Here, Calhoun was not convicted of any offense based on incidents  that had formed the basis of counts dismissed by the magistrate after the preliminary hearing. In addition, unlike the  defendant in Graff, Calhoun has not demonstrated how any [*309]  variance between the preliminary hearing  testimony and the information or the trial testimony had any effect on the way in which D.T. was cross-examined. III. Venue in Orange County Was Proper. After the prosecution [***59]  rested, Calhoun brought an oral motion for judgment of acquittal under section 1118.1  on the ground that Orange County was an improper venue for counts 4 through 7. He contends the trial court erred  by denying the motion. A. Background At the preliminary hearing, D.T. testified that on June 1, 2016, she had oral sex with Calhoun in Santa Ana and had  five customers. That testimony was the basis for establishing venue in Orange County for counts 4 through 7. At  trial, D.T. testified she did not know where Calhoun engaged in oral sex and sexual intercourse with her except to  say it was somewhere in California. In opposition to Calhoun's motion for a judgment of acquittal for improper venue, the prosecutor argued that human  trafficking (count 1) was a continuous offense, and that the acts alleged in counts 4 through 7 were part of human  trafficking. Thus, the prosecutor argued, all of the counts were connected in their commission. In a written brief, the  prosecutor argued Calhoun's motion was untimely and should have been made before the start of trial. If timely, the  motion should be denied because venue in Orange County was proper under section 781 in that the offenses were  committed at least in part in Orange County [***60]  and because venue was a fact to be established at the  preliminary hearing. At the preliminary hearing, D.T. testified at least one act of sexual intercourse and one act of  oral copulation occurred in Orange County. Defense counsel argued in response that the matter was governed by section 784.7, subdivision (a), which governs  sex offenses where some are committed in one county, and some in another, and which allows cross-county filings  only upon written permission of the transferring county and a hearing assuring that the offenses are properly joined.  [*310]  The trial court concluded section 781 was the controlling statute. The court found that D.T. had testified at the  preliminary hearing the sexual acts had been committed in Orange County and her later trial testimony that she did     38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *308; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **651; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***57 Page 30 of 36 not know where the acts occurred was not in conflict. D.T.'s uncontradicted preliminary hearing testimony  established venue in Orange County under section 781. The court denied Calhoun's motion. B. Relevant Venue Statutes CA(11)[ ] (11) Section 777, which sets forth the basic rule of venue for criminal cases,  [**653]  states: “[E]xcept  as otherwise provided by law the jurisdiction of every public offense is in any competent court within the  jurisdictional territory of which it is committed.” HN11[ ] Under section 777 [***61] , “venue lies in the superior  court of the county in which the crime was committed, and a defendant may be tried there.” (People v. Posey (2004)  32 Cal.4th 193, 199 [8 Cal. Rptr. 3d 551, 82 P.3d 755] (Posey).) Venue is a question of law to be decided by the  court prior to trial. (Id. at p. 201.) CA(12)[ ] (12) When the criminal conduct is committed in more than one county, section 781 sets forth the basic  rule. Section 781 states in relevant part: “[W]hen a public offense is committed in part in one jurisdictional territory  and in part in another jurisdictional territory, or the acts or effects thereof constituting or requisite to the  consummation of the offense occur in two or more jurisdictional territories, the jurisdiction for the offense is in any  competent court within either jurisdictional territory.” HN12[ ] Under section 781, “‘where only a part of a crime has  been committed in one county and the other part or parts have been committed in another, venue lies where only a  part of the crime was done.’” (People v. Thomas (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1276, 1283 [140 Cal. Rptr. 3d 184, 274 P.3d  1170].) Section 784.7 governs venue for multiple violations of certain sex offenses. Subdivision (a) of section 784.7 states:  “If more than one violation of Section 220, except assault with intent to commit mayhem, 261 [rape], 262 [spousal  rape], 264.1 [rape or genital penetration in concert], 269 [aggravated sexual assault of a child], 286 [sodomy], 287,  288 [lewd or lascivious conduct with child under 14], 288.5 [continual sexual abuse of child], 288.7 [sexual [***62]   acts with a child 10 years or younger], or 289 [forcible sexual penetration] or former Section 288a [oral copulation]  occurs in more than one jurisdictional territory, the jurisdiction of any of those offenses, and for any offenses  properly joinable with that offense, is in any jurisdiction where at least one of the offenses occurred, subject to a  hearing, pursuant to Section 954, within the jurisdiction of the proposed trial. At the section 954 hearing, the  prosecution shall present written evidence that all district attorneys in counties with jurisdiction of the offenses agree  to the venue. Charged offenses [*311]  from jurisdictions where there is not a written agreement from the district  attorney shall be returned to that jurisdiction.” Section 784.7 governs venue only if no other statute authorizes trial in  a particular jurisdiction. (People v. Aleem (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1160 [51 Cal. Rptr. 3d 140].) Venue in Orange County for counts 1, 2, and 3 was proper under sections 781 and 784.7, subdivision (c). Section  784.7, subdivision (c) provides, in relevant part: “If more than one violation of Section 236.1 [human trafficking of a  minor], 266h [pimping of a minor under the age of 16], or 266i [pandering of a minor under the age of 16 by  procuring] occurs in more than one jurisdictional territory, the jurisdiction of any of those offenses, and for any  offenses properly joinable [***63]  with that offense, is in any jurisdiction where at least one of the offenses  occurred, subject to a hearing pursuant to Section 954, within the jurisdiction of the proposed trial.” C. D.T.'s Preliminary Hearing Testimony Established Venue in Orange County for Counts 4 Through 7. At the preliminary hearing, D.T. testified she had had sexual intercourse and oral sex with Calhoun in Santa Ana on  June 1, 2016. She also testified she had caught two dates that night before getting a bite to eat and caught two or  three dates after eating. At the preliminary hearing, the  [**654]  prosecutor stated count 6 was based on the theory  that Calhoun committed lewd and lascivious acts on D.T. by aiding and abetting those acts of prostitution in Santa  Ana. D.T.'s testimony conferred venue in Orange County over counts 5, 6, and 7 under section 777 and allowed  joinder of count 4. Count 5 (§ 261.5, subd. (d)) was not subject to section 784.7, subdivision (a). An alternate basis  for venue of count 5 was that it was alleged to have been committed as part of the human trafficking offense with  acts or effects in several counties and therefore venue in Orange County was proper under sections 781 and 784.7,  subdivision (c). Calhoun agrees Orange County venue was properly established at the preliminary hearing for counts 4  through [***64]  7. He concedes he had no cause to challenge venue based on the preliminary hearing testimony  38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *310; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **652; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***60 Page 31 of 36 and he did not challenge venue until after the prosecution rested at trial. He contends, however, that D.T.'s trial  testimony eliminated the factual basis for Orange [*312]  County venue over counts 4 through 7 because at trial  D.T. testified she did not know where she orally copulated Calhoun except to say it was in California. D.T.'s trial testimony did not divest Orange County of venue for counts 4 through 7. We assume for argument's  sake that trial testimony could divest a court of venue once venue has been confirmed by evidence at the  preliminary hearing. We find it significant, as did the trial court, that D.T. did not testify she lied at the preliminary  hearing about engaging in oral sex with Calhoun in Santa Ana. She testified at trial she did not know where that  happened. Thus, venue was not premised on false testimony. The trial court, in which venue decisions are vested  (Posey, supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 201), reached the same conclusion. As there was no contradiction between D.T.'s  preliminary hearing and trial testimony, and D.T. did not retract her preliminary hearing testimony, D.T.'s preliminary  hearing [***65]  testimony remained sufficient to support venue under section 777. If, as Calhoun contends, D.T.'s  trial testimony were controlling on the issue of venue, then no county would have venue over counts 4 through 7. Upholding Orange County venue on counts 4 through 7 comports with the purposes for the criminal venue statutes  identified in People v. Simon, supra, 25 Cal.4th at page 1095. Calhoun does not contend that Orange County venue  caused him inconvenience or impaired his ability to obtain evidence or secure witnesses. To the contrary, he was  subject to trial on counts 1 through 3 in Orange County regardless of venue on the other counts. Defense evidence  and witnesses were the same for all counts. Calhoun was arrested in Orange County while engaging in acts of  human trafficking, pimping, and pandering, for which he was prosecuted. Orange County thus bore a reasonable  relationship to the criminal offenses, and it cannot be said the prosecution chose Orange County because it would   [**655]  be more hostile to or burdensome for Calhoun. The people of Orange County have a right to judge  Calhoun on crimes committed here. Because we conclude D.T.'s preliminary hearing testimony established venue in Orange County over counts 4  through 7 under sections 777, 781, and 784.7, we need [***66]  not address the Attorney General's arguments that  Calhoun forfeited a challenge to venue, a motion under section 1118.1 was the wrong vehicle for challenging  venue, or that venue for the human trafficking count also established venue over counts 4, 6, and 7.  [*313]  IV. The Trial Court Did Not Err by Admitting Evidence of Text Messages from the Vortex Cell Phone and  Messages Related to Number (xxx) xxx-5542. Calhoun argues the trial court erred by admitting text messages from the Vortex cell phone and text messages to  and from the cell phone associated with the number (xxx) xxx-5542. He argues the prosecution failed to  authenticate the text messages as coming from numbers associated with him. A. Background Exhibit 19, the Cellebrite report for the Vortex cell phone, identified incoming and outgoing text messages from July  5, 2016, through November 5, 2016. Calhoun's trial counsel did not object to admission of exhibit 19. To avert an         38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *311; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **654; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***64 Page 32 of 36 ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we shall address Calhoun's argument that the trial court erred in admitting  it. The cell phone associated with the number (xxx) xxx-5542 was never recovered and so there is no Cellebrite report  for it. The Vortex cell phone and the ZTE cell [***67]  phone (D.T.'s personal cell at the time D.T. was detained by  Hernandez) communicated with the (xxx) xxx-5542 cell phone. Exhibit 35 is a collection of text messages to and  from number (xxx) xxx-5542. Calhoun's counsel objected to the admission of any evidence of text messages from  the (xxx) xxx-5542 cell phone to the Vortex cell phone or the ZTE cell phone on the ground the prosecutor failed to  lay a foundation to show the messages from the (xxx) xxx-5542 cell phone were made by Calhoun. B. Relevant Law HN13[ ] CA(13)[ ] (13) A writing must be authenticated before it may be admitted into evidence. (Evid. Code, §  1401; People v. Goldsmith (2014) 59 Cal.4th 258, 266 [172 Cal. Rptr. 3d 637, 326 P.3d 239].) Authentication is  defined as “the introduction of evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that it is the writing that the proponent of the  evidence claims it is” or “the establishment of such facts by any other means provided by law.” (Evid. Code, §  1400.) The proponent of documentary evidence has the burden of establishing authenticity and meets that burden  by producing evidence sufficient to sustain a finding the document is what it purports to be. (People v. Perez (2017)  18 Cal.App.5th 598, 621 [226 Cal. Rptr. 3d 820].) Authenticity may be established by the contents of the writing, or  other means, including circumstantial evidence, and the author's testimony is not required. (People v. Valdez (2011)  201 Cal.App.4th 1429, 1434–1435 [135 Cal. Rptr. 3d 628].)  [*314]  C. The Text [***68]  Messages Were Properly Authenticated. 1. Vortex Cell Phone The prosecution produced sufficient evidence to support a finding that the text messages related in exhibit 19 (the  Cellebrite report for the Vortex cell phone) were between D.T. and Calhoun. Hernandez's  [**656]  testimony  established the Vortex cell phone belonged to Calhoun. Hernandez testified that when she stopped Stewart in May  2016 she searched his car and found two cell phones in the center console. D.T. told Hernandez the phones  belonged to Calhoun and the Vortex cell phone was used for text messages. D.T. said she took the cell phones with  her when she left Louie's house while Calhoun was away. The evidence also showed that, although the Vortex cell phone belonged to Calhoun, D.T. used that phone to  communicate with him. D.T. told Hernandez that she used the Vortex cell phone to communicate with Calhoun. In  addition, the contacts and messages reflected in the Cellebrite report establish that D.T. used the Vortex cell phone  to communicate with Calhoun. The Vortex cell phone had a contact for “Daddy” with Calhoun's photograph. Exhibit  19 shows the contact for Daddy is associated with the number (xxx) xxx-5542. Exhibit 19 shows two [***69]  outgoing text messages (#83, #188) sent to (xxx) xxx-5542 that refer to “John,” and  other text messages refer to pimping and prostitution. Incoming text messages from (xxx) xxx-5542 clearly are from  the pimp (#28: “Hey wen u out there don't text”; #55: “Do u have a condom”; #76: “I got to get you some condoms, I  forgot”). Outgoing text messages to (xxx) xxx-5542 are clearly from the prostitute (#39: “I got one that has 40”; #48:  “I have the money”; #102 “Daddy, hows much long I got to be out here”). Calhoun argues the Vortex cell phone probably belonged to D.T. Whether the phone belonged to D.T. or to  Calhoun, the significant point is that the prosecution met its burden of establishing that D.T. used the cell phone to  communicate by text message with Calhoun at the (xxx) xxx-5542 number. 2. Phone No. (xxx) xxx-5542 The prosecution presented sufficient evidence to establish that the unrecovered phone associated with the number  (xxx) xxx-5542 belonged to Calhoun. There are at least two outgoing messages on the Vortex cell phone to the  number (xxx) xxx-5542 that refer to “John.” Exhibit 35 is an extraction report for messages to or from (xxx) xxx- 5542. The messages listed on exhibit 35 are [***70]  either to or from “Daddy” and most refer to pimping and  38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *313; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **655; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***66 Page 33 of 36 prostitution. [*315]  Several messages (#11, #45, and #55) sent to (xxx) xxx-5542 refer to “John.” One message  (#20) sent to that number was “Auntie said for u to call her.” Auntie was the nickname Calhoun used for Louie. Exhibit 34 is the Cellebrite report for D.T.'s personal ZTE cell phone. Entry No. 146 on exhibit 34 is an incoming  message dated May 11, 2016, from Daddy at number (xxx) xxx-5542. The message reads in part, “Give me my  phones. I need my white one. I'm not playing.” D.T. told Hernandez the two phones found in the center console of  Stewart's car were taken from Calhoun. One phone was white. Hernandez detained D.T. on the night of May 11 or  the early morning of May 12, 2016. V. Expert Testimony on D.T.'s Statements Made During a Police Interview and on the Content of Text  Messages Was Admissible or Harmless Error. Calhoun argues the trial court erred by permitting Hernandez to testify about statements made by D.T. during her  police interview on May 11, 2016, and by permitting Hernandez and Medina to testify about the content of text  messages between D.T. and Calhoun. He argues the challenged testimony constituted case-specific [***71]   hearsay made inadmissible by People v. Sanchez (2016) 63 Cal.4th 665 [204 Cal. Rptr. 3d 102, 374 P.3d 320]  (Sanchez)  [**657]  and violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront and cross-examine witnesses. The Attorney General argues Calhoun forfeited his confrontation clause claim by not posing objections specifically  on that ground. Calhoun made a general objection to evidence about text messages and made a hearsay objection  to any testimony about statements made by D.T. to Hernandez. “‘[C]ounsel's failure to object to claimed evidentiary  error on the same ground asserted on appeal results in a forfeiture of the issue on appeal.’” (People v. Redd (2010)  48 Cal.4th 691, 729 [108 Cal. Rptr. 3d 192, 229 P.3d 101].) Calhoun never specifically objected based on Sanchez  or the confrontation clause. But to avert an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we deem counsel's objections  sufficient to preserve those claims. A. Crawford v. Washington and Sanchez HN14[ ] CA(14)[ ] (14) The confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution grants  a criminal defendant the right to confront adverse witnesses. (U.S. Const., 6th Amend.) Admission of testimonial  hearsay is therefore barred by the confrontation clause unless the speaker is unavailable to testify and the accused  previously had the opportunity to cross-examine the [*316]  speaker, or the accused has forfeited the right to do so  by his or her own wrongdoing. (Crawford v. Washington (2004) 541 U.S. 36, 68 [158 L. Ed. 2d 177, 124 S. Ct.  1354].) CA(15)[ ] (15) In Sanchez, the California Supreme Court concluded the holding in Crawford applies to testimonial  hearsay information [***72]  concerning a defendant's gang affiliation and activity. (Sanchez, supra, 63 Cal.4th at  pp. 679–685.) In Sanchez, the court held (1) HN15[ ] an expert witness may not relate as true case-specific facts  asserted in hearsay statements unless they are independently proven and (2) if a prosecution expert witness seeks  to relate testimonial hearsay, there is a violation of the federal confrontation clause unless there is a showing of  unavailability, the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination, or forfeited that right by wrongdoing.  (Sanchez, at p. 686.) CA(16)[ ] (16) The California Supreme Court confirmed that HN16[ ] an expert may rely on hearsay in forming  an opinion but concluded an expert may not relate case-specific facts asserted in hearsay statements “unless they  are independently proven by competent evidence or are covered by a hearsay exception.” (Sanchez, supra, 63  Cal.4th at p. 686.) An expert may “testify about more generalized information to help jurors understand the  significance of those case-specific facts. An expert is also allowed to give an opinion about what those facts may  mean.” (Id. at p. 676.) The court in Sanchez explained that case-specific facts are those of which the expert has no  independent knowledge and relate “to the particular events and participants alleged to have been involved  38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *314; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **656; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***70 Page 34 of 36 in [***73]  the case being tried.” (Ibid.) The expert may render an opinion based on case-specific facts but may not  relate such facts unless they are within the expert's personal knowledge. (Ibid.) The Sanchez court considered the permissible scope of expert testimony and adopted this rule: “When any expert  relates to the jury case-specific out-of-court statements, and treats the content of those statements as true and  accurate to support the expert's opinion, the statements are hearsay. It cannot logically be maintained that the  statements are not being admitted for their truth. If the case is one in which a  [**658]  prosecution expert seeks to  relate testimonial hearsay, there is a confrontation clause violation unless (1) there is a showing of unavailability  and (2) the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination, or forfeited that right by wrongdoing.”  (Sanchez, supra, 63 Cal.4th at p. 686, fn. omitted.) HN17[ ] We assess prejudice resulting from the admission of expert testimony in violation of Sanchez under the  standard of Watson, supra, 46 Cal.2d at page 836. (People v. Flint (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 983, 1003–1004 [231 Cal.  Rptr. 3d 910] (Flint); People v. Jeffrey G. (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 501, 510 [221 Cal. Rptr. 3d 88].) The Watson  standard applies “even where the expert's [*317]  testimony included multiple statements that were inadmissible  under Sanchez.” (Flint, supra, at p. 1004.) Under the Watson standard, reversal is required only if “it is reasonably  probable [***74]  that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the  error.” (Watson, supra, 46 Cal.2d at p. 836.) B. Testimony on D.T.'s Statements Made During the Police Interview Was Admissible Under the Hearsay Exception  for Prior Consistent Statements. When D.T. was detained in May 2016, she was taken to a sheriff's station where she was interviewed by  Hernandez and a sheriff's deputy. At trial, Hernandez testified about statements made by D.T. during the interview.  The Attorney General does not dispute the testimony was offered for the truth of the statements made by D.T. but  argues D.T.'s statements fell within the hearsay exception for prior consistent statements. CA(17)[ ] (17) Evidence Code section 1236 states: “Evidence of a statement previously made by a witness is not  made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement is consistent with his testimony at the hearing and is offered  in compliance with Section 791.” HN18[ ] Evidence Code section 791, subdivision (b) allows a prior consistent  statement if “[a]n express or implied charge has been made that his testimony at the hearing is recently fabricated  or is influenced by bias or other improper motive, and the statement was made before the bias, motive for  fabrication, or other improper motive is alleged to have arisen.” Calhoun [***75]  concedes that express and implied charges of fabrication were made throughout D.T.'s trial  testimony. “This broad, implicit charge of fabrication” allowed the introduction of D.T.'s prior consistent statements.  (People v. Kopatz (2015) 61 Cal.4th 62, 86 [186 Cal. Rptr. 3d 797, 347 P.3d 952].) Calhoun contends D.T.'s  statements made during the interview were inconsistent with her trial testimony and D.T. admitted at trial that some  statements made during the interview were false. We agree with the Attorney General that D.T.'s statements made during the interview, and related by Hernandez in  her testimony, were for the most part consistent with D.T.'s trial testimony. Most significantly, D.T. told Hernandez  and testified at trial that Calhoun was her pimp, he drove her to several blades to work as a prostitute, she had  been working for Calhoun for several months, and he physically abused her. Calhoun does not entirely disagree; instead, he identifies four categories of statements made by D.T. during the  interview which he contends either were inconsistent with her trial testimony or admitted to be false.  [*318]  (1) Calhoun asserts: “[D.T.] never testified on direct that Mr. Calhoun believed  [**659]  she was 14 years old. [D.T.]  never testified that Mr. Calhoun punched her in the [***76]  jaw. [D.T.] never testified that Mr. Calhoun required a  trap of $500 to $600 a night and if she did not make her trap, Mr. Calhoun would hit her. [D.T.] also never testified  that Mr. Calhoun's cousin Raymond threatened to shoot her up.” This assertion is correct. But, as the Attorney  General points out, there was abundant evidence that on one occasion Calhoun punched D.T. on the left side of her  face, giving her a black eye, and that on another occasion he hit her in the face several times with the back of his  38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *316; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **657; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***72 Page 35 of 36 hand. Admission of the other statements was harmless: The evidence established that Calhoun used violence  against D.T., and whether or not Calhoun punched her in the jaw, he did punch her. Raymond's threat to shoot D.T.  did not implicate Calhoun. Whether or not Calhoun believed or knew D.T. was 14 years old is immaterial because  mistake of fact about a minor victim's age is not a defense to human trafficking, pimping a child, or procuring a  child. (§ 236.1, subd. (e); People v. Branch (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 516, 521–522 [109 Cal. Rptr. 3d 412].) (2) Calhoun asserts D.T., at trial, admitted the following statements made during the police interview were false:  Stewart was her boyfriend, she first had sex with him, he turned her into a prostitute, and she stayed with  him [***77]  when she had nowhere to go. Stewart was her pimp and told her “the rules” for being a prostitute.  Those statements were inconsistent with D.T.'s trial testimony and should have been excluded. The error was  harmless given the overwhelming evidence that Calhoun committed the charged offenses. Indeed, the error  redounded to his benefit, because the inconsistency undermined D.T.'s credibility. (3) Calhoun asserts D.T. was not telling the truth when she told Hernandez that Calhoun had taken her “multiple  times” to the blade in Orange County. At trial, D.T. testified the first time and only time she went to Orange County  was on the night she was arrested (June 1 and 2, 2016). Hernandez testified D.T. had said Calhoun drove her to  several blades, including Harbor Boulevard in Orange County, to work as a prostitute. D.T.'s statement to  Hernandez was inconsistent with D.T.'s trial testimony. Error in admitting evidence of the statement was harmless  given the overwhelming evidence that Calhoun committed the charged offenses. Indeed, the error redounded to his  benefit, because the inconsistency undermined D.T.'s credibility. (4) Calhoun asserts D.T. was not telling the truth when she said at the interview [***78]  she and Calhoun had had  sex several times. He does not provide a citation to the record for D.T.'s statement to Hernandez. We decline to  consider the assertion.  [*319]  C. Any Sanchez Error Was Harmless. Calhoun contends the trial court committed Sanchez error and violated his confrontation clause rights by permitting  Hernandez and Medina to testify about the content of text messages between D.T. and Calhoun. Any conceivable  Sanchez error was harmless because the content of the text messages was independently proven through the  Cellebrite reports and extracts from those reports, which were properly authenticated and admitted into evidence as  exhibits 19, 21–26, and 33–35. (Flint, supra, 22 Cal.App.5th at p. 1000.) CA(18)[ ] (18) In addition, as the Attorney General argues, the content of the text messages between Calhoun  and D.T. was admissible under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule, Evidence Code section 1223.  HN19[ ] Hearsay statements made by coconspirators are admissible against a party if the offering party presents  independent  [**660]  evidence to establish the prima facie existence of a conspiracy. (People v. Hardy (1992) 2  Cal.4th 86, 139 [5 Cal. Rptr. 2d 796, 825 P.2d 781].) “Once independent proof of a conspiracy has been shown,  three preliminary facts must be established: ‘(1) that the declarant was participating in a conspiracy at the time of  the declaration; [***79]  (2) that the declaration was in furtherance of the objective of that conspiracy; and (3) that at  the time of the declaration the party against whom the evidence is offered was participating or would later  participate in the conspiracy.’” (Ibid.) Sufficient evidence was presented at trial to establish the prima facie existence of a conspiracy between Calhoun  and D.T. A prostitute can conspire with a pimp; their functions are “interrelated” and one aids and abets the other.  (People v. Ambrose (1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 136, 139 [227 Cal. Rptr. 885].) Sufficient evidence at trial was  presented to establish the three preliminary facts necessary to make the coconspirator statements admissible. The  challenged text messages were by D.T. or Calhoun while he was pimping her (while participating in the conspiracy),  the messages all dealt with pimping and prostitution (the object of the conspiracy), and Calhoun (the party against  whom the evidence was offered) was participating in pimping when the text messages were sent or received. D. There Was No Confrontation Clause Violation. 38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *318; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **659; 2019 Cal. App. LEXIS 711, ***76 Page 36 of 36 CA(19)[ ] (19) There was no confrontation clause violation because the text messages were not testimonial. In  determining whether a hearsay statement is testimonial, “the question is whether, in light of all the circumstances,  viewed objectively, [***80]  the ‘primary purpose’ of the conversation was to ‘creat[e] an out-of-court substitute for  trial testimony.’” (Ohio v. Clark (2015) 576 U.S. 237, 245 [192 L. Ed. 2d 306, 135 S.Ct. 2173, 2180].) HN20[ ]  “Testimonial statements are those made primarily to memorialize facts relating to past criminal activity, [*320]   which could be used like trial testimony. Nontestimonial statements are those whose primary purpose is to deal with  an ongoing emergency or some other purpose unrelated to preserving facts for later use at trial.” (Sanchez, supra,  63 Cal.4th at p. 689.) We question whether the text messages are hearsay and thus even subject to exclusion under the confrontation  clause. We do not need to decide that issue because the text messages are not in the least bit testimonial. The  messages were informal, did not involve law enforcement, and did not have the primary purpose of creating a  substitute for trial testimony or memorializing facts relating to past criminal history. VI. The Trial Court Stayed Execution of Sentence on Counts 2, 3, and 5 Pursuant to Section 654. Calhoun argues the trial court erred by imposing concurrent sentences on counts 2, 3, and 5 instead of staying  execution of sentence on those counts under section 654. The trial court stayed execution of sentence on those  counts. At the sentencing, the court stated, “stayed 654 of the Penal Code,” [***81]  as to counts 2, 3, and 5. The  court minutes have the entry “stayed pursuant to Penal Code section 654” for the sentence on each of those  counts. The abstract of judgment indicates the sentences on counts 2, 3, and 5 as being stayed under section 654. DISPOSITION The judgment is affirmed.  [**661]  Moore, Acting P. J., and Aronson, J., concurred. Appellant's petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 30, 2019, S257468.  38 Cal. App. 5th 275, *319; 250 Cal. Rptr. 3d 623, **660; 2019 Cal.

INTRODUCTION Jose De Jesus Hernandez was convicted of sexually  abusing his stepdaughter and two nieces over a period  of years and was initially sentenced to serve a prison  term of 30 years to life, consecutive to 8 years and 8  months. In his first appeal, Hernandez successfully  argued, and the People conceded, that the trial court  imposed an unauthorized sentence of 15-years-to-life  for his conviction on count 4 (continuous sexual abuse  of a child in violation of Penal Code1section 288.5,  subd. (a)) because Hernandez committed that offense  from September 1996 through September 2001, before  the Legislature amended section 667.61, subdivision (c)  to add section 288.5 as a One Strike offense. The  matter was remanded for resentencing on count 4 without application of the [*2]  One Strike Law (  667.61) and for correction of clerical errors in the  sentencing minute order and abstracts of judgment.  (See People v. Hernandez (Sept. 20, 2022, D080015)  [nonpub. opn.] (Hernandez).) In this second appeal, Hernandez claims the sentence  on count 4 (mid-term of 12 years, consecutive) must  again be reversed and also seeks the correction of trial  court records as directed in Hernandez as well as  subsequent court records. After initially claiming the  resentencing violated ex post facto prohibitions based  on an incomplete and inaccurate legislative history of  section 667.6, Hernandez now concedes the trial court  had discretion and the authority to impose the sentence  on count 4 pursuant to the applicable version of section  667.6, but he raises two additional arguments in his  supplemental letter brief: (1) the record does not clearly  show the trial court understood the applicable version of  section 667.6 did not mandate a full term consecutive  sentence, and (2) the trial court failed to  1 All further statutory references are to the Penal Code.   2  provide a statement of reasons for its election to  sentence Hernandez under section 667.6 in lieu of  section 1170.1. Page 2 of 5 We reject Hernandez's challenges to the sentence and  affirm the trial court's judgment with directions [*3]  for  the correction of the trial court record. RELEVANT BACKGROUND After a jury convicted Hernandez on all four counts of  child sexual abuse in 2021, the trial court sentenced him  to the upper term of 8 years on count 3, a consecutive  term of 8 months on count 2 (one-third of the midterm),  and consecutive sentences of 15 years to life on counts  1 and 4, for a total indeterminate term of 30 years to life.  Following remand in Hernandez, the trial court  scheduled a resentencing hearing for February 1, 2023,  where the trial court imposed an indeterminate prison  term of 15 years to life and a determinate term of 18  years and 8 months to be followed by a lifetime period  of parole with a total credit of 2,010 days. On count 4,  Hernandez was sentenced to the midterm of 12 years,  consecutive, for his continuous sexual abuse of Jane  Doe 3 in violation of section 288.5, subdivision (a) from  September 1996 through September 2001. Hernandez  timely appealed. In this second appeal, Hernandez initially argued that  the sentence on count 4 violated ex post facto  prohibitions based on the erroneous assumption that  section 288.5 had not been added to section 667.6 as  an offense for which a full-term consecutive sentence  was permitted until 2006. The People conceded [*4]   error despite this faulty premise, and both parties  agreed the matter should be remanded for the  correction of the February 1, 2023 resentencing minute  order and the February 6, 2023 abstracts of judgment in  addition to corrections to previous court records as  directed in Hernandez. On October 23, 2023, we issued an order requesting  supplemental briefing to address Assembly Bill 2212  (Stats. 1989, ch. 1402, 4, 7) 3 whereby  the  Legislature  enacted  section  288.5  (continuous sexual abuse) and amended Penal Code  section 667.6, subdivision (c), to include Penal Code  section 288.5 as an offense that could trigger an  increased prison term. Both parties acknowledged in  their respective supplemental letter briefs that the  Legislature had amended section 667.6 to include  continuous sexual abuse of a child in violation of section  288.5 prior to the commission of the count 4 offense,  and that the trial court had discretion to impose a full- term consecutive sentence. However, Hernandez  maintains reversal is still warranted. As discussed below, we conclude (1) the trial court  properly exercised its discretion to impose a lawful  sentence, and (2) Hernandez forfeited his claim that the  trial court failed to provide a statement of reasons for  sentencing him pursuant to section 667.6 in lieu of  section 1170.1. We therefore affirm the judgment and  direct the [*5]  trial court to correct the relevant trial  court records. DISCUSSION A. The Applicable Version of Penal Code Section 667.6.  Section 667.6 was enacted by the Legislature in 1979 to  provide longer prison terms for certain sex offenders  than otherwise permitted under section 1170.1. (Stats.  1979, ch. 944, 10, p. 3258.) In 1989, the Legislature  enacted section 288.5 (continuous sexual abuse) and  amended Penal Code section 667.6, subdivision (c), to  include Penal Code section 288.5 as an offense that  could trigger an increased prison term. (Stats. 1989, ch.  1402,  7.) Subdivision (c) of the applicable version of section  667.6, which was in effect from 1996 through 2001  when Hernandez committed the count 4 offense, states  in part: ""In lieu of the term provided in Section 1170.1, a  full, 4 separate, and consecutive term may be imposed for  each violation of . . . Section 288.5 . . . . If the term is imposed  consecutively pursuant to this subdivision, it shall be  served consecutively to any other term of imprisonment,  and shall commence from the time the person would  otherwise have been released from imprisonment. The  term shall not be included in any determination pursuant  to Section 1170.1. Any other term imposed subsequent  to that term shall not be merged therein but shall  commence at the time the person otherwise would have  been released from prison."" In 2006, the Legislature made substantive and  organizational amendments to section 667.6. (Stats.  2006, ch. 337, 32.) In the current version of the  statute, [*6]  ""[c]ontinuous sexual abuse of a child, in  violation of Section 288.5"" is listed in subdivision (e)(6)  as one of the offenses for which the trial court ""shall""  Page 3 of 5 impose ""[a] full, separate, and consecutive term"" for  each violation of section 288.5. ( 667.6, subd. (e)(6).) B. The Trial Court Was Fully Aware of the Scope of its  Discretion. Although it is now undisputed that the trial  court had discretion to impose a full, separate, and consecutive term for count  4 pursuant to subdivision (c) of the operative version of  section 667.6, Hernandez argues in his supplemental  letter brief that the sentence is still subject to reversal  because it is unclear from the record whether the trial  court mistakenly relied on the current version of section  667.6, which mandates a full term consecutive sentence  for violations of section 288.5, and posits the trial court  did not realize it had discretion to not impose a full term  consecutive sentence. ""The general rule is that a trial court is presumed to  have been aware of and followed the applicable law.""  (People v. Mosley (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 489, 496.) Yet,  when a sentencing court was unaware of the full scope  of its 5 discretionary powers at the time the defendant was  sentenced, ""the appropriate remedy is to remand for  resentencing unless the record 'clearly indicate[s]' that  the trial court would have reached the [*7]  same  conclusion 'even if it had been aware that it had such  discretion.' "" (People v. Gutierrez (2014) 58 Cal.4th  1354, 1391.) Our review of the record reveals the trial court was fully  aware of its discretionary power to impose either a  concurrent or consecutive sentence despite references  to subdivision (e)(6) of the current version of the statute  during the resentencing hearing. Before pronouncing  the sentence, the trial court unequivocally stated: ""The  Court acknowledges that it has discretion to sentence  concurrent. But it's choosing to sentence consecutive in  this  case.""  (Italics  added.)  This  express  acknowledgment by the trial court of its authority to  sentence  Hernandez  either  concurrently  or  consecutively makes clear the trial court exercised  informed discretion when it resentenced Hernandez. Furthermore, the record shows the trial court would  have sentenced Hernandez consecutively in any event.  In addition to informing the parties that it intended to  impose the maximum sentence possible at the initial  sentencing hearing (see Hernandez, supra, D080015),  the trial court informed the parties of its intention to  sentence Hernandez consecutively in chambers prior to  the resentencing hearing and repeated its intention  twice prior to its pronouncement [*8]  of the sentence.  On this record, we conclude the trial court properly  exercised its discretion when it imposed a consecutive  sentence on count 4 in accordance with the applicable  version of section 667.6. Nor was there any violation of state or federal ex post  facto clauses. (See People v. Simmons (2012) 210  Cal.App.4th 778, 796-797.) The initial ex post facto  argument raised in Hernandez's opening brief was  based on the 6 erroneous  premise  that  ""a  full-term  consecutive  sentence for the violation of section 288.5, subdivision  (a) in count 4 was not available before 2006"" and  therefore fatally flawed. Hernandez attempted to  resurrect the ex post facto argument in his supplemental  letter brief by claiming ""the trial court expressly relied on  a later version of 667.6"" that was not in effect at the time  the offense in count 4 was committed. Not only is this  argument belied by the record as previously discussed,  but Respondent aptly argues that no ex post facto  violation occurred ""because section 667.6 did, in fact,  provide an increased penalty for continuous sexual  abuse at the time appellant committed his continuing  offense[.]"" C. Hernandez Forfeited any Error Based on a Deficient  Statement ofReasons for Sentencing Pursuant to  Section 667.6. Prior to its pronouncement of the sentence, the trial  court offered the following statement of [*9]  reasons for  imposing consecutive terms in this case: ""I find that the  crimes  and  their  objectives  were  predominantly  independent of each other. The crimes involved  separate acts of violence, or threats of violence, and the  crimes were committed at different times with separate places rather than being committed so closely in time  and place as to indicate a single period of aberrant  behavior. Certainly from the testimony at trial, this is not  a case of aberrant behavior. I do find that any one of  these factors by itself justifies the imposition of  consecutive sentences or consecutive terms in this  case."" The trial court informed the parties of the sentence it  intended to impose at a chambers conference prior to  the  resentencing  hearing  and  provided  counsel  Page 4 of 5 adequate opportunity to object at the hearing both  before and after it stated its reasons and pronounced  the sentence. Defense counsel did not raise any  objection or seek a separate statement of reasons  regarding 7 the trial court's election to sentence Hernandez pursuant  to section 667.6 in lieu of section 1170.1. Relying on People v. Belmontes (1983) 34 Cal.3d 335,  347-348, Hernandez argues for the first time in his  supplemental brief that the trial court failed to include a  statement of reasons for electing [*10]  to sentence him  under section 667.6 instead of section 1170.1. By failing  to object on this ground in the trial court, Hernandez  forfeited the issue on appeal. (See People v. Scott  (2015) 61 Cal.4th 363, 406.) D. Clerical Errors Must be Corrected. Hernandez provided the following directions for the  correction of various clerical errors in the sentencing  minute order and abstracts of judgment: At sentencing, the trial court imposed three separate  victim restitution orders under section 1202.4 in the  amounts of $2,654.95, $375, and $225, for a total of  $3,254.95 in victim restitution. However, the sentencing  minute order and indeterminate abstract of judgment  state that Hernandez is to pay victim restitution in four  specific amounts: $3,254.95, $2,654.95, $375, and  $225. Both parties agree the first enumerated amount of  $3,254.95, which is the total of the other three amounts  of victim restitution when combined, is erroneous.  Accordingly,  the  sentencing  minute  order  and  indeterminate abstract of judgment shall be corrected to  comport with the oral pronouncement of judgment.  [Citation.] Additionally,  the  indeterminate  and  determinate  abstracts of judgment incorrectly state 2010 as the year  Hernandez committed all of his crimes. Based on the  charges in the information, evidence [*11]  at trial, jury  instructions, and verdicts, the parties agree count 1  occurred between 2010 to 2016; count 2 occurred  between 2016 to 2017, count 3 occurred between 1994  to 1995, and count 4 occurred between 8 1996 to 2001. The abstracts of judgment shall be  corrected accordingly. [Citation.] At the outset of the resentencing hearing following  remand, the trial court referred to the remittitur issued in  Hernandez, acknowledged that the corrections would be  made as directed, and requested ""the clerk's office""  make the corrections. However, it appears the trial court  clerk has yet to make the corrections as previously  directed, and the parties also correctly observed that the  February 1, 2023 minute order and the February 6,  2023 abstracts of judgment also require correction. On February 1, 2023, the trial court made the following  restitution order: ""The Court orders restitution - orders  the defendant to pay restitution under 1202.4 to be  collected by the Department of Corrections and  Rehabilitation  as  follows:  $2,654.95  to  Victim  Compensation Board, case number A17[-]6655906;  $375 to Victim Compensation Board, case number  A17[-]6667869; and $225 to Victim Compensation  Board, case number A17[-] [*12]  6667919. The Court  will continue to reserve on victim restitution."" The  February 1, 2023 minute order again separately lists the  ""$3,254.95"" total to be collected in addition to the  separate amounts comprising the total. The February 6,  2023 indeterminate and determinate abstracts of  judgment similarly reflect the restitution error as well as  the errors identified in Hernandez. The trial court must ensure the prompt correction of  these records. DISPOSITION The February 1, 2023 sentence is affirmed. The trial  court is directed to correct the trial court records as  stated in this opinion, including the ""**Corrected** [¶] Minute Order"" dated September 20,  2021, page 2, and the minute order dated February 1,  2023, page 2, to remove ""$3,254.95."" The 9 trial court is instructed to issue amended abstracts of  judgment reflecting the sentence entered on February 1,  2023, correcting the years the count 4 crimes were  committed (1996-2001), and removing ""$3,254.95"" from  the restitution amounts listed. The trial court shall  forward the amended abstracts of judgment to the  California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. CASTILLO, J. WE CONCUR: DO, Acting P. J.

"People v. Harms, 2023 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 7288","[*1] A jury convicted defendant Gregory Allen Harms of  sexual penetration with force or violence, unlawful  assault with intent to commit rape, and unlawful sexual  penetration after administration of an anesthetic, based  on his sexual assault of two women, C. and Y., on  different occasions while he was assigned to care for  them as a nurse. The trial court sentenced him to state  prison for a determinate term of 14 years and an  indeterminate term of 15 years to life. Defendant now contends (1) the trial court should have  instructed the jury on sexual battery as a lesser included  offense, and (2) the jury and not the trial court should  have determined whether the crimes alleged in counts 1  and 2 occurred on separate occasions for the purposes  of sentencing. Finding no merit in the contentions, we  will affirm the judgment. 1 BACKGROUND A As the result of a car accident, C. was hospitalized with  serious injuries. She had a breathing tube and a  traumatic brain injury. In January 2019, defendant was  assigned to care for her as her nurse. On one occasion  he told her she was ""not being a good girl,"" closed the  curtain around her bed, flipped her on her stomach, and  inserted his finger into her vagina at [*2]  least 10 times.  He repeatedly called her a ""bad girl"" and rubbed his  crotch area against her buttocks and back. He flipped C.  over so she was lying on her back and continued to  insert his finger into her vagina. He tried to insert his  penis into her vagina but he was unsuccessful. During  the assault defendant bound C.'s wrist to the bed with  an elastic therapy band. After five minutes, he stopped  and rearranged C. in her bed. Soon after, another health care provider entered C.'s  room and C. informed the provider about the assault.  Later that day, a physician performed a sexual assault  examination on C. During the exam, C. complained of  anal pain, and the examining physician noticed an  actively bleeding laceration on C.'s anus. C.'s genitals  appeared normal, but the physician testified this is not  unusual even when a sexual assault has occurred. A  swab of C.'s pubic area found DNA that was likely  defendant's. B In March 2011, Y. had surgery at a local surgery center  and defendant was one of the nurses assigned to care  for her. She awoke after the surgery when she felt a  finger in her vagina. She fell back asleep but awoke  again feeling a mouth on her lips. She tried to push the  person [*3]  away, whom she thought was defendant,  and fell back asleep. When she woke up fully, her  hospital gown was pulled up to her midsection and her  underwear was rolled up and misaligned. Defendant  Page 2 of 4 escorted her to the bathroom so she could get dressed.  He stood outside and offered help, but she refused. 2 When Y. left the recovery area, she went to the front  office and told the receptionists what happened. She  reported the incident to the police and identified  defendant to a detective. C The jury found defendant guilty of penetration of C. with  force or violence (Pen. Code, § 289, subd. (a)(1)1 -- count 1), unlawful  assault of C. with intent to commit rape (§ 220, subd. (a)  -- count 2), and unlawful penetration of Y.'s genitals  after Y. was  administered  an  intoxicating  substance  or  anesthetic or controlled substance (§ 289, subd. (e) -- count 6).2 As to count 1, the jury  found true that defendant engaged in the tying or  binding of C. during the offense. (§ 667.61, subd.  (e)(5).) As to each count, the jury found true that the  offense involved great bodily harm or other acts  disclosing a high degree of cruelty, viciousness, or  callousness (§ 1170; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.421(a)(1)),3 that the offense involved a  particularly vulnerable victim (§ 1170; rule 4.421(a)(3)), that the crime was carried out  with planning, sophistication, [*4]  or professionalism (§  1170; rule 4.421(a)(8)), and that defendant took  advantage of a position of trust or confidence (§ 1170;  rule 4.421(a)(11)). The jury further found true that the  crimes involved multiple victims on separate occasions  (§ 667.6, subd. (d); rule 4.426(a)(1), (a)(2), (b)) and were committed at  different times and separate places (rule 4.425(a)(1)- (a)(3)). The trial court sentenced defendant as follows: 15 years  to life in prison on the count 1 conviction of penetration  by force or violence (§§ 289, subd. (a), 667.61, 1  Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal  Code. 2  The jury could not reach a verdict on three counts  involving a third alleged victim and the trial court  dismissed the counts, which are not at issue here. 3  Undesignated rule references are to the California  Rules of Court. 3 subd. (e)(5)), a consecutive upper term of eight years on  the count 6 conviction of unlawful penetration after  administration of an anesthetic (§ 289, subd. (e)), and a  consecutive six years on the count 2 conviction of  unlawful assault with intent to commit rape (§§ 220,  667.6, subd. (d)). The trial court said it was not limited  by section 654 with respect to count 2 because that  offense was a separate crime and a separate time.  (Rule 4.425(a)(1)-(a)(3).) DISCUSSION I Defendant contends the trial court erred in failing to  instruct the jury sua sponte on sexual battery, which he  contends is [*5]  a lesser included offense of forcible  sexual penetration. In support of his argument,  defendant relies on the expanded accusatory pleading  test announced in People v. Ortega (2015) 240  Cal.App.4th 956 (Ortega). In the alternative, defendant argues his constitutional  rights were violated by the failure to give the instruction,  and his counsel was ineffective in failing to request such  an instruction. A trial court ""has a sua sponte duty to instruct on all  elements of an offense and on the general principles of  law governing a case."" (People v. Singh (2019) 42  Cal.App.5th 175, 183.) This duty includes "" 'instruct[ing]  on a lesser offense necessarily included in the charged  offense if there is substantial evidence the defendant is  guilty only of the lesser.' "" (People v. Alvarez (2019) 32  Cal.App.5th 781, 786 (Alvarez).) ""There are two tests for determining whether an  uncharged crime is a lesser included offense. 'Under the  elements test, a court determines whether, as a matter  of law, the statutory definition of the greater offense  necessarily includes the lesser offense.' [Citation.] This test is satisfied if ' ""all legal elements of  the lesser offense are also elements of the greater."" '  [Citation.] 'Under the accusatory pleading test, a court  Page 3 of 4 reviews the accusatory pleading to determine whether  the facts actually alleged include 4 all of the [*6]  elements of the uncharged lesser offense;  if it does, then the latter is necessarily included in the  former.' "" (Alvarez, supra, 32 Cal.App.5th at p. 786.) Sexual battery is not a lesser included offense of  forcible sexual penetration under the elements test  because the forcible penetration statute and the sexual  battery statute encompass different types of contact.  While the forcible penetration statute encompasses  contact by ""any foreign object,"" the sexual battery  statute only encompasses touching by the offender's  body. (§§ 289, subd. (k)(1), 243.4; see also Ortega,  supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at p. 967.) As for the accusatory pleading test, here the pleading  tracked the statutory language of section 289,  subdivision (a)(1) and alleged that defendant ""did  unlawfully cause the penetration of the genital opening  of [C.], for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification,  and abuse by a foreign object, substance, instrument  and device, and by an unknown object, accomplished  by force, violence, duress, menace and fear of  immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim.""4  When ""the accusatory pleading incorporates the  statutory definition of the charged offense without  referring to the particular facts, a reviewing court must  rely on the statutory elements to determine if there is a  lesser included offense."" (People v. Robinson (2016) 63  Cal.4th 200, 207.) Defendant [*7]  nevertheless relies on Ortega and urges  us to look beyond the accusatory pleading. Like here,  the defendant in Ortega was charged with forcible  sexual penetration based on evidence of digital  penetration. (Ortega, supra, 240 Cal.App.4th at pp. 960- 961.) On appeal, he argued the trial court should have  instructed jurors that sexual battery was a lesser  included  offense  of  forcible  sexual  penetration.  According to 4 Section 289, subdivision (a)(1)(A) provides: ""Any  person who commits an act of sexual penetration when  the act is accomplished against the victim's will by  means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of  immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or  another person shall be punished by imprisonment in  the state prison for three, six, or eight years."" 5 the defendant, although it was not a lesser included  offense under the elements test, it was such under an  ""expanded accusatory pleading test."" (Id. at p. 967.) The  appellate court agreed that the ""accusatory pleading  cannot be examined in isolation"" and found that it also  must consider the evidence adduced during the  preliminary hearing, which would have indicated that  defendant was only being charged with forcible sexual  penetration based on his unlawful touching of the victim  with his finger. (Id. at pp. 968-969.) According to [*8]   the appellate court, this expanded analysis comported  with a defendant's due process rights because he  ""cannot be prosecuted for an offense not shown at the  preliminary hearing to have been committed."" (Id. at p.  969.) We decline to apply an expanded accusatory pleading  test. As the court explained in Alvarez, the California  Supreme Court made clear in People v. Montoya (2004) 33 Cal.4th 1031, 1036, that we consider only the  pleading for the greater offense when analyzing the  accusatory  pleading  test.  (Alvarez,  supra,  32  Cal.App.5th at p. 787; see also People v. Smith (2013) 57 Cal.4th 232, 244  [further noting the test ""does not require or depend on  an examination of the evidence adduced at trial""].) Other  appellate courts have agreed with Alvarez and  disagreed with Ortega. (People v. Macias (2018) 26  Cal.App.5th 957, 964 [rejecting Ortega as contrary to  Montoya]; People v. Munoz (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 143, 156-158 [accord].) Defendant's contentions, including that his counsel was  ineffective in this regard, are without merit. (See People  v. Price (1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 387 [no ineffective  assistance where a reasonably competent attorney  might well have determined that an objection would  have been futile in light of existing precedent].) II Defendant also contends the jury and not the trial court  should have determined whether the crimes alleged in  counts 1 and 2 occurred on separate occasions for the  purposes of sentencing. Specifically, he claims [*9]  the  trial court violated his Sixth Amendment rights and  engaged in improper judicial factfinding under Aprendi v.  New 6 Page 4 of 4 Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435] (Aprendi)  when it found that defendant's crimes were committed  on separate occasions within the meaning of section  667.6, subdivision (d) and proceeded to impose a  consecutive sentence on count 2. After defendant filed his opening brief, the California  Supreme Court explained that ""the rule of Aprendi and  [Alleyne v. United States (2013) 570 U.S. 99 [186  L.Ed.2d 314]] does not apply to section 667.6[,  subdivision ](d)."" (People v. Catarino (2023) 14 Cal.5th  748, 750.) In other words, section 667.6, subdivision (d)  does not violate the Sixth Amendment in requiring that a  sentencing court impose full, separate, and consecutive  terms for certain sex crimes if it finds certain facts.  (Catarino, at p. 750.) Defendant's arguments lack merit. DISPOSITION The judgment is affirmed. /S/  MAURO, Acting P. J.

People v. L.G.,"[*429]  [**419]   Toko Serita, J. Defendant moves to vacate her plea of guilty to  disorderly conduct (Penal Law § 240.20) under docket  number 2000QN056893 and the judgment of conviction  and sentence rendered on November 14, 2000, and her  plea of guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the  fourth degree (Penal Law § 265.01) under docket  number 2003QN050066 and the judgment of conviction  and sentence rendered on November 7, 2003, pursuant  to Criminal Procedure Law § 440.10 (1) (h) and (i). The Parties' Contentions Defendant asserts that her prior convictions are directly  related to her arrests for prostitution offenses, and that  because she is a victim of human trafficking, those  convictions must be vacated and the cases dismissed.  Defendant  also  argues  that  she  was  denied  effective [****2]  assistance of counsel when she  pleaded guilty in each case. The People do not contest the factual allegations  presented by defendant. Rather, they argue that her  second conviction  [***2] for criminal possession of a  weapon should not be vacated because it is not a  prostitution-related charge, and as a matter of public  policy, CPL 440.10 should not grant greater protection  to human trafficking victims in weapons cases. They  also assert that defendant failed to seek relief under  CPL 440.10 with due diligence [*430]  because she filed  her motion three years after she ceased to fear her  trafficker in 2008, and a year after CPL 440.10 was  amended in 2010 to allow relief for human trafficking  victims (see CPL 440.10 [1] [i]). Procedural History Defendant L.G. was arraigned on November 14, 2000      under docket number 2000QN056893 under an alias  and charged with prostitution (Penal Law § 230.00).  Defendant pleaded guilty on that date to disorderly  conduct (Penal Law § 240.20) and was sentenced to a  conditional discharge. Subsequently, on November 7, 2003 defendant was  arraigned  under  docket  number  2003QN050066,   [***3] again, under an alias and charged with loitering  for the purpose of engaging in a prostitution offense  (Penal Law § 240.37 [3]), criminal possession of a  weapon in the fourth degree (Penal Law § 265.01 [1])  and  disorderly  conduct  (Penal  Law  §  240.20  [5]). [**420]  On November 7, 2003 defendant pleaded  guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth  degree and was sentenced to three years of probation.  Thereafter, on May 5, 2004, defendant was declared  delinquent for violating the conditions of her probation.  On November 28, 2006 defendant was convicted of  violation of probation and sentenced to 10 days'  imprisonment. I. Factual Background The People do not contest defendant's factual  averments. Accordingly, the court accepts as true the  following facts set out in defendant's moving papers: Defendant, ""L.G.,"" was forced into prostitution when she  was only 12 years old. She was born in 1986 in  Brooklyn, New York, and lived with her grandmother  until she was eight years old. While living with her  grandmother, L.G. was sexually abused by an uncle, but  she never received any medical attention even though  the Administration for Children's Services was involved  and  informed  about  the  abuse.  Following  her  grandmother's death, L.G. was placed into foster care  and  [***4] over the next few years, she was bounced  around different foster homes until she was 12 years  old, when something happened that changed her life.  [*431]   There was a strip club across the street from  where she lived with a foster family in Brownsville,  Brooklyn. One day she was approached by a man in  this thirties, ""A."" He took her to a house where six other  underage girls were living. Each of [****3]  these girls  had a bed in a different room, and ""A,"" who was very       41 Misc. 3d 428, *428; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **418; 2013 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3605, ***1; 2013 NY Slip Op 23276, ****1 Page 5 of 11 nice to her at first, told her that if she stayed with him,  she would not have to go back to her foster family. He  kept her there and would not permit her to return to her  foster home. He explained the rules of the ""game"" to  her, and although she didn't understand it at the time,  ""A"" was preparing her to become a prostitute. After several weeks, ""A"" sent her out  [***5] to a ""track""  on Pennsylvania Avenue in Brooklyn, accompanied by  the other girls, who were there to make sure she did not  get snatched by other pimps. Thereafter, he took her to  that track repeatedly so that she could earn money for  him through prostitution. L.G. was scared to leave ""A""  because he severely beat the other girls just for  speaking with other men. He also beat them with  hangers because he thought they were a bad influence  on defendant. Later, at the encouragement of some girls  she met on the track, defendant started working for  another pimp, named ""B,"" in Crown Heights, because  she felt safer with him. Although he was also nice to her  on the first day they were together, the next day he  forced her to go out and make money for him through  commercial sex. ""B"" also intimidated her with physical  violence and was very strict with his girls, whom he  forced to work daily from 7:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. When  [***6] L.G. was about 13 years old, she started  working for ""C."" She was required to give him the money  she made in exchange for her own room. She did  not [**421]  enjoy her life being prostituted: ""It wasn't  like I wanted to be out there, but being in foster care,  going from home to home, I felt like nobody cared about  me. It made me feel so miserable.""  [*432]   After about six months, L.G. met another pimp  called ""D"" who took her to Atlantic City, New Jersey. In  2000, ""D"" sent her by bus to Washington, D.C., and  then to Miami, Florida. In Florida, defendant, who was  14 years old at the time, attempted to leave ""the life"" by               calling her brother's father who lived in Ft. Lauderdale.  He came to get her, and she lived with him and her  brother for about two weeks. A friend bought her a ticket  back to New York, where she resumed foster care  placement. However, the family she was placed with did  not support her. She then met a girl who introduced her to a  manipulative pimp called ""E"" in Coney Island. L.G. was  14 years old at the time and he was about 30. He was  very violent and would severely beat the girls who  worked for him,  [***7] including L.G., who was afraid  that he would kill her if she ever tried to leave him. She  recalled that ""some girls left once they realized he was  so scary, but 'E' would find them and beat them up. If a  girl made a lot of money, he would put fear in her heart  not to leave."" He beat the defendant often, sometimes  violently, for not making enough money or for  threatening to leave, and would use a belt, or an iron, or  any other handy object. Once he beat her so badly  about the face [****4]  that she was unable to leave the  house for two weeks, primarily because ""E"" was afraid  she might attract the attention of the police. He also  forced her, as well as all his other girls, to have sex  regularly with him. During the time she was with him she  worked the tracks in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, New  Jersey, and other states. ""E"" instructed L.G. to use a  false name and age if she was ever arrested. She was  with ""E"" for about 3½ years. Defendant was first arrested in Queens County for  prostitution on November 14, 2000 when she was 14  years old. In accordance with her pimp's instructions,  she provided a false name and birth date to the police to  appear older. Defendant was next arrested on  November  [***8] 2, 2003 for loitering for purposes of  prostitution, disorderly conduct, and criminal possession  of a weapon in the fourth degree for allegedly carrying a  knife. She was 17 years old at the time. L.G. admits that  she carried a small pocketknife ""no bigger than [her]  forefingers,"" which had been given to her by her pimp,  who instructed her to carry it  [*433]  with her for  protection when she was on the street. ""Johns"" had  raped, assaulted and threatened L.G. with weapons  many times while she was forced to work as a  prostitute. Defendant explained that      41 Misc. 3d 428, *431; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **420; 2013 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3605, ***4; 2013 NY Slip Op 23276, ****3 Page 6 of 11 ""[a]t the time of my second arrest, I had heard that  there was a guy out there who pretended to be a  client, but would then rape girls and beat them up. It  felt like every time I turned around, some girl was  missing. Another girl I knew was raped and beaten  up by a trick. She ended up in the hospital. I had  already been raped by clients and was terrified of it  happening again. Every time I went out I was  scared of being raped or killed."" The night she was arrested, L.G. was working in a dark  and very scary area near a bus stop when she was  stopped by a [**422]  police officer, who requested her  identification, inspected her purse and discovered the  pocketknife. L.G. thought that she was being arrested  for prostitution, not for possession of a weapon. In any  event, she pleaded guilty to the weapons charge and  was sentenced to probation for three years, which she  eventually violated. According to her, she only  discovered years later that there was a warrant for her  arrest when she applied for a certificate of disposition so  that she could get a job as a home health aide. Because  she had failed to comply with probation, she was  sentenced to 10 days' incarceration on November 28,  2006. In 2004, L.G. was 18 years old when she was finally  able to leave ""the life."" Her pimp, ""E,"" had been  arrested, which gave her a chance to escape. She  returned to a foster care placement agency, and for the  first time in her life, disclosed what had happened to her  as a child. They placed her with a family on Staten  Island to keep her away from Brooklyn, where she did  not feel safe because she had been informed that her  pimp was looking  [***10] for her. She went back to  school and stayed with her foster family in Staten Island  for a year before she was able to get a subsidized  apartment right before her 21st birthday.  [****5]   [*434]  L.G. had been previously mandated by the  family court to participate in the GEMS program back in  2001 when she was 14 years old. As a result, she  received support and counseling from them. After  leaving prostitution in 2004 she reconnected with GEMS  and became an active member, participating in their  educational initiative program and in various therapy  groups before starting school again. She received a  home health aide degree in February 2007 and was      working in that capacity during most of 2007, until the  New York City Department of Health ran a background  check and informed her that she could no longer work  because of her past convictions. She received her GED  in 2010 and subsequently qualified for a certificate as a  medical assistant. More recently, L.G. was questioned  about her ability to be a fit guardian when she petitioned  for custody of her nephew—because of her convictions. In 2008, defendant received a message from her pimp  in which he stated that he was not coming after her.  However, she still feared him and therefore did not  report him as her trafficker. In her affidavit in support of  her motion, she stated that ""[o]ne of my family members was recently  murdered by her pimp. He beat her to death. Even  though it's been many years since I was trafficked,  hearing about this was so emotionally difficult. It  touches me every day. I remember how fearful I felt  when I left. I was always afraid that 'E' was going to  come and hurt me. It's only recently that I just got  that fear out of my heart."" Defendant is currently a student at Medgar Evers  College, and expects to graduate in 2014 with a  Bachelor's degree in public administration and social  work. She avers that she wants ""to vacate my  convictions so that I can move forward with my life and  career without being held back by my past."" II. Analysis Defendant L.G.'s odyssey as a victim of human  trafficking began when she was only 12 years old; she  was picked up off the streets of New York City and  forced into prostitution for the next several [***12]    [**423]  years by a succession of exploitative men who  already had other underage girls working for them.  Having endured physical and sexual violence at the  hands of her pimps,  [*435]  johns, and family members,  defendant's childhood and adolescence were marked by  rapes, sexual assaults, kidnapping, enslavement, and  threats of death. Before she was 18 years old, L.G. had  been arrested twice for prostitution-related offenses in  Queens, resulting in a conviction for disorderly conduct  when she was 14 years old after the first arrest, and  another for criminal possession of a weapon three years  later, when she was 17 years old. In both instances,  however, she was charged and convicted as an adult in  local criminal court. As noted earlier, the facts are undisputed in this case.  At issue here is whether Criminal Procedure Law §  41 Misc. 3d 428, *433; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **421; 2013 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3605, ***9; 2013 NY Slip Op 23276, ****4 Page 7 of 11 440.10 (1) (i) empowers the court to dismiss non- prostitution convictions which directly resulted from  defendant's victimization as a trafficked person or  whether the statute's scope must be narrowly applied to  vacate only convictions for prostitution-related offenses.  [****6] Amendment of CPL 440.10 Vacatur Statute In 2010, HN1[ ] New York became the first state in the  country to pass a law which allows  [***13] defendants  to vacate their prior convictions which resulted from their  experiences as victims of human trafficking (CPL  440.10 [1] [i]). It did so by amending CPL 440.10 to  create a new form of post-conviction relief which affords  victims of sex trafficking the remedy of vacating their  convictions if they can establish that ""[t]he judgment is a conviction where the arresting  charge was under section 240.37 (loitering for the  purpose of engaging in a prostitution offense . . . )  or 230.00 (prostitution) of the penal law, and the  defendant's participation in the offense was a result  of having been a victim of sex trafficking under  section 230.34 of the penal law [New York's sex  trafficking statute], or trafficking in persons under  the [Federal] Trafficking Victims Protection Act  (United States Code, title 22, chapter 78)"" (id.).  Thus, HN2[ ] in order to obtain the requested relief, the  movant must  [*436]  establish that (1) she was a                                      trafficking victim at the time of her arrest, and (2) her  conduct or ""participation in the offense"" leading to her  arrest resulted from her being trafficked. Although New  York, unlike federal law,  [***15] does not have a  definition of what constitutes a sex trafficking victim, it  necessarily follows that any person who is a victim of  the statutory crime of sex trafficking would meet this  definition. A person [**424]  is guilty of sex trafficking  under Penal Law § 230.34 if he or she ""intentionally  advances or profits from prostitution"" by engaging in any  one of several types of conduct, such as taking or  keeping  an  individual's  passport  or  immigration  documents to induce a victim to become involved in or  to remain in prostitution (Penal Law § 230.34 [3]), or by  using different methods of force or coercion to instill a  fear in the trafficked victim to compel her to engage in  or continue to engage in prostitution (Penal Law §  230.34 [5] [a]-[h]). HN3[ ] On the federal level, the Trafficking Victims  Protection Act specifically mentioned in CPL 440.10 (1)  (i) defines ""severe forms of trafficking in persons"" to  include sex [****7]  trafficking either in which the victim  is induced to engage in a commercial sex act through  force, fraud or coercion, or where the victim induced to  engage in a commercial sex act has not attained the  age of 18 (22 USC § 7102 [9] [A]). Severe forms of  trafficking in persons also include ""the recruitment,   [***16] harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining  of a person for labor or services, through the use of  force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to  involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or  slavery"" (id. at § 7102 [9] [B]).  This court finds that L.G. was clearly a victim of sex  trafficking under both federal and New York state  standards. L.G. has demonstrated that she was clearly  a victim of sex trafficking under the relevant state sex  trafficking statute because of her traffickers' use of  force and fear to compel her participation in prostitution  (Penal Law § 230.34 [5]). Defendant also meets  [*437]   the requirements under the federal TVPA as a victim of  a ""severe"" form of trafficking because she was induced  into commercial sex while under 18 years of age (22  USC § 7102 [9] [A]; People v G.M., 32 Misc 3d 274,  280, 922 NYS2d 761 [Crim Ct, Queens County 2011];  see also People v Doe, 34 Misc 3d 237, 935 NYS2d 481  [Sup Ct, Bronx County 2011]).     41 Misc. 3d 428, *435; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **423; 2013 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3605, ***12; 2013 NY Slip Op 23276, ****5 Page 8 of 11 More to the point, L.G.'s participation in the offences  which led to her two convictions was the direct result of  her actions as a trafficking victim forced into street  prostitution by her pimp/trafficker. The People do not  contest either defendant's status or the circumstances  surrounding both of her arrests; only that her second  conviction should not be subject to vacatur under this  statute. Thus, the only disputed issue in this case is  whether defendant's conviction for a non-prostitution  offense which was the direct result of her having been  forced into sex trafficking may be vacated under CPL  440.10 (1) (i). L.G. argues that while her second  conviction for weapons possession is admittedly not a  prostitution offense, it should nevertheless be dismissed  because it resulted from her forced involvement in  trafficking activity by her pimp when he required her to  engage in street prostitution. To support the connection  between the weapons conviction and defendant's  coerced prostitution activities, defense counsel notes  that L.G. possessed a pocketknife to protect herself  against unpredictable and potentially violent situations  involving ""johns,"" and was told to do so by her trafficker.  For  [***18] the reasons explained below, this court  holds that L.G.'s conviction for possession of a weapon  in the fourth degree falls within the ambit of the vacatur  statute because her participation in that offense was  undeniably connected to the coerced trafficking activity  which led to [**425]  her arrest on prostitution-related  charges and should therefore be vacated. Vacatur Not Limited to the Arresting Charge under CPL  440.10 (1) (i) The New York legislature passed the new vacatur law,  codified at CPL 440.10 (1) (i), based upon a recognition  of the continuing harm done to trafficking victims  who [****8]  are burdened with criminal convictions as a  result of their victimization in  [*438]  the commercial  sex trade. While New York recognized ""the severity of  the crime of sex trafficking"" by passing the sex  trafficking statute in 2007 (Penal Law § 230.34), one  of  the  sponsors  of  this  new  vacatur  statute  acknowledged that ""gaps remain in our ability to provide  justice to the victims"" (Sponsor's Letter in Support, July         20, 2010, Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 10). ""Victims of trafficking into commercial sex are  frequently arrested for prostitution-related offenses  and are then saddled with the criminal record for  life, long after they may be freed from exploitation.  [This] record may prevent them from obtaining  gainful employment and impair their ability to  access or stay in public or private housing, advance  their education, or participate in other important  aspects of life. Trafficked persons should not suffer  ongoing punishment for acts they committed  unwillingly under coercion"" (id.). This new legislation was thus intended to ""give victims  of human trafficking a desperately needed second  chance they deserve"" (Sponsor's Mem in Support, Bill  Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 13; see People v G.M., 32  Misc 3d at 279; People v Doe, 34 Misc 3d at 237 [new  legislation designed to assist minor trafficking victims]). Central to the issue raised by the instant motion is  determining what is meant by the term ""arresting  charge"" in CPL 440.10 (1) (i), and whether eligibility for  relief is confined only to prostitution and loitering  offenses.  [***20] The statutory language of subdivision  (1) (i) specifies that the court may grant vacatur if ""[t]he  judgment is a conviction where the arresting charge was  under"" either of the offenses for loitering for the purpose  of engaging in a prostitution offense (Penal Law §  240.37), or prostitution (Penal Law § 230.00) (CPL  440.10 [1] [i]). Indeed, human trafficking victims are frequently  arrested and charged for a variety of offenses based on  actions which the victims were unwillingly coerced into  committing by their traffickers. Any interpretation of CPL  440.10 (1) (i) that would narrow the definition of  ""arresting charge"" to include only prostitution offenses  as being entitled to post-conviction relief would  [*439]   certainly neither address the coercive forces confronting  trafficking victims nor comport with the ameliorative  legislative purposes of providing ""relief and justice . . . to  sex trafficking victims"" (Governor's Approval Mem, Bill  Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 6). Rather, this new law is  premised upon the profound understanding that  ""[t]rafficked  persons  should  not  suffer  ongoing  punishment for acts they committed unwillingly under  coercion [of a trafficker]"" (Sponsor's Letter in Support,  July 20, 2010,  [***21] Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 10),  in which they are ""presumably not criminally liable for  the offense"" (Peter Preiser, 2010 Supplementary  Practice Commentary, McKinney's Cons Laws of NY,  41 Misc. 3d 428, *437; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **424; 2013 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3605, ***16; 2013 NY Slip Op 23276, ****7 Page 9 of 11 Book 11A, CPL 440.10, 2013 Pocket Part at 99). The insertion of the term ""arresting charge"" in CPL  440.10 (1) (i) was deliberate on the part of the  legislature. As the bill's sponsors [**426]  observed,  ""[t]he bill is keyed to the 'arresting charge' because it is  common for a person arrested on prostitution- related [****9]  charges to plead guilty to some other  lower-level offense such as disorderly conduct; the bill's  remedy should be available to such a person""  (Sponsor's Letter to Governor's Counsel, Aug. 11, 2010,  Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 11). Similarly, the  Governor's approval memorandum recognized that a  defendant could be arrested for prostitution but  convicted of another offense, and seek vacatur of that  conviction under the statute (Governor's Approval Mem,  Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 6). Thus, HN4[ ] the  legislative history of CPL 440.10 (1) (i) shows that the  legislature anticipated that a victim of human trafficking  arrested on prostitution-related charges may ultimately  plead guilty to an alternate count.  [***22] It necessarily  follows that where, as here, one of the arresting charges  was loitering for the purpose of engaging in prostitution,  and the defendant pleaded guilty to a related non- prostitution crime, then that conviction must be regarded  as having resulted from defendant's having been a  victim of sex trafficking. Consequently, that charge  may be vacated under CPL 440.10 (1) (i). In the instant case, L.G.'s second arrest charged her  with a variety of crimes other than simply loitering for the  purpose of engaging in prostitution. Affording her the  remedy of vacatur for those offenses which were also  committed under force and coercion by an underage  victim of sex trafficking is consistent with the  legislature's intent. There is no dispute that she was  clearly a minor victim at the time of her arrest, under the  coercive control of her trafficker, and that she  possessed a pocketknife to protect herself on the  streets where she was  [*440]  forced to work under  dangerous conditions because she had been raped and  kidnapped in the past. Her conviction for criminal  weapons possession was clearly the result of her having  been trafficked and therefore the arrest charge could  be considered a prostitution-related  [***23] offense. Judicial Discretion Limits Vacatur to Trafficking Related  Offenses Another significant feature of this new law is that the  amended statute contemplates the exercise of judicial  discretion because it states that the court ""may"" vacate  the judgment of conviction if certain criteria are met. As  the Governor's approval memorandum notes, this also  includes the discretion to limit the over-inclusive  application of the statute to avoid vacating convictions  for more serious crimes. ""By allowing a court to deny a  motion, even though the defendant committed a crime  as a result of his or her victimization, the bill properly  permits  judicial  consideration  of  the  nature  or  seriousness of the crime"" (Governor's Approval Mem,  Bill Jacket, L 2010, ch 332 at 6). Thus, HN5[ ] the  statute grants to the court discretion to consider non- prostitution crimes for vacatur, but in exercising that  discretion, the court must ensure that serious crimes are  not vacated merely because the defendant happened to  be  a  victim  of  trafficking.  Additionally,  under  subdivision (6) of CPL 440.10, the statute specifically  contemplates the use of judicial discretion to ""take such  additional action as  [***24] is appropriate in the  circumstances.""  Previously, this court, in People v G.M. (32 Misc 3d 274,  922 NYS2d 761 [2011]), vacated a trafficking victim's  convictions for two violations stemming from drug  charges (disorderly conduct [****10]  [Penal Law §  240.20]), and [**427]  four B misdemeanor convictions,  two for criminal trespass in the third degree (Penal Law  § 140.10), and two for prostitution (Penal Law §  230.00). In that case, the People consented to the  dismissal of all six of the defendant's convictions,  including those that did not involve prostitution charges,  because they agreed that the defendant was clearly a   [*441]  victim of sex trafficking during each of her  arrests. In carefully reviewing the specific facts of this                      41 Misc. 3d 428, *439; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **425; 2013 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 3605, ***21; 2013 NY Slip Op 23276, ****8 Page 10 of 11 case, the court finds no difference between defendant's  status as a victim of sex trafficking and that of the  defendant G.M. Accordingly, there is no discernible  distinction between both cases except for the fact that  L.G. pleaded guilty to the crime of fourth-degree criminal   [***25] possession of a weapon, an A misdemeanor. In People v G.M., this court left open the question HN7[ ] whether CPL 440.10 (1) (i) could be applied to non- prostitution offenses where the People have not  consented to vacatur of the resulting conviction(s). It is  now evident  [***26] from the foregoing analysis of the  legislative  history  behind  the  statute,  that  the  legislature's goal in amending the statute was to avoid  punishing the victims of human trafficking by saddling  them with a criminal record. It is also apparent that the  legislature fully expected the statute to provide relief to  trafficking victims who were not only arrested for  prostitution or loitering for the purpose of prostitution,  but were also convicted of other charges. Finally, the  legislature noted that discretion remains with the court  to determine which convictions should be vacated. Additionally, this court rejects the People's argument  that defendant failed to file this motion with due  diligence after she ceased to be a victim of sex  trafficking, as required under CPL 440.10 (1) (i).  According  to  defendant's  uncontested  factual  averments, she escaped her trafficker in 2004, but  feared until 2008 that he would track her down and  harm her. The statutory provision under which  defendant now seeks relief was not enacted until August  2010 and defendant filed her motion in September  2011. Considering the significant amount of effort  required to prepare the instant motion, and the fact that  CPL 440.10 (1) (i)  [***27] had only been in effect for  barely one year when defendant filed her motion, this  court finds that defendant made her motion with  necessary due diligence as required under CPL 440.10  (1) (i) (i).  [****11]   [*442]   Accordingly, in order for the court to exercise its  discretion to consider vacatur of each of defendant's  judgments of conviction, the court must examine the  unique factual circumstances pertaining to each  conviction. Motion to Vacate Judgment under Docket Number  2000QN056893    Defendant was arraigned on November 14, 2000 under  docket number 2000QN056893 and charged with  prostitution [**428]  (Penal Law § 230.00). Defendant  pleaded guilty on that date to disorderly conduct (Penal  Law § 240.20) and was sentenced to a conditional  discharge. This conviction precisely fits the pattern  anticipated under CPL 440.10 (1) (i) for permitting the  judgment to be vacated. Additionally, the court notes that based upon L.G.'s  uncontroverted factual averments, she was only 14  years old at the time of her conviction for disorderly  conduct. BecauseHN8[ ]  disorderly conduct is an  offense for which criminal responsibility is not imposed  on a minor under age 16 (Penal Law § 30.00 [2]), the  conviction on that charge is a nullity and should be  dismissed  [***28] (Penal Law § 30.00 [1]; People v  Lebron, 197 AD2d 416, 602 NYS2d 602 [1st Dept  1993], lv denied 82 NY2d 898, 632 NE2d 475, 610  NYS2d 165 [1993]; People v McFadden, 194 AD2d 566,  598 NYS2d 567 [2d Dept 1993], lv denied 82 NY2d 722,  622 NE2d 321, 602 NYS2d 820 [1993]). Accordingly, the judgment convicting defendant of  disorderly conduct was ordered vacated, and the  accusatory instrument dismissed by this court. Motion to Vacate Judgment under Docket Number  2003QN050066 On November 7, 2003 defendant was arraigned under  docket number 2003QN050066 and charged with  loitering for the purpose of engaging in a prostitution  offense (Penal Law § 240.37 [3]), criminal possession of  a weapon in the fourth degree (Penal Law § 265.01 [1])  and disorderly conduct (Penal Law § 240.20 [5]).  Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a  weapon in the fourth degree and received a sentence of  three years' probation. It is apparent both from  defendant's  factual  averments,  and  the  factual  allegations contained in the complaint filed in the case,  that the knife at issue which gave rise to the weapons  possession  charge,  was  recovered  incident  to  defendant's prostitution-related activity, and that she  was a victim of trafficking at the time of her arrest.  Accordingly, the judgment convicting defendant of  criminal possession of a  [***29]   [*443]  weapon in the  fourth degree was ordered vacated and the accusatory  instrument dismissed by this court. Conclusion Based upon the foregoing, this court vacated the  judgments of conviction entered under docket number  41 Misc. 3d 428, *441; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **427; 2013 N.Y. Misc.

The court further ordered that  the records of defendant's convictions be sealed under  CPL 160.50 (1) and (3) (f).  [****12]   41 Misc. 3d 428, *443; 972 N.Y.S.2d 418, **428; 2013 N.Y. Misc.

People v. Lamb_ 37 N.Y.3d 1174,"Memorandum. The order of the Appellate Division should be modified  by vacating defendant's convictions for sex trafficking  and ordering a new trial on those counts and, as so  modified, affirmed. The sex trafficking statute is comprised of two distinct  but linked elements, namely the offender must advance  or profit from prostitution by one of the enumerated  coercive acts (see Penal Law § 230.34). The trial court's  supplemental instruction, in response to a jury note,  erroneously severed the required link between those  elements. Accordingly, defendant's sex trafficking  convictions should be vacated, and a new trial held on  Page 2 of 21 those counts (see People v Brown, 87 NY2d 950, 951  [1996]). The trial court's error in the supplemental instruction  was unrelated to defendant's remaining conviction for  promoting prostitution in the third degree and does not  require vacatur of that count (see People v Walston, 23  NY3d 986, 990 [2014]). Defendant's remaining claims are either rendered  academic by our decision or without merit. Concur by: SINGAS; WILSON  Singas, J. (concurring). Defendant stands convicted of two sex trafficking  counts and one count [****2]  of promoting prostitution in  the third degree. Although there was a legally sufficient  basis for the trial court to submit the question of  territorial jurisdiction to prosecute defendant for the  crime of sex trafficking to the jury, the court's  supplemental instruction, in response to a jury note,  erroneously severed the required link between the  elements of that crime. Because the instruction was  misleading and prejudicial, we would modify the  judgment by vacating defendant's sex trafficking  convictions. I. In January 2013, defendant began promoting a  prostitution   [*1176] business  by  advertising [**1082]  [***290]  online. Over the course of  30  months,  he  posted  thousands  of  online  advertisements in both New York and New Jersey.  Defendant paid for these advertisements, which  solicited both clients and young women to be  prostituted, through an account registered to an address  in Manhattan. Certain postings offered housing,  transportation, employment, and financial assistance to  young homeless women, including those living at  Covenant House, an association of youth shelters with  locations  in  New  York  and  New  Jersey.  The  advertisements listed a website, a New York-based  Twitter handle, a phone number (registered [****3]  to  defendant at the same Manhattan address), and email  addresses. His website described the business as an  ""escort provider of New York City and Tri-State area,""  and boasted that he offered ""the Best NYC/NJ Escorts  available."" In June 2013, a 22-year-old woman, KT, answered one  of  defendant's  online  escort  advertisements.  At  defendant's request, KT emailed three photographs of  herself. Defendant then arranged an ""audition"" at a hotel  in Manhattan. He instructed KT as to what clothing she  should bring, including a bathing suit. At the hotel, KT  changed into the bathing suit. She and defendant then  had sex so that he could ""test the merchandise."" That  day, KT saw another woman enter defendant's hotel  room, other men arriving to have sex with the woman  for money, and the woman handing defendant a ""cut"" of  the money earned. Defendant also photographed KT and immediately  posted an advertisement with the photographs so that  she could start working right away. He ultimately listed  multiple ads specifically featuring her photograph and  listing her location as ""Midtown West."" Over several  months, KT performed sexual acts in Brooklyn, Queens,  and New Jersey. Defendant required her to charge  $120 [****4]  for thirty minutes or $300 per hour and to  give that money to another ""employee"" who was also  defendant's girlfriend. KT ultimately helped manage  defendant's prostitution business by screening the  women who answered the escort advertisements and  reporting back to defendant for his ultimate approval of  the women he would employ. KT's phone number was  the contact point for clients responding to the ads. She  directed the women where to meet the clients, including  in Manhattan. In April 2015, then-18-year-old JC reached out by email  to defendant, believing that she was responding to an  advertisement for a hostess or catering job. Defendant  arranged a meeting and instructed her to bring a ""club  dress."" As JC had no  [*1177]  means of transportation,  defendant sent a car to transport her to his New Jersey  apartment. In the apartment, JC changed into the dress  and posed for photographs that defendant said were for  a ""portfolio."" When defendant asked to photograph JC  naked, she realized that he wanted her to prostitute  herself. JC asked to leave, but defendant signaled that  he had a gun in the couch and would shoot or hit her if  she did not comply. JC then allowed defendant to  photograph her partially [****5]  clothed. She also drank  alcohol at defendant's behest and blacked out. JC's next  memory was of defendant dragging her down the stairs  outside his apartment. He put JC in a car and the driver  took her home. A later search of defendant's phone  revealed additional photographs of JC, taken while she  was unconscious and for which she did not remember  posing. 37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1174; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1080; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***288; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****1; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 3 of 21 Over the course of the next several days, defendant and  JC exchanged emails in which JC begged defendant to  stop contacting her and defendant made increasingly  menacing demands. Defendant  [***291] threatened to  physically hurt JC and her  [**1083] family (either by  himself or through his ""goons"") or circulate the nude  photographs to her friends, family, potential employers,  and prospective colleges if she refused to work for him  as a prostitute. To magnify the immediacy of his threats,  defendant told JC her father's name, the color of her  front door, and where she went to school. He stated that  he had ""all [her] personal info."" In the emails, defendant  sent the photographs of JC, as well as pictures he had  taken, without her knowledge, of her high school ID,  birth certificate, and Social Security card. Defendant  stopped contact with JC after she told him [****6]  that  his threats had induced her to attempt suicide.  According to JC, defendant never indicated that he  planned for JC to prostitute herself in New York and JC  never traveled to New York at defendant's behest. In June 2014, Covenant House contacted the New York  County District Attorney's Office regarding defendant's  advertisements targeting young homeless women. The  District Attorney's Office began an investigation,  obtaining business records from banks as well as  telephone and Internet companies. In September 2015,  an indictment was filed charging defendant with  promoting prostitution in the third degree and two counts  of sex trafficking as to JC, as well as one count of sex  trafficking as to JS, another woman whom defendant  was alleged to have threatened, in New Jersey,  [2]   with public humiliation if she refused to work for his  escort service.  [*1178]  During trial, defendant disputed whether New  York had territorial jurisdiction over the sex trafficking  charges against him under CPL 20.20 on the theory that  the coercive conduct toward the victims occurred wholly  in New Jersey. Defendant's pretrial motion to dismiss  the indictment on that basis was denied. In defendant's  motion for a trial order of dismissal, [****7]  he repeated  the argument that the People had not established  territorial  jurisdiction  because  the  victims  ""had  absolutely no contact in New York."" Supreme Court also  denied that motion. Nevertheless, as required by law  (People v McLaughlin, 80 NY2d 466, 606 NE2d 1357,  591 NYS2d 966 [1992]), the court submitted the  territorial jurisdiction question to the jury for each sex  trafficking count, charging: ""The prosecution has the burden to prove beyond a  reasonable doubt that the State of New York has  jurisdiction to prosecute the crime by proving  beyond a reasonable doubt either that [defendant]  engaged in conduct in the State of New York which  constituted at least one element of the crime or that  his conduct constituted an attempt to commit the  crime in this state."" If the jury determined that the People had proved that  one element of the crime, or an attempt to commit the  crime, took place in New York, it was then to consider  whether the People proved defendant's guilt as to each  element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. But if  the jury concluded that the People had not sustained  their jurisdictional burden, it was to cease its  deliberations regarding that crime and move on to the  remaining counts. The court then turned to the specific elements of [****8]   the crimes charged. For count one, sex trafficking as  to JS, the court instructed: ""In order for you to find [defendant] guilty of Count 1  regarding [JS,] the prosecution is required to prove  from all the evidence in this case beyond a  reasonable doubt each of the following: ""(1), that during the period from about August 1 to  September 30, 2014 in New York, [defendant]  advanced or profited from prostitution[,]  [***292] ""(2), that he did so by using force or  engaging in any scheme, plan, or pattern to compel  or induce [JS] to [**1084]  engage in or continue to  engage in prostitution [*1179]  activity by means of  instilling a fear in her that if the demand was not  complied with, [defendant] or another would expose  a secret or publicize an asserted fact whether true  or false tending to subject her to hatred, contempt  or r[i]dicule[,] ""[a]nd (3), that [defendant] did so intentionally."" The court repeated the legal instructions for the first  element for count two, sex trafficking as to JC, and  defined the second element as that he did so by  threatening to expose a secret that would subject her to  hatred or ridicule during the period between April 1 and  April 30, 2015. For count three, sex trafficking as to JC  based on the separate theory [****9]  of threatening  physical injury, the court instructed that element two  was  ""that [defendant] did so by using force or engaging  in a scheme, plan or pattern to compel or induce  37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1177; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1082; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***290; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****5; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 4 of 21 [JC] to engage in or continue to engage in  prostitution activity by means  [3] of instilling a fear  in her that if his demand was not complied with  [defendant] would cause her physical injury, serious  physical injury or death."" Neither party objected to these instructions. During deliberations, the jury sent a note asking, ""Is the  first element for count 1 in general or specifically for  [JS]. Context: some jurors are confused around the  wordings of the elements. Some mention the victim  specifically, whereas element 1 of count 1 does not  mention her name."" The court consulted with the parties  and indicated that it would respond that defendant  ""could have advanced or profited from prostitution by . .  . the use of any of those women"" and ""[i]t is not  necessarily specific to [JS]."" Defense counsel raised a  ""global objection that ties in with the jurisdiction issue.""  According to counsel, ""[i]t is as if the statute is written in  an over broad manner"" and there was ""[n]o action nexus  in New York."" Over defendant's objection, [****10]  the  court answered the note by rereading the first element  of sex trafficking and advising the jurors that ""[i]t is not  specific to anyone. . . . Where it doesn't mention her  name it means it is not specific to this person,"" as long  as the conduct occurred during the relevant time frame. The jury convicted defendant of the sex trafficking  charges as to JC and the promoting prostitution charge.  Defendant was acquitted of the sex trafficking charge  relating to JS. In December 2017, Supreme Court  sentenced defendant to an aggregate indeterminate  prison term of 6 to 18 years.  [*1180]  The Appellate Division unanimously modified,  by vacating the supplemental sex offender fee imposed  by the trial court, and otherwise affirmed the judgment  (188 AD3d 470, 135 NYS3d 97 [1st Dept 2020]). As  relevant here, the Court determined that the People  proved that New York had territorial jurisdiction over  defendant's sex trafficking charges because the  evidence  was  sufficient  to  establish  beyond  a  reasonable doubt that an element of that crime, that  defendant advanced or promoted prostitution, occurred  in New York (id. at 470-471) and rejected defendant's  statutory interpretation argument that sex trafficking is  a one-element crime, citing People v Giordano (87  NY2d 441, 663 NE2d 588, 640 NYS2d 432 [1995]). For  the  same  reason,  the  Court [****11]   rejected  defendant's challenges to the trial court's supplemental  charge on this issue (188 AD3d at 471).  [***293]  A Judge of this Court granted defendant leave  to appeal (36 NY3d 1057, 141 NYS3d 766, 165 NE3d  692 [2021]). II. Defendant  argues  that  there  was  no  territorial  jurisdiction  for  prosecution  of  the   [**1085] sex  trafficking charges, asserting, alternatively that the  crime is a single-element offense, in which the ""core""  coercive conduct had to occur in New York to confer  jurisdiction, or that it is a two-element crime requiring  proof of a nexus between the two elements for purposes  of jurisdiction, wherein one element occurs in New York. Preliminarily, territorial ""[j]urisdiction concerns the power  of the State to bring the criminal proceeding, not the  factual elements of the crime which must be proven for  a conviction"" (McLaughlin, 80 NY2d at 472). Thus,  ""territorial jurisdiction implicates the State's inherent  authority to prosecute and punish a suspect for alleged  criminal conduct"" (People v Carvajal, 6 NY3d 305, 312,  845 NE2d 1225, 812 NYS2d 395 [2005]). Unlike  common law, where ""[a]n offender could . . . be  prosecuted only in the place where the offense was  committed"" (People v Stokes, 88 NY2d 618, 624, 671  NE2d 1260, 648 NYS2d 863 [1996]), New York by  statute has ""broaden[ed] the territorial scope of criminal  jurisdiction"" (id.). In his review of then-Penal Law §  1930,  which  conferred  on  New  York  territorial  jurisdiction to prosecute [****12]  ""a person who  commits within th[e] state any crime, in whole or in part,""  Judge Cardozo observed that where an offender  commits multiple acts, ""some of them in New York and  some in another State, the courts of New York, if they  can catch the offender, may punish for the offense""  (People v Werblow, 241 NY 55, 60, 148 NE 786 [1925]).  [*1181]  The reach of that former statute, however, was  deemed ""unsatisfactory and a more extensive provision  was included in the proposed revision to the Criminal  Procedure Law"" (Stokes, 88 NY2d at 624 [internal  quotation marks omitted]); thus, ""CPL 20.20 . . . has  codified the general principle that, for New York to  exercise criminal jurisdiction, some alleged conduct or a  consequence of that conduct must have occurred in the  state"" (Carvajal, 6 NY3d at 312). As charged to the jury  here, New York has territorial jurisdiction to prosecute a  person for an offense when either ""[c]onduct occurred  within this state sufficient to establish . . . [a]n element of  such offense . . . or . . . [a]n attempt to commit such  offense"" (CPL 20.20 [1] [a], [b]). If the defendant  disputes the evidence of the State's prosecutorial  authority at trial, ""the trial court should charge the jury  that jurisdiction must be proven beyond a reasonable  37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1179; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1084; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***292; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****9; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 5 of 21 doubt"" (McLaughlin, 80 NY2d at 472). Defendant does not question the grant of territorial  jurisdiction under the CPL article 20 statutory [****13]   scheme but rather attacks its particular application here,  in the context of his reading of the crime of sex  trafficking. Resolution of this issue demands a  statutory interpretation of Penal Law § 230.34. III. New York's sex trafficking statute states that  ""[a] person is guilty of sex trafficking if he or she  intentionally advances or profits from prostitution  by: ""1. unlawfully providing to a person who is  patronized, with intent to impair said person's  judgment: (a) a narcotic drug or a narcotic  preparation; (b) concentrated cannabis as defined  in paragraph (a) of subdivision four of section thirty- three hundred two of the public health law;   [***294] (c)  methadone;  or  (d)  gamma- hydroxybutyrate (GHB) or flunitrazepan, also known  as Rohypnol; ""2.  making  material  false  statements,  misstatements, or omissions to induce or maintain  the person being patronized to engage in or  continue to engage in prostitution activity;  [**1086] ""3. withholding, destroying, or confiscating  any actual or purported passport, immigration  document,  [*1182] or any other actual or purported  government identification document of another  person with intent to impair said person's freedom  of  movement;  provided,  however,  that  this  subdivision shall not apply to an attempt to [****14]   correct a social security administration record or  immigration agency record in accordance with any  local, state, or federal agency requirement, where  such attempt is not made for the purpose of any  express or implied threat; ""4. requiring that prostitution be performed to retire,  repay, or service a real or purported debt; ""5. using force or engaging in any scheme, plan or  pattern to compel or induce the person being  patronized to engage in or continue to engage in  prostitution activity by means of instilling a fear in  the person being patronized that, if the demand is  not complied with, the  [4]  actor or another will do  one or more of the following: ""(a) cause physical injury, serious physical injury, or  death to a person; or ""(b) cause damage to property, other than the  property of the actor; or ""(c) engage in other conduct constituting a felony or  unlawful imprisonment in the second degree in  violation of section 135.05 of this chapter; or ""(d) accuse some person of a crime or cause  criminal charges or deportation proceedings to be  instituted against some person; provided, however,  that it shall be an affirmative defense to this  subdivision that the defendant reasonably believed  the threatened charge to be [****15]  true and that  his or her sole purpose was to compel or induce the  victim to take reasonable action to make good the  wrong which was the subject of such threatened  charge; or ""(e) expose a secret or publicize an asserted fact,  whether true or false, tending to subject some  person to hatred, contempt or ridicule; or ""(f) testify or provide information or withhold   [*1183] testimony or information with respect to  another's legal claim or defense; or ""(g) use or abuse his or her position as a public  servant by performing some act within or related to  his or her official duties, or by failing or refusing to  perform an official duty, in such manner as to affect  some person adversely; or ""(h) perform any other act which would not in itself  materially benefit the actor but which is calculated  to harm the person who is patronized materially  with respect to his or her health, safety, or  immigration status"" (Penal Law § 230.34). In its language and form, the sex trafficking statute  evokes New York's first-degree promoting gambling  statute, which we interpreted when defendant disputed  the jurisdiction to prosecute the crime in a particular  county in People v Giordano. .  [***295] To be guilty of         37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1181; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1085; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***293; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****12; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 6 of 21 first-degree  [5] promoting gambling, a defendant must  ""knowingly [****16]  [**1087]  advance[ ] or profit[ ] from  unlawful gambling activity by"" specific conduct set forth  in the statute's subdivisions, including ""[e]ngaging in  bookmaking"" (Penal Law § 225.10 [1]). The defendants  argued there was no jurisdiction to prosecute the case  in Nassau County because Penal Law § 225.10 (1) sets  forth a single-element crime: ""promoting gambling by  bookmaking"" (87 NY2d at 448) and the bookmaking  occurred in New York County. We rejected that  argument because it would make the language in the  opening paragraph surplusage and concluded that  advancing gambling is a separate element of the crime  from engaging in a bookmaking business. We explained  that  the  opening  paragraph  of  Penal  Law  §  225.10 [*1184]  ""holds [a] defendant guilty of promoting  gambling when he 'advances gambling activity', but  'bookmaking' is defined as 'advancing gambling activity  by  unlawfully  accepting  bets'  as  a  business.  Accordingly, the statute would have no different  meaning if the opening language were excised from it  as defendants would do"" (id. [citation omitted]).  Therefore, we held that first-degree promoting gambling  comprises two separate elements. Its opening language  encompasses misdemeanor promoting gambling, and  the operative word ""by"" defines how the offender is  exposed to felony liability (id. at 447). Here, defendant's single-element argument is similarly  unavailing. The coercive actions described in Penal Law  § 230.34's subdivisions themselves advance or profit  from prostitution. Thus, the opening ""advances or  profits"" language of that statute would be superfluous if  it was not a separate element. Moreover, that opening  language parallels the definition of the stand-alone  crime of misdemeanor promoting prostitution (see Penal  Law § 230.20 [1] [""A person is guilty of promoting  prostitution in the fourth degree when he or she  knowingly . . . (a)dvances or profits from prostitution""]).                Its second, aggravating element is defined in its five  subdivisions.  Engaging  in  any  of  the  specified  aggravating conduct, for the purpose of advancing the  prostitution, elevates the liability of an offender who  promotes prostitution to felony sex trafficking. Aside from being a two-element crime, that the  aggravating conduct exposes the offender to increased  liability also demonstrates that sex trafficking's  elements are linked.  Indeed, the plain  [6] language of  the [**1088]  [***296]  statute says as much: an offender   [*1185] must intentionally advance or profit from  prostitution by one of the enumerated coercive actions  (see People v Pabon, 28 NY3d 147, 152, 42 NYS3d  659,  65  NE3d  688  [2016]  [because  ""  'the  clearest [****18]  indicator of legislative intent is the  statutory text, the starting point in any case of  interpretation must always be the language itself, giving  effect to the plain meaning thereof' ""], quoting People v  Golo, 26 NY3d 358, 361, 23 NYS3d 110, 44 NE3d 185  [2015]). In most sex trafficking cases—including the  one before us—the offender's goal would be to induce  the specific victim, via the coercive conduct, to either  join or remain in the prostitution operation (see Penal  Law § 230.34 [1], [2], [5] [all referring to a person being  patronized]). In others, the trafficker's conduct may not  be intended to compel the victim to be prostituted, but  the conduct nevertheless must be in furtherance of the  enterprise (see Penal Law § 230.34 [3], [4] [both lacking                                    37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1183; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1086; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***295; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****15; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 7 of 21 language regarding a person being patronized]). For  example, an offender may, pursuant to Penal Law §  230.34 (3), withhold the passport or immigration  document of the family member of one of his  ""employees."" Thus, while the statute does not, in every  case, require that the victim is the ""person being  patronized,"" the offender's aim in threatening the victim  must be to promote his or her enterprise in some way. That the sex trafficking statute is intended to target  offenders who promote prosecution through specific  coercive conduct common in the sex trade [****19]  is  further demonstrated by the statute's purpose and  legislative history (see Riley v County of Broome, 95  NY2d 455, 463, 742 NE2d 98, 719 NYS2d 623 [2000]  [""the legislative history of an enactment may also be  relevant and is not to be ignored, even if words be  clear""]  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted)]).  The  legislature recognized the ""plight"" of sex trafficking  victims (Letter from NY St Dept of Labor, June 12, 2007,  Bill Jacket, L 2007, ch 74 at 18), the harm that  traffickers inflict on victims, and the many ways that  traffickers manipulate them into, essentially, ""sexual . . .  servitude"" (Senate Introducer's Mem, [*1186]  Bill  Jacket, L 2007, ch 74 at 11, 2007 NY Legis Ann at 57).  Promoting prostitution is the core conduct targeted by  the statute (see Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, Reports  to People of 81st Assembly District, Assemblyman  Dinowitz Passes Landmark Legislation to Combat  Human Trafficking [Summer 2007] [""The legislation  creates a new class B felony, 'sex trafficking,' with a  mandatory prison sentence of up to 25 years for  perpetrators who profit  [***297] from prostitution by  engaging in sex trafficking""]). But someone who  advances or profits from  [7] prostitution without also  taking one of the coercive actions described in the  statute's subdivisions is not a sex trafficker. Instead,  only an individual who promotes prostitution, and  furthers that enterprise by exploiting his or her  victims [****20]  through specified aggravating conduct,  faces increased liability (see Senate Introducer's Mem,             Bill Jacket, L 2007, ch 74 at 11, 2007 NY Legis Ann at  57;  see  also  Danny  Hakim  &  Nicholas  Confessore, [**1089]  Albany Agrees on Law against  Sexual and Labor Trafficking, NY Times, May 17, 2007  at B1 [""Coercing victims into prostitution by force would  be included as a felony sex trafficking offense, as  would tricking people into entering the country by  promising them jobs or providing them with illegal drugs,  and then forcing them into sexual servitude""]). Finally, when the trafficking legislation was introduced,  New York was estimated to be ""the fourth busiest point  of entry for trafficking victims in the United States""  (Letter from St of NY Div of Crim Just Services, Bill  Jacket, L 2007, ch 74 at 22; see also Council of City of  NY Resolution No. 0504-2006 [Nov. 11, 2006], available  at  https://www.greenpolicy360.net/w/New_York,_NY_Reco gnizing_Human_Trafficking_as_a_Crime  [last  accessed Nov. 24, 2021] [""New York State's ports,  airports, rail stations and international borders all  contribute to use of New York as a hub for trafficking,  and as a result many of the victims live in the [****21]   tri-state area""]). Collapsing sex trafficking into a single-element crime  would cast too small a net, unjustifiably limiting the  jurisdiction of this State to prosecute only those cases  where the entire crime occurred in New York. Just as  significantly, treating the statute's two elements as  unlinked could unjustifiably authorize prosecution of  crimes in New York for extraterritorial conduct   [*1187] having no impact on the public safety of the  state. Accordingly, we would hold that the sex  trafficking statute is comprised of two discrete yet  connected elements, to wit, the offender must advance  or profit from prostitution through coercive acts taken in  furtherance of his or her prostitution enterprise. Judge Wilson's concurring opinion's conclusion that the  People must prove, for jurisdiction purposes, both that  defendant advanced or profited from prostitution and  that he did so by coercive conduct (Wilson, J.,  concurring op at 1203-1204) is inconsistent with the  court's jurisdiction charge given pursuant to CPL 20.20  (1) (a) and invents an additional component for sex  trafficking only. Indeed, despite its contentions to the       37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1185; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1088; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***296; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****18; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 8 of 21 contrary, Judge Wilson's concurring opinion's position  effectively collapses both sex trafficking elements into  one (cf. Giordano, 87 NY2d at 447). Section 20.20 (1)  (a) contains [****22]  no language that more than one  element of the offense must be committed in New York,  and we decline to read language into the statute that  simply is not there (see Matter of Chemical Specialties  Mfrs. Assn. v Jorling, 85 NY2d 382, 394, 649 NE2d  1145, 626 NYS2d 1 [1995]). But, the second  jurisdictional predicate, as charged to the jury under  section 20.20 (1) (b), does permit the jury to find  jurisdiction where a defendant has engaged in conduct  constituting an attempt of the entire crime; that is, where   [***298] the defendant ""engage[d] in conduct which  tend[ed] to effect the commission of such crime"" (Penal  Law § 110.00). Regarding sex trafficking, that  jurisdictional analysis necessarily considers whether the  defendant came ""dangerously near"" engaging in the  specified coercive conduct in furtherance of his or her  prostitution enterprise (People v Acosta, 80 NY2d 665,  670, 609 NE2d 518, 593 NYS2d 978 [1993] [internal  quotation marks omitted]).  [**1090]  Notably, a jury's initial finding that the People  have established territorial jurisdiction to prosecute the  crime based on the commission of one element in New  York, or conduct establishing  [8] an attempt to commit  the entire crime here, is not the end of the jury's inquiry.  Rather, the People must still prove that the defendant is  guilty by evidence sufficient to establish that he  committed each and every element of the crime charged  (see McLaughlin, 80 NY2d at 472). In other words, to  prove defendant's [****23]  guilt of sex trafficking, the  People were required to establish that he advanced or  profited from prostitution in New York by his coercive  conduct against the victims in New Jersey. The evidence was sufficient to show, through KT's  testimony, that defendant operated a prostitution  enterprise in New York.  [*1188] In addition, the People  presented evidence that defendant attempted to  promote that enterprise through his actions toward a  specific  victim—JC—thus  engaging  in  conduct  constituting an attempt to commit sex trafficking.  Simply put, the evidence was sufficient to satisfy CPL  20.20 (1) and to allow the trial court to submit the issue  to the jury. The trial court necessarily found as much, as  a matter of law, when it denied defendant's trial order of  dismissal on the ground that the People had not  established territorial jurisdiction. IV. The remaining question is whether, given the link  between the elements of the crime, the trial court  effectively conveyed, in its supplemental instruction in  response to the jury request, that connection to the jury  for its determination of the factual issues in the case. To be clear, the jury was properly instructed, pursuant to  CPL 20.20 (1), that New York had jurisdiction to  prosecute [****24]  defendant if the People proved  beyond a reasonable doubt that he engaged in conduct  in the state sufficient to establish one element of sex  trafficking or that his conduct constituted an attempt to  commit that crime. Defendant did not contend,  specifically, that CPL 20.20 (1) was somehow deficient  or improper. While territorial jurisdiction ""may never be  waived"" (McLaughlin, 80 NY2d at 471), defendant's lack  of protest to that instruction and consistent failure to  argue that CPL 20.20 (1) was not satisfied undercuts his  challenge to the court's instruction as to the State's  jurisdiction to prosecute (cf. Carvajal, 6 NY3d at 311- 312 [because ""defendant never moved for a trial order  of dismissal . . . on the ground that the People failed to  prove jurisdiction, and rejected the court's offer to place  the interrogatories before the jury, . . . defendant  relinquished his opportunity to hold the People to their  burden of proof, and did not preserve his current  contention that the jury should have decided whether  the People proved jurisdiction beyond a reasonable  doubt""]). The supplemental instruction on the elements of sex  trafficking warrants a different resolution. The court's  initial charge, based on the pattern jury instruction (see  CJI2d[NY] Penal Law § 230.34 [5]), appropriately   [***299] bridged  sex [****25]   trafficking's  two  elements: the jury had to find, first, defendant ""advanced  or profited from prostitution,"" and, second, ""that he did  so by"" his coercive threats toward JC. As framed by the  People's theory of  [*1189] prosecution, the element of  promoting prostitution occurred in New York and the  coercive conduct that comprised the second element  occurred in New Jersey. In other words, defendant's  conduct in New Jersey must have been in furtherance of  his prostitution enterprise in New York.  [**1091]  In their specific request for supplemental  instructions, the jurors highlighted that precise issue:  whether the ""advances or profits"" conduct must relate to  the victim of the coercive conduct as named in the  individual counts. The jurors questioned whether the  first element was ""specifically for [JS]""; they then clearly  stated that they were confused by the fact that the  second, coercive element referred to the victim by  37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1187; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1089; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***297; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****21; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 9 of 21 name, but the first element did not. Because the trial court had initially instructed the jurors  that the sex trafficking counts required a determination  of jurisdiction before a determination of guilt, the court  could have asked the jurors to clarify their purpose  before fashioning a response [****26]  (see People v  Taylor, 26 NY3d 217, 227, 22 NYS3d 140, 43 NE3d 350  [2015]; People v Lykes, 81 NY2d 767, 770, 609 NE2d  132, 593 NYS2d 779 [1993]). Indeed, it is unclear  whether the jurors sought guidance as to territorial  jurisdiction—specifically, pursuant to CPL 20.20 (1) (b),  whether defendant engaged in conduct in New York  constituting an attempt to commit the crime of sex  trafficking—or as to their consideration of defendant's  guilt. Either way, their note invoked the interplay  between the two elements. Specifically, the jurors  (correctly) recognized that the initial sex trafficking  charge linked the first and second elements but were  perplexed because the language of the first element,  alone, suggested otherwise. The  inquiry  thus  revealed  ""an  incomplete  comprehension in the minds of the jury of the elements  of the crime[ ] involved"" (People v Miller, 6 NY2d 152,  156, 160 NE2d 74, 188 NYS2d 534 [1959]). The note's  form  ""reflected  their  desire""  to  understand  the  relationship between sex trafficking's elements, and a  proper response to their request ""necessarily"" should  have reiterated the link between the two (Taylor, 26  NY3d at 225; see People v Weinberg, 83 NY2d 262,  267-268, 631 NE2d 97, 609 NYS2d 155 [1994]; People  v Steinberg, 79 NY2d 673, 684-685, 595 NE2d 845, 584  NYS2d 770 [1992]  [*1190] [both acknowledging that a  court, in its discretion, may determine that a deliberating  jury's request for information requires ""a broader  response"" than indicated by the note's text]). Instead,  the court responded that the first element was ""not  specific to anyone."" Its response effectively [****27]   decoupled the second element from the first and  removed the victim from the jury's consideration of  defendant's prostitution enterprise altogether, thereby  contradicting the court's original charge "" 'upon a vital  point' "" (People v Malloy, 55 NY2d 296, 302, 434 NE2d          237, 449 NYS2d 168 [1982], quoting People v  Gonzalez, [***300]  293 NY 259, 263, 56 NE2d 574  [1944]). CPL 310.30 directs that a court, upon a request for legal  instruction from a deliberating jury, ""give such requested  information or instruction as the court deems proper.""  The court is best suited to assess the jury's inquiry and  thus has discretion as to the ""proper scope and nature  of the response"" (Taylor, 26 NY3d at 224; see  Steinberg, 79 NY2d at 684). Its discretion, however, ""is  circumscribed . . . by the requirement that the court  respond meaningfully to the jury's request for further  instruction or information"" (Malloy, 55 NY2d at 302).   [**1092]  In considering the court's response, ""[t]he  factors to be evaluated are the form of the jury's  question, which may have to be clarified before it can be  answered, the particular issue of which inquiry is made,  the supplemental instruction actually given and the  presence or absence of prejudice to the defendant"" (id.).  A supplemental instruction that mischaracterizes the  elements of the crime for the jury to consider, thereby  prejudicing defendant, is error (see People v Brown, 87  NY2d 950, 951, 663 NE2d 1255, 641 NYS2d 225  [1996]). Under the circumstances, the [****28]  supplemental  instruction ""seriously prejudiced defendant"" (Miller, 6  NY2d at 156; see Brown, 87 NY2d at 951). A  reasonable view of the evidence, of defendant's New  York-based enterprise and his attempt to further that  enterprise by his New Jersey threats against JC,  permitted a finding that the People satisfied their  jurisdictional burden under CPL 20.20 (1). Moreover,  viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the  People (see People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620, 621, 454  NE2d 932, 467 NYS2d 349 [1983]), the jury could have  found, as the trial court did in rejecting defendant's CPL  330.30 motion, that defendant did, in fact, threaten JC  with the goal of inducing  [9] her to join his New York  prostitution  operation.  But  the  court's  truncated  supplemental instruction muddled the definition of the  crime, not only as to jurisdiction, but equally as to the  sufficiency of evidence of guilt of the crime of sex  trafficking. We therefore cannot be sure that the jury  used the proper standard  [*1191] in finding either  jurisdiction or that the People proved defendant's guilt. Moreover, the connection between defendant's New  York prostitution enterprise and his New Jersey threats  to JC was one of the main issues in the case. That issue  clearly prompted ""serious discussion"" amongst the  jurors (People v Young, 65 NY2d 103, 109, 479 NE2d  37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1189; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1091; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***299; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****25; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 10 of 21 815, 490 NYS2d 179 [1985]). In advising them that  defendant's coercive [****29]  conduct need not be  connected to his promotion of prostitution in New York,  the court essentially negated the central defense  argument that the latter was unrelated to the former.  Because it failed to reiterate the link between the  elements, the supplemental instruction undermined the  initial charge that properly explained the link between  the statutory elements ""and thereby must have [further]  confused the jury"" (id.). And ""[w]here the court's  instructions are supplemental, coming after the jury has  already once retired, they may well be determinative of  the outcome of the case, coming as they do in response  to questions raised by the jurors themselves"" (People v  Ciaccio, 47 NY2d 431, 436, 391 NE2d 1347, 418  NYS2d 371 [1979]). Indeed, the jury reached its verdict  hours after its inquiry. Ultimately, the jurors were given  an erroneous instruction which was prejudicially  misleading and confusing, risking an improper resolution  of both jurisdiction and defendant's guilt of sex  trafficking. Defendant is entitled to a new trial.  [***301]  Finally, contrary to defendant's related  contention, Supreme Court's error does not require  reversal of his remaining conviction of promoting  prostitution.  Because  the  jury  sought  guidance  regarding sex trafficking's elements only [****30]  as  they related to the named victim and expressed no  confusion  regarding  advancing  or  profiting  from  prostitution generally, ""there was no danger of prejudice  as it related to the latter count"" (People v Walston, 23  NY3d 986, 990, 991 NYS2d 24, 14 NE3d 377 [2014]). None of defendant's remaining claims has merit.  [**1093]  Wilson, J. (concurring). The fundamental question here is whether New York  has jurisdiction to prosecute a defendant for sex  trafficking without showing that the coercive conduct  used on a particular victim  [10] resulted in the  advancement of or profit from prostitution in New York.  Although the trial court initially instructed the jury  correctly as to jurisdiction and the sex trafficking crime  (Penal Law § 230.34), the court gave a materially  incorrect supplemental instruction. By divorcing Penal  Law § 230.34's prefatory clause from the remainder of  the crime, the instruction expanded jurisdiction in a  wholly indefensible way [*1192] . I thus agree with  Judge Singas's concurrence that Mr. Lamb's convictions  for sex trafficking must be vacated and a new trial  ordered. However, I understand the text and history of  the sex trafficking statute differently and would hold  that the error in the supplemental instruction is patent  and does not in any way turn on the jury's potential  confusion.  Rather,  the  instruction [****31]   was  substantively wrong and had the potential to arrogate to  New York jurisdiction over crimes over which we have  no jurisdiction. I The New York Police Department began investigating  Mr. Lamb in 2014 when Covenant House New York,  one of a network of shelters for runaway and housing- insecure young people in various states, alerted the  police to online advertising targeting Covenant House  residents for prostitution-related work in New Jersey.  The investigation concluded that Mr. Lamb had posted  thousands of online advertisements for workers and  clients for sex work on both Manhattan and New Jersey  website  subsections  between  2013  and  2015.  Throughout that time, Mr. Lamb also maintained a  website primarily focused on New York—the website  listed a Midtown address and described itself as an  ""upscale midtown agency"" offering escort services in the  Tri-State area. At some point during the investigation,  New York police discovered that he had moved to  Newark, New Jersey. After police contacted numerous  women Mr. Lamb was suspected of having recruited or  attempted to recruit, two spoke to police about their  experience with Mr. Lamb: KT and JC. The New York  police then arrested Mr. Lamb and recovered [****32]   from his Newark home numerous electronic devices  revealing  his  connection  to  his  advertisements,  websites, and emails. Mr. Lamb was indicted for two counts of sex trafficking  against JC and for promoting prostitution in the third  degree. JC was 18 years old in April of 2015 when she  responded to Mr. Lamb's advertisement. JC testified at  trial that she hoped to get a job as a caterer or party  host, but, only after meeting Mr. Lamb at his Newark   [***302] apartment realized that he was recruiting  people for sex work, in which she was not interested. At  the apartment, Mr. Lamb asked JC if he could take  pictures of her without clothes. When JC declined, Mr.  Lamb signaled that he had a gun in the couch or would  hit or otherwise hurt  [*1193] her if she did not do what  he asked. Frightened for her safety, JC allowed Mr.  Lamb to take photos of her partially undressed. Mr.      37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1191; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1092; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***300; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****28; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 11 of 21 Lamb subsequently forced JC to drink a full cup of  alcohol before she could leave. After drinking the  alcohol, she remembers very little, but arrived home  hours later. The next day Mr. Lamb began threatening  JC by email that he would reveal sexual images of her  to her father, high school, and potential colleges,  including [****33]    [**1094] in  those  messages  indications that he had her family and school addresses  and other personally identifying information he retrieved  from her person while she was unconscious in his  apartment. JC repeatedly begged Mr. Lamb to delete  the photos, even attempting to convince him at one  point that she had attempted suicide out of desperation,  and ultimately telling him that she was going to involve  the police. The other witness against Mr. Lamb at trial, KT, was 22  and living in Staten Island in June  [11] of 2013 when  she responded to an advertisement Mr. Lamb posted  and began working with him. In the Manhattan hotel  room where KT met Mr. Lamb, KT observed another  person who met with clients in a room where KT was  not present. Although KT did not witness the woman  have sex with the men, she did have a conversation  about the work with the woman. KT also testified to  delivering money she made from sex work to Mr.  Lamb's girlfriend after working jobs in Manhattan,  Brooklyn, Queens, and New Jersey. KT ultimately  began helping Mr. Lamb run the business, but later  stopped working for Mr. Lamb as a sex worker after a  client physically assaulted her. Mr. Lamb was tried by a jury in New York County  for [****34]  sex trafficking JC and for promoting  prostitution in the third degree. At the onset and close of  trial, Mr. Lamb objected to New York's jurisdiction to  prosecute him for sex trafficking JC. The court noted  the objection but ruled the jurisdictional issue a question  for the jury. At the close of trial, the court explained that,  before deciding whether the prosecution had proved a  particular charge, the jury must first establish whether  the State of New York had jurisdiction to prosecute the  crime alleged. The judge elaborated that to establish  state jurisdiction, the jury had to find, beyond a  reasonable doubt, that Mr. Lamb ""engaged in conduct in  the State of New York"" and ""that . . . conduct"" was  sufficient to establish at least one element of the crime  or an attempt to commit the crime in New York. The judge then told the jury that to find Mr. Lamb guilty  of the first sex trafficking count relating to JC, it had to  find:  [*1194]  ""One, that during the period of April 1st to  April 30th, 2015, in the County of New York Mr.  Lamb advanced or profited from prostitution. ""Two, that he did so by using force or engaging in  any scheme, plan or pattern to compel or induce  [JC] to engage in or continue to [****35]  engage in  prostitution activity by means of instilling a fear in  her that if his demand was not complied with Mr.  Lamb or another would expose a secret or publicize  an asserted fact whether true or false tending to  subject [JC] to hatred, contempt or ridicule. ""And three, that he did so intentionally."" For the second sex trafficking count, the court  instructed the jury as to identical elements to the first  count but that the jury must find, instead of coercion  through the threatened revelation of a secret,  [***303]  ""that [Mr. Lamb] did so by using force or  engaging in a scheme, plan or pattern to compel or  induce [JC] to engage in or continue to engage in  prostitution activity by means of instilling a fear in  her that if his demand was not complied with Mr.  Lamb would cause her physical injury, serious  physical injury or death."" The jury began deliberations on June 21, 2017. After the  jury submitted a request for clarification regarding the  wording of that first element, which unlike the other  elements did not specify a victim, the judge explained  that no specific victim was necessary: ""The first element  that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt is that  during the period from on/or about August [****36]  1st  to September 30, 2014 in the County of  [**1095] New  York Mr. Lamb advanced or profited from prostitution. It  is not specific to anyone."" The jury returned a verdict convicting Mr. Lamb of two  counts of sex trafficking for his conduct towards JC  and promoting prostitution in the third degree. The court  sentenced him to 6 to  [12] 18 years' incarceration for  each sex trafficking count and 2 1/3 to 7 years for the  promoting prostitution count, with the sentences to run  concurrently. Mr. Lamb appealed and the Appellate Division modified,  vacating a fee but upholding the convictions (188 AD3d  470, 135 NYS3d 97 [2020]). The Court applied the  textual interpretation of People v Giordano (87 NY2d  441, 663 NE2d 588, 640 NYS2d 432 [1995]) to reason  that the prefatory [*1195]  language of Penal Law §  230.34 (advancing or profiting from prostitution) was a  37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1193; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1093; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***302; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****32; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 12 of 21 separate element of the offense, which the People  proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, Mr. Lamb had  completed in New York (188 AD3d at 470-471).  Moreover, the Court concluded that it did not matter  ""that the threatening conduct against a particular person  occurred in New Jersey, because the statute does not  require that a defendant advance or profit from the  prostitution of the specific victim who was threatened""  (id. at 470). ""For the same reasons,"" the Court held that  ""defendant's  challenges  to  the [****37]   court's  supplemental charge on this issue in response to a jury  note are unavailing"" (id. at 471). II As an initial matter, Judge Singas's concurrence agrees  with me that Penal Law § 230.34 is comprised of two  separate but ""linked"" elements. New York has  jurisdiction to prosecute a crime when conduct occurs  within the state sufficient to constitute an element of the  crime (CPL 20.20 [1] [a]). Thus, if an element of the  crime of sex trafficking occurs within New York, New  York has jurisdiction to prosecute. To understand the  sex trafficking statute and its interplay with CPL 20.20  properly, it is imperative to consider Penal Law § 230.34  in its entirety. It reads: ""A person is guilty of sex trafficking if he or she  intentionally advances or profits from prostitution  by: ""1. unlawfully providing to a person who is  patronized, with intent to impair said person's  judgment: (a) a narcotic drug or a narcotic  preparation; (b) concentrated cannabis as defined  in paragraph (a) of subdivision four of section thirty- three hundred two of the public health law; (c)  methadone; or (d) gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB)  or flunitrazepan, also known as Rohypnol; ""2.  making  material  false  statements,  misstatements, or omissions to induce or maintain  the person being patronized to engage in or  continue to engage [****38]  in prostitution activity; ""3. withholding, destroying, or confiscating any  actual or purported passport,  [***304] immigration  document, or any other actual or purported  government  [*1196] identification document of  another person with intent to impair said person's  freedom of movement; provided, however, that this  subdivision shall not apply to an attempt to correct  a  social  security  administration  record  or  immigration agency record in accordance with any  local, state, or federal agency requirement, where  such attempt is not made for the purpose of any  express or implied threat; ""4. requiring that prostitution be performed to retire,  repay, or service a real or purported debt; ""5. using force or engaging in any scheme, plan or  pattern to compel or induce the person being  patronized to  [**1096] engage in or continue to  engage in prostitution activity by means of instilling  a fear in the  [13] person being patronized that, if  the demand is not complied with, the actor or  another will do one or more of the following: ""(a) cause physical injury, serious physical injury, or  death to a person; or ""(b) cause damage to property, other than the  property of the actor; or ""(c) engage in other conduct constituting a felony or  unlawful [****39]  imprisonment in the second  degree in violation of section 135.05 of this chapter;  or ""(d) accuse some person of a crime or cause  criminal charges or deportation proceedings to be  instituted against some person; provided, however,  that it shall be an affirmative defense to this  subdivision that the defendant reasonably believed  the threatened charge to be true and that his or her  sole purpose was to compel or induce the victim to  take reasonable action to make good the wrong  which was the subject of such threatened charge;  or ""(e) expose a secret or publicize an asserted fact,  whether true or false, tending to subject some  person to hatred, contempt or ridicule; or ""(f) testify or provide information or withhold  testimony or information with respect to another's  legal claim or defense; or  [*1197] ""(g) use or abuse his or her position as a  public servant by performing some act within or  related to his or her official duties, or by failing or  refusing to perform an official duty, in such manner  as to affect some person adversely; or ""(h) perform any other act which would not in itself  materially benefit the actor but which is calculated  to harm the person who is patronized materially  with respect to his or her health, [****40]  safety, or  37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1195; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1095; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***303; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****36; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 13 of 21 immigration status"" (Penal Law § 230.34). Because "" 'the clearest indicator of legislative intent is  the statutory text, the starting point in any case of  interpretation must always be the language itself, giving  effect to the plain meaning thereof' "" (People v Pabon,  28 NY3d 147, 152, 42 NYS3d 659, 65 NE3d 688 [2016],  quoting People v Golo, 26 NY3d 358, 361, 23 NYS3d  110, 44 NE3d 185 [2015]). That ""plain meaning must be  discerned 'without resort to forced or unnatural  interpretations' "" (Matter of Theroux v Reilly, 1 NY3d  232, 240, 803 NE2d 364, 771 NYS2d 43 [2003], quoting  Castro v United Container Mach. Group, 96 NY2d 398,  401, 761 NE2d 1014, 736 NYS2d 287 [2001]; see  McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes § 232).  The plain language of section 230.34 suggests that it is  comprised  of  two  interdependent  elements:  the  prosecution must prove (1) that the defendant  intentionally advanced or profited from prostitution, and  (2) that the defendant did so by one of the enumerated  coercive  actions.  Because  of  the  word  ""by,""   [***305] these  elements  are  necessarily  linked.  Accordingly, the advancement or profit from prostitution  can only be completed through the coercive conduct  element. Because the second element requires a  victim—a person who has been the target of the  prohibited coercion—it follows that the first element,  which can only be completed through the second, must  also be linked to that same victim. In sum, Penal Law §  230.34 has two elements that  [14] are separate but  linked: the advancement or profit from prostitution  must [****41]  be completed through the enumerated  coercive actions taken against a particular victim. Reading the statute's elements as entirely separate  would require us to permit the trial in New York of a  defendant for sex trafficking even if defendant's  coercive acts against a victim were totally unrelated to  the defendant's promotion of prostitution. Were we to  conclude that commission  [**1097] in New York of any  of the coercive acts contained in the subdivisions  numbered (1) through (5)—without regard to the  prefatory clause ""advances or profits from prostitution  by""—are  elements  sufficient  to   [*1198] confer  jurisdiction in New York, New York would, for example,  have jurisdiction over all people who ""testify . . . with  respect to another's legal claim"" (Penal Law 230.34 [5]  [f]), regardless of what that claim was about or whether  it was linked to prostitution in any way. Conversely, and  as relevant here, were we to conclude that someone  who advances or profits from prostitution in New York  could be prosecuted for sex trafficking in New York  even when the coercive acts occurred outside of New  York and had nothing to do with prostitution at all, we  would expand the reach of the sex trafficking statute in  ways that make no sense and exceed the [****42]   legislature's language and intent. We must decline to  read the statute in such an unnatural manner when the  language plainly draws a connection between the  defendant's coercive acts involving a specific victim and  the defendant's promotion of prostitution. Similarly, the People, who concede that the statute  consists of two separate but linked elements, contend  the linkage is satisfied for jurisdictional purposes when a  defendant carries out the coercive acts anywhere in  furtherance of advancing or profiting from prostitution in  New York, even if the defendant does not actually  advance or profit from prostitution in New York through  that  coercion.  The  dissent  would  follow  this  interpretation of the statute. I disagree—Penal Law  230.34 requires the defendant to have advanced or  profited from prostitution through the enumerated  coercive action. Either the intentional advancement or  profit may take place in New York or the coercion may  take place in New York, but the two must be interrelated  so that, regardless of whether the coercion or the  advancement is the element occurring in New York, the  advancement or profit must occur ""by"" coercion of ""the  person being patronized."" The ""linkage"" between  the [****43]  two elements must follow the text of the law  itself: the defendant must advance or profit from  prostitution by coercion of the victim. Accordingly,  the  supplemental  jury  instruction  improperly severed the required linkage. Judge Singas's  concurrence and I agree there as well. The prefatory  language (""intentionally advances or profits from  prostitution"") cannot, as the supplemental instruction  allowed, be wholly disassociated from the coercive  conduct or the victim of that coercion (e.g., ""using force .  . . to compel or induce the person being patronized to  engage in or continue to engage in prostitution activity"").  [*1199]  II Although Judge Singas's concurrence agrees with me  that Penal Law § 230.34 is comprised  [***306] of two  linked elements, I arrive there by the above analysis.  Judge Singas's concurrence's reliance on Giordano to  inform its statutory interpretation is misplaced. New  York's jurisdiction to prosecute the defendants in  Giordano was unquestioned because all the illicit activity  (taking bets in New York City and laying them off in  Nassau  County)  occurred  within  the  territorial  37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1197; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1096; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***304; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****40; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 14 of 21 boundaries of New York State (Giordano, 87 NY2d at  445). Giordano, thus, cannot contain any holding about  jurisdiction. Because Giordano dealt, instead, with a  question of venue, and because of the fundamental  differences [****44]  between the histories and purposes  of the gambling and sex trafficking statutes, our  interpretation of the sex trafficking crime is unaffected  by our prior construction of the promoting gambling  offense. Judge Singas's concurrence asserts that even though  Giordano  involved  venue—not  jurisdiction—  [**1098] the difference is of no moment. Our decisional  law says otherwise. Territorial jurisdiction bears a close  relationship to the inherent power of the State and the  relationship between the people subject to the  legislature's authority and the legislature (Adams v  People, 1 NY 173, 176, How. A. Cas. 365 [1848]  [quoting Chief Justice John Marshall who wrote that the  "" 'jurisdiction of (a state's) Courts is a branch of (the  state's) sovereignty' ""]; see also People v McLaughlin,  80 NY2d 466, 471, 606 NE2d 1357, 591 NYS2d 966  [1992] [discussing jurisdiction as the ""very essence of  the State's power to prosecute""]). We have in the past  explained that there are ""distinct conceptual differences  between venue and territorial jurisdiction and their  different jurisprudential purposes make it virtually  impossible to equate the two"" (McLaughlin, 80 NY2d at  471). Jurisdiction, as compared to venue, has a marked  difference ""when measured in terms of the effect on the  fundamental rights of the defendant"" (id.). Thus, when  interpreting  a  statute  for  the  purposes  of  jurisdiction, [****45]  we must tread carefully (see also  People v Kassebaum, 95 NY2d 611, 621, 744 NE2d  694, 721 NYS2d 866 [2001]). Applying Giordano to sex  trafficking, as Judge Singas's concurrence does,  grants New York jurisdiction to prosecute a defendant  who advances prostitution solely in Thailand, if that  defendant—for  completely  unrelated  reasons— withholds someone's passport in Utica or threatens to  reveal someone's secret misdeeds to the New York  Post. That consequence, standing alone, should  foreclose the idea that Giordano's holding on venue has  any genuine relevance here.  [*1200]  Although Judge Singas's concurrence is  correct that the differences between jurisdiction and  venue do not mandate interpreting identical language  differently, we have not referred to those venue  decisions as binding precedent, but merely as  ""additional support to our conclusion that defendant's  jurisdiction claim lack[ed] merit"" (id.). Thus, even if  Giordano had interpreted language identical to entire  clauses of Penal Law § 230.34, that would not dictate a  result here. Furthermore, unlike Kassebaum, in which a  prior decision had interpreted identical statutory  language at issue (compare CPL 20.20 [1] [a] [""Conduct  occurred within this state sufficient to establish: (a) An  element of such offense""], with CPL 20.40 [1] [a]  [""Conduct occurred within such county sufficient to  establish: (a) An element [****46]  of such offense""]),  there is no such prior construction of the sex trafficking  statute. The only reason to look to the gambling statute  at all is that it also contains the word ""by."" However,  attention  [***307] to the widely diverging legislative  histories and purposes that distinguish the statutes,  which Judge Singas's concurrence also misconstrues,  further reveals any reliance on Giordano to be  misplaced. Unlike the statute criminalizing gambling at issue in  Giordano or the promoting prostitution offenses that  predated and exist alongside the sex trafficking law,  Penal Law § 230.34 is not a series of additional  aggravators tacked onto a prior prohibited conduct (e.g.,  promoting prostitution). Rather, when the legislature  enacted section 230.34 (and its companion labor  trafficking statute, codified at Penal Law § 135.35), it  criminalized a new and distinct crime of human  trafficking, some but not all of which was related to  trafficking for sexual exploitation. The passage of the human trafficking legislation in  2007 marked the end of years of legislative deadlock as  the legislature  [**1099] sought to catch up with the  roughly two dozen states that had already enacted anti- trafficking laws (Targeting Human Trafficking, NY  Times, May 21, 2007 at A18). Perceiving a gap between  federal  enforcement [****47]   and  existing  state  remedies, advocates had urged the  [15] legislature to  follow the lead of other states in creating new law that  would target smaller operations that often fall out of the  federal law enforcement's focus (Remarks of Senator  Krueger, NY Senate Debate on Senate  [*1201] Bill  S5902, May 22, 2007 at 3282 [""this wasn't the kind of  issue that the federal law enforcement officials were  going after""]). The goal was to curb not just sex  trafficking but all forms of modern-day slavery  (Remarks of Senator Padovan, NY Senate Debate on  Senate Bill S5902, May 22, 2007 at 3268). The  legislature simultaneously studied, debated and adopted      37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1199; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1097; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***306; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****43; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 15 of 21 the labor and sex trafficking laws (L 2007, ch 74, §§ 2,  3). The resulting New York anti-trafficking law provided  for additional resources to the victims of trafficking,  created an interagency trafficking task force, mandated  a harsh penalty for those convicted of trafficking (as a  class B, rather than class C felony), and criminalized the  hallmarks of modern trafficking operations, i.e.,  drugging patronized people, withholding or destroying  identification and immigration documents, requiring  prostitution in service of a debt, and finally, promoting  prostitution by an array of conduct (Penal Law § 230.34  [1]-[5]; L 2007, ch 74, §§ 1, 2, 3, 11, 12). Those measures swept far [****48]  broader than the  promoting prostitution offenses that existed before the  law and that the law left unchanged. Promoting  prostitution offenses have existed with few changes  since codification in 1965 (L 1965, ch 1030, § 230).  These offenses range in degree, up to and including  Penal Law § 230.30 (promoting prostitution in the  second degree), which criminalizes the knowing  advancement of prostitution ""by compelling a person by  force or intimidation to engage in prostitution"" or  profiting by another's coercive conduct (Penal Law §  230.30 [1]), and Penal Law § 230.32 (promoting  prostitution in the first degree). That offense remains  valid with some overlap with Penal Law § 230.34,  reinforcing the separate nature of both offenses—one  criminalizes forceful promotion of prostitution while the  other targets the sex trade. In sum, the legislature did  not add aggravating circumstances to the existing  prostitution laws; it created an entirely new class of  offenses related to the crime of human trafficking,  simultaneously enacting Penal Law §§ 230.34 and  135.35. As the Introducer's Memorandum of Support  submitted alongside the legislation announces: ""This bill  creates the new crimes of sex trafficking and labor  trafficking"" (Senate Introducer's Mem  [***308] in  Support, Bill Jacket, L 2007, ch 74 at 9, 2007 NY Legis  Ann at 57 [emphasis added]).              [**1100]  [*1202]  Not only is it clear that the legislature  acted to combat human trafficking as a new and  distinct offense, but there is absolutely nothing in the  legislative history to suggest that the legislature   [16] drew any parallel to gambling, which sharply  undercuts the notion that our decision in Giordano has  anything to do with the proper interpretation of the  interaction of Penal Law § 230.34 and CPL 20.20. . In  Giordano, we interpreted Penal Law § 225.10, which  reads: ""A person is guilty of promoting gambling in the  first degree when he knowingly advances or profits form  unlawful  gambling  activity  by:  1.  Engaging  in  bookmaking.""  We  found  the  prefatory  language  (""knowingly  advances  or  profits  from  unlawful  gambling"") to be a separate element from the conduct  described after the word ""by"" (Giordano, 87 NY2d at  448). Our holding, however, relied on our understanding  of the gambling statute as a typical one  [*1203] in                                     37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1201; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1099; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***307; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****47; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 16 of 21 which core conduct (promotion of gambling) is  prohibited, and the several identified aggravators  impose increasingly severe penalties. We carefully  noted that the prefatory language encompassed the  ""core crime"" at issue, whereas the aggravating conduct  simply increased the defendant's ""liability . . . to the  felony level because he engaged in bookmaking as a  business"" [****50]  (id.). The sex trafficking statute has  no such core conduct and aggravators: it is a single  offense—sex trafficking—which can be committed by  dozens of specifically enumerated  [***309] coercive  acts typically used by traffickers. The parallel to the gambling statute is not the sex  trafficking statute, but Penal Law § 230.15, which  establishes promotion of prostitution as the core crime,  with aggravators contained in Penal Law §§ 230.19,  230.20, 230.25, 230.30, 230.32 and 230.33. Judge  Singas's  concurrence  misapplies  Giordano's  construction involving a typical set of aggravators to the  conceptually distinct crime of sex trafficking—treating it  as if it were one of the aggravating factors increasing  liability for the core crime of promoting prostitution  (Singas, J., concurring op at 1184). However, as the  history above demonstrates, the sex and labor  trafficking statutes were not designed to enact just one  more aggravator for the core promoting prostitution  offense. Indeed, labor trafficking, which is similarly  structured to Penal Law § 230.34, contained no  antecedent in the Penal Law and so could not constitute  additional aggravating  [17] conduct. The result of those  diverging histories and purposes means any reliance on  the gambling statute has no bearing on the proper  interpretation of  [**1101] Penal Law § 230.34, the  purpose of which [****51]  was to criminalize sex  trafficking, which occurs only when prostitution is  advanced or promoted by one of the specific  trafficking-related actions the legislature enumerated. III In sum, I believe Giordano does not bear on the proper  interpretation of Penal Law § 230.34. The text and  history—particularly when read in the context of CPL  20.20 and long-standing notions of the territorial  jurisdiction of States, compel the conclusion that New  York's  jurisdiction  over  sex  trafficking  is  not  established unless either (a) ""advanc[ing] or profit[ing]  from prostitution"" in New York is accomplished by one of  the coercive conducts the statute itemizes; or (b)  ""advanc[ing] or profit[ing] from prostitution"" outside of  New York is accomplished by one of the coercive  conducts committed in New  [*1204] York. Applying that  reading to the trial court's supplemental instruction, I  conclude, and Judge Singas's concurrence agrees, that  the court improperly severed the link required for the  assertion of jurisdiction (Singas, J., concurring op at  1190-1191).  Unlike  Judge  Singas's  concurrence,  however, I do not agree that the response failed the  requirements of CPL 310.30. The response was  ""meaningful""—it addressed the jury's question with a  resolute and clear answer. The jury asked whether the  advancing or promoting [****52]  of prostitution must  relate to coercive acts against a specific person, which  is the question the court answered. That answer was  meaningful, but wrong. IV Ultimately, Judge Singas's concurrence's construction of  the sex trafficking statute would leave the next court to  try Mr. Lamb and others accused of violating Penal Law  § 230.34 with no real guidance. Judge Singas's  concurrence's emphasis on the jury's request for an  instruction and its understandable confusion is, in my  view, wholly irrelevant to whether the instruction is  legally incorrect and material. By focusing on the jury's  concerns and the meaningfulness of the response,  Judge Singas's concurrence obscures its jurisdictional  holding and interpretation of Penal Law § 230.34. That  lack of clarity is untenable for a law which, by Judge  Singas's concurrence's observation, addresses conduct  that is likely to occur across state lines and therefore  pose recurring jurisdictional questions. To be clear, New  York can prosecute sex trafficking when prostitution in  New York is advanced or profited from by subjecting  victims to any of the statutorily enumerated coercive  acts regardless of the location of those acts, and New  York can prosecute sex trafficking when prostitution  outside  of  New  York  is  advanced  or  profited [****53]  [***310]  from by subjecting persons in  New York to any of the statutorily enumerated coercive  acts. But New York cannot prosecute as sex trafficking  conduct that exists wholly without its borders or where  the out-of-state coercive conduct against a trafficked  person does not lead to the advancement of or profit  from prostitution in New York. As I see it, that rule is  soundly based in Penal Law § 230.34 and is  straightforward, easily administrable, and honors the  legislature's objective in creating a distinct set of  trafficking offenses. Dissent by: FAHEY  37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1203; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1100; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***308; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****49; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 17 of 21 Fahey, J. (dissenting in part). Defendant presents two issues to this Court related to  the People's jurisdiction to prosecute  [*1205] him for  sex trafficking in New York. The first is whether the  People proved, by legally sufficient evidence, that New  York had geographical jurisdiction over that offense  pursuant to CPL 20.20. The second is whether the trial  court's supplemental instruction to the jury in response  to a jury note, which inquiry related to the jurisdictional  issue in dispute in the case, was erroneous and requires  a new trial. The majority's writing does not clearly decide the first  issue, but the Court remits  [**1102] for a new trial and  does not dismiss the sex trafficking counts of [****54]   the indictment on which defendant was convicted. This  means that the Court has concluded that the evidence  presented was legally sufficient to establish geographic  jurisdiction. In that regard, I agree. However, the majority's conclusion that the trial court's  supplemental instruction, in response to the jury's note  regarding the elements of sex trafficking, was  erroneous cannot be reconciled with the majority's  implicit conclusion that New York had jurisdiction to  prosecute defendant for sex  [18] trafficking. This is a  clear contradiction. The Court's decision leaves trial  courts with no direction as to how to define the elements  of sex trafficking for deliberating juries. I respectfully dissent. I would affirm the Appellate  Division order in all respects. I. The two sex trafficking counts at issue on this appeal  relate to defendant's conduct toward a single victim. JC  was an 18-year-old high school student when she met  with defendant on the understanding that he was  seeking a hostess for private catering events. When JC  realized that the job was actually prostitution and tried to  leave defendant's New Jersey apartment, he told her he  had a gun and would shoot her or hit her if she did  not [****55]  allow him to photograph her nude. She  complied, and defendant also took nude photographs of  her when she was unconscious from consuming alcohol  that defendant had coerced her into drinking. When JC  thereafter refused to engage in prostitution for  defendant,  he  threatened  to  send  these  nude     photographs to her friends and family and to post them  on the Internet. Defendant also informed JC that he  knew all of her personal information, including her  address  [*1206] and high school. He further threatened  that he or his ""goon squad"" would physically harm her if  she did not comply. On this appeal, defendant does not contest the legal  sufficiency of the People's evidence that he engaged in  this conduct. Indeed, the People presented evidence  that the nude photographs of JC were found on  defendant's phone, and they introduced the email  exchanges between JC and defendant, which contained  defendant's threats, into evidence. Rather, defendant   [***311] contends on this appeal only that the People  did not prove by legally sufficient evidence that New  York had jurisdiction to prosecute him for sex  trafficking because all of the interactions he had with  JC, including their in-person encounter and their email  exchanges,  [****56] took place when both he and JC  were in New Jersey. Defendant does not dispute that he  had an extensive prostitution operation in New York. He  asserts, however, that for New York to have jurisdiction  to prosecute him for sex trafficking JC, he must have  coerced or threatened JC in New York, or the People  must have demonstrated that he was ""recruiting"" JC to  work as a prostitute in New York. II. Penal Law § 230.34, which criminalizes sex trafficking,  provides that a defendant is guilty of sex trafficking ""if  he or she intentionally advances or profits from  prostitution by"" . . . engaging in certain aggravating  conduct.  . Defendant was  [**1103] charged pursuant                  37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1204; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1101; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***310; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****53; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 18 of 21 to  [19]  [20] Penal Law § 230.34 (5) (a) and (e) on  the [*1207]  two counts of  [***312] sex trafficking  pertaining to JC. Accordingly, those two counts required  the People to prove: (1) that defendant intentionally  advanced or profited from prostitution by using force or  engaging in any scheme, plan or pattern to compel or                                              induce JC to engage in or continue to engage in  prostitution activity by means of instilling a fear in JC  that, if the demand were not complied with, defendant or  another would cause physical injury, serious physical  injury, or death to a person (see Penal Law § 230.34 [5]  [a]);  and  (2)  that  defendant  intentionally  advanced [****57]  or profited from prostitution by using  force or engaging in any scheme, plan or pattern to  compel or [*1208]  induce JC to engage in or continue  to engage in prostitution activity by means of instilling a  fear in JC that, if the demand were not complied with,  defendant or another would expose a secret or publicize  an asserted fact, whether true or false, tending to  subject some person to hatred, contempt or ridicule (see  Penal Law § 230.34 [5] [e]). Defendant contended during trial, as he does on appeal,  that the ""coercive threats"" required under subdivision (5)  of the statute had to take place in New York for New  York to have jurisdiction to prosecute him  [**1104] for  sex trafficking. In other words, defendant contends that  it was not enough for him to ""intentionally advance[ ] or  profit[ ] from prostitution"" in New York and then engage  in the coercive threats required by subdivision (5) in  New Jersey, even if the coercive threats furthered his  overall cross-border prostitution enterprise. The crux of  defendant's argument depends on our interpretation of  the use of the word ""by"" in the statute. We interpreted a nearly identical statutory scheme in  People v Giordano (87 NY2d 441, 663 NE2d 588, 640  NYS2d 432 [1995]). Although the issue in Giordano was  venue pursuant to CPL 20.40, not jurisdiction pursuant  to CPL 20.20, the relevant analysis in Giordano  was [****58]  its statutory interpretation. Giordano  interpreted the statute criminalizing promoting gambling  in the first degree (see Penal Law § 225.10). Similar to  Penal Law § 230.34, that statute provides that a  defendant is guilty of promoting gambling in the first  degree when the defendant ""knowingly advances or  profits from unlawful gambling activity by"" . . . engaging  in certain aggravating conduct (Penal Law § 225.10).  The statute then contains a list of aggravating conduct  that elevates the defendant's crime to promoting  gambling in the first degree, including, as relevant in  Giordano, engaging in bookmaking to a defined extent  (see id. § 225.10 [1]). The defendants in Giordano argued that venue should  have been in New York County, rather than Nassau  County, because although they engaged in some  gambling activity in Nassau County by ""hedging"" or  ""laying off"" bets there, their overall gambling operation,  37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1206; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1103; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***311; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****56; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 19 of 21 including their bookmaking, occurred in New York  County. In other words, the defendants in Giordano  contended, as defendant does here, that the use of the  word ""by"" in the statute required them to engage in both  the ""core"" crime and its ""aggravating"" element in the  same place (see Giordano, 87 NY2d at 445-446). This Court rejected that argument. It held that  ""advancing or profiting from unlawful gambling activity is  a separate [****59]  element  [*1209] of promoting  gambling in the first degree and, if established by the  evidence, could support jurisdiction in Nassau County""  (id. at 446). The Court explained its interpretation of  Penal Law § 225.10: ""The opening paragraph and subdivision (1)  describe different conduct; the use of the word 'by'  in the statute to define  [***313] how the enhanced  liability obtains does not, as defendant maintains,  collapse two elements into one. One 'advances  gambling' activity by engaging in any conduct which  materially aids a gambling operation (Penal Law §§  225.05, 225.00 [4]), in this case by hedging bets. . .  . ""To read Penal Law § 225.10 (1) as a one element  crime,  'advancing  unlawful  gambling  by  bookmaking', would make the statute redundant  and render the language in the opening paragraph  surplusage. That paragraph holds defendant guilty  of  promoting  gambling  when  he  'advances  gambling activity', but 'bookmaking' is defined as  'advancing gambling activity by unlawfully accepting  bets' as a business (see, Penal Law § 225.00 [9]).  Accordingly, the statute would have no different  meaning if the opening language were excised from  it as defendants would do. Under well-established  principles of interpretation, effect and meaning  should be given to the entire statute and 'every part  and word thereof' (Sanders v Winship, 57 NY2d  391, 396, 442 NE2d 1231, 456 NYS2d 720). We  should assume [****60]  the Legislature had a  purpose when it used the phrase 'advances or  profits from unlawful gambling activity' in the first   [**1105] paragraph and avoid a construction which  makes the words superfluous (see, Matter of  Branford House v Michetti, 81 NY2d 681, 688, 623  NE2d 11, 603 NYS2d 290). These rules of statutory  construction lead us to conclude that the opening  language of the statute and that of subdivision (1)  address two distinct types of conduct, and must  therefore be two elements of the crime. . . . ""Thus, we conclude that conduct advancing  gambling activity and engaging in a bookmaking  business are two separate elements. If conduct  establishing one of these two elements occurred in  Nassau  [21] County, that County had jurisdiction to   [*1210] prosecute defendants for the whole crime.""  (Giordano, 87 NY2d at 447-448.) The Giordano Court's interpretation of Penal Law §  225.10, a statute that is identical both in structure and  its use of the word ""by"" to Penal Law § 230.34, applies  equally here. The crime of sex trafficking as charged in  Penal Law § 230.34 (5) contains at least two elements,  the first that defendant intentionally advanced or profited  from prostitution, and the second that defendant  engaged in the coercive threats enumerated in   [**1106] subdivision (5). Pursuant to CPL 20.20 (1) (a), if defendant engaged in  conduct sufficient to establish one element of the  offense in New York, New York has jurisdiction to  prosecute [****61]  the offense. Defendant does not  dispute that he intentionally advanced or profited from  prostitution in New York, and the People presented  ample evidence of that during trial. Defendant's  contention that he must also commit the aggravating  conduct in New York would collapse these two elements  of the sex trafficking statute into one, contradicting this  Court's reasoning in Giordano and the legislature's  presumed intent (see Giordano, 87 NY2d at 447-448).  Defendant was not required to engage in coercive  threats in New York, so long as he intentionally  advanced or profited from prostitution in New York (see  id.). The People proved, by legally sufficient evidence,  that defendant intentionally advanced or profited from  prostitution in New York, and they therefore provided  legally sufficient evidence of New York's jurisdiction to  prosecute defendant for sex trafficking. The Court does not dismiss those two counts of  indictment charging defendant with the sex trafficking  of JC, and instead  [***314] grants defendant a new trial  on those counts. I assume this means that my  colleagues have concluded that the People presented  legally sufficient evidence of New York's jurisdiction to  prosecute defendant for sex trafficking (see CPL  470.40 [1]; 470.20 [2]). Yet the [****62]  majority does  not expressly state that the People proved jurisdiction  by legally sufficient evidence in this case, rather stating  only that defendant's ""remaining claims are either  rendered academic by our decision or without merit""  (majority mem at 1175). To the extent that the Court has  rejected defendant's legal sufficiency argument, I agree  37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1208; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1104; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***312; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****58; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 20 of 21 with that result. But because the Court's implicit  conclusion that the People proved jurisdiction by legally  sufficient evidence is in irreconcilable conflict with its  stated conclusion that the trial court erred in responding  to the jury's note, I must respectfully dissent.  [*1211]  III. The trial court initially instructed the jury on the elements  of sex trafficking by reading the New York Criminal  Jury Instructions (CJI) charge. That charge includes the  instruction that defendant is guilty of sex trafficking if  he advanced or profited from prostitution, and ""did so  by"" engaging in the coercive threats enumerated in  subdivision (5) (see CJI2d[NY] Penal Law § 230.34 [5]).  That CJI instruction tracks the language of the statute  and describes these as separate elements, consistent  with the jurisdictional analysis discussed above. During deliberations, the jury sent a note asking whether  the first element of sex [****63]  trafficking, i.e., that  defendant intentionally advanced or profited from  prostitution, must relate to a specific victim. After the  court informed counsel that it planned to instruct the jury  that this element was not specific to any victim,  defendant objected on the same basis as the defense's  ""global objection"" to  [22] ""jurisdiction."" The court  instructed the jury that ""[t]he first element that must be  proven beyond a reasonable doubt is that during the  period from on/or about August 1st to September 30,  2014 in the County of New York Mr. Lamb advanced or  profited from prostitution. It is not specific to anyone."" The  majority  concludes  that  this  supplemental  instruction to the jury requires reversal and a new trial  on  the  sex  trafficking  counts  because  that  supplemental instruction ""erroneously severed the  required link"" between the two elements of sex  trafficking (majority mem at 1175). I disagree. The supplemental instruction did no such  thing. Rather, the court merely informed the jurors that  the element requiring defendant to advance or profit  from prostitution in New York did not pertain to any  specific victim, which is consistent with the interpretation        of Penal Law § 230.34 (5) the majority implicitly  adopts [****64]   by  rejecting  defendant's  legal  sufficiency contention. The trial court did not instruct the  jury that defendant's coercive threats need not further  defendant's overall prostitution enterprise, or otherwise  need  not  have  any  connection  whatsoever  to  defendant's  cross-border  prostitution   [*1212] enterprise. It was certainly clear to the jury from  the evidence presented at trial that defendant's  prostitution enterprise crossed borders. The court's  response to the note therefore did not sever the link  between the two elements that the Court concludes is  required.  [***315]  Furthermore, the majority's conclusion that the  supplemental jury instruction was improper cannot be  squared with its implicit conclusion that the People  proved jurisdiction in New York by legally sufficient  evidence. As explained, the Court's implicit conclusion  that the evidence was legally sufficient to establish New  York's jurisdiction to prosecute defendant for sex  trafficking necessarily depends on the conclusion that  so long as defendant advanced or profited from  prostitution in New York, his coercive threats to JC  could occur outside New York. Yet by holding that the  supplemental jury instruction was erroneous, the Court  necessarily [****65]  concludes that the first element of  advancing or profiting from prostitution did need to  pertain to a specific victim, and defendant's conduct of  advancing or profiting from prostitution in New York as  evidenced by his overall prostitution scheme was  insufficient. Notably, defendant never asked the trial  court to seek clarification from the jury about its note,  instead understanding the note to relate to the issue of  jurisdiction that the parties had been litigating. In my view, the jurisdictional analysis and the propriety  of the court's supplemental instruction are inextricably  linked. There are two potential ways for the Court to  interpret Penal Law § 230.34 (5): (1) a defendant  commits sex trafficking in New York for purposes of  CPL 20.20 if the defendant advances or profits from  prostitution  [**1107] in New York, even if the coercive  threats required by subdivision (5) occur outside New  York, so long as there is some evidence that the  coercive threats furthered the defendant's overall  prostitution scheme; or (2) as defendant suggests, sex  trafficking pursuant to Penal Law § 230.34 (5) is a one- element crime that requires the defendant to advance or  profit from prostitution by engaging in coercive threats  directed toward a specific victim in New York— the [****66]  defendant may not advance or profit from  prostitution in New York generally and then attempt to  37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1210; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1106; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***314; 2021 N.Y. LEXIS 2576, ****62; 2021  NY Slip Op 07057, *****07057 Page 21 of 21 coerce someone into engaging in prostitution outside  New York, even if it is in  [23] furtherance of the  defendant's overall enterprise. Inasmuch as the first  option is consistent with this Court's reasoning in  Giordano and the jurisdictional requirements of CPL  20.20, I believe it is the correct approach. If it is, then  the trial court's  [*1213] supplemental jury instruction  was entirely proper. We must interpret Penal Law §  230.34 the same way when we are evaluating its  elements for jurisdictional purposes as we do when we  are evaluating its elements for purposes of establishing  guilt. IV. If the trial court receives a substantially similar inquiry  from a deliberating jury upon retrial, how should it  respond? The majority does not say, and trial courts will  be unable to discern what this Court is requiring of them  in future sex trafficking cases. The Judges concurring  in the majority memorandum have conflicting views of  the proper interpretation of Penal Law § 230.34 (see  Wilson, J., concurring op; of Singas, J., concurring op).  The Court is inexplicably confused about what should  be, in my view, a relatively straightforward matter. Must the defendant [****67]  engage in coercive threats  in New York, or is it sufficient that the defendant  advances or profits from prostitution in New York? Must  the defendant advance or profit from prostitution only by  engaging in coercive threats in New York directed  toward a specific victim, or is it sufficient that the  coercive threats toward the victim, although they occur  out of state, further the defendant's overall prostitution  enterprise? Answers to these questions await further  clarification from this Court. In the meantime, lower   [***316] courts unfortunately must attempt to decipher  the Court's perplexing ruling. Chief Judge DiFiore and Judges Rivera, Garcia, Wilson,  Singas and Cannataro concur, Judge Singas in a  concurring opinion, in which Chief Judge DiFiore and  Judge Cannataro concur, and Judge Wilson in a  separate concurring opinion, in which Judges Rivera  and Garcia concur. Judge Fahey dissents in part and  votes to affirm in an opinion. Order modified by vacating defendant's convictions for  sex trafficking and ordering a new trial on those counts  and, as so modified, affirmed, in a memorandum.  37 N.Y.3d 1174, *1212; 182 N.E.3d 1080, **1107; 162 N.Y.S.3d 288, ***315; 2021 N.Y.

"People v. Mahjoob, 2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2073","Page 2 of 17 INTRODUCTION Codefendants Mahrad Mahjoob and Jason Tapia were tried together before separate juries. They appeal from  judgments entered after their juries convicted them of human trafficking of a minor, in violation of Penal Code  section 236.1, subdivision (c)(1). Mahjoob asserts instructional error on the elements of human trafficking and  insufficient evidence to support his conviction. Tapia asserts he was convicted of an offense with which he was not  charged, the trial court erred in refusing to instruct his jury with the more inclusive instruction for circumstantial  evidence, and the prosecutor committed [*2]  misconduct. We affirm both judgments. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND A. The Information The information charged Mahjoob with a single count of human trafficking of a minor for a commercial sex act (§  236.1(c)(1)) with intent to violate section 266i, the pandering statute. The information charged Tapia with a single count of human trafficking of a minor for a commercial sex act with  intent to violate section 266h, the pimping statute. In addition, the information alleged Tapia had a serious or violent  felony conviction within the meaning of the three strikes law (§§ 667, subds. (b)-(j), 1170.12) and served a prior  prison term within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). Mahjoob and Tapia pleaded not guilty to the charges. B. The Prosecution's Case Mahjoob and Tapia were tried together before separate juries. The People's witnesses included Cloey, Ahmad  Khan, the forensic nurse who examined Cloey, and police officers and detectives who responded to or interviewed  witnesses after the incident with Khan, which took place overnight between May 13 and May 14, 2017. The police  officers and detectives also provided expert testimony about commercial sex work. The trial court admitted into  evidence complete or excerpted audio recordings and transcripts of field or station interviews [*3]  with Cloey, Khan  and Mahjoob, as well as the audio recording and transcript of a conversation between Tapia, Mahjoob and Officer  Torres, who was undercover, posing as a sex worker, the night of the incident. 1. Background Cloey was 15 years old when she ran away from home on May 6, 2017, and went to stay with her friend. She  began using methamphetamine at 15 but had been sober for a few months before May 2017. At her friend's home  and on her friend's phone, Cloey used a messenger application, Kik. Mahjoob, who called himself Mike, contacted Cloey through Kik. Cloey said she was 16 years old, and Mahjoob  said he was in his thirties. Cloey explained to Mahjoob that she was trying not to use drugs anymore. Mahjoob told          2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2073, *1 Page 3 of 17 Cloey he could pick her up and let her stay at his home, and Cloey gave Mahjoob her friend's address. Mahjoob  picked up Cloey, and while in the car, Cloey smoked methamphetamine that Mahjoob gave her. They arrived at an apartment that belonged to Mahjoob's friend Crystal. Cloey was high from smoking  methamphetamine in the car. Mahjoob told Cloey she could take a shower. While Cloey was showering, Mahjoob  entered the shower and had sex with Cloey. Cloey testified she had a choice [*4]  to say no but did not do so  because she felt obligated to have sex with Mahjoob because he was providing her with a place to stay, and she  thought she would not be able to stay if she did not have sex with him. After Cloey got out of the shower, she met Crystal, who was surprised Cloey was there and began yelling. Cloey  offered to leave, but Crystal told her to come downstairs, where Mahjoob, Crystal, and Cloey smoked  methamphetamine and talked. The next morning, Crystal wanted Mahjoob and Cloey to leave her home, so she  took them to the train station. Cloey and Mahjoob took the train and bus to Burbank. At the North Hollywood station of the Metro Orange Line,  Mahjoob and Cloey ran into Ahmad Khan, also known as ""Pops."" Khan had known Mahjoob for five or six months.  Khan had paid Mahjoob for sex with two women in the past. Cloey was the third woman that Mahjoob introduced to  Khan. After Khan spoke with Mahjoob, Khan thought Mahjoob was pimping Cloey, and Khan agreed to have Cloey  be brought to his room. Mahjoob and Cloey went to the home of Mahjoob's friend Hamlet. Cloey met Tapia there, and they all smoked  methamphetamine. Cloey stayed at Hamlet's house for several days and used methamphetamine [*5]  during her  stay. Cloey told Tapia she no longer wanted to stay at Hamlet's home. So, they left and ran into Mahjoob at a  convenience store, where he bought food for them. Then, they all went to Mahjoob's motel room. Within five  minutes of arriving, Mahjoob made a phone call. After the call, Mahjoob and Tapia talked amongst themselves, but  Cloey was not paying attention to them. After about 10 minutes, they all left to go to Khan's motel room. Mahjoob and Tapia went to the Starlight Motel to take Cloey to Khan's room. Mahjoob wanted Khan to pay $150 for  Cloey. But Khan thought it was too much and gave Mahjoob $60 or $80 upfront. Mahjoob and Tapia left Cloey  alone with Khan. After Mahjoob and Tapia left the room, the motel manager kicked them off the property. Khan told  Cloey that he wanted to have sex with her, which made her feel uncomfortable. Cloey did cocaine, and after  speaking for less than an hour, Cloey told Khan her ride was there, and she had to leave. When Khan complained  to Cloey that they had not done anything yet, Cloey promised to return the next day. Khan gave Cloey a cell phone,  which Cloey explained, ""[H]e just wanted to hit me up for business later,"" meaning to have [*6]  sex. While Cloey was with Khan, Mahjoob and Tapia were waiting on the sidewalk near the motel. Officer Torres was  working undercover as a sex worker nearby, and Mahjoob and Tapia approached her. The audio recording of their  conversation was played for the jury and admitted into evidence. When the officer asked, ""What's up?"" Tapia  responded, ""Working."" They continued talking. Tapia explained, ""He [Mahjoob] got a [sic] Arabian uncle in there.  We got money. We got our homegirl in there but she ain't trying to be in there."" Officer Torres asked where the  ""homegirl"" was, and Tapia responded at the Starlight Motel. Officer Torres inquired further about their ""homegirl""  ""working,"" and Tapia responded, ""She is trying. I'm trying to lace her up on the game, you know what I mean, but . .  . it is what it is."" When Officer Torres commented that it was ""slow in the street still,"" Tapia asked Mahjoob to call  Khan to see if ""he needs more company . . . ."" Mahjoob went to make a phone call. Tapia continued speaking with  Officer Torres: ""I got the homegirl in there working! Trying, shit, but she, she wasn't feeling it, or whatever. She just  said she wasn't feeling it from the beginning."" Tapia continued, [*7]  ""I told her look, go in there and, you know, you  not feeling it, whatever . . . . Breaking her in, breaking her in . . . ."" Officer Torres asked, ""She not having it?"", and  Tapia responded, ""Yeah. This is her first time."" Mahjoob and Tapia walked away from the officer, got into a car and drove behind the Starlight Motel. Cloey,  Mahjoob and Tapia eventually left the motel, got into a car, and were pulled over by the police.   2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2073, *3 Page 4 of 17 2. Cloey's testimony Cloey testified about how she met Mahjoob and how they spent the first few days after he picked her up. Cloey  testified that while at Crystal's house, Mahjoob had sex with her in the shower and that she ""let him"" because she  felt obligated ""in a way."" Cloey explained that she had smoked methamphetamine at Crystal's house as well as  Hamlet's house and that Mahjoob had supplied the drugs to her. After leaving Hamlet's, Cloey, Mahjoob and Tapia went to Mahjoob's motel room. Cloey testified Mahjoob made a  phone call when they got to his motel room. Mahjoob and Tapia talked amongst themselves after the phone call;  Cloey ""wasn't paying attention"" to what they talked about. Finally, a rideshare vehicle, which Cloey believed was  arranged by Khan, arrived [*8]  to pick up Mahjoob, Tapia and Cloey to go to Khan's motel room. Cloey was still  high from smoking methamphetamine. When they arrived at the Starlight Motel, Mahjoob and Tapia took Cloey ""straight to [Khan's] room."" Cloey recalled  some discussion about money but could not remember any conversation details. After refreshing her recollection  with the transcript from her interview with Detective Pinner, Cloey confirmed Khan gave Mahjoob and Tapia $80.  Mahjoob and Tapia then left the room. Once alone with Khan, Khan told Cloey he wanted to have sex with her,  which made her feel ""uncomfortable."" She asked Khan to call Mahjoob and Tapia to pick her up. Khan made the  call and, during the call, complained that Cloey would not have sex with him. Cloey thought Khan seemed upset. The People played clips from Cloey's interviews with Detective Pinner. She explained that her statement during the  interview that ""it's like I didn't know, until now, what they were actually doing . . . probably because of the drugs,""  meant that ""at first I didn't . . . know that they would have wanted me to go there and have sex with him, but at the  time [of the interview] I realized."" On cross-examination, when asked whether [*9]  she felt as though she was being sold for sex services when she  met with Khan the first time, Cloey said no. When she was asked whether there was a plan of what was supposed  to happen once she went to see Khan, Cloey responded no. But Cloey testified that she had a conversation with  Mahjoob and Tapia about going to Khan's room and getting money and a phone. When asked whether ""this whole  thing was a plan for the three of you to re-up"" and ""to get a phone,"" Cloey said yes. Cloey also did not know that  Mahjoob and Tapia had ""made a deal with [Khan] for $150 to have sex with [her]."" Cloey also testified that she never asked Mahjoob or Tapia to take her home during the entire stay, that they never  told her she could not leave or call home and that she stayed with them because she wanted to be there. Audio clips of Cloey's field and station interviews were played for the jury. In the excerpts of Cloey's interview with  Detective Pinner and a female officer, Cloey said the defendants dropped her off at Khan's room. Cloey said that  Khan wanted to have sex, but she told him no. The female officer asked, ""These two guys are pimping you out.  Right? They want you to have sex. Right? Yes?"" Cloey [*10]  responded, ""Yeah."" In response to the question, ""So,  you've had sex for them before?"" Cloey said, ""I guess I have."" The female officer asked, ""But they've told you to go  have sex with guys in motel rooms in exchange for drugs and sex—for money."" Cloey responded, ""The other time,  yeah."" Cloey's recollection of how many times she had had sex and with whom over the last several weeks was  hazy, but she recalled having sex with Mahjoob once ""like last week."" Cloey explained she ended up in Khan's room that night because of ""[t]he guys, they, their plan."" Cloey said,  ""[T]hey wanted to re-up,"" and they were interested in getting money and drugs. Cloey explained that Khan had  given her drugs in an envelope and a phone. Khan gave her a phone because ""he just wanted to hit me up for  business later."" The female officer asked, ""So you can go visit him again? But for sex, right?"" Cloey responded,  ""Yeah.""   2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2073, *7 Page 5 of 17 Detectives interviewed Cloey again at the station. The transcript noted Cloey was mumbling and speaking  inaudibly. Cloey had been sleeping, and the detectives observed she had been more talkative in the field. At the  station, Cloey thought she had been with Mahjoob and Tapia for ""like two weeks."" [*11]  Cloey initially denied  having sex with Mahjoob or Tapia but later said she had sex with Mahjoob once. Cloey denied she had been  dropped off at the Starlight Motel for a ""sex date"" and described it as ""like business, like I was supposed to go there  and I was supposed to get the phone and the drugs and stuff."" Khan wore a t-shirt and shorts. Cloey confirmed they  did not have sex but that when she was leaving, Khan gave her a ""little"" kiss on her lips. Cloey said Mahjoob and  Tapia did not tell her they wanted her to have sex with Khan. 3. Khan's testimony Khan was granted immunity from prosecution in connection with the incident. Khan testified that he first saw  Mahjoob and Cloey at an Orange Line metro station. Mahjoob asked Khan if he wanted Cloey sexually, and Khan  responded yes. Khan was under the impression that Mahjoob was ""in control of Cloey"" and that Mahjoob ""had her  to offer"" ""to whoever would pay."" Khan arranged for Mahjoob to bring Cloey to Khan's motel room, and they  discussed payment. Mahjoob brought Cloey to Khan's motel room. Although Khan usually paid after sexual services have been  performed, he paid Mahjoob $60 upfront because he wanted the money for a motel room for Cloey. [*12]  Once  Mahjoob left, Cloey began to cry. Khan realized she was young and asked what her age was. Cloey told Khan she  was ""working to get a room."" Based on his experience with commercial sex workers, he understood working to  mean ""doing sexual favors for money."" Based on his experience with drugs, he thought Cloey was under the  influence of drugs. Khan testified he did not recall getting a call from anyone while Cloey was in the room with him. Two excerpts of officer interviews with Khan were played for the jury and admitted into evidence. Khan had met  Mahjoob through a friend about six months earlier. Khan saw Mahjoob and Cloey at the Orange Line metro station.  Mahjoob asked Khan if he liked Cloey and told Khan he ""could have her."" Khan interpreted this to mean ""he was  pimping her."" Mahjoob did not ""name a price."" Khan attended his mother's funeral that day. When he got back to his motel room, Mahjoob called him to let Khan  know he was nearby. Khan told Mahjoob, ""I'm not gonna go to your room with you there to do anything,"" and asked  Mahjoob to come to his room. Mahjoob showed up with Cloey, and Khan and Mahjoob discussed payment.  Mahjoob wanted to be paid up front, but Khan wanted to [*13]  pay afterward. Mahjoob said it would cost $150 for  sex with Cloey, and Khan responded that was too much. Khan wanted to speak with Cloey directly to ""make a  different deal."" Khan described Cloey as ""innocent,"" ""scared,"" and ""high on something."" Although Cloey told him  she was 18 years old, Khan thought she looked ""like 16 or 17."" Cloey wanted to leave, and Khan said, ""But we  have not done anything."" (Emphasis in original.) Cloey said, ""But how about if I promise to come tomorrow,"" and  Khan agreed. It is unclear from the interview if Cloey called a rideshare service or if Khan called Mahjoob and asked him to send  a cab for Cloey. Khan thought Mahjoob was trying to ""rescu[e] [Cloey] from the Armenian guy."" But when the officer  asked how Mahjoob could be rescuing her if he's trying to sell her to Khan for sex, Khan responded, ""Yeah, yeah,  he's pimp, he's trying to become a pimp. He's not pimp, he's a doper, he's a doper."" Khan said, ""This is the fourth  time he's offered [a white girl]."" 4. Forensic nurse Jessica Bain's testimony Bain, a forensic nurse examiner, specializing in treating sexual assault victims, examined Cloey on May 14, 2017.  Bain wrote down verbatim statements made by Cloey [*14]  during the examination, including, ""Mike wanted me to  make him money and get him drugs. I went to a motel with Mike. Pops asked if I wanted to have sex, and I told him  no."" 5. Officer Torres's testimony Officer Torres testified that she had been with the Los Angeles Police Department for six years and was working as  an undercover officer in the human trafficking unit at the time of the incident. Officer Torres testified that Sepulveda  2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2073, *10 Page 6 of 17 Boulevard, where the Starlight Motel is located, was ""an area well known as a track which means it is well known  for elicit [sic] behavior, in this case prostitution . . . ."" Officer Torres testified about the meaning of Tapia's words in the context of human trafficking. She explained that  ""the game"" referred to the culture of pimping and pandering, that ""'lace up' is street vernacular for teaching  someone to work as a prostitute,"" and that ""to 'break' someone in"" meant ""introducing them to this life-style [sic] and  . . . essentially teaching them how to be a prostitute by way of doing the job."" She defined ""business"" as ""providing  dates or if it's a john . . . purchasing a sex act from a prostitute."" She said, ""working"" referred to a prostitute  looking [*15]  for a ""date"" with someone willing to pay for sexual favors. She also explained that ""company"" referred  to someone who ""wanted another date"" and that ""not feeling it"" referred to a prostitute who ""did not want to perform  what was expected."" When asked if, based on her conversation with Tapia and Mahjoob, she was ""absolutely 100  percent sure that this was referring to prostitution and nothing else,"" Officer Torres responded unequivocally, ""Yes."" 6. Detective Pinner's testimony Detective Pinner explained that pimps often used sex to groom the prostitutes. Pimps made sure the prostitutes  were dependent on them. Pimps usually took sex workers to places where prostitution was common. The  Sepulveda Corridor, where Cloey was taken, was a prime location for breaking in a commercial sex worker.  Detective Pinner said that a ""teenage white girl"" was the ""most valuable commodity in terms of a commercial sex  worker."" He also noted that it was common for the term ""sex"" never to be used when discussing commercial sex  acts, that ""johns"" were customers, and that a pimp usually got paid directly for the prostitute's sex acts. Detective Pinner also testified that words like ""business,"" ""working,"" and ""companionship"" [*16]  were used to refer  to the process of exchanging money or anything of value for a sex act. Pinner explained that a ""hustle"" was when a  woman meets with a man and does things other than sexual intercourse. Detective Pinner acknowledged that some  human trafficking terms could also mean something else in different contexts. 7. Mahjoob's interview During Detective Pinner's examination, the People played, only for Mahjoob's jury, an audio recording of Mahjoob  being questioned by Detective Pinner. Mahjoob initially said that Cloey was Tapia's friend, that he wasn't ""too sure"" about her name, and he thought Cloey  was staying at the motel or visiting a friend. Mahjoob eventually explained he met Cloey online and picked her up  because she seemed in trouble. Cloey told Mahjoob she was 18 years old, but Mahjoob thought she might be  underage based on her appearance. Mahjoob explained they went to his friend Crystal's house and then to  Burbank to another friend's house. Mahjoob denied having sex with Cloey. The detective described the doorway negotiation at Khan's motel room, which Mahjoob did not readily  acknowledge. Mahjoob said they went to Khan so Cloey could get a phone. Mahjoob said Khan ""likes, [*17]  you  know just the company of women . . . but we never discussed him having sex and that definitely wasn't like  something that . . . anything either of them would [do] . . . ."" Mahjoob said he told Cloey ""she doesn't have to do  anything she doesn't want to do, she just has to like entertain the guy you know he likes company and you, I always  knew that he likes to be around women."" Mahjoob told Cloey ""she didn't have to have any kind of sex"" with Khan,  and she could ""just . . . go talk to Pops and he's got a phone for you and if you don't want to be there you can leave  . . . ."" Mahjoob denied that Khan had told him that he wanted to have sex with Cloey. Mahjoob recounted that before going to Khan's, Tapia told Cloey what Tapia's ""baby mama"" does, which is ""lead  the guys on to believe there's something going on like that, I guess, and then you know, as soon as they bring up  some, such as you know, . . . the girl can . . . say that's she's not . . . trying to do anything like that and she can  leave."" As for Tapia's conversation with Officer Torres, Mahjoob said Tapia was being ""silly"" and not ""serious-wise"" and  was trying to ""impress her . . . ."" Mahjoob said Tapia kept asking him to call [*18]  Khan to see if Khan wanted  2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2073, *14 Page 7 of 17 ""some more company."" Mahjoob explained he did it because he ""thought [he] was helping the other lady, that, that's  what her profession is."" C. The Defense Case Mahjoob did not testify. Mahjoob played for the jury two excerpts of interviews with Cloey during her cross- examination, which were admitted into evidence. A complete transcript of Cloey's interview at the station also was  admitted into evidence. 1. Excerpts of Cloey's interviews In one excerpt of an interview with Cloey, Detective Pinner asked, ""Okay and why did you get dropped off there?  For a sex date?"" Cloey responded, ""NO."" (Emphasis in transcript.) Cloey explained, ""It was like business, like I was  supposed to go there and I was supposed to get the phone and the drugs and stuff."" She did not think she had to  do anything for it. In another excerpt of an interview with Cloey, Detective Pinner asked if Mahjoob or Tapia told her they wanted her  to have sex with Khan. Cloey said no. She described what she was doing as ""hustling"" and that this was her first  hustle. 2. Tapia's testimony Tapia testified before both juries. Tapia testified that he, Mahjoob and Cloey came up with a plan to ""hustle"" Khan.  Specifically, [*19]  Cloey would meet Khan in his room, ""play the part, take the money, the phone and drugs and  leave the room."" Her reason for leaving the room would be to smoke a cigarette. Tapia testified that Cloey brought  up not wanting to have sex with Khan, and they discussed ""[f]or her not to have sex."" On cross-examination, Tapia admitted he knew Khan was a purchaser of sex services from commercial sex  workers, Khan was trying to purchase sex services from Cloey, and a ""deal"" had been made. Tapia said that before  taking Cloey to Khan's room, he told Cloey that Khan wanted to have sex with her in exchange for money, a phone  and drugs. Tapia confirmed he believed Officer Torres was a prostitute, and while he was speaking with her, he  asked Mahjoob to call Khan to see if Khan needed more ""company."" Tapia explained he was ""just bullshitting"" with  Officer Torres. Tapia testified that ""hustle"" meant to him to ""rip[ ] off the guy who wanted to pay for sex,"" and the  ""hustle"" was to benefit himself, Mahjoob and Cloey. D. The Verdict and Sentencing Mahjoob and Tapia were convicted of violating section 236.1, subdivision (c). After Mahjoob agreed to waive 180 days of pretrial custody credit and 180 days of conduct credit, the trial  court [*20]  denied probation and sentenced Mahjoob to the low term of five years in state prison. Mahjoob timely  appealed. Tapia waived a jury trial on his prior conviction and admitted suffering the strike prior. The trial court struck the  prison prior under section 1385. The court sentenced Tapia to the low term of five years, doubled as a second  strike, and imposed a total term of imprisonment of 10 years. The court awarded Tapia 1397 days of credit (699  actual credits plus 698 conduct credits). Tapia timely appealed. DISCUSSION A. The Trial Court Did Not Err in Instructing the Jury on the Human Trafficking of a Minor Charge Against Mahjoob 1. Relevant law and standard of review Section 236.1, subdivision (c), is violated ""in two circumstances: when a person, acting with the requisite intent, (1)  induces a minor to engage in a commercial sex act; or (2) attempts to induce a minor to engage in such an act.""  (People v. Moses (2020) 10 Cal.5th 893, 902, 272 Cal. Rptr. 3d 862, 477 P.3d 579.) It provides: ""A person who  2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2073, *18 Page 8 of 17 causes, induces, or persuades, or attempts to cause, induce, or persuade, a person who is a minor at the time of  commission of the offense to engage in a commercial sex act, with the intent to effect or maintain a violation of  Section 266, 266h [the pimping statute], 266i [the pandering statute], 266j, 267, 311.1, 311.2, 311.3, 311.4, 311.5,  311.6, or 518 is guilty [*21]  of human trafficking."" (§ 236.1, subd. (c).) ""A trial court has a sua sponte duty to correctly instruct the jury on all elements of any charged offenses."" (People v.  Sta Ana (2021) 73 Cal.App.5th 44, 60, 288 Cal. Rptr. 3d 97; accord, People v. Mil (2012) 53 Cal.4th 400, 409-410,  415, 135 Cal. Rptr. 3d 339, 266 P.3d 1030 [due process violation where the trial court's charge to the jury omitted  an essential element of the crime].) But ""'[a] trial court has no sua sponte duty to revise or improve upon an  accurate statement of law without a request from counsel . . . .""' (People v. Jackson (2016) 1 Cal.5th 269, 336, 205  Cal. Rptr. 3d 386, 376 P.3d 528.) ""We review a claim of instructional error de novo. [Citation.] The challenged instruction is considered 'in the context  of the instructions as a whole and the trial record to determine whether there is a reasonable likelihood the jury  applied the instruction in an impermissible manner.'"" (People v. Rivera (2019) 7 Cal.5th 306, 326, 247 Cal. Rptr. 3d  363, 441 P.3d 359 (Rivera); see People v. Smithey (1999) 20 Cal.4th 936, 987, 86 Cal. Rptr. 2d 243, 978 P.2d  1171 [""'""[T]he correctness of jury instructions is to be determined from the entire charge of the court, not from a  consideration of parts of an instruction or from a particular instruction.""'""].) ""'""Instructions should be interpreted, if  possible, so as to support the judgment rather than defeat it if they are reasonably susceptible to such  interpretation.""'"" (People v. Spaccia (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 1278, 1287, 220 Cal. Rptr. 3d 65.) 2. It is not reasonably likely the jury applied the challenged instruction in an impermissible manner The first element of the crime of human [*22]  trafficking is ""a person, acting with the requisite intent, (1) induces a  minor to engage in a commercial sex act; or (2) attempts to induce a minor to engage in such an act."" (Moses,  supra, 10 Cal.5th at p. 902.) CALCRIM No. 1244 provides that for a defendant to be found guilty of a violation of  section 236.1, subdivision (c), the People must prove beyond a reasonable doubt for element one that "" [t]he  defendant (caused/ [or] induced/ [or] persuaded) [or] attempted to (cause/ [or] induce/ [or] persuade)] another  person to engage in a commercial sex act."" However, for the first element, the trial court modified CALCRIM No. 1244 and instructed the jury, ""To prove that a  defendant is guilty of this crime, the People must prove that: the defendant caused, induced or persuaded or  attempted to cause, induce or persuade another person to become a prostitute or engage in a commercial sex act."" Mahjoob contends the court's modification of the standard jury instruction to add the words ""become a prostitute or""  suggested to the jury that it could convict Mahjoob of human trafficking (§ 236.1, subd. (c)) without proving he had  induced or attempted to induce a minor of ""engag[ing] in a commercial sex act""—a required element. Mahjoob  argues the result of the modified instruction was to ""remove[ ] the commercial [*23]  sex act element from the  human trafficking offense."" Mahjoob argues the instructional error violated his rights to due process and trial by jury  under the United States Constitution and his right to have a jury determine each element of an offense under the  California Constitution.             2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2073, *20 Page 9 of 17 We conclude that although the additional four words were not ideal, they were superfluous and not error. It is  improbable the jury applied the instruction in an impermissible manner in the context of the rest of the instructions. Most importantly, according to the definitions the court gave the jury, a commercial sex act encompassed  prostitution. The court defined the terms ""prostitute,"" a ""lewd act"" and a ""commercial sex act:"" ""A prostitute is a  person who engages in sexual intercourse or any lewd act with another person in exchange for money or other  compensation. [ ] A lewd act means physical contact of the genital, buttocks or female breasts or either the  prostitute or customer with some part of the person's body for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification. [¶] A  commercial sex act is sexual conduct that takes place in exchange for anything of value."" In effect, for the first  element, the court [*24]  instructed the jury that the People had to establish ""the defendant caused, induced or  persuaded or attempted to cause, induce or persuade another person to become a prostitute""—meaning ""to  engage in sexual intercourse or any lewd act with another person in exchange for money or other compensation""— ""or engage in a commercial sex act."" Not only are the definitions nearly identical, but the definition of a prostitute is  narrower than that of a commercial sex act. If the jury found that Mahjoob persuaded or attempted to persuade  Cloey to become a prostitute, the jury would have also found that Mahjoob persuaded or attempted to persuade  Cloey to engage in a commercial sex act. The court even clarified, ""In order to cause, persuade encourage or induce another person to become a prostitute,  and to intend to influence another person to become a prostitute, the defendant must intend that the other person,  at some point, actually engage in sexual intercourse or another lewd act for money or other compensation."" In addition, the court correctly stated the charge against Mahjoob: ""The defendant is charged with causing, or  inducing or persuading or attempting to cause, induce, or persuade a minor [*25]  to engage in a commercial sex  act."" (Emphasis added.) Moreover, the court repeated several times that the charge involved inducing or attempting to induce a minor to  engage in a commercial sex act. The court explained, ""When you decide whether the defendant caused or induced  or persuaded or attempted to cause, induce or persuade the other person to engage in a commercial sex act,  consider all the circumstances including the age of the other person, her relationship to the defendant and the  other's handicap or disability, if any."" (Emphasis added.) In connection with evidence of uncharged unlawful sexual  intercourse with a minor under the age of 16 years, the court instructed: ""If you decide that the defendant committed  the uncharged offense, you may, but are not required to, conclude from that evidence that the defendant was  disposed or inclined to commit sexual offenses, and based on that decision, also conclude that the defendant was  likely to commit the crime causing, inducing or persuading or attempting to cause, induce or persuade a minor to  engage in commercial sex acts as charged here."" (Emphasis added.) The court continued, ""It is not sufficient by  itself to prove that the defendant [*26]  is guilty of causing, inducing or persuading or attempting to cause, induce or  persuade a minor to engage in commercial sex acts. The People still must prove causing, inducing or persuading or  attempting to cause, induce or persuade a minor to engage in commercial sex acts beyond a reasonable doubt.""  (Emphasis added.) B. Substantial Evidence Supports Mahjoob's Conviction for Human Trafficking of a Minor 1. Standard of review ""'When reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we ask ""'whether, after viewing the evidence in the  light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the  crime beyond a reasonable doubt.'"" [Citation.] Because the sufficiency of the evidence is ultimately a legal question,  we must examine the record independently for ""'substantial evidence — that is, evidence which is reasonable,        2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2073, *23 Page 10 of 17 credible, and of solid value'"" that would support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt.' [Citation.] In doing so, we  'view the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict and presume the existence of every fact that the  jury could reasonably have deduced from that evidence.' [Citation.] 'We must also [*27]  ""accept logical inferences  that the jury might have drawn from the circumstantial evidence.""' [Citation.] We do not question the credibility of a  witness's testimony, so long as it is 'not inherently improbable,' nor do we reconsider the weight to be given any  particular item of evidence."" (People v. Navarro (2021) 12 Cal.5th 285, 302, 285 Cal. Rptr. 3d 861, 497 P.3d 935.) 2. Substantial evidence supports the jury's finding that Mahjoob attempted to induce Cloey to engage in a  commercial sex act Mahjoob argues substantial evidence does not support the jury's finding that he attempted to induce Cloey to  engage in a commercial sex act. Mahjoob supports his position by relying on the evidence presented through  himself, Tapia and Cloey, who ""all denied that there was any attempt to cause, induce, or persuade Cloey to  engage in a commercial sex act, with each participant stating emphatically that she was not to engage in sex with  Khan."" We conclude the evidence presented was sufficient. Khan testified extensively about how he and Mahjoob discussed arranging for Khan to have sex with Cloey.  Mahjoob had previously arranged two meetings with other commercial sex workers for Khan. When Khan saw  Mahjoob and Cloey at the Orange Line metro station, Mahjoob asked Khan if Khan wanted [*28]  to have sex with  Cloey. When Khan replied yes, Mahjoob agreed to bring Cloey to Khan's room at the Starlight Motel. Khan and  Mahjoob discussed the payment. When Mahjoob and Cloey came to Khan's room later that day, there was a further  negotiation of the payment amount, and Khan gave Mahjoob a partial upfront payment ostensibly so Cloey could  pay for a room. After Mahjoob left, Cloey told Khan that she was ""working"" to get a room. Khan understood  ""working"" to mean performing sexual favors. Although Cloey did not end up having sex with Khan, Khan was clear  about his belief that the purpose of the arrangement was to have sex, and he told Cloey as much. In her field interview, Cloey explained she ended up in Khan's room because of ""[t]he guys, they, their plan.""  Cloey said, ""[T]hey wanted to re-up,"" and they were interested in getting money and drugs. Cloey explained that  Khan had given her drugs in an envelope and a cell phone. Khan gave her a phone because ""he just wanted to hit  me up for business later."" The female officer asked, ""So you can go visit him again? But for sex, right?"" Cloey  responded, ""Yeah."" While Cloey was inside with Khan, Mahjoob and Tapia were outside unwittingly speaking [*29]  with Officer Torres,  who they believed was a prostitute. A transcript of their recorded conversation was admitted into evidence. Among  other things, Tapia said to Officer Torres that he had ""the homegirl [Cloey] in there working"" and that he was ""trying  to lace her up on the game"" and ""breaking her in"" because ""[t]his [was] her first time."" At one point, at Tapia's  urging, Mahjoob called Khan to find out if he wanted more ""company."" Officer Torres and Detective Pinner testified  about the meaning of the words ""working,"" ""lace her up on the game,"" ""breaking her in,"" and ""company"" in the  context of human trafficking and prostitution, explaining the words were street vernacular referencing various  aspects of commercial sex work. Detective Pinner explained common circumstances and practices used to recruit and groom someone as a  commercial sex worker, including meeting online, engaging face-to-face, targeting runaways, creating a sense of  reliance on the groomer, and ""trying out the merchandise,"" meaning having sex with the person being groomed as a  form of ""instruction."" The evidence established these grooming characteristics as to Cloey. Cloey was a runaway  who met Mahjoob through a social [*30]  media application. Mahjoob picked Cloey up and took her to a friend's       2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2073, *26 Page 11 of 17 home where he had sex with her. Cloey testified she felt obligated ""in a way"" to have sex with Mahjoob because he  gave her a place to stay. Mahjoob contends he told Cloey not to have sex with Khan in exchange for money. But a violation of human  trafficking of a minor does not necessarily turn on an incident involving a specific person at a particular time. (See  People v. Dell (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 248, 265-266, 283 Cal. Rptr. 361 [""both pimping and pandering have been  held to be crimes of a continuous ongoing nature and are therefore not subject to the requirement the jury must  agree on the specific act or acts constituting the offense""].) Moreover, a ""commercial sex act"" does not require  intercourse or the exchange of money. Rather, a ""commercial sex act"" broadly covers any ""sexual conduct on  account of which anything of value is given or received by a person."" (§ 236.1, subd. (h)(2).) According to Mahjoob, the evidence demonstrated the entire scheme involved a ""hustle"" to steal money, drugs and  a phone from Khan, and there was insufficient evidence for a jury to find an attempt to cause, induce or persuade  Cloey to engage in sexual conduct in exchange for anything of value. But even if Mahjoob expressly [*31]  told  Cloey not to have sex with Khan, a jury could have concluded that Mahjoob's conduct—knowing Khan wanted to  have sex with Cloey, arranging a date with Khan, taking Cloey to Khan's motel room, negotiating and accepting  payment for the date, leaving Cloey with Khan—amounted, at a minimum, to an attempt to cause Cloey to engage  in some form of sexual conduct in exchange for money, drugs and a cell phone. Further, Khan gave Cloey a cell  phone to get in touch with her in the future so they could have sex. The jury was free to credit the testimonies of  Cloey, Khan, Officer Torres and Detective Pinner that Mahjoob was grooming and attempting to cause, induce or  persuade Cloey to engage in a commercial sex act, whether with Khan on that night or with Khan (or someone else)  in the future. (See People v. Dell, supra, 232 Cal.App.3d at pp. 265-266 [explaining that pandering and pimping are  crimes of an ongoing nature].) C. Tapia's Due Process Rights Were Not Violated When the Jury Convicted Him of Human Trafficking of a Minor 1. Relevant law and standard of review ""Due process requires that an accused be advised of the specific charges against him so he may adequately  prepare his defense and not be taken by surprise by evidence offered at trial."" [*32]  (People v. Haskin (1992) 4  Cal.App.4th 1434, 1438, 7 Cal. Rptr. 2d 1; see People v. Whitmer (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 906, 919, 179 Cal. Rptr.  3d 112 [""the purpose of an accusatory pleading is '""to provide the accused with reasonable notice of the  charges""'""].) ""'[A]n accused cannot be convicted of an offense of which he has not been charged, regardless of  whether there was evidence at his trial to show he committed the offense.'"" (People v. Sawyers (2017) 15  Cal.App.5th 713, 720, 223 Cal. Rptr. 3d 438.) An exception to the rule is when ""'the accused expressly or impliedly consents or acquiesces in having the trier of  fact consider a substituted, uncharged offense.'"" (People v. Sawyers, supra, 15 Cal.App.5th at p. 720; see People v.  Whitmer, supra, 230 Cal.App.4th at p. 919 [""'proceedings in the trial court may constitute an informal amendment of  the accusatory pleading, when the defendant's conduct or circumstances created by him amount to an implied  consent to the amendment'""].) The failure to object to an instruction on a nonincluded offense may be ""'""regarded as  an implied consent to treat the information as having been amended to include the offense on which the sentence  was imposed""'"" and results in the forfeiture of any contention of error. (People v. Toro (1989) 47 Cal.3d 966, 976- 977, 254 Cal. Rptr. 811, 766 P.2d 577, disapproved on other grounds in People v. Guiuan (1998) 18 Cal.4th 558,  568, fn. 3, 76 Cal. Rptr. 2d 239, 957 P.2d 928; see Whitmer, at p. 920 [""Because appellant never raised any  objection to the instructions before the trial court, he impliedly consented to the submission of both theories [of  liability based on an included and nonincluded offense] [*33]  to the jury.""].) Because Tapia's argument involves resolving a question of law and procedural fairness, we apply a de novo  standard of review. (See, e.g., People v. Marrero (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th 896, 911, 275 Cal. Rptr. 3d 177 [""'We  review procedural due process claims de novo because ""the ultimate determination of procedural fairness amounts  to a question of law.""'""]; see also People v. Cole (2004) 33 Cal.4th 1158, 1205, 17 Cal. Rptr. 3d 532, 95 P.3d 811  2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2073, *30 Page 12 of 17 [""Whether defendant received constitutionally adequate notice that the prosecution was relying on a particular  theory of guilt entails a resolution of a mixed question of law and fact that we believe is predominantly legal.""].) 2. Tapia impliedly consented to have the jury consider whether he was guilty of human trafficking of a minor with  intent to pander Tapia was charged with and convicted of human trafficking of a minor in violation of section 236.1, subdivision  (c)(1). However, the information charged Tapia with human trafficking of a minor with intent to violate section 266h,  the pimping statute, and the trial court instructed the jury on human trafficking of a minor with intent to violate  section 266i, the pandering statute. Specifically, the court instructed the jury with a modified version of CALCRIM  No. 1244, which referenced section 266i, and with CALCRIM No. 1151, which described the elements of pandering.  Tapia did not object to giving CALCRIM No. 1244. Tapia objected to some of the [*34]  language included in  CALCRIM No. 1151 but not to giving the instruction. Tapia contends the trial court's erroneous instruction resulted in him being convicted of an offense with which he  was not charged, in violation of his state and federal due process rights. But he does not argue he was surprised  or unaware of the pandering theory such that he was deprived of an opportunity to adequately defend himself at  trial. We conclude Tapia has failed to demonstrate a due process violation because he impliedly consented to an  informal amendment of the information. ""[G]enerally an accused will receive adequate notice of the prosecution's theory of the case from the evidence  adduced at the preliminary examination . . . ."" (People v. Cole, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 1205.) Tapia's preliminary  hearing provided him notice that the People would be pursuing a pandering theory against him—that Tapia had  knowingly and purposefully encouraged Cloey to become a prostitute regardless of whether his efforts were  successful. (See People v. Zambia (2011) 51 Cal.4th 965, 973, fn. 5, 980.) Officer Torres testified about her  conversation with Tapia, in which she recounted that Tapia told her ""he had a girl [in the motel] that he was working  . . . and that he was training her up and breaking her in."" Detective Pinner and Officer [*35]  Torres testified about  their experiences and expertise involving pandering, pimping and commercial sex trafficking. At the conclusion of  the hearing, the trial court found it could ""draw a very strong and reasonable inference that the victim, Cloey, was  being trafficked for prostitution."" Accordingly, the court held Tapia to answer to ""count two, also a felony, violation of  Penal Code section 236.1(c)(1),"" without specifying the statute supplying the specific intent element of the offense. At the outset of the jury trial, the descriptions of the charge and evidence against Tapia included references to both  pimping and pandering. In describing the charge against Tapia to potential jurors, the trial court read the charge as  stated in the information and added, in reference to section 266(h), that ""you will be further instructed on that, but  basically that is the pimping and pandering statute . . . ."" The prosecutor's opening statement explained, ""The  evidence in this case will show that the defendants acted in concert to pander, which is to offer up, a child for sex in  exchange for money with the intent of pimping that child, and pimping simply means benefiting financially from the  sexual labor of others."" During the trial, when [*36]  the trial court asked counsel about ""any issues you have with the jury instructions,""  Tapia's counsel said, ""[A]s to 266h and [266]i . . . I don't know what we need 1-B. I don't think there is an issue that  this was a house of prostitution."" Tapia's counsel did not object to the instruction as improper because Tapia had  not been charged with human trafficking of a minor with the intent to pander or argue the instruction on pandering  should not be given.       2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2073, *33 Page 13 of 17 By closing arguments, it was clear that the People were proceeding on a pandering theory. In closing, the  prosecutor defined the second element of the human trafficking offense as when Tapia ""acted, he intended to  commit a violation of the pandering statute."" Likewise, Tapia's counsel explained to the jury that the intent element  of the human trafficking offense was being supplied by section 266i: ""Number two, when Jason acted, he intended  to commit a felony in violation of Penal Code section 266i[,] which is the pandering statute."" Neither side mentioned  ""pimping"" as an element of the offense charged. D. The Trial Court Did Not Err by Denying Tapia's Request To Instruct the Jury with CALCRIM No. 224 1. Relevant law and standard of review The trial court is required to instruct [*37]  the jury '""on the general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by  the evidence.""' [Citation.] A trial court must instruct the jury on how to evaluate circumstantial evidence """"'sua  sponte when the prosecution substantially relies on circumstantial evidence to prove guilt.'"""" (People v. Contreras  (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 587, 591, 108 Cal. Rptr. 3d 880; accord, People v. Wright (2021) 12 Cal.5th 419, 451, 287  Cal. Rptr. 3d 510, 500 P.3d 267.) As discussed, ""We review a claim of instructional error de novo."" (Rivera, supra, 7 Cal.5th at p. 326.) ""Whether or  not to give any particular instruction in any particular case entails the resolution of a mixed question of law and fact  that, we believe, is . . . predominantly legal. As such, it should be examined without deference."" (People v. Waidla  (2000) 22 Cal.4th 690, 733, 94 Cal. Rptr. 2d 396, 996 P.2d 46.) 2. The nature of the case warranted giving only CALCRIM No. 225 ""CALCRIM Nos. 224 and 225 provide essentially the same information on how the jury should consider  circumstantial evidence, but CALCRIM No. 224 is more inclusive."" (People v. Samaniego (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th  1148, 1171-1172, 91 Cal. Rptr. 3d 874.) CALCRIM No. 224 instructs the jury on how to evaluate circumstantial  evidence with regards to any necessary element that must be proven, including intent. (Ibid.; see People v. Cole,  supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 1222 [CALCRIM No. 224 ""is the proper instruction to give unless the only element of the  offense that rests substantially or entirely on circumstantial evidence is that of specific intent or mental state""].)  CALCRIM No. 225 focuses on circumstantial evidence to prove intent. (People v. Samaniego, supra, at pp. 1171- 1172.) Tapia [*38]  argues the trial court erred when it only instructed the jury with CALCRIM No. 225 and denied his  request to also instruct the jury with CALCRIM No. 224. Tapia contends the more comprehensive instruction of  circumstantial evidence was necessary because the People relied on circumstantial evidence to prove all three  required elements of human trafficking of a minor. We conclude the court did not err in denying Tapia's request to instruct the jury with CALCRIM No. 224. CALCRIM  No. 225 was proper because the People substantially relied on circumstantial evidence only to prove Tapia's intent  or mental state. (See People v. Hughes (2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 347, 116 Cal. Rptr. 2d 401, 39 P.3d 432; accord,  People v. Marshall (1996) 13 Cal.4th 799, 849, 55 Cal. Rptr. 2d 347, 919 P.2d 1280; see also Bench Notes to  CALCRIM No. 225 (2021) [""Give this instruction when the defendant's intent or mental state is the only element of  the offense that rests substantially or entirely on circumstantial evidence. If other elements of the offense also rest  substantially or entirely on circumstantial evidence, do not give this instruction. Give CALCRIM No. 224,  Circumstantial Evidence: Sufficiency of Evidence.""].) To find Tapia guilty of human trafficking of a minor, the People needed to prove three elements beyond a  reasonable doubt: (1) Tapia induced, caused, persuaded, or attempted to induce, cause, or persuade Cloey to  commit a commercial [*39]  sex act; (2) Tapia had the intent to violate section 266i; and (3) Cloey was under the  age of 18 during this period. (§ 236.1, subd. (c); CALCRIM No. 1244.)    2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2073, *36 Page 14 of 17 Other than the second element on intent, the elements were primarily established with direct evidence. Specifically,  the first element was supported by Tapia's testimony. Tapia admitted he knew Khan used his money to buy sex,  and Khan was trying to purchase sex services from Cloey. Tapia also said that before taking Cloey to Khan's room,  he told Cloey that Khan wanted to have sex with her in exchange for money, a phone and drugs. Tapia also knew  that when he escorted Cloey to the Starlight Motel, an agreement had been reached with Khan to pay for sex  services from Cloey. Further, as described earlier, Tapia's conversation with Officer Torres, notwithstanding his  characterization that he was ""just bullshitting"" with her, also supplies direct evidence of Tapia's involvement in  causing or attempting to cause Cloey to engage in a commercial sex act. Finally, the third element was supported  by Cloey's testimony. Cloey testified that her birthdate was September 22, 2001, and she was 15 years old in May  2017. In addition, CALCRIM No. 225 briefly explained to the jury how to use circumstantial evidence [*40]  to find any  necessary fact had been proven: ""Before you may rely on circumstantial evidence to conclude that a fact necessary  to find the defendant guilty has been proved, you must be convinced that the People have proved each fact  essential to that conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt."" And the jury was provided with additional instructions that  explained the concept of circumstantial evidence, its potential uses, what the concept of reasonable doubt means,  and how they must first find that the People proved each fact ""essential to [the] conclusion beyond a reasonable  doubt."" According to Tapia, the other elements of the charged offense relied on drawing inferences from circumstantial  evidence. Tapia identifies five pieces of evidence: ""Mahjoob's having sex with Cloey was a 'test run' and was an act  of violence . . . ; providing drugs to Cloey was a device or scheme . . . ; isolating her and making her dependent on  Mike for food and shelter was duress . . . ; Sepulveda Boulevard was ""a place where prostitution was encouraged  or allowed' . . . ; whether the terminology or lingo used between Tapia and Detective Torres necessarily holds the  meaning Detective Pinner states . . . ."" Tapia [*41]  does not specify which element of the offense these pieces of  evidence are meant to support. But by identifying acts of violence, a device or scheme, duress, and a place where  prostitution is encouraged or allowed, Tapia refers to how section 266i can be violated. (§ 266i, subd. (a)(2), (4) &  (5).) But to be guilty of human trafficking, it must be shown that Tapia intended to violate section 266i, meaning  these pieces of evidence go towards showing that Tapia had the intent to violate the statute, which supports the trial  court's decision to give CALCRIM No. 225. E. Tapia Forfeited His Claims of Prosecutorial Misconduct 1. Relevant proceedings The prosecutor's closing argument focused on Tapia's role as an aider and abettor of Mahjoob, who the prosecutor  characterized as ""the main perpetrator."" The prosecutor focused on human trafficking of a minor as being a crime of  intent, and that intent could be inferred from Tapia's actions. The prosecutor argued Tapia's testimony  demonstrated he was trying to blame Cloey for what happened, or at a minimum, he thought Cloey was ""game for  all this."" The prosecutor referenced ""somebody else's child"" or ""someone else's child"" on several occasions,  primarily in the context of arguing Tapia exploited ""somebody else's [*42]  child"" and thought it was ""okay because  he didn't do it to his own kid."" In closing, defense counsel argued the defendants' scheme was never to induce Cloey into engaging in a  commercial sex act but rather to have her steal money, drugs and a phone from Khan. Defense counsel refuted the  prosecutor's assertion that Tapia was ""blaming Cloey for anything happened."" Defense counsel argued Tapia's  limited role in the incident and his conversation with Officer Torres could mean something other than attempting to  cause Cloey to engage in a commercial sex act. Defense counsel relied on statements made by Cloey near the      2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2073, *39 Page 15 of 17 time of the incident that the entire thing was ""hustle,"" which counsel argued meant to take Khan's money, and that  ""Mike and Jason did not send her to Pop's room to have sex."" In rebuttal, the prosecutor again focused on Tapia's efforts to blame Cloey for what happened and Tapia's  argument Cloey agreed to the plan to steal from Khan. The prosecutor argued that once Cloey had been offered  sex in exchange for money, the crime of pandering had been committed. The prosecutor painted Tapia and  Mahjoob as uncaring about what happened to Cloey and referred to how Tapia ""brag[ged] about [*43]  how he was  making [Cloey] do it"" even though he knew she ""didn't want to be there, did not want to do this . . . ."" 2. Relevant law and standard of review When addressing a jury, prosecutors enjoy wide latitude in commenting on the evidence, including identifying  reasonable inferences derived from the evidence. (See People v. Edwards (2013) 57 Cal.4th 658, 736, 161 Cal.  Rptr. 3d 191, 306 P.3d 1049 [""[a] prosecutor's 'argument may be vigorous as long as it is a fair comment on the  evidence, which can include reasonable inferences or deductions to be drawn therefrom'""]; People v. Hill (1998) 17  Cal.4th 800, 823, 72 Cal. Rptr. 2d 656, 952 P.2d 673 [same].) That latitude, however, does not extend to  statements that appeal solely to the passions or prejudices of the jurors. (See People v. Redd (2010) 48 Cal.4th  691, 742, 108 Cal. Rptr. 3d 192, 229 P.3d 101 [""'[i]t is, of course, improper to make arguments to the jury that give it  the impression that ""emotion may reign over reason,"" and to present ""irrelevant information or inflammatory rhetoric  that diverts the jury's attention from its proper role, or invites an irrational, purely subjective response""'""]; People v.  Kipp (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1100, 1130, 113 Cal. Rptr. 2d 27, 33 P.3d 450 [""'[a]n appeal for sympathy for the victim is  out of place during an objective determination of guilt'""].) A prosecutor also cannot engage in ""personal attacks on  the integrity of opposing counsel."" (People v. Gionis (1995) 9 Cal.4th 1196, 1215.) We consider the prosecutor's [*44]  remarks in the context of the entire record. (People v. San Nicolas (2004) 34  Cal.4th 614, 21 Cal. Rptr. 3d 612, 101 P.3d 509.) ""Ultimately, the test for misconduct is whether the prosecutor has  employed deceptive or reprehensible methods to persuade either the court or the jury."" (People v. Dennis (1998) 17  Cal.4th 468, 522, 71 Cal. Rptr. 2d 680, 950 P.2d 1035.) ""'To prevail on a claim of prosecutorial misconduct based  on remarks to the jury, the defendant must show a reasonable likelihood the jury understood or applied the  complained-of comments in an improper or erroneous manner. [Citations.] In conducting this inquiry, we ""do not  lightly infer"" that the jury drew the most damaging rather than the least damaging meaning from the prosecutor's  statements. [Citation.]""' (People v. Brown (2003) 31 Cal.4th 518, 553-554, 3 Cal. Rptr. 3d 145, 73 P.3d 1137.) ""'[A] defendant may not complain on appeal of prosecutorial misconduct unless in a timely fashion—and on the  same ground—the defendant made an assignment of misconduct and requested that the jury be admonished to  disregard the impropriety.'"" (People v. Stanley (2006) 39 Cal.4th 913, 952, 47 Cal. Rptr. 3d 420, 140 P.3d 736;  accord, People v. Riggs (2008) 44 Cal.4th 248, 322, 79 Cal. Rptr. 3d 648, 187 P.3d 363; accord, People v. Perez  (2018) 4 Cal.5th 421, 450, 229 Cal. Rptr. 3d 303, 411 P.3d 490.) Exceptions exist to the general rule in cases  where an objection would have been futile, an admonition would not have cured the harm, or an immediate  overruling of the objection deprived the defendant of the opportunity to request an admonition. (See People v. Hill,  supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 819; accord, People v. Navarro, supra, 12 Cal.5th at p. 332.) When preserved, we review a trial court's rulings [*45]  on prosecutorial misconduct for an abuse of discretion.  (People v. Alvarez (1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 213, 58 Cal. Rptr. 2d 385, 926 P.2d 365.) 3. Tapia failed to object and request admonishments Tapia raises numerous misconduct challenges to statements in the prosecutor's closing and rebuttal arguments,  which Tapia contends disparaged defense counsel as blaming Cloey for her victimization and improperly appealed  to the jury's emotions. Tapia concedes that none of the comments were reprehensible in isolation. He also     2022 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2073, *42 Page 16 of 17 acknowledges that he failed to object to most of the statements he now challenges and that such failure generally  results in forfeiture on appeal. But because he ""complains of the broader impact from multiple comments,"" he  contends we should exercise our discretion to consider his argument. We conclude Tapia forfeited his prosecutorial misconduct claims and decline to review them. Tapia did not object to 15 of the 17 statements he now argues were problematic. (Cf. People v. Williams (2009) 170  Cal.App.4th 587, 606, 88 Cal. Rptr. 3d 401 [exercising discretion to consider prosecutorial misconduct claims on the  merits where the defendant forfeited some claims but raised ""numerous appropriate and timely objections in the trial  court"" on the same concern raised in the forfeited claims].) Tapia objected to two statements during closing [*46]  and rebuttal arguments. In the closing rebuttal argument, the  prosecutor urged, ""They want you to believe that it's okay for all of you to turn all of your children over to the  defendant."" The trial court sustained Tapia's counsel's objection. The prosecutor then reframed the statement: ""To  turn over all the children in the world to the defendant and his pimp partner, so that they can take them out on the  track, make deals with them for johns and then arguing it's the child's fault."" Tapia did not object to the  restatement. At the end of the rebuttal argument, the prosecutor said, ""Don't . . . be a Jason Tapia or a Mahrad  Mahjoob and think that because that child is a run away [sic] that it's okay for you to sexually exploit her."" Again, the  court sustained Tapia's counsel's objection. The first statement Tapia objected to was improper and is troubling. The statement broke the Golden Rule by  expressly personalizing the crime and appealing to the jurors' emotions, asking them to put themselves in the shoes  of Cloey's parents. (See People v. Vance (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1198, 116 Cal. Rptr. 3d 98 [""The  condemnation of Golden Rule arguments. . . is so widespread that it is characterized as 'universal.'""]; see People v.  Fields (1983) 35 Cal.3d 329, 362, 197 Cal. Rptr. 803, 673 P.2d 680 [""It has long been settled that appeals [*47]  to  the sympathy or the passions of the jury are inappropriate at the guilt phase of a criminal trial.""].) We are less  troubled by the second statement Tapia objected to, which was consistent with the evidence that Cloey was a  runaway and the People's theory that the defendants had sexually exploited her. Moreover, immediately after the  objection, and as her final word, the prosecutor said, ""Apply the law to the evidence, and when you do that you can  only come to one fair, just, and reasonable conclusion and that is that the defendant is guilty."" However, Tapia failed to request an admonition. (See People v. Sanchez (2016) 63 Cal.4th 411, 476, 204 Cal.

Having sustained defense counsel's objections, it appears the trial court would have granted requests for  admonitions. Further, the record discloses no reason to believe that an admonition to the jury to decide the case  based on the facts and law, and not on emotions or sympathy, would not have cured any prejudice caused by the  prosecutor's statements.

"People v. Pitcher, 2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838","Brannon Lawrence Pitcher appeals after a jury convicted him on two counts of sex trafficking of a minor (Pen.  Code, § 236.1, subd. (c) (§ 236.1(c)); counts 1 and 2), one count of possession of a controlled substance (Health  & Saf. Code, § 11377, subd. (a)), and 73 misdemeanor counts of disobeying a court order (§ 166, subd. (a)(4)). The  jury also found that the offense charged in count 1 involved force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress,   Page 2 of 13 menace, or threat of unlawful injury (§ 236.1(c)(2)). Appellant admitted suffering prior serious felony and strike  convictions (§ 667, subds. (a)(1), (d)(1) & (e)(1), 1170.12, subds. (b)(1) & (c)(1)) and serving two prior prison terms  (§ 667.5, subd. (b)). The trial court sentenced him to 36 years to life in state prison, consisting of 15 years to life on  count 1 doubled by the strike prior, plus 5 years for the prior serious [*2]  felony conviction and 1 year for one of the  prison term priors. Concurrent terms were imposed on the remaining counts and the one-year enhancement on the  other prison prior was stayed. Appellant contends (1) the evidence is insufficient to support the true finding on the section 236.1(c)(2) allegation;  (2) the court erred in instructing the jury with an unmodified version of CALCRIM No. 3184; (3) the court erred in  failing to accept the jury's orally reported verdict of not guilty on count 2; (4) the court misinstructed the jury on  count 2 by misstating the ""acquittal-first"" rule; (5) section 236.1(c) is unconstitutional; (6) counts 1 and 2 must be  reduced to violations of section 266i pursuant to the Williamson rule; (7) his separate convictions on counts 1 and  2 violate double jeopardy principles; (8) his sentence amounts to cruel and unusual punishment; and (9) cumulative  error compels the reversal of his convictions. He also asks us to conduct an independent review of the in camera  hearing on his Pitchess motion. Pursuant to the People's request, we shall order that the abstract of judgment be  corrected to reflect the correct sentence imposed on count 1. Otherwise, we affirm. STATEMENT OF FACTS Commercial Sex Trafficking of [*3]  Doe In May 2013, 16-year-old Doe was working as a prostitute in Florida. She began prostituting at age 12 or 13 and  always had a pimp who received all of her income. In early May, appellant texted Doe in response to an escort advertisement. Appellant was a known pimp and  wanted Doe to work for him. In late May or early June, Doe met appellant in Maryland at his request. Doe stayed in  a hotel with appellant and ""Milky,"" another prostitute. Doe told appellant she was looking for a better situation  because her current pimp was being physically and emotionally abusive. Doe and Milky met with ""clients"" in the  hotel room they shared with appellant and gave him all of their earnings. During this period, appellant sent Doe  texts discussing her prostitution, demanding her earnings, and expressing interest in being her pimp. Appellant, Milky, and Doe subsequently went to Richmond, Virginia, where Doe and Milky continued to prostitute.  Doe met customers by advertising online and always gave appellant whatever she earned, which was generally  $160 to $200 for each ""date."" While they were in Richmond, Doe saw appellant hit Milky in the face hard enough to  make her bleed. Appellant and Doe then spent [*4]  a day or two in Alexandria, Virginia, followed by a week or two  in Washington, D.C. Milky was left behind. Doe continued to prostitute and always gave appellant whatever she  earned. At the end of June, Doe and appellant took a bus to California and stayed for a few days at appellant's mother's  house in San Francisco. During that time, Doe performed ""outcalls"" and appellant's mother acted as her driver. Doe  paid appellant's mother for driving her and gave the remainder of her earnings to appellant. Appellant and Doe  subsequently moved on to Oakland, where Doe continued to prostitute. She reluctantly ""walked the track"" because  appellant said they needed the money.       2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *1 Page 3 of 13 Over the next two months appellant and Doe travelled to Belmont, Santa Rosa, Sacramento, Salinas, San Luis  Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. Doe prostituted in each city and always gave appellant all of her earnings. On  one of two trips to Santa Barbara, Doe had more than 10 ""dates."" Doe and appellant were occasionally  accompanied by Melissa, whom appellant had recruited for prostitution. Appellant also recruited another girl (Emily)  in Belmont. Like Doe, Melissa and Emily gave all of their earnings to appellant. On numerous [*5]  occasions,  Melissa witnessed appellant post ads online for both Doe and herself. Appellant physically assaulted Doe on numerous occasions throughout their relationship and called her derogatory  names like ""stupid"" and ""bitch."" Melissa witnessed at least three such assaults. In one incident, appellant became  angry because he thought Doe was not making enough effort to find ""dates."" He suddenly started slapping and  choking her. Doe fell to the floor and appellant kicked her. Doe began crying. Appellant told her to stop crying,  straddled her, and put her in a headlock. Melissa advised Doe to seek medical treatment after the incident because Doe was bruised and had difficulty  breathing. Doe refused to go to the hospital because she had a warrant. Melissa also called the police to report the  assault. She reported the name of the motel where they were staying but did not disclose their room number.  Appellant later told Melissa that Doe was a minor and Melissa threatened to report him to the police. Appellant  responded by sending Melissa threatening text messages. Melissa called the police and reported that appellant was  abusing Doe. Throughout her time with appellant, Doe exchanged text messages [*6]  with her friend Sandra K., who was  working as a prostitute in Florida. In July 2013 Doe texted, ""I can't take it. I swear I'm going to kill myself before he  kills me."" That same day she texted, ""[H]e goes out and hits me every time my eyes close."" On another occasion  she texted, ""And I don't know what to do. I'm not walking the track. And I'm sick of verbal abuse and being beat for  no reason."" An FBI agent met Sandra while conducting a prostitution sting. After viewing Doe's texts to Sandra, another agent  tracked down Doe's location and contact information. The agent contacted Doe online and posed as a potential  customer. On August 22, FBI agents and other law enforcement officers contacted Doe in a hotel room. Appellant  left the room through a window and was apprehended shortly thereafter. Officers found 1.24 grams of  methamphetamine in the room and a small amount of marijuana. They also found a list containing telephone  numbers, times, and dollar amounts, three sex directories, and various sex toys. Appellant and Doe's phones were  seized along with a third phone they both used. Doe admitted to the police that she was acting as a prostitute yet claimed appellant was merely her boyfriend. [*7]   Doe also said that appellant had told her not to say anything to the police about what was going on. She did not tell  the FBI agents that she gave appellant money from her dates because she loved him and did not want him to be  prosecuted. After appellant was arrested, he maintained contact with Doe from jail by using a three-way call through his  mother's phone. There were 60 to 70 recordings of such calls. During one of the calls, appellant directed Doe to go  to the ""track"" in Oakland in order to make money to pay for his attorneys. He also said he did not want to hear any  excuses as to why she could or would not do so for him. Appellant also continued to tell Doe that he loved her and  talked about getting married. He told her that perjury was not a serious offense and was only punishable by a year  in jail. He also repeatedly blamed Doe for his situation. After Doe testified at the preliminary hearing, she asked appellant's mother to put her in touch with appellant again.  She felt that she had no other option than prostitution because she had no family or a place to stay. In December,  the Los Angeles County Superior Court issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting appellant from [*8]  having  any contact with Doe. A permanent restraining order was issued in July 2104. In October 2014, a District Attorney  investigator interviewed Doe to review 73 calls that took place between April 2014 and September 2014. Doe  verified that the voices heard on the calls were hers and appellant's. The investigator ultimately found recorded  calls between appellant and Doe that took place after the permanent restraining order was issued. 2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *4 Page 4 of 13 Jail inmate Charles Schmidt testified that he had repeatedly allowed appellant to use Schmidt's inmate identification  number to make phone calls to Doe. Appellant told Schmidt that he had pending charges for pimping and pandering  an underage girl and that he believed she would not testify against him because she was in love with him. Appellant  said he was hopeful this girl would continue making money for him while he was in custody. Appellant also told  Schmidt he would prey on girls who did not have any money and focused on Caucasian girls because they made  the most money. He also emphasized that he got all of the money the girls earned. Expert Testimony On The Exploitation Of Minors Through Commercial Sex Trafficking Dr. Sharon Cooper, a developmental [*9]  and forensic pediatrician, testified for the prosecution as an expert on the  sexual exploitation of minors through commercial sex trafficking. Dr. Cooper explained that sex traffickers  intentionally choose victims who appear to have certain vulnerabilities. Female victims are typically first targeted  when they are between 12 and 14 years old and come from adverse backgrounds that include neglect, sexual and  psychological abuse, domestic violence, substance abuse, and incarceration of family members. Sometimes the  victims are given drugs to make them dependent on the trafficker. Runaways and ""thrown-away children"" face the  greatest risk of being recruited into sex trafficking. Commercial sex trafficking victims are most commonly recruited ""under the guise of romance."" A ""Romeo pimp"" is  typically an older male who promises a romantic relationship or even marriage. Such a strategy renders the victim  much more likely to bond with the pimp. The pimp then transitions to a controlling and abusive relationship in which  the focus is placed on the victim's need to ""contribute to [the] family."" It is also common for victims to be used to  recruit other victims. Pimps also frequently used competition [*10]  or jealousy to manipulate and control their  victims. Dr. Cooper also explained that victims are often expected to make a certain amount of money and are punished if  they fail to do so. For example, some victims will be taken to a ""track"" and ordered to continue working until they  make their quota. Degradation and humiliation are part of the grooming process. A trafficker may also render  victims dependent upon him through ""trauma bonding,"" which the doctor described as ""a psychological form of  coercion"" in which another victim is physically abused in their presence. Victims often will not leave because they  are convinced they have nowhere else to go. A pimp or trafficker may have to use less violence because the victim  was previously conditioned to expect to be harmed in certain circumstances. Traffickers also teach their victims to  deny that they work for a pimp and claim they are merely working for themselves. Most victims do so and usually  minimize the abuse their traffickers inflict on them. Anaheim Police Lieutenant Craig Friesen also testified as a prosecution expert on commercial sex trafficking. Pimps  generally target vulnerable girls and lure them in with false promises of a [*11]  better life. Prostitutes commonly  have romantic relationships with their pimps, which gives them a false sense that they are not really in a business  relationship. Pimps receive all of the prostitute's earnings and decide how the money will be spent. A prostitute who  tried to keep the money would be physically or emotionally punished. Pimps remain in control even when they are  in a different city or are incarcerated. It is common for trafficking victims to travel to various cities within a state or  region. The victims and their pimps usually move around in order to avoid detection by law enforcement. Moving  around also isolates the victims and removes them from any support network. It is also common for traffickers to  dissuade their victims from testifying against them. DISCUSSION I. Sufficiency of the Evidence - § 236.1(c)(2) Appellant contends the evidence is insufficient to support the finding that the sex trafficking offense charged in  count 1 involved force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury, as set  forth in section 236.1(c)(2). We disagree. 2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *8 Page 5 of 13 ""When considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we review the entire  record in the [*12]  light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidence?that  is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value?from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the  defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.]"" (People v. Lindberg (2008) 45 Cal.4th 1, 27, 82 Cal. Rptr.  3d 323, 190 P.3d 664.) We determine ""whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the  prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable  doubt. [Citation.]"" (Jackson v. Virginia (1979) 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560.) In so doing, a  reviewing court ""presumes in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce  from the evidence. [Citations.]"" (People v. Kraft (2000) 23 Cal.4th 978, 1053, 99 Cal. Rptr. 2d 1, 5 P.3d 68.) As relevant here, a person is guilty of commercial sex trafficking if he or she ""causes, induces, or persuades, or  attempts to cause, induce, or persuade, a person who is a minor at the time of commission of the offense to engage  in a commercial sex act[.]"" (§ 236.1(c).) The crime is punishable by 15 years to life in state prison and a fine of not  more than $500,000 ""when the offense involves force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or  threat of unlawful injury to the victim or to another person."" (§ 236.1(c)(2).) The statute defines [*13]  ""coercion"" as  ""includ[ing] [any] scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that failure to perform an act would  result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any person; the abuse or threatened abuse of the legal  process; debt bondage; or providing and facilitating the possession of [any] controlled substance to a person with  the intent to impair the person's judgment."" (Id., subd. (h)(1).) ""Duress"" in this context ""includes a direct or implied  threat of force, violence, danger, hardship, or retribution sufficient to cause a reasonable person to acquiesce in or  perform an act which he or she would otherwise not have submitted to or performed[.]"" (Id., subd. (h)(4).) The jury was instructed on the section 236.1(c)(2) allegation in accordance with CALCRIM No. 3184. The  allegation was attendant to count 1, which was based on appellant's conduct from the time he met Doe until his  arrest. In challenging the jury's finding, appellant focuses on the evidence that he used actual force and violence  and claims the evidence compels a finding that Doe ""had no fear of [appellant], and did not prostitute herself or act  based on fear of him."" This assertion effectively ignores the controlling standard of review, [*14]  which compels us  to review the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's finding that appellant's sex trafficking of Doe prior to  this arrest involved force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury, as set  forth in section 236.1(c)(2). When viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment, the evidence supporting the true finding on the section  236.1(c)(2) allegation is overwhelming. Among other things, appellant once slapped, kicked, and choked Doe  because ""[s]he wasn't doing her job right."" Appellant also spiked Doe's drink with methamphetamine, which  contributed to her addiction to the drug. As Dr. Cooper testified, sex traffickers often make their victims dependent  upon them by giving them drugs. Appellant also deceived Doe to believe he wanted to marry her. According to Dr.  Cooper, a pimp often employs this very type of deceit as a means of inducing the victim to work for him. Doe also  complained in text messages that appellant ""hits me every time my eyes close"" and ""beat [her] for no reason."" Dr.                2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *11 Page 6 of 13 Cooper testified that sex traffickers often employ such abuse as a means of maintaining control over their victims.  This evidence is sufficient [*15]  by itself to support the finding that the sexual trafficking offense charged in count 1  involved force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury as provided in  section 236.1(c)(2). Appellant's assertion is also erroneous to the extent it presumes that the section 236.1(c)(2) enhancement is  necessarily premised upon a finding that Doe prostituted herself because she feared appellant. As we have  explained, the instilling of fear is but one theory upon which the enhancement can be based. In any event, Doe's  state of mind is essentially irrelevant to the jury's finding. Section 236.1(c)(2) does not require a finding that the  victim acted out of fear or any other particular motivation. The relevant inquiry was whether appellant's sexual  trafficking of Doe involved the use of force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of  unlawful injury, and not whether those tactics secured Doe's prostitution. As section 236.1 makes clear, ""[c]onsent  by a victim of human trafficking who is a minor at the time of the commission of the offense is not a defense to a  criminal prosecution under this section."" (§ 236.1, subd. (e); see also In re M.V. (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1517,  fn. 16, 171 Cal. Rptr. 3d 519 [""[A] minor's status as a sexually exploited youth operates independently of any notion  that [*16]  the minor somehow consented to her own victimization""].) II. CALCRIM No. 3184 As we noted ante, the jury was instructed on the section 236.1(c)(2) allegation pursuant to CALCRIM No. 3184.  Appellant claims that the jury's true finding on the allegation must be reversed because the instruction ""incorrectly  permitted jurors to find the special allegation true based on any unrelated force, fear, or violence. So, if [appellant]  used force, fear, or violence to make [Doe] iron his shirts, jurors incorrectly could have found the force allegation  true."" He further claims that ""without quantifying the amount of force, fear, or violence, jurors incorrectly could have  found the allegation true based on some minor amount of force, that was inadequate to have caused [Doe] to  engage in commercial sex acts."" Neither point has merit. First, the instruction plainly stated that in order for the allegation to be true, the People had to prove ""that when the  defendant committed the crime, he used force, fear, deceit, coercion, violence, or duress against [Doe]."" (Italics  added.) In light of this statement, no reasonable juror would have concluded the allegation could be found true  based on evidence that appellant used force that was unrelated to his commission [*17]  of the crime. (See People  v. Sanchez (2001) 26 Cal.4th 834, 852, 111 Cal. Rptr. 2d 129, 29 P.3d 209 [""Jurors are presumed able to  understand and correlate instructions and are further presumed to have followed the court's instructions].) Although appellant correctly notes that CALCRIM No. 3184 expressly defined duress, coercion, and serious harm,  ""[t]he requirement of use of force or fear has no technical meaning which must be explained to jurors[.]"" (People v.  Sullivan (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 524, 544, 59 Cal. Rptr. 3d 876; see also People v. Griffin (2004) 33 Cal.4th 1015,  1022-1024, 16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 891, 94 P.3d 1089 (Griffin) [the term ""force"" as used in the forcible rape statute (§ 261,  subd. (a)(2)) ""ha[s] a common usage meaning, rather than a specialized legal definition, and . . . hence there is no  sua sponte duty to specially instruct the jury in a rape case on the definition of that term""].) Moreover, that ""the  Legislature . . . saw fit to expressly and specifically define the terms 'menace' and 'duress' . . . , [yet] has not seen fit  to do the same for the term 'force,' . . . supports a conclusion that no specialized legal meaning was ever intended  for that term. [Citation.]"" (Griffin, supra, at p. 1023 [discussing § 261].) Second, a finding that a defendant used force as provided in section 236.1(c)(2) does not require a finding that the  force was sufficient to cause the victim to do what he or she otherwise would not have done. In arguing otherwise,  appellant misplaces his reliance on Griffin at is [*18]  progeny. In Griffin, the court held ""that 'in order to establish  force within the meaning of section 261, subd. (a)(2) [forcible rape], the prosecution need only show the defendant  used physical force of a degree sufficient to support a finding that the act of sexual intercourse was against the will  of the [victim.]' [Citation.]"" (Griffin, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 1024.) In so holding, the court faulted the Court of Appeal  for relying on People v. Cicero (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 465, 204 Cal. Rptr. 582 (Cicero), disapproved in People v.  2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *14 Page 7 of 13 Soto (2011) 51 Cal.4th 229, 119 Cal. Rptr. 3d 775, 245 P.3d 410 (Soto), which held that conviction of forcible lewd  acts on a minor (§ 288, subd. (b)(1)) requires proof of ""'physical force substantially different from or substantially  greater than that necessary to accomplish the lewd act[.]'"" (Griffin, at pp. 1021-1022, quoting Cicero, at p. 474.) The  court reasoned among other things that ""[t]here is considerable difference between the crime of lewd acts by force  on a child under the age of 14, with which Cicero was directly concerned [citation], and the crime of forcible rape.""  (Griffin, at p. 1026.) Griffin is inapposite here. Section 236.1(c)(2), unlike section 261, does not require a finding that the crime was  committed against the victim's will if the victim is a minor. As subdivision (e) of section 236.1 makes clear,  ""[c]onsent by a victim of human trafficking who is a minor at the time of the commission of the offense is not a  defense to a criminal prosecution under this section."" The same distinction [*19]  was made in Soto, supra, 51  Cal.4th 229, in which the court distinguished Griffin and recognized that consent is not a defense to the crime of  aggravated lewd conduct on a child under age 14 (§ 288, subd. (b)(1)). (Soto, at p. 248.) Because consent is not a  defense to the crime, ""the prosecution need not prove that a lewd act committed by use of force, violence, duress,  menace or fear was also against the victim's will."" (Ibid.) We discern no legitimate reason for concluding otherwise  here. III. Verdict on Count 2 Appellant contends the court erred in failing to accept the jury's orally reported verdict of not guilty on the greater  offense of human trafficking charged in count 2. We disagree. Appellant's contention is based on discussions that took place in response to a note the court received from the jury  during its deliberations. The note stated, ""Can't all agree on Count 2?lesser verdict pimping."" The court brought the  jury into the courtroom and stated: ""[T]he question is a little bit ambiguous, so we brought you out here to inquire a  little bit further and to seek some clarification in terms of where you're at on deliberations. So the question is, you  can't all agree on Count 2, dash, lesser verdict, pimping. [¶] So typically,—well, the instructions [*20]  indicate that .  . . you don't get to the question of deciding whether or not a defendant is guilty of a lesser until you've all agreed  one way or the other as to the greater, that is, you all agree that the defendant is not guilty of the greater offense, in  this case, on Count 2, it's human trafficking."" The court asked the jury foreperson, ""has the jury all agreed as to the greater count on Count 2?"" The foreperson  responded, ""Yes."" The court then stated: ""So you've all agreed the defendant is not guilty of the greater on Count 2,  because you don't get to the greater—hold on a second. You don't get to the lesser count until you've all agreed  that he's not guilty of the greater count, and on Count 2, the greater count is human trafficking. So have you all  agreed on a verdict as to the offense of Count 2, human trafficking?"" The foreperson replied, ""Yes. On the greater  counts, yes."" The court then asked, ""You all agreed or not agreed [sic]?"" The foreperson did not respond. The record indicates that the ""Jury confers amongst themselves."" The court then  added, ""So maybe I confused you a little bit. . . . [T]he jury instructions indicate you can deliberate in whatever order  you want. So you can [*21]  discuss Count 2 as it's alleged, which is human trafficking; you can begin with the  lesser charge of pimping and pandering as to Count 2 and discuss that; but on the question of reaching a verdict on  the lesser, you all have to first agree that the defendant—and the lesser is pimping—you all have to agree that the  defendant is not guilty of the charged count in Count 2, which is human trafficking."" The foreperson interjected, ""Is that the lesser or the greater?"" The court replied, ""Let me just finish. There's an  element of Count 2 which is pimping or pandering, okay? Is that where you're having some issues, that you can't all  agree?"" The foreperson replied, ""Yes."" After reiterating that pimping or pandering was an element of the offense of  human trafficking, the court asked, ""Is that why the jury is having some issues, or are you having an issue as to the  lesser included offense of pimping as to Count 2"" The foreperson replied, ""The lesser."" The court then asked if the  jury had ""all agreed as the human trafficking charge in Count 2"" and the foreperson replied, ""Not on the lesser."" 2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *18 Page 8 of 13 The court continued: ""Okay. So here is what we're going to do. I'm going to have you go back into the jury [*22]   deliberation room. I want you to carefully review the jury instructions again. So read very carefully the jury  instructions for Count 2, of which pimping and pandering is an element of Count 2, okay? If you all agree on a  verdict as to Count 2, if it's not guilty, then you go to the lesser offense or Count 2, which is pimping and/or  pandering, but you can't get to the lesser offense as to Count 2 until you all agree the defendant is not guilty of the  greater offense of human trafficking. So hopefully that's helpful, and with that, I'm not going to say anymore, but I'm  going to send you back into the jury deliberation room and again review the instruction."" After the jury left the courtroom, the court asked the attorneys if they had any comments. Defense counsel stated:  [T]hey're clearly perplexed. It appears there's some misunderstanding even amongst the jurors, just looking at the  body language . . . , so I think we leave them to deliberate and try to figure out better what their questions and  problems are before we can help them any further."" About 10 minutes later, the court indicated it had received another note that stated, ""We accidentally signed count 1  & 2 of the lesser crime. What [*23]  do we need to do, if anything. We have reached agreement [sic]."" The court  asked the foreperson if the jury had reached a verdict on each count and the foreperson replied in the affirmative.  The court then asked all of the jurors ""do you feel you need any further time to deliberate?"" They all responded,  ""No."" According to appellant, the foregoing exchanges reflect that ""[t]he jury multiple times reported a general verdict of  acquittal within the meaning of section 1151."" He claims that ""[u]nder . . . section 1164, subdivision (a), the verdict  was 'complete' when the foreperson reported (multiple times) that the jury had reached a verdict on the greater  offense, and could not agree on the lesser."" The record does not support appellant's assertion. The foreperson never stated that the jury had reached a verdict  of not guilty on the offense of human trafficking charged in count 2. When construed in their entirety, the  foreperson's comments reflect nothing more than confusion about the manner in which the jury was to decide the  charges. At one point, the foreperson even expressed confusion whether sex trafficking was the greater offense.  Even defense counsel agreed that the jury was simply confused and that further deliberations were  warranted. [*24]  Moreover, the jury returned shortly thereafter with guilty verdicts on all counts and the jurors all  agreed that no further deliberations were needed. Contrary to appellant's claim, nothing in the subject discussions  compelled the court to reject the jury's guilty verdict on count 2. IV. Alleged Instructional Error On Count 2 Appellant contends that the judgment on count 2 must also be reversed on the ground that the court's response to  the jury's question (as discussed ante) misstated the ""acquittal-first"" rule. We are not persuaded. ""Under the acquittal-first rule, a trial court may direct the order in which jury verdicts are returned by requiring an  express acquittal on the charged crime before a verdict may be returned on a lesser included offense. [Citation.]""  (People v. Bacon (2010) 50 Cal.4th 1082, 1110, 116 Cal. Rptr. 3d 723, 240 P.3d 204.) Jurors are free, however, to  deliberate on the charges in any order and may thus discuss a lesser included offense before returning a verdict on  the greater offense. (People v. Kurtzman (1988) 46 Cal.3d 322, 335-336, 250 Cal. Rptr. 244, 758 P.2d 572.) The  jury in this case was instructed pursuant to CALCRIM No. 3517 as follows: ""It is up to you to decide the order in  which you consider each crime and the relevant evidence, but I can accept a verdict of guilty of a lesser crime only  if you have found the defendant not [*25]  guilty of the corresponding greater crime.""     2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *21 Page 9 of 13 Appellant asserts that the court disregarded the acquittal-first rule when it told the jury: ""If you all agree on a verdict  as to Count 2, if it's not guilty, then you go to the lesser offense of Count 2, which is pimping and/or pandering, but  you can't get to the lesser offense as to Count 2 until you all agree the defendant is not guilty of the greater offense  of human trafficking."" This is an impermissibly selective quoting of the court's instructions. ""We determine the  correctness of the jury instructions from the entire charge of the court, not from considering only parts of an  instruction or one particular instruction. [Citation.]"" (People v. Smith (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 7, 13, 85 Cal. Rptr. 3d  180.) Here, the court's instructions also made clear that ""you can deliberate in whatever order you want. So you can  discuss Count 2 as it's alleged, which is human trafficking; you can begin with the lesser charge of pimping and  pandering as to Count 2 and discuss that; but on the question of reaching a verdict on the lesser, you all have to  first agree that the defendant—and the lesser is pimping—you all have to agree that the defendant is not guilty of  the charged count in Count 2, which is human trafficking."" [*26]  Appellant's claim of instructional error fails. V. Constitutionality of Section 236.1(c) For the first time on appeal, appellant asserts that section 236.1(c) is unconstitutional because it (1) violates the  separation of powers doctrine by delegating the judicial branch's sentencing authority to the prosecution; and (2)  violates his right to equal protection. Both claims are forfeited (People v. Fuiava (2012) 53 Cal.4th 622, 670, 137  Cal. Rptr. 3d 147, 269 P.3d 568), and in any event lack merit. The separation of powers doctrine provides that ""[t]he powers of state government are legislative, executive, and  judicial. Persons charged with the exercise of one power may not exercise either of the others except as permitted  by this Constitution."" (Cal. Const., art. III, § 3.) Appellant's claim that section 236.1(c) violates this doctrine is based  on the premise that the statute essentially proscribes the same conduct as the pimping and pandering statutes (§§  266h, 266i), yet provides for a substantially greater punishment. Appellant argues that this disparity violates the  separation of powers doctrine because it delegates to the prosecutor (i.e., the executive branch) the authority to  dictate the defendant's range of punishment. He contends that ""[s]electing the crime to prosecute falls within the  executive's discretion, but not to the extent that doing so infringes upon [*27]  the judiciary's core power of  determining and fashioning a sentence within the parameters, all parameters, set by the Legislature."" Appellant fails to sufficiently allege a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. ""[T]he separation of powers  doctrine prohibits the legislative branch from granting prosecutors the authority, after charges have been filed, to  control the legislatively specified sentencing choices available to a court. A statute conferring upon prosecutors the  discretion to make certain decisions before the filing of charges, on the other hand, is not invalid simply because the  prosecutor's exercise of such charging discretion necessarily affects the dispositional options available to the court.  Rather, such a result generally is merely incidental to the exercise of the executive function—the traditional power  of the prosecutor to charge crimes."" (Manduley v. Superior Court (2002) 27 Cal.4th 537, 553, 117 Cal. Rptr. 2d 168,  41 P.3d 3.) By enacting section 236.1(c)(2), the electorate chose to increase the punishments for those who engage in sex  trafficking of minors. ""'""[S]ubject to the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, the power to  define crimes and fix penalties is vested exclusively in the legislative branch."" [Citations.]' [Citation.]"" (Manduley v.  Superior Court, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 552.) Moreover, [*28]  ""'[t]he power of the people through the statutory  initiative is coextensive with the power of the Legislature.' [Citation.]"" (Ibid.) The fact that the enactment of these  statutes gives prosecutors the discretion to pursue charges for sex trafficking rather than pimping and/or pandering       2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *25 Page 10 of 13 does not run afoul of the separation of powers doctrine; on the contrary, this discretion is a hallmark of the doctrine.  (Ibid.) Appellant's equal protection claim is equally unavailing. Our Supreme Court has recognized that ""neither the  existence of two identical criminal statutes prescribing different levels of punishments, nor the exercise of a  prosecutor's discretion in charging under one such statute and not the other, violates equal protection principles.  [Citation.]"" (People v. Wilkinson (2004) 33 Cal.4th 821, 838, 16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 420, 94 P.3d 551, citing United States  v. Batchelder (1979) 442 U.S. 114, 124-125, 99 S. Ct. 2198, 60 L. Ed. 2d 755.) This authority, which appellant fails  to address, plainly disposes of his equal protection claim. VI. Williamson Appellant asserts that his convictions on counts 1 and 2 must be reduced to pandering (§ 266i) pursuant to the  Williamson rule. This claim is forfeited because it was not raised below and in any event lacks merit. ""Under the Williamson rule, if a general statute includes the same conduct as a special statute, the court  infers [*29]  that the Legislature intended that conduct to be prosecuted exclusively under the special statute. In  effect, the special statute is interpreted as creating an exception to the general statute for conduct that otherwise  could be prosecuted under either statute."" [Citation.] (People v. Murphy (2011) 52 Cal.4th 81, 86, 127 Cal. Rptr. 3d  78, 253 P.3d 1216.) ""[T]he Williamson preemption rule is applicable (1) when each element of the general statute  corresponds to an element on the face of the special statute, or (2) when it appears from the statutory context that a  violation of the special statute will necessarily or commonly result in a violation of the general statute. [Citation.]""  (People v. Watson (1981) 30 Cal.3d 290, 295-296, 179 Cal. Rptr. 43, 637 P.2d 279.) The Williamson rule does not apply here. Appellant labels section 266i as ""more specific"" than section 236.1(c), yet  he fails to explain how this is so. In any event, application of the Williamson rule in the manner contemplated by  appellant would effectively render section 236.1(c) a nullity. A violation of section 266i is an element of section  236.1(c). Moreover, in enacting section 236.1(c), the electorate expressed its intent to increase punishment for  defendants, like appellant, who engage in sex trafficking of minors. The Williamson rule is simply a means of  determining and effectuating legislative intent, and should never be applied to defeat such intent. (See People v.  Jenkins, supra, 28 Cal.3d at p. 502; [*30]  People v. Salemme (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 775, 783, 3 Cal. Rptr. 2d 398.)  Section 236.1(c) was enacted to create the offense of sex trafficking of minors, and in this context section 266i is an  express element of that offense. Concluding that section 266i effectively trumps section 236.1(c) here ""would be  absurd, and we must 'presume that the Legislature did not intend absurd results.' [Citation.]"" (Salemme, at p. 784.)  Because it is clear that a section 266i was not intended to create an exception to section 236.1(c), the Williamson  rule does not apply. (See People v. Murphy, supra, 52 Cal.4th at p. 86.) VII. Double Jeopardy Appellant contends he was convicted on both counts 1 and 2 in violation of the state and federal double jeopardy  clauses because the crimes involved the same victim and took place over the same timeframe. This contention was  not raised below and is thus forfeited. (In re Henry C. (1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 646, 648-649, 207 Cal. Rptr. 751.) In        2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *28 Page 11 of 13 any event, the claim is both factually and legally inaccurate. Count 1 related to appellant's conduct from May  through August 2013, while count 2 related to the conduct following his arrest in November 2013. Moreover, ""While  the Double Jeopardy Clause may protect a defendant against cumulative punishments for convictions on the same  offense, the Clause does not prohibit the State from prosecuting respondent for such offenses in a single  prosecution."" (Ohio v. Johnson (1984) 467 U.S. 493, 500, 104 S. Ct. 2536, 81 L. Ed. 2d 425.) VIII. Cruel and Unusual Punishment Appellant contends that his sentence of 36 years to life amounts to [*31]  cruel and unusual punishment in violation  of the state and federal Constitutions. We are not persuaded. The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 17 of the California Constitution  prohibit cruel and/or unusual punishment. Both clauses prohibit punishment that is disproportionate to a defendant's  personal responsibility and moral culpability. (Enmund v. Florida (1982) 458 U.S. 782, 801, 102 S. Ct. 3368, 73 L.  Ed. 2d 1140.) Under the federal Constitution, noncapital sentences are subject only to a narrow proportionality  review, if any. (See Ewing v. California (2003) 538 U.S. 11, 23, 123 S. Ct. 1179, 155 L. Ed. 2d 108.) A punishment  violates the state Constitution only if ""it is so disproportionate to the crime for which it is inflicted that it shocks the  conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity. (Fn. omitted.)"" (In re Lynch (1972) 8 Cal.3d 410,  424, 105 Cal. Rptr. 217, 503 P.2d 921.) Appellant's claim of cruel and unusual punishment focuses upon section 236.1(c)(2), which was enacted in 2012  pursuant to Proposition 35. Although he does not assert that the dictated sentence of 15 years to life is facially  unconstitutional, he claims that ""[t]he facts of this case represent the bare minimum of conduct that meets the  elements of human trafficking."" The record belies this assertion. Moreover, federal courts have repeatedly rejected  Eighth Amendment challenges to the federal human trafficking law (18 U.S.C. § 1591), upon which the state law is  patterned. (See, e.g., United States v. Alaboudi (8th Cir. 2015) 786 F.3d 1136, 1146; United States v. Flanders  (11th Cir. 2014) 752 F.3d 1317, 1343; United States v. Mozie (11th Cir. 2014) 752 F.3d 1271, 1290.) Appellant also complains that ""the gravamen [*32]  of the criminal conduct in counts 1 and 2 is essentially the same  offense as pimping and pandering. Yet, the punishments are shockingly different."" He adds that ""[i]t was not until  voters passed Proposition 35 . . . in November 2012, that a sentence could include 15 years to life and fines of up  to $1,500,000."" Appellant fails to recognize, however, that the enactment of section 236.1(c)(2) reflects the  electorate's intent to increase the punishment for such offenses when the victim is a minor and the offense involves                   2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *30 Page 12 of 13 force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury to the victim or another person. ""'It  is the prerogative of the Legislature, and the electorate by initiative, to recognize degrees of culpability and penalize  accordingly. [Citations.]' [Citation.]"" (People v. Doyle (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1251, 1267, 164 Cal. Rptr. 3d 86.)  Appellant's complaint that a violation of section 236.1(c)(2) is subject to the same punishment as second degree  murder (§ 190) is similarly unavailing and downplays the significance of his offenses. Appellant fares no better in comparing his sentence under section 236.1(c)(2) with the sentences imposed in other  states for similar crimes. As we have noted, it is questionable whether a proportionality review even applies here.  (Ewing v. California, supra, 538 U.S. at p. 23.) In any event, virtually [*33]  all of the states he identifies allow  similarly substantial punishments. (See, e.g., Minnesota, M.S.A. § 609.322 [15 to 25 years of imprisonment];  Maryland, CR § 11-303 [imprisonment not exceeding 25 years]; Rhode Island, § 11-67-3 [up to 20 years  imprisonment].) Appellant's claim of cruel and unusual punishment also fails to the extent he relies upon the enhancements that  were imposed as result of his recidivism. States do not run afoul of the Eighth Amendment by enacting law that  more harshly punish recidivists who either cannot or will not conform their conduct to social norms. (Rummel v.  Estelle (1980) 445 U.S. 263, 284-285, 100 S. Ct. 1133, 63 L. Ed. 2d 382).) In Rummel, the United States Supreme  Court upheld a mandatory life sentence under a Texas recidivist statute even though the defendant had been  convicted of obtaining $120.75 by false pretenses and his prior convictions consisted of two nonviolent felonies.  The Court reasoned that the sentence under a recidivist statute is ""based not merely on that person's most recent  offense but also on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during which he has been convicted  of and sentenced for other crimes."" (Id. at p. 284.) The statute serves the legitimate goal of deterring repeat  offenders and of segregating the recidivist ""from the rest of society [*34]  for an extended period of time."" (Ibid.) Appellant's sentence was enhanced by 21 years as a result of his recidivism, which includes prior strike and serious  felony convictions for armed robbery and a prior prison term. As the People accurately note, ""[a]ppellant spent  almost all of his entire adult life either in prison or on parole and he violated his parole over and over again."" He was  actually on parole for committing false imprisonment by violence when he committed the instant offenses. Appellant  has failed to ""overcome [his] 'considerable burden' in convincing us his sentence was disproportionate to his level of  culpability. [Citation.]"" (People v. Weddle (1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 1190, 1197, 2 Cal. Rptr. 2d 714.) His claim of cruel  and unusual punishment accordingly fails. IX. Pitchess Prior to trial, appellant filed a Pitchess motion seeking disclosure of the personnel files of Chief District Attorney  Investigator Dave Saunders. Defense counsel's declaration stated that Saunders was in a relationship with Doe's  attorney and added, ""It is my belief that . . . Saunders was involved in improper conduct related to [appellant's] case  and that conduct [sic] has been documented by members of the District Attorney [sic]."" In opposing the motion, the              2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *32 Page 13 of 13 prosecution offered [*35]  among other things that Saunders had no involvement in the case. After conducting an in  camera hearing, the court ordered that one of the documents in Saunders's life be provided to the defense subject  to a protective order. Appellant asks us to review the sealed transcripts of the in camera proceedings to determine if the court followed  the proper procedure and whether all relevant documents were disclosed. We have reviewed the sealed transcripts  and conclude there was no error. (People v. Hughes (2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 330, 116 Cal. Rptr. 2d 401, 39 P.3d  432; People v. Mooc (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1216, 1232, 114 Cal. Rptr. 2d 482, 36 P.3d 21.) X. Cumulative Error Appellant contends the cumulative effect of the alleged errors requires reversal. We reject this contention because  there was no error to cumulate. (People v. Avila (2009) 46 Cal.4th 680, 718, 94 Cal. Rptr. 3d 699, 208 P.3d 634;  People v. Bolin (1998) 18 Cal.4th 297, 335, 75 Cal. Rptr. 2d 412, 956 P.2d 374.) XI. Correction of Judgment The People ask us to order that the judgment be corrected to reflect that appellant was sentenced on count 1 to 30  years to life, rather than 15 years to life. Appellant does not dispute the error, and we shall accordingly order it  corrected. DISPOSITION We order that the judgment be corrected to reflect that appellant was sentenced to an indeterminate term of 30  years to life on count 1 (irrespective of the enhancements that were also imposed), rather than a term of 15 years to  life. The superior court clerk shall [*36]  prepare an amended abstract of judgment and forward a certified copy to  the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed. PERREN, J. We concur: GILBERT, P. J. YEGAN, J.  2017 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 2838, *34",1
"People v. Turuc, 2023 Ill. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1965","[*1] PRESIDING JUSTICE McLAREN delivered the  judgment of the court. Justices Schostok and Kennedy  concurred in the judgment. ORDER  1 Held: The trial court properly denied, following a third- stage hearing, defendant's postconviction claim that trial  counsel was ineffective for failing to seek dismissal of a  charge of criminal sexual assault because a sheriff's  detective falsely testified to the grand jury that the  victim, a teenage runaway, had lived at defendant's  substance abuse recovery home after the victim  reached out to him. There was no prejudice from the  false statement because there was other evidence to  satisfy the element that defendant held a position of  trust as to the victim-i.e., the detective's testimony that  the victim sought help from defendant, whom the victim  believed was a substance abuse counselor, and that  they spent two days together and stayed at a motel.  2 Defendant, James W. Turuc, appeals from a  judgment, entered after an evidentiary hearing, denying his petition for relief under the Post-Conviction  Hearing Act (Act) (725 ILCS 5/122-1 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U et seq. (West 2020)). Defendant contends that he  proved that his trial counsel was ineffective forfailing to  move to dismiss a charge-of which he was later  convicted-based on false testimony [*2]  presented to  the grand jury. We affirm.  3 I. BACKGROUND  4 On June 27, 2007, the State filed a four-count  indictment against defendant. Counts I and II both  alleged criminal sexual assault in violation of section 12- 13(a)(4) of the Criminal Code of 1961 (720 ILCS 5/12/- 13(a)(4) (West 2006)). Count I alleged that defendant,  ""on or about April 16, 2007[,] through April 17, 2007,""  placed his penis in K.P.'s mouth, while defendant was  45 years old, K.P. was at least 13 years old but less  than 18 years old, and defendant ""held, as a substance  abuse treatment counselor, a position of trust in relation  to [K.P]."" Count II was identical to count I except that it  alleged that defendant placed his penis into K.P.'s anus.  Counts III and IV charged aggravated criminal sexual  abuse (id. 12-16(d)) based on the acts alleged,  respectively, in counts I and II, but without alleging a  position of trust.  5 On August 7, 2007, defendant moved to dismiss  counts I and II, alleging that the State did not prove the  element that defendant held a position of trust as a  substance abuse counselor, because the grand jury  heard evidence only that K.P. believed defendant was a  Page 2 of 11 substance abuse counselor, not that he was one in fact.  The motion alleged no other basis for dismissal. The  trial [*3]  court denied the motion.  6 After a jury trial, defendant was acquitted of counts I  and III but convicted of counts II and IV. The trial court  merged count IV into count II and sentenced defendant  to 15 years in prison. On appeal, he contended that (1)  he was denied his right to a speedy trial and his counsel  was ineffective for failing to seek dismissal on that  ground, (2) he was not proved guilty beyond a  reasonable doubt, as the State did not prove that he  held a position of trust, and (3) the trial court  2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U considered  an  improper  sentencing  factor.  See  generally People v. Turuc, 2012 IL App (2d) 100846-U.  We affirmed. Id. 1, 23.  7 In 2013, defendant initiated a proceeding under the  Act. Eventually, he filed a second amended petition,  alleging in part that his trial counsel had been ineffective  for ""failing to properly allege in a motion to dismiss  indictment [sic] that the grand jury was misled by false  testimony and deceptive evidence,"" i.e., the testimony of  Andrea Usry, a Lake County sheriff's detective, that K.P.  had stayed at defendant's substance abuse recovery  home in Wisconsin. Defendant noted that a trial court  may dismiss an indictment if the defendant establishes  that he has suffered a prejudicial denial of due [*4]   process. See People v. Oliver, 368 Ill. App. 3d 690, 694  (2006). He argued that the State violates due process if  it intentionally misleads the grand jury, uses known  perjured or false testimony, or presents other deceptive  or inaccurate evidence. See People v.DiVincenzo, 183  Ill. 2d 239, 257 (1998).1  8 To lay out the factual underpinnings of defendant's  postconviction claim, we reference in part the transcript  of the grand jury proceeding and other documents  attached to the second amended petition.  9 We begin with the grand jury transcript. Usry was the  sole witness before the grand jury. She testified that, in  April 2007, she started investigating K.P., a runaway  minor. Usry was already acquainted with K.P. from her  work as a school outreach officer in his district. She  learned that K.P.'s friend had received a call from a  phone that she then traced to defendant. She learned  that defendant was running a purported substance  abuse recovery home, ""Hote Haus,"" in Wisconsin.  Eventually, she spoke with K.P. K.P. told her that, at an  Alateen meeting, he told a woman that his parents had  kicked him out of the house. The woman gave him a  business card for Hote Haus, 1The second amended petition raised several other  claims, but they are not at issue here. 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U with defendant's name on it. She [*5]  told K.P. that he  could call the number and that defendant could help  him. At the time, defendant was 45 years old.  10 The examination continued: ""Q. And among other things [K.P] told you that he had  been with the defendant? A. Yes. Q. He had been living in that substance abuse recovery  home in Wisconsin? A. Yes. Q. And among other places that the defendant took him  was to a motel in Winthrop Harbor, Illinois? A. That's correct. Q. That's in Lake County? A. That is. Q. And that was on the evening of April 16, through the  morning of April 17, of 2007? A. Correct."" (Emphasis added.)  11 Usry testified that K.P. said that, late on April 16 or  early on April 17, 2007, defendant entered the bedroom  that he shared with K.P. and placed K.P.'s penis into his  mouth, without his consent. Soon, K.P. said he had ""  'had enough,' "" entered the other bedroom, and went to  sleep. Several hours later, as K.P. woke up, defendant  removed K.P.'s pants, rolled him over, and placed his  penis into K.P.'s anus, without K.P.'s consent.  12 Usry testified that she investigated Hote Haus  further and learned that defendant ""was running kind of  a halfway house for men that were recovering from  drugs and alcohol."" He rented 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U  [*6] the house and rented rooms to men undergoing  Page 3 of 11 recovery. Usry also found a web page that defendant  had created for Hote Haus. Her testimony continued: ""Q. [The web page] describe[d] Hote Haus as a  residence for people recovering from alcohol and who  need assistance and support of living situations in order  to facilitate the transition into independent community  life? A. Yes. Q. And [K.P.] believed that the defendant was actually a  substance abuse counselor? A. Correct.""  13  The  second  amended  petition's  allegations  continued as follows. Usry's testimony that K.P. told her  that he stayed at Hote Haus ""supported the inference  presented to the grand jury that [defendant] held himself  out as a substance abuse treatment counselor."" But  when she provided this testimony, Usry knew that it was  false. On April 30, 2007, Usry interviewed K.P. and  generated a lengthy report based thereon. Usry's report  never indicated that K.P. said or implied that he had  stayed at Hote Haus. On May 2, 2007, K.P. submitted a  written statement, which did not indicate that he stayed  at Hote Haus. Moreover, at defendant's trial, K.P.  testified that he never stayed at Hote Haus.  14 We summarize K.P.'s statement and Usry's [*7]   report to the extent necessary here.  15 In his statement, K.P. wrote that, on Friday, April 13,  2007, he ran away from home and went to an Alateen  meeting."" There, he asked about finding a place to stay.  A woman handed him a card with defendant's name and  phone number. K.P. called defendant, who picked him  up and let him stay at his home on Saturday night. On  Sunday, he stayed with defendant and several other  people in defendant's home. On Monday, he and  defendant met with Mike, a friend of 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U defendant. Afterward, defendant and K.P. spent the  night at the LaVilla Motel in Zion, where defendant  sexually assaulted K.P. on Monday evening (oral) and  Tuesday morning (anal). On Tuesday, after meeting  with Mike again, he and defendant stayed at the Skyline  Motel in Zion. On Wednesday, they met with Mike, after  which defendant and K.P. drove to a funeral in  Kentucky. On Friday, April 20, 2007, defendant drove  them back to Illinois, where they stayed at a motel. On  Saturday, K.P. stayed with a person he had met that  day. On Sunday, defendant drove K.P. home.  16 In her report, Usry disclosed the following  statements by K.P. After defendant picked him up on  Friday, April 13, 2017, they went to an [*8]  Alcoholics  Anonymous (AA) meeting until 1:00 a.m. on Saturday.  They then slept at defendant's home in Wisconsin. On  Saturday, defendant drove K.P. to Hote Haus to meet  some residents, then spent time with him at the home of  defendant's friend Mark. Defendant and K.P. spent  Saturday night at defendant's home. On Sunday, after  he and defendant met with Mike and Janice, also a  friend of defendant, he and defendant spent the night at  Janice's home. On Monday, after meeting with Mike,  they spent the night at the LaVilla Motel in Zion, where  defendant sexually assaulted K.P. On Tuesday night,  after spending the day together, they stayed at the  Skyline Motel in Zion without incident. On Wednesday  morning, defendant, having learned that his former AA  sponsor had passed away in Kentucky, drove to the  wake with K.P. and stayed two days without incident.  They returned to Illinois on Friday and stayed overnight  at a motel near the Wisconsin border. On Saturday  night, K.P. stayed at the home of a new acquaintance.  On Sunday, defendant drove K.P. home.  17 The second amended petition further alleged as  follows. In moving to dismiss the indictment, defendant's  trial counsel never alleged that Usry [*9]  provided false  or misleading testimony to the grand jury, even though  K.P.'s statement and Usry's report proved that K.P.  never 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U stayed at Hote Haus. The introduction of this false and  misleading evidence, even if unintentional, violated due  process. The violation was prejudicial, as the remaining  evidence would not have resulted in an indictment. An  element of count II, of which defendant was convicted,  was that defendant occupied a position of trust in  relation to K.P. At the grand jury proceeding, the State  presented evidence that defendant held himself out as a  substance abuse counselor and that he induced K.P. to  believe this by boarding him at Hote Haus. Without the  latter fact, the evidence would not have established  probable cause to find a position of trust and, hence, the  grand jury would not have indicted him on count II.  Thus, trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to  dismiss the indictment based on the false testimony,  and appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue  Page 4 of 11 that trial counsel was ineffective.  18 The petition proceeded to an evidentiary hearing.  Usry was the sole witness. She testified as follows. On  April 16, 2007, she began investigating K.P. [*10]  After  learning that K.P. had called a friend on defendant's  phone, and informing herself about Hote Haus, she  called defendant's number and left a message  requesting information on K.P. On April 22, 2007,  deputies brought K.P. and defendant to the sheriff's  office, where defendant spoke to Usry, but K.P. would  not. On April 30, 2007, after learning more about Hote  Haus, Usry interviewed K.P.  19 According to Usry, K.P. recounted that, after he and  defendant met, they overnighted at defendant's home in  Wisconsin. They also spent an unspecified number of  nights at Janice's home. During the daytimes, K.P. and  defendant attended several AA meetings and met with  friends of defendant. On April 16, 2007, K.P. and  defendant overnighted at the LaVilla Motel, where  defendant sexually assaulted K.P. On April 17, they  stayed at the nearby Skyline Motel without incident. On  April 18, defendant drove K.P. to Kentucky, where they  attended a funeral 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U and lodged together for two nights without incident.  When they drove back to Illinois on Friday, April 20, they  stayed together at a motel near the Wisconsin-Illinois  border without incident.  20 The examination continued: ""Q. So, during this time period, [*11]  [K.P.] never told  you that he; *** had spent any nights at Hotehaus [sic];  is that correct? A. That is correct. Q. He never told you that he was inside Hotehaus [sic];  is that correct? A. That's correct, I believe. Q. He did tell you that he was driven to that location on  two occasions; is that- A. Yes. Q. -correct? A. Yes. Q. Okay. But he didn't actually go inside the building; is  that right? A. To my understanding, no; or, if he did, I don't believe  he told me that he had gone inside. Q. Okay. *** to clarify: What [K.P.] told you *** was that  he hadn't gone inside? A. (Nodding) MR. ATWOOD [(DEFENSE ATTORNEY)]: Judge, can  the record reflect that the witness nodded her head? THE COURT: The record will so reflect.""  21 Usry testified that, later on, she went to Hote Haus  and observed its interior. In the interview, K.P. did not  describe the house's interior or point out anything that  Usry observed later in her visit. The examination  continued: 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U ""Q. During your interview *** did [K.P.] ever make any  statements to you that during that time period he was  engaged in *** what you could classify as substance  abuse counseling conversations with [defendant]? A. *** [F]rom my history of knowing [K.P.], I knew [*12]   that he was going to meetings for those issues. And  what he described was that [defendant] was helping  him. And, so, from what I knew of [K.P.] and what he  was going through and that that was a recovery house, I  umbrellaed [sic] that as that would be [sic] their  discussions; around sobriety.""  22 Asked whether K.P. elaborated on his statement  that defendant was ""helping"" him, Usry testified, ""No, no  more than that [K.P.] had received the card; and that  [defendant] helps people who are in recovery."" Asked  whether K.P. ever told her that defendant was his  ""substance abuse counselor,"" Usry testified, ""He did not  use those words, no.""  23 Usry testified that, before the grand jury, she said  nothing about K.P.'s attendance with defendant at AA  meetings. Further, other than the overnight at the  LaVilla Motel, she was not asked how long K.P. was  with defendant or where they stayed together. K.P. did  not tell her directly that defendant provided him with  shelter, food, and transportation. However, Usry inferred  as much based on K.P.'s age (14 years old) at the time  of the incident and his statement that he had no money  of his own during this period. Usry confirmed that  defendant paid for the [*13]  room at one motel where  Page 5 of 11 he and K.P. stayed. K.P. told Usry that, other than the  night of April 21-22, 2007, he and defendant stayed  overnight together each night while K.P. remained away  from home in late 2007. K.P. never told Usry that he and  defendant ever stayed at Hote Haus.  24 On cross-examination, Usry testified as follows. In  his interview, K.P. said that defendant took him to  several places for AA meetings. K.P. told Usry that,  when he ran away, he took no money with him but that  defendant and Mike, who were running a check-fraud  scheme, set up a 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U bank account for him. Asked whether K.P. gave her  ""any information that he understood about [Hote Haus],""  Usry testified, ""I don't recall."" K.P. said that the woman  at the Alateen meeting who gave him defendant's  business card told him that defendant ""had a sober- living place."" Asked to explain her grand jury testimony  that K.P. had believed that defendant was a substance  abuse counselor, Usry testified: ""A. Given the totality of the situation and of the  information that was piecemeal of saying [sic] that he  got a card. And I believe from reviewing my reports, *** the card ***  said counselor on it, perhaps. That [defendant] has a  place [*14]  for people that are recovering from alcohol  and drugs, for them to stay. When  I  interviewed-because  I  had  interviewed  [defendant] prior to [the] Grand Jury-when I interviewed  him, [defendant] told me that he was a counselor. And  [K.P.] kept saying that-that he gives people help.""  25 Usry testified that, during their interview, K.P. told  her more than once that defendant was helping him.  K.P. did not use the specific term ""substance abuse  counselor.""  26 The cross-examination continued: ""Q. Now, defense counsel asked you about the  statement regarding [K.P.] living at [Hote Haus]; and you answering [sic] affirmatively in  front of the Grand Jury? A. Yes. Q. Why did you answer affirmatively if you knew he  wasn't in the physical Hotehaus [sic] home? 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U A. Because, as stated in my reports, when I interviewed  [defendant], he stated that [K.P.] had told him that he  was 17, and that he was going to be 18 in a week or  two; and that he had to be 18 to live in the house. And during the interview, [defendant] told me that for the  first week that any one new *** wants to be a part of  Hotehaus [sic] has [sic] to stay with him 24/7. So, for me that was 24/7, the umbrella of-of the  Hotehaus [sic]. If it had not [*15]  been for the Hotehaus  [sic], [K.P.] would not have called; right? I mean that's- that was under the umbrella. I guess I look at it like-can I use an analogy? Q. If it explains why you believed- A. Okay. Q. -why you answered that affirmatively, yes. A. So, you are in jail. You have drug charges. And ***  you are sentenced or sent to Haymarket for three  months. Are you under the authority of Haymarket, or  are you still under the authority of the Court? Q. Okay. A. So, the Court still has an overreaching arm into ***  what that defendant can do while they are at  Haymarket; like, they can't have unsupervised time out  when they earn it, as opposed to people that were not  court-ordered.""  27 Usry testified that defendant told her that, to live at  his facility, a person must first be with an employee 24/7  for a week. While K.P. was with him, he was the only  employee.  28 Usry testified on redirect as follows. At the grand  jury proceeding, the prosecutor asked her specifically  whether K.P. told her that ""[h]e had been living in [Hote  Haus]"" and she answered, 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U ""Yes."" Asked whether she agreed that K.P. ""had not  been living at that facility,"" Usry testified, ""He had not  been staying in that physical facility, [*16]  correct.""  29 Asked whether defendant ever told her that he was  a substance abuse counselor, Usry testified that he did.  When asked about her testimony at defendant's trial- Page 6 of 11 that defendant told her he helped people stay clean and  sober but was not licensed as a counselor-Usry said  she did not recall giving that testimony.  30 Asked whether K.P. ever told her he was planning to  move into Hote Haus, Usry testified that she did not  recall. After refreshing her recollection with her report,  Usry testified that K.P. had not told her he planned to  stay at Hote Haus. K.P. did say that defendant would  help him find a place to stay.  31 The trial court admitted copies of the grand jury  transcript, Usry's report of her interview with K.P., K.P.'s  statement, and an excerpt from Usry's trial testimony.  32 After hearing arguments, the trial court denied the  petition. In explaining its reasons, the trial court framed  the issue as follows. If the court found that false  statements had been presented to the grand jury,  whether intentionally or otherwise, it had to determine  solely from the grand jury transcript whether, absent the  false statements, there was sufficient evidence to indict  defendant. If [*17]  so, there was no prejudice and a  motion to dismiss would have failed.  33 Next, the trial court found that Usry's grand jury  testimony that K.P. had believed that defendant was a  substance abuse counselor was not false. The court  explained that K.P.'s belief did not depend on whether  defendant actually was a substance abuse counselor,  much less on whether he was licensed.  34 The trial court then turned to Usry's grand jury  testimony that K.P. had been living at Hote Haus. The  trial court found this testimony ""[was], in fact, false."" The  court specifically found: 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U ""[K.P.] was at the Hote Haus, but he did not apparently  go in and he certainly was not living there."" Therefore,  the court noted, it would consider the sufficiency of the  grand jury evidence absent Usry's false statement. The  court continued: ""So I am going to determine whether or not I believe that  [K.P.] believed that the defendant was [a] substance  abuse counselor and the answer is yes, he did. Clearly  he did, and *** this case has a plethora of various  reasons why he believed [defendant] was a substance  abuse counselor, why he believed that he was in a  position of trust, but the whole context of the reason he  was with him [*18]  was because he believed he was  some form of substance abuse counselor. It was never testified to the Grand Jury that [K.P.]  believed [that] the defendant was a trained substance  abuse counselor. It was never testified [that K.P.]  believed that the defendant was a licensed substance  abuse counselor. That he was a substance abuse  counselor. Once again that is somebody who counsels  somebody on substance abuse. So the entire context under which he met [sic] after he'd  run away was at an Alateen meeting for substance  abuse. He is given a card *** identifying [defendant] with  the Hote Haus *** it was clear Hote Haus is something  and he can help you. Obviously that was the context. He  then called the defendant. He was picked up by the  defendant. He was at various points taken into  substance abuse meetings. He was taken to the Hote  Haus. He didn't go in. He was told the defendant ran it.  The entire context of the relationship here was that  [defendant] was a substance abuse counselor of some  form. There's no doubt *** for those reasons plus all the  reasons the Appellate Court set forth *** that [K.P.] did  believe that. So I decline *** to hold that was a  misstatement to the Grand Jury, *** but [*19]  let's say I  agreed *** that [K.P.] believed that the defendant was 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U a substance abuse counselor [sic] would there be  enough remaining for the indictment to stand. So, *** I don't think this was willful. I do think it was  sloppy and I do think it was lazy. It started with the  prosecutor and extended to the deputy. I see this  happen too often *** people clearly didn't read reports very carefully and  can ask questions that were wrong and the police too  often say yes, yes, yes, agreeing with everything also  not having reviewed the report. I don't think it was purposeful because there was an  abundance of evidence showing the position is of trust.  So, it would have been completely unnecessary. In  addition it was demonstrably capable of being rebutted.  [Usry's] report never said [K.P.] stated that. [Usry's] own  report never stated he was living there. He was there,  but he wasn't living there. And this by the way is not the  reason for my ruling. I am going to make that finding  [that] I don't think it was done purposely. That doesn't  mean the indictment couldn't be dismissed of course. So, what is left, let's assume I agree with the defense ***  Page 7 of 11 what is left is the child is a 14-year-old runaway. [*20]   *** not somebody who knew the defendant at all. *** So  a runaway, 14 years old was with [defendant] and using  his phone. Furthermore, [defendant], who [was] 45 years [old] at  the time, was taking the 14-year-old to various different  places including, once again I am not going to consider  the recovery part in Wisconsin because that's wrong, to  a motel in Winthrop Harbor. No other adults around, no  parents around, not at this house, not somebody he  knew. He was, therefore, making decisions, transporting  the child, deciding to stay at a motel, giving a phone  number where he could be reached which is his phone  number, in essence he was 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U in loco parentis in every way to [K.P.], given the age,  given lack of other parents, given his legal status as [a]  runaway, given him being away from home in need of  substance abuse treatment, for all those reasons I find  that even were I to agree that [K.P.] did or didn't believe  the defendant was a substance abuse counselor, even if  I agree with the defense on that I still find that there is  sufficient evidence in the remainder of the transcript to  sustain the indictments. For that reason, the defense has failed to show  ineffective assistance of counsel  under [*21]  either *** incompetence [or prejudice] ***  so the motion [sic] is denied.""   35 This timely appeal followed.   36 II. ANALYSIS   37 On appeal, defendant contends that he proved that  his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to  dismiss count II of the indictment on the ground that it  was obtained through Usry's false and deceptive  testimony that K.P. stayed at Hote Haus.  38 At an evidentiary hearing in a proceeding under the  Act, the defendant must prove, by the preponderance of  the evidence, a constitutional violation in the proceeding  that resulted in his conviction or sentence. People v.  Coleman, 2013 IL 113307, 92. We must accept the trial  court's factual findings unless they are manifestly  erroneous. People v. Carter, 2017 IL App (1st) 151297,  132. We review de novo issues of law. People v.  English, 2013 IL 112890, 23.  39 To establish that trial counsel was ineffective,  defendant had to prove that (1) counsel performed  unreasonably and (2) it is reasonably probable that, but  for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the  proceeding would have been different. Strickland v.  Washington, 466 U.S. 688, 694 (1984); People v.  Albanese, 104 Ill. 2d 504, 525 (1984).  2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U  40  In  contending  that  trial  counsel  performed  unreasonably in failing to move to dismiss count II on  the basis of Usry's false statement, defendant first notes  that, as the trial court found, the statement was  false [*22]  and deceptive. K.P. never stayed at Hote  Haus, and Usry had no basis to testify that he did or  even that he ever went inside the building.  41 At the evidentiary hearing, Usry admitted that K.P.  never stayed at Hote Haus and that she had no basis to  believe even that he ever went inside. In explaining why  she told the grand jury that K.P. stayed there, she  construed ""staying"" at Hote Haus to include staying in  totally separate locations, mostly in other states, with  the person who ran Hote Haus. Needless to say, the  grand jurors probably did not construe her testimony in  this unique and tortured manner. By testifying that K.P.  stayed at Hote Haus-or, perhaps we should say,  agreeing with the prosecutor's testimony that he did- Usry implied to any reasonable hearer that K.P. spent at  least one night there. Thus, defendant contends that (1)  the trial court erred in finding that Usry did not commit  perjury; and (2) even if Usry's statement was not  perjurious, it was false and deceptive, which warranted  moving to dismiss count II.2  42 Based on the foregoing, defendant contends that  trial counsel performed unreasonably because, from  K.P.'s statement and Usry's police report, counsel knew  or [*23]  should have known that K.P. did not stay at  Hote Haus and that Usry had no basis to testify that he  had. Defendant contends that counsel's mistake was  prejudicial because, absent the statement that K.P. had  been a resident of the substance abuse facility, there  was no probable cause to believe that defendant had  held a 2Third, defendant contends that, although there is  conflicting authority on whether a subsequent conviction  cures a due process violation such as the one here, the  better rule is that it does not. In view of our resolution of  the appeal, we need not address this issue.  2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U Page 8 of 11 position of trust relative to K.P. Defendant contends that  Usry testified to almost nothing about the relationship  between defendant and K.P. except that defendant took  K.P. to a motel one night and that K.P. believed that  defendant was a substance abuse counselor.  43 The State responds first that the trial court properly  found that Usry's testimony that K.P. stayed at Hote  Hause, although false, was not perjury. Based on this,  the State argues that there was no due process violation  or that, at the least, the dismissal would not have been  with prejudice. The State contends second that the court  properly [*24]  found no prejudice because sufficient  other evidence supported count II's allegation of a  position of trust. Finally, returning to the performance  prong, the State argues that trial counsel's choice of  strategy was reasonable. Thus, the State concludes,  defendant did not prove either prong of the Strickland  test for ineffective assistance.3  44 The nub of this appeal is whether, absent the false  testimony, there was sufficient evidence for the grand  jury to find probable cause that defendant occupied ""a  position of trust"" relative to K.P. See 720 ILCS 5/12- 13(a)(4) (West 2006) (a defendant commits criminal  sexual assault when, inter alia, the defendant ""held a position of trust,  authority or supervision in relation to the victim[ ]"").  Obviously, the answer to this question depends on the  meaning of the term ""position of trust."" Yet neither party  attempts to define this term according to case authority  or established principles of statutory construction.  Defendant says no more than that the grand jury heard  ""no evidence *** from which it could conclude that  [defendant] being a substance abuse counselor 3The State also contends that the trial court properly  found that Usry testified truthfully that K.P. believed  defendant [*25]  was a substance abuse counselor.  Defendant, however, concedes this point. 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U meant that K.P. trusted him."" Defendant appears to  imply that, under the statute, the minor's trust in the  adult is both necessary and sufficient to create a  position of trust. Not only is this dubious on its face, but  defendant cites no authority for it. The State, for its part,  does not address the meaning of ""position of trust"" at  all.  45 The meaning of ""position of trust"" is crucial to  deciding whether the grand jury heard sufficient  evidence of this element. Therefore, we shall address  the issue without the parties' assistance. Fortunately,  the case law is well established, consistent, and  straightforward.  46 The stem case is People v. Secor, 279 Ill. App. 3d  389 (1996). There, the defendant was convicted of  criminal sexual assault based in part on the allegation  that he occupied ""a position of trust, authority, or  supervision"" (720 ILCS 5/12-13(a)(4) (West 1994)) over  the minor victim. Secor at 391-92. On appeal, he contended that (1) the  evidence did not prove beyond a reasonabledoubt any  of the three alternative relationships (trust, authority,  supervision) with the victim and (2) section 12-13(a)(4) was unconstitutionally vague. Id.  at 392-93.  47 On the first issue, the appellate court noted the  following [*26]  trial evidence. The 14-year-old victim  testified that he and his 11-year-old brother spent a  night at the defendant's house visiting his son. Id. at  391. The victim had been there numerous times and  spent the night there twice. Id. While the victim lay in bed, the defendant sexually  fondled him several times. Id. The victim's mother  testified that her family had known the defendant for  about 10 years and that her children had overnighted at  his house approximately six times. Id. at 392.  48 The appellate court held that the State had proved  beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's relationship  to the victim fit within section 12-13(a)(4), as the  evidence ""raise[d] a strong inference of trust and  supervision."" (Emphasis added.) Id. at 394. Defendant's  function in the relationship could be characterized, ""at a  minimum, as that of baby sitter [sic] or chaperone.""  2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U Id. On the evening at issue, he assumed ""a parental or  quasi-parental role."" Id. Further, his family and the  victim's family had been friends for 10 years, which  would likely have generated mutual trust. Id.  49 On the second issue, because there was no  statutory definition of ""position of trust, authority or  supervision in relation to the victim,"" the court  relied [*27]  on the presumption that words used in a  statute have their ordinary and popularly understood  meanings. Id. at 391, 396 (citing Page 9 of 11 People v Caffrey, 97 Ill. 2d 526, 530 (1983)). The court  relied on a dictionary definition of "" 'trust' "" as ""  '[c]onfidence in the integrity, ability, character, and truth  of a person ***[;] [s]omething committed into the care of another.' "" Id. at  396 (quoting American Heritage Collegiate Dictionary  1300 (2d ed. 1985)). The court held that section 13- 4(a)(4) was not unconstitutionally vague. Id. The court  continued: ""It is evident that, in enacting section 12-3(a)(4), the  legislature sought to prevent sex offenses by *** those  in whom [a] child has placed his trust, such as the  defendant. It is the trust that makes the child particularly  vulnerable, and it is the betrayal of that trust that makes  the offense particularly devastating."" Id.  50 Several appellate court opinions have adopted  Secor's definition of ""trust"" and its explanation of the  legislature's decision to increase the grade of a sex  offense when the defendant occupies a position of trust  in relation to the victim. See People v. Miki, 2020 IL App  (2d) 190862,  55; People v. Feller, 2012 IL App (3d) 110164, 14-15;  People v. Reynolds, 294 Ill. App. 3d 58, 65, 68-69  (1997).4 4On defendant's direct appeal, we also followed Secor  and its reasoning. See Turuc, 2012 IL App (2d) 100846, 11. 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U  51 With this necessary groundwork laid, we now turn to  the specific issues [*28]  raised on appeal.  52 The parties disagree on whether the trial court's  finding that Usry's false testimony was not perjury was  manifestly erroneous. We need not resolve this  disagreement. We note the general principle that, in  addition to the grounds specified by statute (see 725  ILCS 5/114-1(a) (West 2020)), an indictment may be  dismissed if the defendant established with certainty a  violation of due process. See People v. Wolfe, 114 Ill.  App. 3d 841, 844-45 (1983). In DiVincenzo, our  supreme court stated, ""The due process rights of a  defendant may be violated if the prosecutor deliberately  or intentionally misleads the grand jury, uses known  perjured or false testimony, orpresents other deceptive  or inaccurate evidence."" (Emphasis added.) DiVincenzo,  183 Ill. 2d at257. This plainly means that, to establish a  violation, a defendant need not establish that the State's  use of deceptive or inaccurate evidence was intentional.  See People v. Basile, 2022 IL App (2d) 210740, 16, No.  129026 (Jan. 25, 2023) (pet. for leave to appeal  allowed); Oliver, 368 Ill. App. 3d at 696.  53 As the trial court properly found that Usry's  testimony that K.P. stayed at Hote Haus was false and  deceptive, defendant established a due process  violation. We next consider whether defendant proved  that the violation was prejudicial.  54 We note that the trial court found first that Usry  testified  truthfully  that  K.P.  believed [*29]   that  defendant was a substance abuse counselor. Defendant  does not contend that this finding was manifestly  erroneous, and we conclude that it was more than  sufficiently supported by Usry's grand jury testimony  about what K.P. told her of the events at the Alateen  meeting that led to his contact with defendant. Further,  K.P.'s statement, Usry's report, and testimony from  defendant's trial bolstered the court's finding that Usry  was truthful in testifying that K.P. believed defendant  was a substance abuse counselor. 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U  55 Next, the trial court found that Usry's testimony,  even absent the false statement that K.P. had stayed at  Hote Haus, established probable cause to believe that  defendant occupied a position of trust relative to K.P.  This conclusion was well founded. K.P. entrusted  himself to defendant's care by calling him and placing  confidence in him to provide him with urgently needed  help, i.e., a place to stay indefinitely. Given the context  of the call and defendant's occupation as shown on his  business card, defendant likely understood that K.P.  would look to him for help with his substance abuse  problem. It was highly probable that, when K.P. called  defendant, they discussed [*30]  their mutual interest in  defendant's provision of counseling to K.P.  56 Moreover, as the trial court noted, Usry's further  testimony, limited as it was, bolstered this evidence of a  relationship of trust. Partly, this came from the unequal  positions of K.P. and defendant: one was a teenage  runaway in need of shelter and lacking any means to  support himself on his own, and the other was a 45- year-old who took him in and supported him. K.P.'s  dependence on defendant implied a relationship of trust- he had to trust defendant to do what the minor could not  do himself, and defendant knew it. The subsequent  events bore this out. For some period, even if only a day  or  two,  defendant  decided  on  K.P.'s  housing,  transportation, and food, paying for those essentials. Page 10 of 11  57 Defendant contends that Usry's testimony ""did not  include the information that K.P. and [defendant] spent  days together during which [defendant] fed and housed  K.P.-information that would have provided probable  cause that [defendant] held a position of trust.""  Defendant's assertion is correct in the most literal  sense: Usry did not testify directly that K.P. and  defendant spent any specific number of days together  during which [*31]  defendant fed and housed K.P. (as  we shall note later, this omission is surprising and  disturbing.) However, Usry testified to facts from which  this conclusion was a reasonable inference-indeed, the  most reasonable. A young runaway 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U with no means of supporting himself sought shelter from  an adult who took him in and accompanied him at,  ""among other places,"" a motel where they shared a  room. Usry's testimony did not specify that K.P. and  defendant were together on days other than April 16  and 17, 2007, but it provided probable cause to believe  that,  at  least  for  these  two  days,  defendant  accompanied K.P. and fed and housed him-which, he  now grants, established a position of trust. Moreover,  the mention of ""other places"" (albeit in a leading  question by the prosecutor) allowed an inference that  K.P. and defendant were together for more than two  days.  58 Our conclusion is consistent with the determinative  case law that we (if not the parties) have discussed.  Even from Usry's limited testimony (minus the false  statement), there was probable cause to believe that  K.P. placed "" '[c]onfidence in the integrity, ability,  character, and truth of a person' "" and "" 'committed [his  well-being] into [*32]  the care of another.' "" Secor, 279  Ill. App. 3d at 396 (quoting American Heritage Collegiate  Dictionary 1300 (2d ed. 1985)). Usry did not testify to a  long-standing relationship of dependence of K.P. on  defendant, but the case law did not require one. In  Secor, the defendant was alone with the victim for an  evening, but the court still concluded that there was a  position of trust because their relationship was, ""at a  minimum, as that of baby sitter [sic] or chaperone."" Id. at  394. Even counting only the events of April 16-17, 2007,  defendant's relationship to the victim was at least as  extensive as that which Secor concluded was sufficient  under section 12-3(a)(4). (Although the Secor court also  noted that the defendant's family and the victim's family  had long known and interacted with each other, it  appears that this was not crucial for the court but only  further evidence of a relationship of trust. See id.). Also,  in Feller, the defendant assisted a blind girl with swimming  in a lake and then sexually assaulted her,the court held  that a relationship of trust was proved beyond a  reasonable doubt because (1) the victim, who had not  known the defendant before the day of the offense,  testified that she would 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U not have gone swimming with someone whom  she [*33]  did not trust; and (2) common sense dictated  that guiding a blind person into an unknown body of  water established a position of trust. Feller, 2012 IL App  (3d) 110164, 4, 6, 14. The duration of their  acquaintanceship was not material. Id. at 15. Again, the present case, which required only  probable cause and not proof beyond a reasonable  doubt, presented facts at least as compelling for finding  a position of trust.  59 We turn to the ultimate issue: whether defendant  proved that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to  move to dismiss count II based on Usry's false grand  jury testimony. The answer is no. Defendant did not  show a reasonable probability that, had trial counsel  filed the motion, the result of the proceeding would have  been different. Even excluding the false testimony, there  was ample evidence to indict defendant for criminal  sexual assault based on a position of trust. Thus, the  trial court properly denied his postconviction petition.  60 By affirming the judgment, however, we do not  mean to condone the provision of false information to  the grand jury. Although the trial court did not find that  Usry's  misstatement  was  intentional,  the  court  concluded that her lapse resulted from conduct that was  ""sloppy"" [*34]  and ""lazy"" on the part of both her and the  prosecutor. We agree. The prosecutor essentially fed  Usry much of her testimony, most problematically in the  question that triggered Usry's false statement. This  question was not merely leading-it was really a  statement of fact with a raised inflection at the end.  Much more importantly, it was a false statement of fact.  Usry, for whatever reason, agreed with the blatant  misstatement.  61 Moreover, the State made only a modest effort to  present evidence to the grand jury that defendant  occupied a position of trust as to K.P. Usry's lengthy  report detailed how defendant and K.P. spent more than  a week rarely separate from each other, traveling  Page 11 of 11 together, attending AA meetings and other activities  together, and lodging together. The prosecutor asked  about none of 2023 IL App (2d) 220374-U this other than the initial contact between K.P. and  defendant and the events of April 16-17 at the motel and  otherwise made only a cryptic reference to ""other places  that the defendant took [K.P.]"" By adding easily  available evidence, the State could have avoided the  postconviction claim that led to this appeal. Judicial  resources have been expended to resolve an issue that  could have [*35]  easily been avoided.",0
"Phillips v. Cap. Internal Med. Assocs., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217760","[*1] OPINION This is an action bringing federal and state claims  against a doctor and his employer under Title VII of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, and the  Michigan state equivalent. Plaintiffs, a nurse practitioner  and a doctor, both of whom worked with or for  Defendants, bring suit on counts of assault, battery,  hostile work environment, and intentional infliction of  emotional distress. Before the Court is a motion to set  aside the default (ECF No. 16) entered against the  individual defendant, Joseph Kozlowski. For the reasons  stated below, the Court will grant the motion. I. BACKGROUND Plaintiffs Alexis Phillips and Sarah Denham worked at  Capital Internal Medicine Associates (""CIMA"") between October 2018 and  October 2022. (Compl. ¶¶ 14, 222.) Denham is still  employed as a primary care physician at CIMA, while  Phillips, a nurse practitioner, has since left the practice.  Their allegations stem from their interactions with  another doctor at CIMA, Joseph Kozlowski. Over the  course of four years, Phillips, especially, claims she was  subject to verbal and sometimes physical harassment at  Kozlowski's hands, beginning when she was a student at CIMA under his supervision. Denham, too,  claims  Kozlowski  made  inappropriate  comments  towards her; [*2]  however, her primary allegations  revolve around her efforts to push CIMA leadership to  discipline Dr. Kozlowski. Despite relaying detailed  descriptions of harassment and inappropriate behavior  directed at her and others, Denham says she was  consistently rebuffed or ignored. On April 27, 2023, Phillips and Denham filed a  complaint against CIMA and Kozlowski bringing claims  under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the  Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act (""ELCRA"") - the Michigan  analogue to Title VII. The complaint details six counts  against Dr. Kozlowski: 1) sex discrimination in violation  of Title VII, 2) sex discrimination in violation of the  ELCRA, 3) hostile work environment under Title VII, 4)  hostile work environment under the ELCRA, 5) assault  and battery, and 6) intentional infliction of emotional  distress. (Compl. ¶¶ 225-274.) CIMA filed a timely answer to the complaint (ECF No.  7). Dr. Kozlowski, on the other hand, did not. He was  served by Plaintiffs on June 9, 2023; however, the  summons was botched. Although the caption listed him  as a defendant in the action, it was addressed to CIMA  alone. (Summons, ECF No. 16-3, PageID.181.) Below  the caption, in the section marked ""Proof of Service,""  CIMA was again listed [*3]  as the recipient for the  summons. Likely recognizing the mistake, the process  server - or someone else - crossed out ""Capital Internal  Medicine Associates P.C."" and scrawled ""Joseph  Kozlowski"" above it in pen. Id. Despite the sloppy nature  of the document, court rules dictated that Kozlowski had  Page 2 of 4 until June 30 - twenty-one days from service - to  respond. (Summons.) When no answer came by the  30th, Plaintiffs moved for an entry of default as to  Kozlowski on July 3, 2023. (Appl. for Entry of Default,  ECF No. 12.) The clerk entered the 2 default that same day. (Default, ECF No. 14.) On July  20, 2023, Kozlowski filed a motion to set aside the  default. II. LEGAL STANDARD Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires  that a plaintiff serve a defendant with a summons and a  copy of the complaint. ""Service requirements are more  than mere technicalities, they also implicate due  process."" Savoie v. City of East Lansing, No. 21-2684,  2022 WL 3643339, at *2 (6th Cir. Aug. 24, 2022) (citing  Friedman v. Est. of Presser, 929 F.2d 1151, 1156 (6th  Cir. 1991)). Therefore, courts hold plaintiffs to a high  standard for service of process, requiring ""more than  just actual knowledge of the action by a defendant."" Id.  Without proper service, a court may not exercise  personal jurisdiction over a defendant, and any ruling  made by the court as to that party is void. See Omni  Capital Int'l v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., Ltd., 484 U.S. 97, 104  (1987). When a summons and complaint are [*4]  properly  served on a party, that party must answer or respond  within the time provided by Rule 12 of the Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(1). If the  defendant fails to respond, then the plaintiff may submit  an application for entry of a default with the clerk of  court. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a). A party against whom a  default is entered may move to have the default set  aside under Rule 55(c). The Court ""may set aside an  entry of default for good cause."" Fed R. Civ. P. 55(c). III. ANALYSIS Kozlowski argues that the default entered against him  should be set aside on two bases. First, that the Court  never obtained personal jurisdiction over him because  Plaintiff's service of process was fatally defective under  Rule 4, and any ruling made by the Court against him is  therefore void. Second, that there is good cause for the  Court to set aside the entry of default 3 against him under Rule 55(c). It is not necessary to  address Kozlowski's ""good cause"" argument because  the Court concludes that it lacks personal jurisdiction  over him. A. Plaintiffs' Service of Process was Insufficient and  the Court Lacks Personal Jurisdiction Courts may only exercise personal jurisdiction over a  defendant who has been properly served. See Omni  Capital, 484 U.S. at 104. Rule 4(a)(1) lays out the  necessary contents of a proper summons. One  requirement is it must ""be [*5]  directed to the  defendant."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(a)(1)(B). Kozlowski argues that because his  summons was directed to CIMA in the caption, and only  indirectly named him elsewhere in the document, the  service was constitutionally deficient. Courts are divided on how strictly to hold plaintiffs to the  requirements of Rule 4(a). Compare Birch v. Sprint/Nextel Corp., No. 15-cv-01901,  2016 WL 8652260, at *3 (D. Colo. May 17, 2016)  (holding that naming the wrong defendant in a summons  did not invalidate service of process when the defendant  had actual notice of the suit against him) with Hampton  v. McMillin, No. 3:09-cv-406, 2010 WL 3167885, at *1  (S.D. Miss. July 6, 2010) (holding that process was  insufficient when plaintiff named the wrong party) and  Gartin v. Par Pharm. Cos., Inc., 289 F.App'x 688, 691  n.3 (5th Cir. 2008) (indicating that the sufficiency of  service of process may be challenged where a plaintiff  fails to name the party being served). The Sixth Circuit has never directly addressed this  issue; however, as previously discussed, it has ruled  that compliance with the requirements of Rule 4 is no  mere technicality. In Friedman, the court considered  whether an action should have been dismissed for lack  of personal jurisdiction where the defendant never  returned  an  acknowledgment  of  service  despite  agreement between the parties that the defendants  were aware of the suit and did not suffer prejudice as a  result of the defective process. Friedman, 929 F.2d at  1155. In holding that the district court erred [*6]  by  failing 4 to dismiss the action, the court reasoned that, ""[d]ue to  the integral relationship between service of process and  due process requirements . . . actual knowledge of an  action"" is no cure for ""a technically defective service of  process."" Id. at 1156. The Court in Friedman did not  Page 3 of 4 consider how this principle applied to Rule 4 (a)(1), but  its reasoning aligns with holdings in other circuits in  which the failure to follow each of the requirements of  Rule 4(a)(1)(A)-(G) ""is fatal to the plaintiff's case."" See  Ayres v. Jacobs & Crumplar, P.A., 99 F.2d 565, 569 (3d  Cir. 1996) (dismissing a case when the summons was  not signed and sealed by the clerk as required by Rule  4(a)(1)(F) and (G)). Courts in this Circuit have interpreted Friedman to  impose a strict reading of Rule 4 (a)(1) on plaintiffs. For  example, in In re Bavelis, 453 B.R. 832 (Bankr. S.D.  Ohio 2011), a bankruptcy court in Ohio considered  whether it was appropriate to exercise personal  jurisdiction over defendants who had not been named in  the plaintiff's summons. Relying on Friedman, it  concluded that Sixth Circuit precedent supported the  notion that ""a defendant who is not named in [a] summons has not effectively been served and  service of process on that defendant, as well as the  process itself, is therefore insufficient."" Id. at 862. The  court in Bavelis ultimately held that it lacked personal  jurisdiction over the unnamed defendants [*7]  and  instructed the plaintiff to correct their pleadings and re- serve the defendants. Id. at 865. Here, as in Bavelis, whether or not Defendant Kozlowski  had actual notice of the lawsuit, the summons was  defective. Rule 4(a)(1)(B) requires that a summons be  ""directed to the defendant."" Although Kozlowski is  named as a defendant in the caption of the summons,  the ""TO"" section of the caption only names CIMA. Id.  Kozlowski is further named underneath the caption in  pen over the crossed-out name of his co-defendant.  (Summons,  PageID.181.)  However,  that  section  concerns the process server, not the party to be served,  and it does not clearly state that 5 the summons is ""directed to"" Kozlowski. Although  Kozlowski might have been able to glean who the  defendants were supposed to be from the contents of  the complaint and the context of the summons, Rule  4(a)(1)(B) requires more explicit language. Plaintiffs contend that this case is distinguishable from  Bavelis. They point to Conner-Cooley v. AIG Life  Brokerage, 282 F.R.D. 431 (E.D. Wis. 2012), as a more  appropriatecomparison. In Conner-Cooley, the court  entered a default and default judgment against a  defendant who never responded to the plaintiff's  complaint  which  clearly  identified  the  intended  defendant. In seeking to have the defaults set aside, the  defendant-corporation [*8]  argued that service was  defective because the plaintiff had named ""AIG Life  Brokerage"" in the summons rather than the more  appropriate ""American General Life Companies LLC.""  Id. at 435. The court held for the plaintiffs on the basis  that ""service is proper despite a misnomer"" if the  complaint is ""not susceptible to any reasonable doubt or  confusion about who it was the plaintiff intended to sue."" Id. (citing Tremps v. Ascot Oils, Inc., 561 F.2d 41, 44  (7th Cir. 1977)). Plaintiff's reliance on Conner-Cooley is unavailing. As  indicated above, different circuits treat Rule 4 differently.  Some allow plaintiffs more leeway. See, e.g., United  Food & CommercialWorkers Union, Locals 197, et al. v.  Alpha Beta Co., 736 F.2d 1371, 1382 (9th Cir. 1984)  (""Rule 4 is a flexible rule which is liberally construed to uphold  service as long as defendant receives sufficient notice  of the complaint."") The Seventh is one such circuit. In  Conner-Cooley, the Wisconsin district court followed  Seventh  Circuit  precedent  that  emphasizes  the  importance of actual knowledge of a suit over technical  compliance with Rule 4. See Tremps, 561 F.2d at 44 (""A  defendant who is clearly identified by a summons and  complaint and who has been served with those  documents may not avoid the jurisdiction of the district  court merely because he is incorrectly named in them."").  The holding in Conner-Cooley was based, in large part,  on the 6 premise that the misnaming in that case [*9]  did not  create ""any reasonable doubt or confusion"" about who  the plaintiff intended to sue. Conner-Cooley, 282 F.R.D.  at 435. In contrast, the holding in Friedman suggests that such considerations are not  relevant, and the vast majority of courts in this Circuit  downplay the importance of actual knowledge and  instead emphasize the significance of process. See,  e.g., Bavelis, 453 B.R. at 63; PNC Mortg. v. Rhiel, Nos.  2:10-cv-578, 2:10-cv-579, 2011 WL 1043949, at *5  (S.D. Ohio Mar. 18, 2011); Ohio ex rel. Dewine v.  Superior Fibers, Inc., No. 2:14-cv-1843, 2017 WL  6055159, at *4-5 (S.D. Ohio Dec. 7, 2017); Arthur v.  Litton LoanServicing LP, 249 F. Supp. 2d 924, 927 (E.D.  Tenn. 2002); Engler v. Arnold, No. 4:14-cv-2442, 2015  Page 4 of 4 WL 4213642, at *2 (N.D. Ohio July 10, 2015). Even if the Sixth Circuit followed the body of law that  emphasized actual knowledge, the result may well be  the same. Unlike the defendant in Conner-Cooley,  Kozlowski proffered evidence that he was unsure of the  intended defendant to this suit. See Conner-Cooley, 282  F.R.D. at 435 (""[Defendant] does not, for example  submit an affidavit from [its lawyer] stating that when it  received the summons and complaint it could not  determine which, if any, of its clients plaintiffs intended  to sue.""). Kozlowski submitted such an affidavit stating  that ""my delay in answering the Complaint was . . .  partially due to the confusion over the summons.""  (Kozlowski Aff. ¶ 4, ECF No. 16-2.) Therefore, it would be reasonable to  conclude that the technically defective summons had a  real-world impact on Kozlowski's actual knowledge of  Plaintiffs intent to bring suit against him. Thus, this  summons provided insufficient [*10]  process even  under a laxer standard than Sixth Circuit precedent  demands.",0
"Rice Enters., LLC v. RSUI Indem. Co., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217212","OPINION Plaintiff, Rice Enterprises, LLC, brings the within action  against Defendants, RSUI Indemnity Company and  Zenith Insurance Company, concerning insurance  coverage for defense and indemnification based upon a  pending Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas  lawsuit (L.H. lawsuit). (ECF No. 20). Specifically, Rice's Amended Complaint avers claims for  Declaratory Judgment (Counts I and II), Breach of  Contract (Counts III, IV, and V), and Statutory Bad Faith  under 42 Pa.C.S. § 8371 (Counts VI and VII) due to 1)  RSUI's denial of indemnification under Rice's Directors  and Officers [*2]  Liability policy (D&O policy); 2) RSUI's  denial of defense and indemnification under Rice's  Commercial Umbrella Liability policy (Umbrella policy);  and 3) Zenith's denial of defense and indemnification  under Rice's Employers' Liability policy (Zenith policy).  Id. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), Zenith moves for  dismissal, contending that it owes no duty to defend  and/or indemnify under the Zenith policy because of the  policy's exclusion language, and that Rice's claim for  statutory bad faith fails as a result. (ECF No. 23). RSUI  moves for partial dismissal, contending that it owes no  duty to defend and/or indemnify under the Umbrella  policy, and that Rice's claim for statutory bad faith fails.  (ECF No. 21). Upon consideration of Defendants' Motions (ECF Nos.  21 and 23), the respective briefs (ECF Nos. 22, 24, 27,  30, and 31), and for the following reasons, Zenith's  Motion to Dismiss will be granted, and RSUI's Partial  Motion to Dismiss will be granted. I. Background A. L.H. Lawsuit On or around September 21, 2021, L.H., a minor, by  and through her parents and natural guardians T.H. and  B.H. (collectively, ""L.H.""), filed a civil action in the Court  of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania,  Page 2 of 8 against [*3]  Rice Enterprises, McDonald's USA, LLC,  and McDonald's Corporation (collectively Rice and  McDonald's). (ECF No. 20 at ¶ 6 and ECF No. 20-1).  The plaintiffs allege that on October 25, 2020, L.H., then  14 years old, applied for a job with McDonald's via the  McDonald's Careers website. Id. at ¶ 27. L.H. was hired  to work as a ""Crew Member"" at a McDonald's restaurant  operated by Rice Enterprises. Id. at ¶ 36. L.H. allegedly  did not receive the full three-day orientation training that  she was promised, nor did she receive any training  concerning sexual harassment and reporting of the  same. Id. at ¶¶ 37-44. In January 2021, a new manager, Walter A. Garner,  was hired, and he thereafter supervised L.H.'s shift. Id.  at ¶ 46. ""Unbeknownst to [L.H.],"" Garner was hired,  even though he was (and remains) publicly registered  as a ""Lifetime Offender"" on Megan's Law Public Report  following  his  2003  guilty  plea,  conviction,  and  incarceration for sexual assault of a 10-year-old girl. Id.  at ¶ 47. L.H. alleges that ""Garner began sexually  harassing [her] almost immediately after they began  working together on the same shift."" Id. at ¶ 48. Other  McDonald's  employees  and  managers  allegedly  overheard Garner's [*4]  verbal harassment. Id. at ¶¶  49-50. L.H. alleges that Garner's comments soon  ""became both more overt and more frequent,"" and then  ""Garner began touching [L.H.] inappropriately, including  brushing up against her while walking by, touching her  hair, and touching other parts of her body."" Id. at ¶ 55.  L.H. avers that ""Garner was also abusing and harassing  other minor McDonald's employees"" at the same that he  was harassing L.H. Id. at ¶ 58. L.H. and two other  employees allegedly informed McDonald's ""about the  harassment they were experiencing and the identity of  the manager,"" but it is alleged that ""McDonald's did not  take any steps to stop the harassment."" Id. at ¶¶ 65, 67.  In mid-February 2021, during a work shift , Garner  followed L.H. into the bathroom at the McDonald's  restaurant and raped her. Id. at ¶ 71. Rice allegedly learned about Garner's harassment only  after an unrelated theft on the premises prompted Rice  to review surveillance footage, which coincidentally  showed Garner groping L.H. Id. at ¶¶ 77-78. Although  ""McDonald's management spoke to Garner about the  conduct viewed on video,"" Garner was neither  disciplined nor fired. Id. at ¶ 79. This harassment  allegedly continued [*5]  until Garner was arrested in  mid-April 2021. Id. ¶¶ 80-86. L.H. has alleged a single claim for negligence against  Rice and McDonald's. Id. ¶¶ 116-119. It is alleged that  Rice  and  McDonald's  were  negligent  in  failing  adequately train L.H. ""on how to identify, address, and  report incidents of sexual harassment, sexual assault  and/or battery, and sexually hostile work environment"";  and in ""[f]ailing to adequately perform screening and/or  background checks on Garner prior to hiring"" him; and  in ""[f]ailing to adequately supervise Garner""; and in  ""failing to properly address"" employee ""complaints of  harassment and abuse""; and in""[f]ailing to publish and  distribute policies and procedures on sexual harassment  and reporting."" Id. at ¶ 117. B. Present Lawsuit 1. Allegations against Zenith Rice alleges it was the named insured on a Zenith  Employers' Liability policy. Id. at ¶ 40. On August 15,  2022, Rice provided Zenith with notice of L.H.'s  Allegheny County Complaint, and requested Zenith's  defense and indemnification for that lawsuit. Id. at ¶ 41.  On September 19, 2022, Zenith sent Rice a coverage  denial letter. Id. at ¶ 43. Zenith relies upon two  exclusions for denying coverage. Id. at ¶ 44. [*6]  Rice  argues that Zenith's coverage denial under said  exclusions is nonsensical and meritless. Id. at ¶ 50. Rice  avers claims against Zenith for Declaratory Judgment  (Count I), Breach of Contract (Count III), and Bad Faith  Pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 8371 (Count VI). 2. Rice's allegations against RSUI Rice avers that it is the named insured on an RSUI  Directors and Officers Liability policy. (ECF No. 20 at ¶  25). In or around September 22, 2021, Rice submitted  the L.H. lawsuit to RSUI, requesting defense and  indemnification under the D&O policy. Id. at ¶ 26. On  September 29, 2021 and December 2, 2021, RSUI  acknowledged that it owed a duty to defend Rice for the  L.H. Lawsuit under the D&O policy. Id. at ¶ 27.  However, on March 3, 2023, RSUI, denied indemnity  coverage for the L.H. Lawsuit under the D&O policy. Id.  at ¶ 36. Rice avers claims against RSUI for Declaratory  Judgment (Count II), Breach of Contract (Count IV), and  Bad Faith Pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 8371 (Count VII)  concerning the D&O policy. Rice also avers that it is the named insured on an RSUI  Commercial Umbrella policy. Id. at ¶ 51. The Umbrella  policy affords coverage to Rice above and beyond the  Zenith policy and the RSUI D&O policy. Id. at ¶ 52 (ECF  No. 20-8). [*7]  In or around September 22, 2021, Rice  submitted the L.H. lawsuit to RSUI, requesting defense  Page 3 of 8 and indemnification pursuant to the Umbrella policy in  relation to the L.H. Lawsuit. Id. at ¶ 53. Rice alleges that  RSUI knew of the existence of the Umbrella policy, but it  failed to acknowledge Rice's tender of coverage under  the Umbrella policy in either of its September 29th or  December 2nd letters. Id. at ¶ 55. While acknowledging  its duty to defend Rice under the D&O policy, RSUI  denies any defense or indemnity coverage under the  Umbrella policy. Id. at ¶ 56. Rice avers claims against  RSUI for Declaratory Judgment (Count II), Breach of  Contract (Count V), and Bad Faith Pursuant to 42  Pa.C.S. § 8371 (Count VII) concerning the Umbrella  policy. II. Relevant Standards A. Motion to Dismiss When reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal  Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the court must ""accept  all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in  the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine  whether,  under  any  reasonable  reading  of  the  complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief."" Eid v.  Thompson, 740 F.3d 118, 122 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting  Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 233 (3d  Cir.2008)). ""To survive a motion to dismiss a complaint  must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true,  to 'state a claim to relief [*8]  that is plausible on its  face.'"" Ashcroft v.

""A claim has facial plausibility when  the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court  to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is  liable for the misconduct alleged."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678  (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556); see also Thompson  v. Real Estate Mortg. Network, 748 F.3d 142, 147 (3d  Cir. 2014). ""Threadbare recitals of the elements of a  cause of action, supported by mere conclusory  statements, do not suffice."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  ""Factual allegations of a complaint must be enough to  raise a right to relief above the speculative level.""  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. A pleading party need not  establish the elements of a prima facie case at this  stage; the party must only ""put forth allegations that  'raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal  evidence of the necessary element[s].'"" Fowler v. UPMC  Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 213 (3d Cir.2009) (quoting  Graff v. Subbiah Cardiology Associates, Ltd., 2008 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 44192, 2008 WL 2312671 (W.D. Pa.

Corp., 809  F.3d 780, 790 (3d Cir.2016) (""Although a reviewing  court now affirmatively disregards a pleading's legal  conclusions, it must still . . . assume all remaining  factual allegations to be true, construe those truths in  the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and then draw all  reasonable inferences from them."") (citing Foglia v.  Renal Ventures Mgmt., LLC, 754 F.3d 153, 154 n. 1 (3d  Cir.2014)). Nonetheless, a court need not credit bald assertions,  unwarranted inferences, or legal conclusions cast in the  form of factual averments. Morse v. Lower Merion  School District, 132 F.3d 902, 906, n. 8 (3d Cir.1997).  The primary question in [*9]  deciding a motion to  dismiss is not whether the Plaintiff will ultimately prevail,  but rather whether he or she is entitled to offer evidence  to establish the facts alleged in the complaint. Maio v.  Aetna, 221 F.3d 472, 482 (3d Cir.2000). The purpose of  a motion to dismiss is to ""streamline [ ] litigation by  dispensing with needless discovery and factfinding.""  Neitzke v.

Insurance Policy Interpretation Pennsylvania courts apply traditional rules of contract  interpretation to insurance policies. The goal is to  ascertain the parties' intent, as manifested by the policy  language. Madison Constr. Co. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins.  Co., 557 Pa. 595, 735 A.2d 100, 106 (Pa. 1999).  Pennsylvania courts give words of common usage their  ""natural, plain, and ordinary sense."" Kvaerner Metals  Div. of Kvaerner v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 589 Pa.  317, 908 A.2d 888, 897 (Pa. 2006). Clear and  unambiguous terms must be given their effect.  Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. CPB Int'l, 562 F.3d 591, 595  (3d Cir. 2009); Kvaerner, 908 A.2d at 897. ""[A] provision  is ambiguous only if reasonable people could, in the  context of the entire policy, fairly ascribe different  meanings to it."" Frog, Switch & Mfg. Co. v. Travelers  Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 742, 746 (3d Cir. 1999). C. Duties to Defend and Indemnify In determining whether an insurer has a duty to defend,  Pennsylvania courts follow the ""four corners"" rule, which  requires comparison of ""the four corners of the  insurance contract to the four corners of the complaint.""  Am. & Foreign Ins. Co. v. Jerry's Sport Ctr., Inc., 606  Pa. 584, 2 A.3d 526, 541 (Pa. 2010). ""[O]nly allegations  contained within the underlying complaint pertaining to  Page 4 of 8 injuries which are either actually or potentially [*10]   within the scope of the insurance policy obligate the  insurer to defend the insured."" Erie Ins. Exch. v.  Claypoole, 449 Pa. Super. 142, 673 A.2d 348, 355-56  (Pa. Super. Ct. 1996). ""[T]he particular cause of action  that a complainant pleads is not determinative of  whether coverage has been triggered. Instead it is  necessary to look at the factual allegations contained in  the complaint."" Mut. Benefit Ins. Co. v. Haver, 555 Pa.  534, 725 A.2d 743, 745 (Pa. 1999); see also Scopel v.  Donegal Mut. Ins. Co., 698 A.2d 602, 605 (Pa. Super.  Ct. 1997) (""[I]n focusing attention upon the cause of  action pled, [claimants] run afoul of our caselaw, which  dictates that the factual averments contained in a  complaint determine whether an insurer must defend."").  This prevents ""the use of artful pleadings designed to  avoid exclusions in liability insurance policies."" Haver,  725 A.2d at 745. III. Discussion A. Zenith's Motion to Dismiss Zenith moves to dismiss Rice's claims for defense and  indemnification under its Employer's Liability policy in  Count I (Declaratory Judgment), Count III (Breach of  Contract), and Count VI (Statutory Bad Faith). 1. Zenith Policy Zenith's policy provides that it ""will pay all sums that you  legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury to  your employees, provided the bodily injury is covered by  this Employers' Liability Insurance."" (ECF No. 20-6 Part  Two, § B). Zenith argues that exclusions within said  policy precludes coverage [*11]  of the claims and  damages at issue in the L.H. lawsuit. Part Two of the  Zenith policy contains a number of exclusions, including  the following: This insurance does not cover: . . . 4.  Any  obligation  imposed  by  a  workers'  compensation,  occupational  disease,  unemployment compensation, or disability benefits  law, or any similar law; ... 7. Damages arising out of coercion, criticism,  demotion, evaluation, reassignment, discipline,  defamation, harassment, humiliation, discrimination  against or termination of any employee, or any  personnel practices, policies, acts or omissions; Id. at p. 8 (""Exclusions C.4 and C.7""). 2. Analysis a. Exclusion C.4 Zenith argues that coverage is barred under Exclusion  C.4, because the L.H. lawsuit arises out of an obligation  imposed by a worker's compensation law. Specifically,  Zenith contends that, as alleged in her complaint, L.H.  was subjected to harassment, inappropriate touching,  abuse, sexual harassment, coercion, and sexual assault  by her supervisor on Rice's premises and during her  work shifts. (ECF No. 20-1 at ¶¶ 5-6, 43-95). The L.H.  lawsuit also claims her harm was the result of Rice's  negligent decision to hire and failure to supervise  Garner. Id. Zenith [*12]  maintains that any recovery by  L.H. from Rice would be an ""obligation imposed by a  workers' compensation,"" such that coverage under the  Employer Liability policy is excluded by policy Exclusion  C.4. Rice maintains that none of the claims or damages  asserted in the L.H. lawsuit involve or implicate any  obligation imposed by any ""occupational disease,  unemployment compensation, or disability benefits law,  or any similar law."" Rice argues that Zenith's own denial  of coverage letter concedes that L.H. does not seek to  recover benefits under the Pennsylvania Workers'  Compensation Act (""PWCA""). Rice contends that, since  no worker's compensation claim has been filed by L.H.,  coverage under the Zenith Employers' Liability policy is  not excluded. In addition, Rice argues that an  employers' liability policy covers injuries to employees. As regards Rice's argument against Exclusion C.4,  based upon no worker compensation claim having been  filed, in cases interpreting the same policy language,  courts have held that said exclusion bars coverage for  claims that are subject to workers compensation  exclusivity, regardless of whether the employee actually  sought such benefits. ""It is the fact that the [*13]   employee's claim comes within the scope of the  workers' compensation statute rather than the actual  fact that he or she has recovered or is receiving  workers' compensation for his or her harm, which is the  basis for [the workers' compensation exclusion].""  Morales v. Zenith Ins. Co., 152 So. 3d 557, 563 (Fla.  2014) (quoting 8 Couch on Ins. § 115:89 (3d ed. 2013))  (holding identical Exclusion C.4 language barred  coverage for default judgment of personal injury claim).  ""The 'obligation imposed' by the workers' compensation  law is readily understood to mean the obligation as an  employer, under workers' compensation, to provide  benefits. That inchoate obligation exists whether or not  an employee actually chooses to seek benefits.""  Page 5 of 8 Culligan v. State Comp. Ins. Fund, 81 Cal. App. 4th 429,  96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 656, 664 (Cal. App. 2000) (emphasis  added) (holding that identical Exclusion C.4 language  barred coverage for tort lawsuit where injuries were  covered  by  workers  compensation  exclusivity,  regardless of whether the employee actually seeks  workers  compensation  benefits).  The  Court  is  persuaded, that consistent with Morales and Culligan,  application of Exclusion C.4 to deny coverage does not  require that L.H. seek or claim workers compensation  benefits. As such, Exclusion C.4 applies and precludes  coverage for the L.H. lawsuit, notwithstanding L.H. has  not claim [*14]  worker compensation benefits. As regards Rice's argument that the Zenith Employer's  Liability provides a path for coverage for an injury to  employees, such as those alleged by L.H., said  argument lacks merit. The PWCA also ""provides that  worker's compensation is the exclusive remedy for  injuries arising in the course of a worker's employment.""  Durham Life Ins. Co. v. Evans, 166 F.3d 139, 160 (3d  Cir. 1999); see 77 P.S. § 481(a). ""There is a rebuttable  presumption that the injury is work related where it  occurs on the premises of the employer."" Albright v.  Concurrent Techs. Corp., No. 3:21-CV-112, 2022 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 179060, 2022 WL 4640115, at *7 (W.D. Pa.  Sept. 30, 2022). Given the broad sweep of the PWCA's  exclusivity rule, ""the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has  held that even intentional torts committed by the  employer fall within the coverage of the Act"" and are  subject to the exclusivity rule. Danese, 784 F. Supp. at  229 (citing Poyser v. Newman & Co., 514 Pa. 32, 522  A.2d 548, 551 (Pa. 1987)). Courts have broadly applied  the PWCA's exclusivity rule to preempt civil claims for  workplace torts including assault, shootings, and fraud,  among others. See, e.g., Albright v. Concurrent Techs.  Corp., No. 3:21-CV-112, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 179060,  2022 WL 4640115, at *8 (W.D. Pa. Sept. 30, 2022)  (applying PWCA's exclusivity rule to allegations of  workplace ""harassment and hostility""); Abbott v. Anchor  Glass Container Corp., 2000 PA Super 249, 758 A.2d  1219, 1225 (Pa. Super. 2000) (holding PWCA's  exclusivity rule applied to the intentional shooting by a  co-employee, resulting in death). As particularly relevant here, courts have applied the  PWCA's exclusivity rule to preempt claims of workplace  sexual harassment [*15]  and attempted rape. See  Blazevich v. Star Hotels, Inc., Civ. A. No. 3:19-198,  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62988, 2021 WL 1214688, at *8  (W.D. Pa. Mar. 31, 2021) (holding PWCA exclusivity  applied to negligent supervision claims related to sexual  harassment by co-worker); Holland v. NTP Marble, Inc.,  No. 17-CV-2909, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78097, 2019  WL 2059966, at *11 (E.D. Pa. May 8, 2019); Hershey v.  Ninety-Five Assoc., 413 Pa. Super. 158, 604 A.2d 1068,  1070 (Pa. Super 1992) (holding PWCA's exclusivity rule  applied to physical attack and attempted rape). Here,  the injuries and damages alleged by L.H. occurred  during the course of and at L.H.'s Rice employment  worksite. As such, in the facts and circumstances  presented, employer liability to L.H. would be an  obligation imposed by PWCA, and coverage therefore is  excluded by Exclusion C.4 of the Zenith policy. Rice's  arguments to the contrary fail. Exclusion C.4 applies to  exclude coverage under the Zenith policy. b. Exclusion C.7 Zenith argues that Exclusion C.7 bars coverage,  because the L.H. lawsuit arises out of ""harassment,  humiliation, discrimination, or personnel practices,  policies, acts or omissions."" In the L.H. lawsuit, L.H.  contends she was harmed as an employee due to her  supervisor  Garner's  misconduct,  including  sexual  harassment. L.H. also alleges that Rice's negligence in  its personnel practices, policies, acts and omissions  caused her harm. Zenith denied coverage based upon  allegations within the L.H. lawsuit and the application of  Exclusion C.7. Rice asserts [*16]  that Exclusion C.7 does not apply to  the allegations in the L.H. lawsuit, because the  damages sought by L.H. arise out of ""coercion, criticism,  demotion,  evaluation,  reassignment,  discipline,  defamation, harassment, humiliation..."" from Garner and  not by employer Rice. Rice further contends that the  term ""sexual misconduct"" is not specified as an  exclusion under Exclusion C. 7. Further, as regards  Exclusion C.7's terms ""personnel practices, policies,  acts or omissions,"" Rice argues that said language is  ambiguous and undefined in the policy; and, where  Zenith now seeks to exclude coverage, based upon  such policy language, Zenith's failure to define such  terms prevents enforcement of Exclusion C.7 in this  case. Presently, where coverage is denied based on an  exclusion, the burden is on the insurer to prove the  applicability of the claimed exclusion. Nationwide Mutual  Insurance Co. v. Arnold, 2019 PA Super 213, 214 A.3d  688, 695, 701-02 (Pa. Super. 2019). Exclusion C.7  precludes damages that arise out of enumerated  circumstances or events. Pennsylvania courts interpret  the phrase ""arising out of"" in policy exclusions in a very  broad manner to mean a causal, ""but for"" relationship.  Madison Contr. Co. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., 557  Page 6 of 8 Pa. 595, 735 A.2d 100, 110 (Pa. 1999); McCabe v. Old  Republic Ins Co., 425 Pa. 221, 228 A.2d 901, 903 (Pa.  1967) (stating that ""arising out of"" unambiguously  means ""causally connected with, not proximately  caused by""). [*17]  If the alleged injuries would not have  happened but for the excluded conduct, the injuries  ""arise out of"" the conduct. First Liberty Ins. Corp. v. Coll,  2015 Phila. Ct. Com. Pl. LEXIS 14, at *14 (Pa. Ct.  Comm. Pl. Jan. 6, 2015), aff'd, 131 A.3d 85 (Pa. Super.  Ct. 2015). Rice's argument, that coverage under the Zenith Policy  cannot be excluded because of the conduct of Garner,  lacks merit. Other courts have addressed identical  language contained in Exclusion C.7 and ultimately  concluded that allegations of conduct similar to  Garner's, as alleged in the L.H. lawsuit, satisfies the  ""arise out of"" causal link to exclude coverage. See, e.g.  Gen. Star Indem. Co. v. Sch. Excess Liab. Fund, 888  F.Supp. 1022, 1028 (N.D. Cal. 1995) (finding exclusion  based upon allegations of coercive conduct by  supervisor and employee humiliation); Fisher v. St. Paul  Ins. Co., 02 C 9488, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6525, 2003  WL 1903983, at *9 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 17, 2003) (upholding  exclusion  based  upon  allegations  of  sexual  discrimination, harassment, and assault); TIG Ins. Co. v.  Sweet Factory, Inc., 748 So.2d 337, 339 (Fla. Dist. Ct.  App. 1999) (upholding exclusion based upon clear and  unambiguous language wherein, like the L.H. complaint,  alleged sexual harassment of minor employee by  supervisor). Here, the L.H. lawsuit unequivocally sets  forth  allegations  of  ""damages  arising  out  of""  harassment, humiliation, and coercion."" (ECF No. 20-1  at ¶¶ 48, 56, 61-62, and 82(a)). Thus, as to the conduct  of Garner, vis-à-vis coverage for Rice, Exclusion C.7  applies to preclude coverage. Further, the L.H. lawsuit alleges her damages ""arise  out [*18]  of"" Rice's personnel practices, policies, acts or  omissions, namely, in hiring Garner despite his sexual  misconduct history, and his status as a registered sex  offender, and Rice's failure to adequately train L.H. and  take action following the observation and/or reports of  Garner's misconduct. Each of these allegations support  the applicability of Exclusion C.7 to preclude coverage  to Rice. The Court finds no ambiguity in the policy  language, and L.H.'s complaint allegations fall squarely  within the plain meaning of the terms ""personnel  practices, policies, acts or omissions."" Thus, Exclusion  C.7 applies to preclude Zenith's coverage for Rice. c. Bad Faith Finally, as regards Rice's claim for Bad Faith against  Zenith, Zenith argues that Rice's statutory bad faith  claim fails because, where the policy provides for a  reasonable basis for exclusion, there can be no bad  faith as a matter of law. Rice contends that it has  sufficiently pleaded a bad faith claim against Zenith. ""Resolution of a coverage claim on the merits in favor of  the insurer requires dismissal of a bad faith claim  premised on the denial of coverage, because under the  circumstances  the  insurer  necessarily  has  a  reasonable [*19]  basis for denying benefits."" Gold v.  State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., 880 F. Supp. 2d 587, 597  (E.D. Pa. 2012) (citing Frog, Switch, & Mfg. Co., Inc. v.  Travelers Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 742, 751 n. 9 (3d Cir.  1999)). Here, given that Exclusions C.4 and C.7 of the Zenith  policy apply to exclude coverage to Rice, Zenith's denial  of a defense and indemnification under its policy was  reasonable. As such, Rice cannot maintain a statutory  bad faith claim against Zenith for its refusal to defend  and indemnify. Accordingly, based upon the foregoing, Zenith's Motion  to Dismiss will be granted. Rice's claims against Zenith,  Counts I, III, and VI will be dismissed. Because the  Court's analysis is based upon the policy language and  allegations within the L.H. lawsuit, any amendment to  Rice's claims against Zenith would be futile. Therefore,  there will be no leave to amend. All claims against  Zenith will be dismissed, with prejudice. B. RSUI's Partial Motion to Dismiss RSUI moves to dismiss Rice's claims for Declaratory  Judgment (Count II), Breach of Contract (Count V), and  Statutory Bad Faith (Count VII), concerning Rice's  tender for defense and indemnification under the RSUI  Umbrella policy. 1. The RSUI Commercial Umbrella Liability Policy The RSUI Umbrella policy provides in relevant part as  follows: I. INSURING AGREEMENT 1. We will pay on behalf of the insured those  sums [*20]  in excess of the ""retained limit"" which  the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as  damages to which this insurance applied because  of ""bodily injury"", ""property damage"" or ""personal  and advertising injury"". *** Page 7 of 8 2. We will have the right and duty to defend any  ""suit"" seeking those damages when: a. The applicable limits of insurance of the  ""underlying insurance"" and other insurance  have been used up in the payment of  judgments or settlements; or b. No other valid and collectible insurance is  available to the insured for damages covered  by this policy. *** 9. Loss Payments a. We will have liability for any one ""occurrence"" or  offense only when the amount of the ""retained limit""  with respect to such ""occurrence"" of offense has  been paid by: (1) The insured; (2) Us on behalf of the insured (other than this  policy; or (3) The insured's underlying insurer. b. If we are obliged to indemnify the insured for any  payment or judgments or settlements, the insured  must make a written claim within 12 months of: (1) Actually paying any amount in excess of the  ""retained limit""; or (2) The insured's liability being made certain  by: (a) The final judgment of a trial; or (b)  The  written  agreement  of  the  insured, [*21]   the  claimant  or  the  claimant's legal representative and us. (ECF No. 20-8 at pp. 31, 14-16). 2. Analysis a. Duty to Defend RSUI argues that any duty to defend Rice under its  Umbrella policy has not been triggered. Specifically,  RSUI maintains that Rice's underlying insurance, which  includes the RSUI D&O policy and the Zenith policy, has  not been ""used up in the payment of judgments or  settlements,"" and Rice does not aver that ""no other valid  or collectible insurance is available to the insured for  damages covered by [the RSUI Commercial Umbrella  Liability policy]."" Given this Court's above ruling, that  there is no coverage under the Zenith Policy, no further  discussion concerning Zenith is necessary. The only  remaining issue as regards the Umbrella policy is the  status of coverage under the RSUI D&O policy. In  regards to the RSUI D&O policy, RSUI contends that, if  the D&O policy partially applies to the claims in the L.H.  lawsuit, as Rice contends, then the L.H. lawsuit is not an  uncovered occurrence for purposes of the RSUI  Umbrella policy. Rice maintains that, because of the  Zenith  coverage  denial,  it  has  an  ""uncovered  occurrence"" that would trigger RSUI's Umbrella policy. ""When an insured [*22]  is covered by both a primary  policy and an excess policy, the general rule is that the  excess liability carrier is not obligated to participate in  the defense until the primary policy limits are  exhausted."" Steven Plitt et al., Couch on Insurance §  200:42 (3d. ed. 2020). The Third Circuit has explained  that ""a true excess or secondary policy is not 'triggered'  or required to pay until the underlying primary coverage  has been exhausted."" Koppers Co. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur.  Co., 98 F.3d 1440, 1454 (3d Cir. 1996). Here, Rice's Amended Complaint does not support the  triggering of RSUI's Umbrella policy, because RSUI has  accepted Rice's defense tender under its D&O policy.  (ECF No. 20 at ¶ 27). Therefore, under the Umbrella  policy language, there has yet to be an uncovered  ""occurrence,"" notwithstanding the lack of any coverage  under the Zenith policy. In addition, Rice's claim for  excess coverage under RSUI Umbrella policy is  premature because Rice does not allege the limits of  liability and defense under the D&O policy have been  exhausted. Thus, Rice cannot claim any present duty to  defend under RSUI's Umbrella policy. Accordingly,  RSUI's Partial Motion to Dismiss, as regards defense in  the L.H. lawsuit under the Umbrella policy, will be  granted. b. Duty to Indemnify [*23]  RSUI also argues that Rice's request for indemnification  under the Umbrella policy is premature. It maintains that  coverage for loss payments is only triggered when the  retained limit has been paid by the insured, or paid by  RSUI on behalf of the insured under policies other than  the Commercial Umbrella Liability policy, or paid by  Rice's other underlying insurer(s). RSUI contends that  none of these conditions have been met; therefore, no  duty has yet arisen under the RSUI Umbrella policy.  Rice argues that its demand for indemnification is timely  and judicially economical. Specifically, it maintains that  dismissal of the claims against RSUI's Umbrella policy  should not occur, given that the L.H. lawsuit remains  unresolved and the necessity of the Umbrella policy is  unknown. Under Pennsylvania law, ""[a]n insurer is required to  indemnify only where the insured is held liable for a  claim actually covered by the policy."" USX Corp. v.  Adriatic Ins. Co., 99 F.Supp.2d 593, 611 (W.D.Pa.2000)  Page 8 of 8 (citing Gen. Accident Ins. Co. of Am. v. Allen, 547 Pa.  693, 692 A.2d 1089, 1095 (1997)). ""As a general rule, a  court entertaining a declaratory judgment action in an  insurance  coverage  case  should  refrain  from  determining the insurer's duty to indemnify until the  insured is found liable for damages in the underlying  action."" Victoria Ins. Co. v. Mincin Insulation Servs., No.  Civ.A. 08-909, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106536, 2009 WL  90644, at *5 (W.D.Pa. Jan. 14, 2009) (quotation  omitted). [*24]  Here, Rice's argument against prematurity is unavailing  based upon the above well-settled law. Rice has not  alleged that liability in the L.H. lawsuit has been  established, and where Rice has not been found liable  for damages in the underlying action, any claim for  RSUI to indemnify is premature. Further, Rice has not  alleged that any underlying coverage under the RSUI  D&O policy has been exhausted. Thus, RSUI's partial  Motion to Dismiss, as regards indemnity under the  Umbrella policy, will be granted. c. Statutory Bad Faith Finally, RSUI argues that Rice's statutory bad faith claim  fails because, when no coverage for defense and/or  indemnification exists, there can be no bad faith as a  matter of law. Rice contends that it made a legitimate  demand for coverage pursuant to the terms and  requirements of the Umbrella Policy, and that the  question, of whether RSUI's refusal to defend and  indemnify under its Umbrella Policy was in bad faith,  remains a question of fact. ""Resolution of a coverage claim on the merits in favor of  the insurer requires dismissal of a bad faith claim  premised on the denial of coverage, because under the  circumstances the insurer necessarily has a reasonable  basis [*25]  for denying benefits."" Gold v. State Farm  Fire and Cas. Co., 880 F. Supp. 2d 587, 597 (E.D. Pa.  2012) (citing Frog, Switch, & Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Travelers  Ins. Co., 193 F.3d 742, 751 n. 9 (3d Cir. 1999)). Here, given that the language of the Umbrella policy  does not provide Rice within any present right to  coverage,  RSUI's  denial  of  a  defense  and  indemnification under the Umbrella policy is reasonable.  As such, Rice cannot presently maintain a statutory bad  faith claim against RSUI concerning RSUI's denial of  coverage under the Umbrella policy. Accordingly, based upon the foregoing, RSUI's Partial  Motion to Dismiss will be granted. Rice's claims, as  regards the RSUI Umbrella Policy within Counts II  (Declaratory Judgment), Count V (Breach of Contract),  and VII (Bad Faith) will be dismissed. Because the  Court's analysis is based upon the policy language, the  pending status L.H. lawsuit, and the non-exhaustion of  the RSUI D&O policy, any amendment to Rice's  dismissed claims against RSUI related to the Umbrella  policy would be futile. Therefore, there will be no leave  to amend. A separate order will follow pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. 58,  and will direct RSUI to answer the remaining claims  against it. DATED this 6th day of December, 2023. BY THE COURT: /s/ Marilyn J. Horan MARILYN J.

DATED this 6th day of December, 2023. BY THE COURT: /s/ Marilyn J. Horan MARILYN J. HORAN United States District Judge",0
"Richardson v. NW Univ., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 168742","MOO Hayden Richardson alleges that, as a member of the  Northwestern University cheerleading [*2]  team, she  suffered sexual assaults and sexual harassment at the  hands of fans, alumni, and donors at tailgates, alumni  fundraising events, and a private University club. Worse,  Richardson alleges that the head cheerleading coach  intentionally put Richardson and the other women  cheerleaders into the gauntlet of those assaulters, with  the explicit purpose that the cheerleaders flirt with the  fans, alumni, and donors, and knowing that the assaults  would be the result. On top of that, after Richardson  complained to University and Athletics Department  leaders about the assaults, the leaders did little to stop  the victimization. In a 256-paragraph complaint, Richardson first asserts  that Northwestern's mishandling of her cries for help  violated  federal  anti-discrimination  statute  and  regulations  governing  educational  institutions,  commonly known as Title XI, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq.  R. 1, Compl. Those two Title IX counts (Counts 1 and  2)  target  Northwestern  as  the  defendant,  and  Northwestern has not moved to dismiss those claims.  Three other counts—labelled Counts 3, 4, and 5—bring  claims under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act  against Northwestern and other defendants. R. 1,  Compl. Count 3 cites to 18 U.S.C. § 1590, R. 1 at 40,                  Page 2 of 13 which prohibits trafficking in forced [*3]  labor, and is  asserted against the University itself, as well as Heather  Obering (the former Associate Athletic Director for  Marketing); Amanda DaSilva (the former Deputy Title IX  Coordinator); Michael Polisky (the former Deputy  Director of Athletics); and Pamela Bonnevier (the former  head coach of the cheerleading team). Compl. ¶¶  19-22. Count 4 asserts that the Defendants violated the  sex-trafficking prohibition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §  1591. Id. at 44-48. The final federal law claim, Count 5,  alleges that the Defendants violated the ban against  forced labor, 18 U.S.C. § 1589. Richardson also brings state law breach-of-contract and  promissory-estoppel claims against Northwestern, and a  state law claim for intentional infliction of emotional  distress against Bonnevier. Compl. ¶¶ 238-49, 250-56.  For the reasons discussed in this Opinion, the motions  to dismiss are granted in part and denied in part. The  motions to dismiss the claims for forced-labor trafficking  (Count 3), sex trafficking (Count 4), and forced labor  (Count 5) are denied as to all of the Defendants. The  state law claims for breach of contract and estoppel  (Counts 6 and 7) are dismissed, for now without  prejudice. The emotional-distress claim (Count [*4]  8)  against Bonnevier survives. I. Background For purposes of this motion, the Court accepts as true  the factual allegations in the Complaint, Erickson v.  Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d  1081 (2007), as well as those in Richardson's response  brief (but only to the extent that the allegations in the  brief are consistent with the Complaint), see Heng v.  Heavner, Beyers & Mihlar, LLC, 849 F.3d 348, 354 (7th  Cir. 2017). See also Thompson v. Ill. Dep't of Prof. Reg.,  300 F.3d 750, 753 (7th Cir. 2002) (on a Rule 12(b)(6)              motion, the pleadings ""consist generally of the  complaint, any exhibits attached thereto, and supporting  briefs."") (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c)). Hayden  Richardson  transferred  to  Northwestern  University in 2018 to begin her sophomore year of  college. R. 1, Compl. ¶¶ 47-48. An avid cheerleader for  most of her life, Richardson began looking into  Northwestern's cheerleading team soon after she  transferred. Id. ¶¶ 45, 49. After viewing the cheerleading  team's website and social-media accounts, Richardson  contacted the head coach, Pamela Bonnevier, about  joining the team. Id. ¶¶ 49-50. Bonnevier asked  Richardson to submit videos of her cheerleading skills,  including in performing stunts. Id. After viewing the  videos, Bonnevier quickly accepted Richardson onto the  team. Id. For her participation on the team, Richardson received  scholarships in both 2019 and 2020. Compl. ¶ 51. In  2019, she received a $5,500 scholarship, [*5]  and in  2020 the scholarship amount was $4,041. Id. As part of  joining the team, Richardson was required to sign a  contract. Id. ¶ 55 The contract, referred to by  Richardson as the Spirit Squad Contract, laid out the  terms of her membership on the cheerleading team. Id.  The contract required team members to attend all home  games and tournaments, in addition to any other events  dictated  by  the  coaching  staff.  Id.  Throughout  Richardson's two cheerleading seasons, these events  mostly included tailgating, alumni donor events, and  appearances at the University's limited-membership  Wilson Club. Id. ¶¶ 55, 100. When Richardson attended  any of these events, she and the other female  cheerleaders were required to wear their cheer  uniforms. Id. ¶¶ 2-3, 57, 64, 67. The women's cheer  uniforms were scant and exposed much of the women's  bodies—yet the men's cheer uniforms did not. Id. ¶¶ 57,  64, 67. The contract also stated that if a team member  were to quit or be asked to leave the team, then the  cheerleader would be required to repay the University  for the cheerleading scholarship, as well as for all fees  and expenses associated with the cheerleading  events—including travel, food, equipment, and [*6]   camp costs. Id. ¶¶ 55, 101. A. Bonnevier Bonnevier was the head coach of the cheerleading team  throughout Richardson's two seasons on the team.  Compl. ¶¶ 22, 95. As the 2018-2019 cheer season  began, Bonnevier told the women cheerleaders that  Page 3 of 13 their top priorities were to keep fans happy and always  appear as ""fun girls."" Id. ¶ 56. Richardson understood  this instruction to especially apply to keeping alumni- donor fans happy. See id. ¶ 63. Throughout both 2019  and 2020, Bonnevier acknowledged that some fans  might be ""creepy,"" but that the cheerleaders must  endure taking photos with fans even if they moved their  hands to inappropriate places or made the cheerleaders  feel  uncomfortable.  Id.  Bonnevier's  pre-season  prophesies came true: on multiple occasions, fans  touched Richardson's breasts and buttocks. Id. ¶ 58.  Richardson alleges multiple specific instances of these  assaults, including at a game in September 2018 when  Bonnevier directly instructed Richardson to take photos  with fans, and those fans touched Richardson's breasts.  Id. ¶ 59. During another incident of inappropriate  touching that season, Bonnevier gave Richardson's full  name to a group of intoxicated fans, who then not  surprisingly [*7]  threatened to find her after the game.  Id. ¶¶ 61-63. In addition to instances in which Bonnevier  acted as a liaison between Richardson and the alumni  fans, Bonnevier also instructed Richardson and other  women cheerleaders not to eat before games and to  undress and change in public view on the team bus;  Bonnevier also isolated the women from one another  whenever she wanted the cheerleaders to interact with  as many as donors as possible, and also controlled the  cheerleaders' access to the restroom. Id. ¶¶ 71-74, 76- 78, 81. As the season progressed, Bonnevier made it clear that  Richardson and the other cheerleaders were required  not only to attend sporting tailgates, but also specific  alumni-donor events and to make appearances at the  University's exclusive donor club, the Wilson Club.  Compl. ¶¶ 57, 64-65, 100. The Wilson Club is a private  space available only to donors who contributed $6,000  or more—the highest donation bracket pertinent to the  Athletics Department. R. 48-2, Pl.'s Exh. 1, Fan Priority  Seating Order at 3. Yet Richardson's male teammates  were not required to attend the same alumni fundraising  events or make appearances at the Wilson Club.  Compl. ¶¶ 67, 164. On multiple [*8]  occasions  Bonnevier sent Richardson to the Wilson Club to flirt  with wealthy donors. Id. ¶ 57. Bonnevier made it clear to  Richardson that if Richardson did not follow the coach's  instructions, she would no longer be part of the team.  And if Richardson were no longer part of the team, she  would lose her sports scholarships and be responsible  for reimbursing the University for the scholarships and  myriad expenses. Id. ¶¶ 60, 101. B. Athletics Department Leadership & Title IX  Deputy Coordinator In addition to the accusations against Coach Bonnevier,  Richardson  alleges  misconduct  committed  by  Northwestern itself, through former University leaders  Polisky, Obering, and DaSilva. As a reminder, at the  time of the alleged misconduct, Polisky was the Deputy  Director of Athletics; Obering was the Associate Athletic  Director for Marketing; and DaSilva was the Deputy Title  IX Coordinator. Compl. ¶¶ 18-21. Before raising her  concerns with these University leaders, Richardson first  complained  about  Bonnevier's  conduct  to  the  cheerleading team's doctor. Id. ¶ 82. This discussion  happened on January 8, 2019 (as explained later in this  Opinion, the exact timing is important). Id. Richardson  told the [*9]  team doctor that Bonnevier had time and  again forced the female cheerleaders to attend—for the  University's  benefit—events  during  which  the  cheerleaders were sexually harassed and assaulted. Id.  The following day (January 9), Associate Athletic  Director Obering emailed Richardson to discuss the  allegations. Id. ¶ 83. Richardson told Obering about the  misconduct, and Obering in turn instructed Richardson  to gather testimonials and evidence from other students  to corroborate the allegations. Id. ¶¶ 84-85. Richardson  followed those instructions and submitted corroborating  materials. Id. ¶¶ 86-87. She also requested a meeting  with the University's then-Athletic Director, Jim Phillips,  but Deputy Athletic Director Polisky did not set up a  meeting with Phillips. Id. ¶ 87. On January 24, 2019, Richardson and a teammate met  with Obering and Polisky to discuss the alleged  misconduct. Id. ¶ 88. Both Obering and Polisky accused  Richardson of falsifying the corroborating student  testimonials and suggested that she had not done  enough to show that the allegations were true. Id. ¶¶ 8,  88. Despite the evidence that Richardson had brought  forward, the University's Title IX Office did not open a  formal investigation. [*10]  Id. ¶ 9. Around one week later, on February 1, 2019, DaSilva  (the Deputy Title IX Coordinator) reached out to  Richardson via email. Compl. ¶ 90. DaSilva's email to  Richardson mischaracterized Richardson's allegations,  including by asserting that Richardson had raised only  the single issue of one individual fan harassing her. Id.  In  response,  Richardson  corrected  DaSilva's  mischaracterization and set forth multiple dates and  events during which she was assaulted. Id. ¶ 91. A few  days later (on February 5), Richardson emailed Obering  to report that, although Bonnevier had been more  Page 4 of 13 organized at a recent basketball game, she ""still made  derogatory comments to members of the team  regarding their physical appearance ...."" Id. ¶ 92. In the  meantime, communication from DaSilva was sparse,  with just a general February 18 notification saying that  the Title IX Office was still working with Bonnevier to  address the situation. Id. ¶ 93. Then one month passed  with no more outreach from DaSilva, and eventually the  response petered out with an end to the ""training"" of  Bonnevier on April 17, 2019. Id. ¶¶ 93-95. So, instead of opening a Title XI investigation,  Bonnevier simply received some form of training [*11]   and was told that she could no longer force the  cheerleaders to attend tailgating events. Id. ¶ 11. The  tailgating stopped but the cheerleaders were still  required to attend alumni fundraising events. Id. ¶ 11. At  that time, the University took no other action was taken  against Bonnevier. Id. ¶¶ 94-95. At the end of May 2019, Richardson had a follow-up  meeting with Obering and Polisky. Id. ¶ 96. Richardson  told them that Bonnevier's problematic behavior was  ongoing, including the misconduct that she first told  them about in January 2019. Id. At some later date,  DaSilva finally started a formal investigation into the  ongoing alleged sexual misconduct. Id. ¶ 12. But during  the course of the investigation, DaSilva changed  Richardson's status from Title IX complainant to  witness. Id. ¶ 13. The change in status meant that  Richardson no longer had access to the status of the  investigation or its ultimate outcome. Id. ¶¶ 13-14. On  top of that change in status, the misconduct continued  into 2020. Id. ¶¶ 53, 102-03. II. Legal Standard Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a  complaint generally need only include ""a short and plain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This short and  plain [*12]  statement must ""give the defendant fair  notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon  which it rests."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,  555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)  (alteration in original) (cleaned up). The Seventh Circuit  has explained that this rule ""reflects a liberal notice      pleading regime, which is intended to 'focus litigation on  the merits of a claim' rather than on technicalities that  might keep plaintiffs out of court."" Brooks v. Ross, 578  F.3d 574, 580 (7th Cir. 2009) (quoting Swierkiewicz v.  Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 514, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L.  Ed. 2d 1 (2002)). ""A motion under Rule 12(b)(6) challenges the sufficiency  of the complaint to state a claim upon which relief may  be granted."" Hallinan v. Fraternal Order of Police of Chi.  Lodge No. 7, 570 F.3d 811, 820 (7th Cir. 2009). ""[A]  complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,  accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is  plausible on its face.'"" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,  678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). These allegations ""must be  enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative  level."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. The allegations that  are entitled to the assumption of truth are those that are  factual, rather than mere legal conclusions. Iqbal, 556  U.S. at 678-79. III. Analysis A. Trafficking Victims Protection Act Forced Labor  (§ 1589) and Forced-Labor Trafficking (§ 1590) Generally speaking, the Trafficking Victims Protection  Act establishes criminal and civil penalties against  forcing a person, by deploying certain prohibited tactics,  to perform labor or services. 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589, 1590.  Section 1589(a) bans the primary conduct, that is,  knowingly providing or obtaining the labor or services of  a person by using [*13]  (among other things) force,  serious harm, abuse of law, or threats of any of those  things. § 1589(a)(1), (2), (3), (4). Section 1589(b)  prohibits knowingly benefiting from participation in a  venture that has provided or obtained forced labor by  the prohibited means, when the defendant knows or  recklessly disregards the fact that the venture has done  so. § 1589(b). And Section 1590(a) addresses  trafficking of forced labor, that is, knowingly recruiting,  harboring, transporting, providing, or obtaining forced  labor or services by the forbidden means set forth in  primary-conduct statute, § 1589(a)(1)-(4). § 1590(a).  The forbidden means in § 1589(a)(1)-(4) run the  spectrum from threats of ""force,"" ""physical restraint,""  ""serious harm,"" or ""abuse"" of legal process: (1) by means of force, threats of force, physical  restraint, or threats of physical restraint to that  person or another person; Page 5 of 13 (2) by means of serious harm or threats of serious  harm to that person or another person; (3) by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of  law or legal process; or (4) by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern  intended to cause the person to believe that, if that  person did not perform such labor or services, that  person or another person would suffer serious harm  or physical restraint[.] 18 U.S.C. § 1589(a)(1)-(4) (emphasis added). [*14]   This case presents the question of the meaning of  ""threats of serious harm."" Here, Richardson alleges that the Defendants forced  Richardson to perform services by requiring her to  attend alumni events and tailgating events in violation of  both Sections 1589 and 1590. See Compl. ¶ 226. The  Defendants also knowingly benefitted from participation  in their venture of forcing Richardson to perform the  services. As detailed in more depth below, Richardson  believed that she would suffer serious financial harm if  she did not perform those services. Id. ¶ 227. The  Northwestern Defendants argue that Richardson has  not plausibly alleged forced labor under § 1589 or  forced-labor trafficking under § 1590 because she has  failed to allege that the threat of ""serious harm,"" §  1589(a)(2), caused her to perform the services. NU  Defs.' Br. at 23. As pertinent here, to successfully plead a forced-labor  claim under § 1589, Richardson must adequately allege  that the Northwestern Defendants and Bonnevier used  ""threats of serious harm"" to obtain her services. Section  1589(c)(2) defines ""serious harm"" for the Trafficking  Victims Protection Act: it ""means any harm, whether  physical  or  nonphysical,  including  psychological,  financial, or reputational harm, that is sufficiently  serious, under all the surrounding [*15]  circumstances,  to compel a reasonable person of the same background  and in the same circumstances to perform or to continue  performing labor or services in order to avoid incurring  that harm."" 18 U.S.C. § 1589(c)(2). As the statutory  definition spells out, the term ""serious harm"" covers both  overt physical coercion and nonphysical forms of  coercion, including ""financial"" harm. See United States  v. Calimlim, 538 F.3d 706, 714 (7th Cir. 2008) (""Section  1589 is not written in terms limited to overt physical  coercion, and we know that when Congress amended  the statute it expanded the definition of involuntary  servitude to include nonphysical forms of coercion.""). Richardson alleges that the Defendants used a plethora  of financially coercive means—that is, the cheerleading  contracts, financial incentives, online advertisements,  and representations on social media—to compel her to  attend and to perform at tailgating events and various  alumni events. Compl. ¶¶ 180-81, 226, 227. The key  allegation rests on the Sprit Squad contracts, the  execution of which was a mandatory condition for  joining the team. Id. ¶ 55. Under the terms of the  contracts, if Richardson had left the team, then she  would  have  owed  Northwestern  over  $10,000,  comprising a minimum of $9,541 to pay back the  cheerleading [*16]  scholarships, plus all lodging, food,  equipment-rental, and training expenses. See id. ¶¶ 55,  101. This allegation of a mandatory financial burden  adequately supports the force-labor and forced-labor  trafficking claims as a ""threat of serious harm"" under the  Act. Remember that evaluating whether a harm qualifies  as a ""serious harm"" under the Act takes into account  whether the financial harm would compel a reasonable  person ""of the same background and in the same  circumstances"" as the victim. § 1589(c)(2). Viewing the  allegation in Richardson's favor, as required at the  pleading stage, $10,000 at stake is more than enough  for a reasonable person in Richardson's shoes—a  young adult (not yet 21 years old at the time, Compl. ¶  58) pursuing an education funded in part by a  scholarship—to reasonably feel compelled to continue  performing the services. Indeed, Richardson outright  alleges—and this must be accepted as true right now— that she ""could not afford the financial liability attendant  to quitting the team or being terminated."" Id. ¶ 60. On  top of the sheer dollar amount, the mandatory nature of  the reimbursement provision supports the reasonable  inference, at the pleading stage, that the payback [*17]   requirement was indeed intended to coerce Richardson  to stay on the team and to attend the dictated events.  The  looming  financial  burden  of  the  payback  requirement and the go-forward possibility of losing  one's access to college education (plus, Richardson had  already transferred from another university, Compl. ¶  47) readily qualify as a threat of serious harm under the  Act. At the very, very least, the Complaint sufficiently  alleges that the Defendants used a scheme or plan  intended to cause Richardson to believe (even if in fact  it would not happen) that she would suffer serious harm  if she did not perform the services. § 1589(a)(4). With regard to specific Defendants, there is no doubt  that the Complaint adequately alleges that the head  coach at the time, Bonnevier, knew and relied on the  Spirit Squad contracts. It would be odd indeed if the  Page 6 of 13 head coach of the Sprit Squad did not know and rely on  the terms of the mandatory contracts. With regard to the  University itself (through its Athletics Department), as  well as Obering, DaSilva, and Polisky, here again it is  plausible that, when viewing the allegations in  Richardson's favor, that the Northwestern Defendants  were all aware of the contents [*18]  of the Spirit Squad  contracts and of the requirement that cheerleaders  reimburse the University if they leave the team.  Remember that Richardson had put Obering, DaSilva,  and Polisky on notice of the harassment. It is  reasonable to infer that, in response to being put on  notice of the harassment, these University leaders  would (at the very least) examine the fundamental  document setting forth the obligations that Richardson  (and other cheerleaders) had to the University, and that  the University had to Richardson. Giving the benefit of  reasonable inferences to Richardson at the pleading  stage, the Complaint adequately alleges that the  individual Northwestern Defendants (and through them,  the University itself) deployed threats of serious financial  harm  (with  all  its  attendant  consequences  on  Richardson and her education), or at least knew of  those threats, to compel Richardson to perform  services. B. Trafficking Victims Protection Act Sex-Act  Trafficking (§ 1591) Moving on from the forced-labor and forced-labor  trafficking claims, Congress expanded the Trafficking  Victims Protection Act back in 2000 to specifically  combat sex trafficking in an effort ""to prevent violence  against women ...."" Pub. L. No. 106-386 § 102, 114  Stat. 1488 (2000) (codified as 18 U.S.C. § 1591). To  successfully plead a sex-trafficking claim under Section  1591(a)(1) of the Act—the provision [*19]  that governs  the primary conduct of sex-trafficking, as distinct from  benefitting from sex trafficking—the plaintiff must  adequately allege that the defendant (1) knowingly  recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided,  obtained, or maintained by any means a person; (2)  'knowing, or in reckless disregard of the fact, that means  of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion ... will be  used""; (3) ""to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1). Here, the  Defendants challenged the sex-trafficking claim in the  Complaint on two primary grounds. The defense  contends that Richardson has not adequately alleged a  ""commercial sex act"" under the Act, nor has she  plausibly alleged that ""coercion"" (the pertinent form of  forbidden conduct in this case) caused the commercial  sex act. NU Defs.' Br. at 20-26; Bonnevier's Br. at 7-12.  Again, however, the defense arguments fail at the  pleading stage. The Act defines ""commercial sex act"" under § 1591 as  ""any sex act, on account of which anything of value is  given to or received by any person."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(e)(3). Richardson argues that the harassment that  she experienced—which included sexual groping and  touching—constitutes a ""sex act"" under the Act.  Pl.'s [*20]  Br. at 2. None of the Defendants actually  disagree with Richardson on this specific point. So the  question here is whether Richardson adequately alleges  that anything of value was given or received ""on account  of"" the sex act. § 1591(e)(3). To the Defendants' way of  thinking, the answer is no, because Richardson has not  specifically alleged that there was a direct payment of  donations from alumni or fans in exchange for the sex  acts. Defs.' Br. at 20. But this argument is premised on a too-narrow definition  of commercial sex act when compared to the plain  meaning of the statutory text. The statutory definition  does not require pleading any direct exchange—only  that ""on account of"" the sex act, act ""anything of value""  was ""given to or received by any person,"" § 1591(e)(3)  (emphases added). As set out in the factual Background  section in this Opinion, the allegations do plausibly  allege an exchange of donations for the sex acts. At  every home game, cheerleaders were instructed to  ""flirtatiously mingle"" with fans, and on ""several""  occasions, Coach Bonnevier sent Richardson to the  limited-membership Wilson Club ""to flirt with wealthy,  elderly donors ...."" Compl. ¶ 57. These mandated events  led to harassment and [*21]  assaults in which fans  ""placed their hands on [Richardson's] buttocks and  breasts while taking pictures."" Id. ¶ 58. On top of that,  outside of athletics games, the cheerleaders were  required to attend alumni events dressed ""in their tiny  cheerleading uniforms."" Id. ¶ 64. At the alumni events,  the women on the cheerleading team—and only the  women, not the male cheerleaders, who were not even  required to attend, id. ¶ 67—were required to ""flirt"" and  take photos with the alumni, who touched ""them  inappropriately on their lower backs and behinds while  taking photos."" Id. ¶ 65. Based on these marching  orders to the female cheerleaders, and the specific  emphasis on the Wilson Club and alumni events, the  reasonable inference is that the fans and donors were  allowed to engage in sex acts with the cheerleaders in  exchange for the fans' and donors' financial support of  the Athletics Department and the University. See id. ¶  66. Page 7 of 13 The other disputed element of the sex-trafficking claim  is the Act's requirement that ""means of force, threats of  force, fraud, [or] coercion"" caused the commercial sex  act. 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Richardson grounds her claim  on ""coercion."" Pl.'s Br. at 34. The Defendants argue that  the payback [*22]  of the scholarship and expenses,  plus the go-forward loss of the scholarship, does not  amount to ""coercion"" under the Act. This back-and-forth is essentially a reprise of the  dispute over whether Richardson labored under a threat  of serious harm under the forced-labor statutes, §§  1589, 1590. That is because the Act defines ""coercion""  for a sex-trafficking claim as (among other things): ""(A)  threats of serious harm ... against any person; (B) any  scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to  believe that failure to perform an act would result in  serious harm to ... any person."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(2).  Threats of serious harm, in turn, is defined—like it is in  the forced-labor statutes—sufficiently serious, under all  the surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable  person of the same background and in the same  circumstances to perform or to continue performing  commercial sexual activity in order to avoid incurring  that harm,"" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(5). And, again like the  forced-labor definition, ""harm"" does include ""financial""  harm. § 1591(e)(5). Given the similarity between the forced-labor definition  and the sex-trafficking definition, the analysis and the  answer are the same. Richardson faced the risk (going  forward) of losing almost $10,000 [*23]  in scholarships,  as well as (looking backwards) a mandatory repayment  of around that same amount of money. With the benefit  of the pleading-stage standard of review, Richardson  has adequately alleged that she was coerced into  performing the commercial sex acts. C. Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization  Act Civil Liability (§ 1595) In its early versions, the Trafficking Victims Protection  Act imposed criminal liability for, among other things,  forced labor, forced-labor trafficking, and sex trafficking.  18 U.S.C. §§ 1589, 1590, 1591. In 2003, Congress  added a civil-liability provision through the Trafficking  Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. Pub. L. No. 108- 193, 117 Stat. 2875, 2878 (codified at 18 U.S.C. §  1595). At that time, the civil provision only imposed  liability against the direct trafficker of the victims. Id. In  2008, however, Congress expanded the scope of civil  liability. Pub. L. 110-457, 122 Stat. 5044 (William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008). Section 1595 of the Act  now provides a civil remedy against not only the direct  perpetrator, but also ""whoever knowingly benefits, or  attempts or conspires to benefit, financially or by  receiving anything of value from participation in a  venture which that person knew or should have known  has engaged in an act in violation of this chapter,"" 18  U.S.C. § 1595(a) (emphases added). As  discussed  earlier,  Richardson  alleges  that  Northwestern, DaSilva, Obering, Polisky, and Bonnevier  all violated specific criminal-liability provisions of the Act,  namely, 18 U.S.C. § 1589 (forced labor), [*24]  § 1590  (forced-labor trafficking), § 1591 (sex trafficking).  Because  the  Defendants  allegedly  violated  the  underlying criminal statutes, Richardson argues, they  are allegedly liable under 18 U.S.C. § 1595 for civil  liability. Richardson argues that Bonnevier is liable as  the direct perpetrator, and Northwestern, DaSilva,  Obering, and Polisky are liable, at the least, as knowing  beneficiaries of the violations. Compl. ¶¶ 185-87, 192,  209-11, 218-19, 228-30, 235-36. The Northwestern Defendants frame the elements of  beneficiary liability differently than Richardson, but all  agree in substance that to successfully state a claim for  civil  liability  on  the  Northwestern  Defendants,  Richardson must adequately allege that they (1)  knowingly benefitted (2) from participation in a venture,  and (3) that the venture violated the Act and (4) that the  Northwestern Defendants knew or should have known  that the venture violated the Act. The Defendants argue  that Richardson has failed to plead sufficient facts for  any element of the civil-liability provision. NU Defs.' Br.  at 7-19; Bonnevier Br. at 7-11. According to all of the  Defendants, the allegations do not plausibly allege that  a ""venture"" was formed; nor that the Defendants [*25]   ""particpat[ed]"" in the venture; nor that the Defendants  knew or should have known that the venture violated the  Act; nor that there was any knowing benefit to the  Defendants. Defs.' Br. at 8-19. But these objections to  the civil-liability claim fall short at the pleading stage.  Each element is addressed in turn, taking the ""venture""  and ""participation"" in a venture together and first. 1. ""Venture"" and ""Participation"" in a Venture As a threshold matter, the parties focus much of their  disagreement on the definitions of ""venture"" and  ""participation in a venture"" under 18 U.S.C. § 1595.  Unfortunately, Section 1595 does not define ""venture"" or  Page 8 of 13 ""participation"" in a venture. But the underlying criminal  provision for sex trafficking, passed before Congress  added a civil liability provision, does define those terms  in 18 U.S.C. § 1591 (though, as explained in detail  below, there is a distinction between the carry-over (or  not) of ""venture"" versus ""participation"" in a venture). On the definition of ""venture,"" the Defendants argue  that, because venture is not defined in § 1595, it should  be given its plain meaning as provided by dictionary  definitions. NU Defs.' Br. at 8. The Defendants rely on  various,  hand-picked  dictionary  definitions  to  suggest [*26]  that venture must involve some element  of ""risk."" Id. But there is no need to turn to dictionary  definitions at all, because Congress defined venture in  the same statutory scheme. Congress defined ""venture""  in the sex-trafficking provision, 18 U.S.C. § 1591, as  ""any group of two or more individuals associated in fact,  whether or not a legal entity,"" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(6).  That's it. There is no reference to riskiness of the  venture or, really, to anything else. With the Section 1591 sex-trafficking definition of  ""venture"" in place, the plain language of the statute is  conclusive unless there is some other clear statutory  command to the contrary. United States v. Berkos, 543  F.3d 392, 396 (7th Cir. 2008) (cleaned up). Identical  words used in different parts of the same statute are  generally presumed to have the same meaning. United  States v. Achbani, 507 F.3d 598, 602 (7th Cir. 2007).  Given that Section 1595 authorizes civil liability for sex- trafficking violations of Section 1591, the statutory- interpretation tool applies equally well here: the sex- trafficking definition in Section 1591 ought to be  incorporated into Section 1595. It is true that the Eleventh Circuit has declined to carry  over the criminal definition of ""participation in a venture""  to the civil-liability provision and has asserted that the  text of § 1591 overcomes that presumption. Doe #1 v.  Red Roof Inns, Inc., 21 F.4th 714, 724 (11th Cir. 2021).  In Red Roof, the Eleventh Circuit reasoned in part that  because [*27]  § 1591 explicitly says that its definition of  ""participation in a venture"" applies ""[i]n this section,"" §  1591(e) (prefatory clause), Congress did not intend for  the definition to apply elsewhere—including to the civil- liability provision. In lieu of the sex-trafficking definition,  the Eleventh Circuit applied a mixture of dictionary  definitions to define ""venture"" and ""participation in a  venture"" as taking part in a common undertaking or  enterprise involving risk and potential profit. Red Roof,  21 F.4th at 725. But the two statutory sections, Sections 1591 and 1595,  were enacted in a sequence that undermines that  reasoning. As explained earlier, the sex-trafficking  statute, § 1591, was passed in 2000, before the civil- liability section, § 1595, was passed in 2003. There is  nothing in the text of Section 1591's definitional  subsections to suggest that Congress was affirmatively  excluding their application to any later-passed, related  statute—let alone one that actually incorporates the  elements of Section 1591, like the civil-liability provision  of Section 1595. Also, Section 1591's reference to ""In  this section"" is merely the prefatory clause before the  listing of terms. The subsection is set out as ""(e) In this  section:"" and goes on to set forth subparagraphs (1)  through (6). § 1591(e), § 1591(e)(1)-(6). It is not as if the  clause says, ""In this section, [*28]  and only in this  section."" Nothing in the text of the sex-trafficking  definitional section precludes its application to the civil- liability provision. Indeed, the Public Law that added  Section  1595's  civil-liability  provision  contains  a  congressional  finding  emphasizing  the  continued  problem of human trafficking: ""Trafficking in persons  continues to victimize countless men, women, and  children in the United States and abroad."" Pub. L. 108- 193, § 2(1). It would be odd for Congress to make that  finding and then laden the civil-liability provision with  new, barnacled definitions of terms already defined by  pre-existing anti-trafficking provisions. The Defendants also argue that Richardson must plead  that the Defendants actively formed a venture. But,  again, no requirement like that is found in the sex- trafficking definition of ""venture,"" which is simply ""any  group of two or more individuals associated in fact,  whether or not a legal entity."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(6).  Associated-in-fact is not a completely new legal term:  the Supreme Court has used that term in explaining  when a group of individuals can qualify as an  ""enterprise"" under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt  Organizations  Act,  18  U.S.C.  §  1961(4).  An  ""association-in-fact enterprise"" should have at least  three structural features: ""a purpose, relationships [*29]   among those associated with the enterprise, and  longevity sufficient to permit those associates to pursue  the enterprise's purpose."" Boyle v. United States, 556  U.S. 938, 946, 129 S. Ct. 2237, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1265  (2009). Applying that definition (from one pre-existing criminal  statute to another), Richardson pleads sufficient facts to  allege that Northwestern, Obering, DaSilva, and Polisky  (and, indeed, Bonnevier) were associated in fact. The  individual Defendants were employed by Northwestern  Page 9 of 13 and the actions spanned over the course of two years.  Despite Richardson's objections and warnings to  University leadership, she continued to be forced to  attend the alumni events and Wilson Club events that  subjected her to sexual assaults. As part of the  University and the Athletics Department, the Defendants  (it is reasonable to infer) were motivated to promote the  financial support and donations of fans and alumni. This  is more than enough to allege an association in fact.  Richardson has adequately alleged that the Defendants  were part of a ""venture"" under Section 1595(a). Moving on to ""participation"" in a venture, the carry-over  from the sex-trafficking statute to the civil-liability  provision is not nearly as smooth. Section 1591 defines  participation in a venture: ""the term participation in a  venture [*30]  means knowingly assisting, supporting, or  facilitating a violation of subsection (a)(1),"" where (a)(1)  refers to the first subsection of Section 1591. 18 U.S.C.  § 1591(e)(4) (emphasis added). The key term here is  the mental state of ""knowingly."" Under Section 1591,  participation in a venture requires a knowing mental  state: (a)Whoever knowingly— ... (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of  value, from participation in a venture which has  engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2) (emphases added). In contrast,  Section 1595(a) allows civil liability based on a less- culpable mental state, namely, it is enough if the  defendant knew or ""should have known"" that the  venture has violated the Act. § 1595(a). This is an  important textual difference that creates a more  expansive range of culpable mental states for civil  liability under § 1595(a) that the mental states required  for criminal liability. Yes, it is generally true that the  same statutory terms ought to be read identically in  related statutes, but the general presumption yields  where, as here, ""there is such variation in the  connection in which the words are used as reasonably  to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in  different parts of the act with different intent,"" Atlantic  Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, 286 U.S. 427, 433,  52 S. Ct. 607, 76 L. Ed. 1204 (1932). The upshot is that     civil liability does [*31]  not require that the defendant  knowingly participate in a violation of the Act—because  it is enough for the defendant to benefit from  participation in a venture that the defendant ""should  have known"" violated the Act. Having said that, it bears emphasizing that the textual  differences between Section 1591 and Section 1595  only pertains to the necessary mental state—there is no  reason to alter the conduct aspect of the definition in  Section 1591(e)(4). Participation in a venture still  requires ""assisting, supporting, or facilitating"" the  venture. Id. But Richardson need not plead that the  Defendants themselves committed an overt act in  furtherance of ""the sex trafficking aspect of the venture,""  United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App'x 272, 286 (6th Cir.  2016) (unpublished order); see A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc.,  455 F. Supp. 3d 171 (E.D. Pa. 2020); M.A. v. Wyndham  Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959 (S.D. Ohio  2019). Here, given the absence of a requirement that  the Defendants directly engaged in sex trafficking, the  Complaint adequately pleads participation: after each  Defendant became aware of the alleged misconduct,  they drew distinctions between the misconduct that the  Defendants chose to curtail—and the misconduct that  they allowed to continue. Bonnevier was still permitted  by the Northwestern Defendants to require women  cheerleaders to attend alumni fundraising events and  events at the Wilson Club. Indeed, it is [*32]  a  reasonable inference from the allegations that the  alumni fundraising events and the Wilson Club events  were the more financially lucrative events at which the  sex acts took place. At the pleading stage, giving  Richardson the benefit of the doubt, the Complaint  sufficiently alleges that the Defendants facilitated the  continued  presence  of  the  female  cheerleaders  specifically at the events that most benefitted the  Athletics Department and the University. Both the  elements of ""venture"" and ""participation"" in a venture  have been sufficiently pleaded. 2. Knew or Should Have Known Next, the Defendants argue that the Complaint lacks  facts to suggest that they knew or should have known  that the venture engaged in a violation of the Trafficking  Victims Protection Act. NU Defs.' Br. at 14-17;  Bonnevier Br. at 2. As part of this argument, the  Defendants contend that the last commercial sex act  alleged by Richardson happened in January 2019, and  that because the University, Obering, Polisky, and  DaSilva were not put on notice of the misconduct until  Page 10 of 13 that same month, the allegations fail to allege  knowledge or even constructive knowledge. NU  Defendants' Br. at 16, n. 10, 17. The Defendants are wrong. The Complaint clearly  alleges [*33]  that the harassment and sex acts  continued to happen after Richardson put those  University leaders on notice of the misconduct.  Richardson alleges that, after putting the Defendants on  notice of the harassment, she was ""subjected to the  same photo opportunities, groping, and harassment that  she had previously notified Northwestern about."" Compl.  ¶ 100 (emphasis added). That is not a mere conclusory  allegation. The allegation directly refers back to specific  conduct that was already laid out in the Complaint, so  Richardson need not restate each act of misconduct to  show the continuing timeline. So, after being explicitly  put on notice (which is actual knowledge, let alone  constructive  knowledge)  of  the  misconduct,  the  harassment and sex acts continued. Those allegations  sufficiently allege the culpable mental state for civil  liability under Section 1595 for all of the Defendants. Even more specifically, Obering (the Associate Athletic  Director  for  Marketing)  allegedly  knew  of  the  harassment and sex acts because Northwestern's team  doctor  directly  told  Obering  that  (according  to  Richardson) Bonnevier forced Richardson to participate  in events, including fundraising events and appearances  at the Wilson [*34]  club, where she was sexually  harassed and assaulted. Compl. ¶¶ 57, 82. Indeed, in  mid-January 2019, Richardson directly told Obering  about the harassment, id. ¶ 84, and even provided on  January 22 (in response to Obering's demand) written  testimonials from other cheerleaders detailing the  misconduct, id. ¶¶ 84-86. With regard to then-Deputy Director of Athletics Polisky,  Richardson met with Polisky in January 2019 and told  him about the abuse that she had suffered at various  alumni events. Compl. ¶ 88. Polisky (and also Obering)  accused Richardson of writing the testimonials herself,  and put the burden on Richardson to corroborate the  claims. Id. Polisky later attended the meeting on May  28, 2019, during which Richardson reiterated that the  forced and coerced participation in various events  where she was sexually harassed and touched had  continued. Compl. ¶¶ 88, 96. Lastly, with regard to Deputy Title IX Coordinator  DaSilva, as discussed earlier, here too Richardson  adequately alleged that she put DaSilva on notice of the  harassment and sex acts. To sum up again, the context  starts with, on February 1, 2019, DaSilva emailing  Richardson with mischaracterizations of her allegations,  including [*35]  saying that Richardson had only raised  the single issue of one individual fan harassing her.  Compl. ¶ 90. In response, Richardson corrected  DaSilva's mischaracterization and set forth multiple  dates and events during which she had been assaulted.  Id. ¶ 91. A few days later (on February 5), Richardson  emailed Obering to report that, although Bonnevier had  been more organized at a recent basketball game, she  ""still made derogatory comments to members of the  team regarding their physical appearance ...."" Id. ¶ 92.  Yet DaSilva refused to conduct a formal investigation,  and instead only provided training to Bonnevier that did  not work. Id. ¶ 95. DaSilva's knowledge of the  misconduct is adequately alleged. 3. Knowingly Benefitted The next question is whether Richardson has sufficiently  alleged that the Defendants ""knowingly benefit[ted] ...  financially or by receiving anything of value"" from  participation in the venture. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). Here,  again, at the early pleading stage, the factual allegations  are sufficient to support the reasonable inference that  the Defendants all knowingly benefitted from their  participation  in  the  venture.  Remember  that  Richardson's allegations primarily focus on three  categories [*36]  of events: tailgating; alumni fundraising  events; and appearances at the Wilson Club. Of those  three categories, only tailgating was addressed by the  Defendants, when Richardson finally was no longer  forced to attend tailgates. But it is reasonable to infer  that the presence of the cheerleaders at tailgates—open  to virtually all fans, regardless of whether they were  donors—had the smallest impact on alumni fundraising  and alumni relations. Yet even after Richardson made  the Defendants aware of the sexual harassment and the  barrage of assaults, she was still required to attend the  fundraising events and Wilson Club events, Compl. ¶¶  12, 100, 104, 152, the most financially lucrative events  for the Athletics Department and, in turn, the University.  The Wilson Club is a private space and is restricted to  fans who hold loge, Wilson Club, or courtside (for  basketball games) tickets. Id. ¶ 57 & n.4. Polisky,  DaSilva, Obering, DaSilva, and Bonnevier all had an  interest—as University leaders and employees—in  maintaining the flow of donations from alumni and from  Wilson Club members. To be sure, the individual  Defendants did not pocket money directly from donors.  But that is not needed under [*37]  the Act. Instead, it is  enough to benefit by receiving anything of value for  Page 11 of 13 participating in the venture, § 1595(a), including the  benefit of promoting their own employer's coffers and  prestige, and maintain their own employment. The  Defendants themselves allegedly drew a distinction  between tailgating—with its less-sizeable donation  impact—and the fundraising and Wilson Club events. At  least at the pleading stage, before discovery can test  the facts, the benefit element has been adequately  pleaded. In sum, then, the forced-labor claim (Count 5),  the force-labor trafficking claim (Count 3), and the sex- trafficking claim (Count 4) are all adequately pleaded  and survive the motion to dismiss. D. Breach of Contract & Promissory Estoppel Moving from the federal claims to the state law claims,  Richardson also brings state law claims for breach of  contract and promissory estoppel. For these two claims,  Richardson relies on Northwestern's published Policy on  Sexual Misconduct. Compl. ¶¶ 111, 239. But both  claims are not adequately pleaded because Richardson  has not sufficiently alleged that Northwestern made and  broke a binding promise somewhere in the Policy. Under Illinois common law, it is indeed [*38]  possible  that the relationship between a student and a university  can amount to a binding contract in certain aspects.  See, e.g., Ross v. Creighton Univ., 957 F.2d 410, 416  (7th Cir. 1992). But the mere existence of a student- college relationship is not carte blanche for breach-of- contract claims. To successfully state a claim for breach  of contract, Richardson must point to a specific  contractual promise, rather than challenge the way that  Northwestern handled the sexual-misconduct complaint.  Yes, the handling of the complaint can give rise to other  forms of liability, like under Title IX's anti-discrimination  provisions. But that does not mean that a contract- based promise was broken, and the Complaint does not  identify that kind of promise. A similar flaw applies to the promissory-estoppel claim.  To successfully allege a claim for promissory estoppel  under Illinois common law, a plaintiff must allege that (1)  the defendants made an unambiguous promise to the  plaintiff; (2) the plaintiff relied on the promise; (3) the              plaintiff's reliance was expected and foreseeable by  defendants; and (4) the plaintiff relied on the promise to  the plaintiff's detriment. Quake Constr., Inc. v. American  Airlines, Inc., 141 Ill. 2d 281, 565 N.E.2d 990, 1004, 152  Ill. Dec. 308 (Ill. 1990). The Complaint fails on the first  element:  Richardson  has  not  alleged  facts  suggesting [*39]   that  Northwestern  made  any  unambiguous promise to her. Richardson offers the following as the alleged promises:  (1)  Northwestern's  promise  to  provide  a  safe  environment free from discrimination and harassment,  Compl. ¶ 246; and (2) Northwestern's promise to  provide a thorough and equitable process to resolve any  alleged violation of the University's policies. Id. But  neither of those statements are definite enough to  constitute an unambiguous promise. At most, they  reflect a commitment to broad principles of fairness and  nondiscrimination without giving specifics about how  those principles will be achieved. Indeed, the context in which the statements were made  confirms that they are not the kind of unambiguous  promises on which a reasonable person would be  entitled to rely. The Sexual Misconduct Policy, for  example, begins with broad aspirational statements,  noting that the policy is intended to ""promot[e] the  dignity of all individuals."" R. 42-1 at 2, Defs.' Exh. A,  2018 Sexual Misconduct Policy; R. 42-2 at 2, Defs.' Exh.  B, 2019 Sexual Misconduct Policy. More to the point,  the Policy explicitly says that because of the unique  nature of sexual misconduct claims, the University  ""reserves [*40]  discretion to take reasonable actions to  address those issues in a manner consistent with the  spirit of the applicable policies and these guidelines.""  2018 Sexual Misconduct Policy at 21 (emphases  added); 2019 Sexual Misconduct Policy at 22. Those  discretion-reserving statements hedge so much that a  student cannot reasonably rely on them as setting forth  specific promises. The promissory-estoppel claim must  be dismissed. E. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress Richardson's final claim is that Bonnevier intentionally  caused her severe emotional distress. As a threshold  matter, Bonnevier asserts the statute of limitations, that  is, she argues that the emotional-distress claim against  her is time-barred because all of the alleged conduct  took place before January 29, 2019, placing it outside  the two-year statute of limitations. Bonnevier Br. at 12. But the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense,  Page 12 of 13 and ""plaintiffs need not anticipate and attempt to plead  around all potential defenses."" Xechem, Inc. v. Bristol- Myers Squibb Co., 372 F.3d 899, 901 (7th Cir. 2004).  Indeed, the Seventh Circuit has repeatedly held that  dismissal under Civil Rule 12(b)(6) on statute-of- limitations grounds is ""irregular,"" because the defendant  bears the burden of proof on affirmative defenses. [*41]   United States v. Northern Trust Co., 372 F.3d 886, 888  (7th Cir. 2004) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)). It is true,  however, that when the allegations of a complaint itself  reveal that the case is barred by the statute of  limitations—and no factual development is otherwise  needed—then dismissal can be appropriate. Indep.  Trust Corp. v. Stewart Info. Servs. Corp., 665 F.3d 930,  935 (7th Cir. 2012); Jay E. Hayden Found. v. First  Neighbor Bank, N.A., 610 F.3d 382, 383 (7th Cir. 2010)  (explaining that ""if it is plain from the complaint that the  [statute of limitations] defense is indeed a bar to the suit  dismissal is proper without further pleading."") (cleaned  up). The motion to dismiss would be, in essence,  treated as a motion for judgment on the pleadings under  Civil Rule 12(c). Brownmark Films, LLC v. Comedy  Partners, 682 F.3d 687, 690 (7th Cir. 2012) (citing  Brooks, 578 F.3d at 579). Here, it is not clear from the Complaint itself that the  statute of limitations bars the emotional-distress claim  against Bonnevier. The statute of limitations on  emotional-distress claims in Illinois is two years. Flentye  v. Kathrein, 485 F. Supp. 2d 903, 923 (N.D. Ill. 2007)  (citing 735 ILCS 5/13-202). Richardson filed the  Complaint in this case on January 29, 2021. Bonnevier  would be right that the claim is barred by the statute of  limitations if all of the alleged misconduct happened  before January 29, 2019. But, as detailed earlier, the  Complaint does allege ongoing misconduct after  January 29, 2019. For example, Richardson alleged that  during the 2019 athletics season—which would start in  Fall 2019—she still suffered the harassment and  assaults: [*42]  Plaintiff was still sent to numerous alumni events as  well as the Wilson Club during games to be  paraded around in her skimpy uniform in order to  please alumni and garner donations. As such, she  was subjected to the same photo opportunities,  groping, and harassment that she had previously  notified Northwestern about. Compl. ¶ 100 (emphasis added). Even later in time,  Richardson also alleges that she told DaSilva again in  May 2020 that the ""same issues"" concerning Bonnevier  continued. Id. ¶ 103. To repeat what the Opinion  explained earlier, Richardson need not spell out the  specific conduct again in every single paragraph and  every single time frame—it is enough that she  incorporates by reference the conduct that she  specifically alleged earlier in the Complaint. Maybe  discovery will disprove the allegations, but at the  pleading stage, the statute of limitations is not a barrier. On the merits of the emotional-distress claim, to  successfully allege that type of claim under Illinois  common law, a plaintiff must allege that (1) the  defendant's conduct was ""extreme and outrageous;"" (2)  the defendant either intended that his conduct inflict  severe emotional distress or knew that there was [*43]   at least a high probability that his conduct would cause  severe emotional distress; and (3) the defendant's  conduct in fact caused severe emotional distress.  Schweihs v. Chase Home Fin., LLC, 2016 IL 120041,  412 Ill. Dec. 882, 77 N.E.3d 50, 63 (Ill. 2016). Run-of- the mill annoyances and oppressions do not qualify as  ""extreme and outrageous"" conduct. Instead, the  offending conduct must be ""so outrageous in character,  and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible  bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious,  and utterly intolerable in a civilized community."" Id.  (cleaned up). The Complaint readily alleges for the emotional-distress  claim to survive the dismissal motion. Richardson has  plausibly alleged that Bonnevier, among other things,  intentionally and repeatedly put Richardson in situations  where she would be sexually assaulted; forced  Richardson to undress and to change clothes in public  spaces; restricted her ability to eat; and mocked her  attempts to report sexual harassment. Compl. ¶¶ 117- 18, 57-59, 61-62, 64-65, 68-71, 75-78, 100. As the head  coach, Bonnevier was in a position of supreme authority  over Richardson—which intensifies the outrageousness  of the misconduct. Nor were these one-off instances.  Bonnevier allegedly knew that she was putting  Richardson [*44]  in the path of assault, and yet  continued to do so again and again over the course of  two years. And given Richardson's complaints to and  about Bonnevier, Bonnevier knew how Richardson was  suffering—yet continued on anyway. Viewing the light in  the most favorable to Richardson, as required at the  pleading stage, the allegations amount to extreme and  outrageous misconduct. What's more, Richardson has  alleged that as a result of Bonnevier's misconduct,  Richardson experienced panic attacks, and needed both  mental-health therapy and prescription medications. Id.  ¶¶ 167, 255. At this stage, all of the elements of an  emotional-distress claim have been adequately alleged. Page 13 of 13",0
"Rivas v. State, 2023 Fla. App. LEXIS 8246","N, J. A jury found Rene Elmer Rivas guilty of (1) sexual  battery on a person less than twelve years old and (2)  lewd or lascivious molestation. The trial court sentenced  him to life imprisonment. Rivas now appeals, and we  affirm. At trial, the victim testified that when she was seven  years old, Rivas molested and raped her while she was  in his care. On a separate occasion, also when the  victim was seven years old, Rivas forced her to perform  oral sex on him. About three and a half years after the incidents, the  victim confided in her friend about the sexual abuse.  The friend persuaded the victim to tell her mother. The  mother contacted the authorities, and Rivas eventually  faced trial. I. On  appeal,  Rivas  argues  that  two  testimonial  statements, one from the friend and the other from  Nurse Practitioner Natasha Woodham, were unfairly  prejudicial [*2]  and vitiated the legitimacy of the entire  trial. We disagree. The first statement that Rivas challenges is the friend's,  who testified for the State: [The State]: Do you know if [the victim] had told her  mom at that point? [Friend]: She had told me that she never told  anyone. [The State]: How did you feel about that? [Friend]: It honestly hurt me, because I know that,  through my experiences that I've had with multiple  men in my youth, it's hard to open up to someone,  especially in Hispanic communities, it's very  normalized behavior upon men. Defense counsel did not object. On appeal, Rivas  argues that the testimony prejudiced him because it  characterized child molestation as normalized behavior  among men like Rivas. Since the court admitted the statement without  objection, the issue is unpreserved, and fundamental  error analysis applies. Serrano v. State, 279 So. 3d 296,  301 (Fla. 1st DCA 2019). Fundamental error is an error  so severe that it reaches ""into the validity of the trial  itself to the extent that a verdict of guilty could not have  been obtained without the assistance of the alleged  Page 2 of 2 error."" Knight v. State, 286 So. 3d 147, 151 (Fla. 2019)  (quoting Brown v. State, 124 So. 2d 481, 484 (Fla.  1960)). The  underlying  premise  of  Rivas'  argument  is  questionable. He asserts that the friend characterized  child molestation as normalized behavior [*3]  among  men like Rivas. But the friend did not say ""child  molestation"" nor name Rivas when she mentioned  ""normalized behavior."" So the record does not support  Rivas' contention. But even if Rivas' assertion is fair, his legal argument  still fails. He argues that the friend's testimony was  unfairly prejudicial. To amount to unfair prejudice, the  testimony must have ""an undue tendency to suggest  decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not  necessarily, an emotional one."" Brown v. State, 719 So.  2d 882, 885 (Fla. 1998) (quoting Old Chief v. United  States, 519 U.S. 172, 180, 117 S. Ct. 644, 136 L. Ed. 2d  574 (1997)). Rivas does not identify the ""improper  basis"" suggested by the testimony, how the testimony  may have unduly encouraged a decision on that  improper ground, nor any rule of evidence that would  preclude the statement's admission. Even if the testimony were prejudicial, its admission  would still fall short of fundamental error. The record  does not reveal that Rivas would have been acquitted  without this specific testimony. Considering the stronger  evidence throughout the trial (such as the victim's direct  testimony about what occurred when she was seven  years old), the friend's attestation alone does not appear  to have sealed Rivas' fate. Without showing that he  could not have been convicted but for the alleged [*4]   error, Rivas fails to demonstrate fundamental error.  Knight, 286 So. 3d at 151. II. Next, Rivas challenges the statement of Nurse  Practitioner Woodham, who conducted a medical  examination on the victim. The examination disclosed a  tear of the victim's hymen: [The State]: So, your opinion is that this injury was  occurred from some penetrating force? [Woodham]: That's correct. [The State]: Is there any significance to the fact that  you found this injury in [the victim]? [Woodham]: Yes. So, as I said before, I've been at  the Children's Advocacy Center since 2015 and I've  done a lot of these exams. Most children that I do  these genital exams on, have no injuries, even  when we know that there's been something  happened to them, either video or someone's  walked on the act happening. Most of these  children, probably over 90 percent of them do not  have injuries to their genitalia at all because of the  nature of the vagina and how much it can stretch  whenever injuries happen to it. So, the fact that she  had an injury is significant. Out of all the exams that  I've done, I probably only have maybe two handfuls  of children that have had a transection to their  hymen. Defense counsel did not object. On appeal, Rivas  argues that [*5]  the testimony was unduly prejudicial  because any reasonable juror would develop an affinity  for the victim after hearing that ""the seven-year-old's  vagina was penetrated with such force that her hymen  was torn."" That, he says, could have ""tipped the scales""  in the State's favor. Rivas correctly asserts that the jury may have found this  testimony emotionally charging. That is true of nearly  any evidence pointing to a child sex crime. Yet juries are  generally allowed to consider any evidence that tends to  prove a material fact. See §§ 90.401-.402, Fla. Stat.  (2022). Woodham's testimony about the victim's  physical examination supported the State's case. Rivas  supplies no authority that would disallow the testimony  nor any ""improper basis"" it could have induced. III. To win on these unpreserved issues, Rivas would have  to demonstrate fundamental error. None of Rivas'  arguments establish that the trial court committed any  error, much less fundamental error. We affirm. A. R and W, JJ., concur.",0
"Rodgers v. Homes, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217337","[*1] THIS MATTER is before the Court on motions to  dismiss filed by Defendants Costner Law Office, PLLC;  Kuester Management Group; NVR Inc.-Ryan Homes;  and Flagstar Bank pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1), 12(b)(4),  12(b)(6) and 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  (Doc. Nos. 32, 34, 39, 43). Also pending is Plaintiff's pro  se Motion for Preliminary Injunction, seeking an Order  from this Court ""to stop dismissal of my [case],"" and  awarding $60 million in punitive damages. (Doc. No.  47). I. BACKGROUND Pro se Plaintiff Marcha L.M. Rodgers filed this action on  March 27, 2023, naming as Defendants Costner Law  Office, PLLC; Kuester Management Group; NVR Inc.- Ryan Homes; and Flagstar Bank. Plaintiff's claims arise  from a routine residential real estate closing in which  Plaintiff took out a mortgage to buy a residence at 959  Portrush Lane, Tega Cay, SC 29708. Plaintiff bought  the property from NVR, Inc., for $318,000.00 with an  $80,000 down payment. Defendant Costner Law Office,  PLLC was Plaintiff's closing attorney. Plaintiff financed  the sale through NVR Mortgage Finance, Inc. The  closing occurred without incident, and the special 1 warranty deed and mortgage were properly recorded.  The recorded deed conveys a fee simple estate to Plaintiff. See (Doc. No. 6-2, p. 1). Plaintiff [*2]  alleges that, after the closing, she learned  that the deed of trust was not filed, and what I had agreed to  purchase was not what was listed on record. What was  listed was not homeownership, of this property. This  deed, encumbrance all of my rights to any property, I  own nothing, all of my future rights of refinancing will  never be possible: everything I had worked for was  gone. NVR/Ryan Homes correlated this scheme with  Flagstar Bank and Costner Law Office to [deprive] me of  all  my  rights.  They  created  [an]  illusion  of  homeownership to gain financially. By filing [an]  encumbrance  deed  with  the  assessor[']s  office  [deprived] me of my ownership rights. They setup [an]  escrow account with Flagstar Bank which reversed my  payment to another account. To inflate the property  taxes collected with my payments, by tripling them to  intimidate, coercing, and sending threatening letters to  trick me into filing bankruptcy, to make it appear to me  that I own the property. (Id. p. 2). Plaintiff then alleges the following, in block  fashion: I am pursuing my rights; under article I, Pub. L.  amended 111-203, title X, 124, stat. 2092 (2010) and  Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692- 1692P; Civil Rights act, 1964 (Pub. L. 102-166 (title VII  as amended, Vol. 42, Pub. L. 102-166 CRH, title 5 (101- 1.0 to 3402-2.0) 2100-2101 to 2108-2109, amendment  IV & VIII, U.S. Constitution case histories; U.S. V.  Alston, 609 F.2d 531, 538 (D.C. Cir. 1979), U.S. v. Reid,  Page 2 of 4 533 F.2d 1255, 1264 n34 (D.C. Cir. 1976), U.S. v.  Cusiono, 694 F.2d 185, 187 (9th Cir. 1982). Page One of the Complaint's Addendum additionally  lists claims for ""breach [*3]  of contract and mail fraud."" The three cases cited by Plaintiff deal with  the federal criminal offenses of mail fraud. Because the allegations in Plaintiff's original Complaint  were vague, confusing, and failed to state any legally cognizable claim, the named  Defendants filed motions to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint. On August 24, 2023, the Court  ordered Plaintiff to amend her complaint within thirty days to ""clarify her factual and legal claims  against each Defendant."" (Doc. No. 30). Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on September 22,  2023. Despite the Court's Order, 2 Plaintiff's Amended Complaint neither clarifies her  factual and legal claims, nor does it tie her claims to each Defendant. In the Amended Complaint,  Plaintiff again contends that her claims arise under ""federal law.""1 The sole allegations in the  Amended Complaint are as follows:2 NVR Inc., Ryan Homes, and Costner Law Office PLLC  intentionally and willfully altered the legal status of my  contract of deed, and the character of the stated  condition of the documents. They filed and submitted a  counterfeit deed. NVR, Inc. and Costner Law Office  sold, transferred, sold, and explored the agreement to  third-party vendors without my [*4]  explicit written  consent. Kuester and Flagstar Bank aided them by  facilitating billing claims, under the contract of my  original creditor. Flagstar intentionally sent notice of  charges for mortgage payments without legal status.  They altered the billing amount by not applying  payments correctly, causing an exuberant increase in  the size of the amount of money sent. Kuester illegally  obtained funds under false misrepresentation of facts. I  have endured this pattern of sufferance and servitude  for over a year, and I am still feeling the effects  presently. All of the Defendants have not shown any  changes in their pursuit of counterfeit claims against me. (Doc. No. 31-1). Plaintiff seeks $60 million in punitive  damages. II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW Defendants move to dismiss this action for lack of  subject matter jurisdiction under FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(1), failure to state a claim under FED.  R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6), and failure to comply with FED. R. CIV. P. 8.3 Subject matter jurisdiction is a threshold question the  Court must address before reaching the merits of the case. Jones v. Am. Postal Workers  Union, 192 F.3d 417, 422 (4th Cir. 1999). The Court must dismiss any action over which it lacks  subject matter jurisdiction. Plaintiff, as the party seeking federal jurisdiction, has the burden to  show that subject matter jurisdiction [*5]  1 Plaintiff does not assert diversity jurisdiction under 28  U.S.C. § 1332. 2 The Court has fixed typos, misspellings, and  grammatical errors in the handwritten Amended  Complaint. 3 Additionally, Defendant Kuester seeks dismissal  based on insufficient service of process under Rule  12(b)(4). 3 exists. Richmond, Fredricksburg & Potomac R. Co. v.  United States, 945 F.2d 765, 768 (4th Cir. 1991).  ""Federal jurisdiction may not be premised on the mere  citation of federal statutes."" Wellerv. Dept. of Soc.  Servs. for the City of Baltimore, 901 F.2d 387, 391 (4th  Cir. 1990) (dismissal of pro se claims under Social  Security  Act  and  for  sex-based  discrimination).  Conclusory allegations of federal questions are not  sufficient to confer jurisdiction when none exists.  See,e.g., Sanderlin v. Hutchens, Senter & Britton, P.A.,  783 F. Supp. 2d 798, 800 (W.D.N.C. 2011) (dismissal of pro se plaintiffs' complaint for lack of  subject matter jurisdiction over claim against law firm,  mortgagee, and others to enjoin foreclosure sale despite  plaintiffs' assertion of ""important Federal Questions""). In reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to FED. R.  Page 3 of 4 CIV. P. 12(b)(6), the Court must accept as true all  factual allegations in the Complaint and draw all  reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the  plaintiff. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,  555-56 (2007). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion,  ""[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to  relief above the speculative level,"" with the complaint  having ""enough facts to state a claim to relief that is  plausible on its face."" Id. at 570. ""[T]he tenet [*6]  that a  court must accept as true all of the allegations contained  in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions,"" and  ""[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of  action, supported by mere conclusory statements"" are  insufficient. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)  (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). A complaint survives a motion to dismiss only if it ""states  a plausible claim for relief"" that ""permit[s] the court to  infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct""  based upon ""judicial experience and common sense."" Id. at 679  (citations omitted). While the Court may construe  Plaintiff's complaint liberally because she is proceeding  pro se, the complaint must still allege ""'facts sufficient to  state all the elements of [her] claim'"" to survive a motion  to dismiss. 4 Williams v. Wal-Mart Stores East, L.P., No. 5:18-CV-33- BO, 2018 WL 3341181, at *2 (E.D.N.C. July 6, 2018)  (quoting Bass v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 324  F.3d 761, 765 (4th Cir. 2003)). Rule 8 requires a complaint to contain a short and plain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief. FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2). ""Each  allegation must be simple, concise, and direct."" FED. R.  CIV. P. 8(d)(1). ""A 'shotgun pleading' is one that fails to  articulate claims with sufficient clarity to allow the  defendant to frame a responsive pleading or one in  which it is virtually impossible to know which allegations  of fact are intended to support which claims for relief.""  Wilkinson v. Wells [*7]  Fargo Bank, N.A., No. 3:19-CV- 00580-RJC, 2020 WL 2542867, at *3 (W.D.N.C. May 19, 2020). Pro se  complaints ""marred by shotgun pleading . . . warrant dismissal"" where it is ""impossible . . . to  decipher which allegations of fact are intended to  support which claims for relief."" Id. (quoting McCrea v.  Fargo, No. RDB-18-2490, 2019 WL 2513770, at *7 (D.  Md. June 17, 2019)). III. DISCUSSION The Court will dismiss this action for the reasons stated  in Defendants' motions to dismiss-namely, because  Plaintiff fails to show that this Court has subject matter  jurisdiction over her claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and  because Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint still does not  articulate Plaintiff's claims with sufficient clarity to allow  Defendants to frame any sort of responsive pleading or  to know which allegations match up with which claimed  violation.4 4 Plaintiff is perhaps upset because her tax and  insurances payments were placed in escrow, and her  monthly mortgage payment has increased. Or she may  be upset that her mortgage was transferred to a new  company to service her mortgage. In any event, both  actions (placing insurance and tax payments in escrow  and transferring a mortgage out to a different loan  servicer) are routine, common, and legal. 5 First, as to subject matter jurisdiction, federal [*8]   question jurisdiction is provided in 28 U.S.C. § 1331 for ""civil actions arising under the  Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States."" This means that federal courts have jurisdiction  to hear ""only those cases in which a well-pleaded  complaint establishes either that federal law creates the  cause of action or that the plaintiff's right to relief  necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial  question of federal law."" Franchise Tax Bd. v. Constr.  Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 27-28 (1983);  Battle v.Seibels Bruce Ins. Co., 288 F.3d 596, 606-07  (4th Cir. 2002). A mere reference to federal statutes ""is  not sufficient to obtain jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §  1331."" PEM Entities, LLC, v.County of Franklin, 57 F.4th  178, 183 (4th Cir. 2023). When the reference to a  federal claim is ""facially insubstantial or frivolous"" or ""so insubstantial,  implausible … or otherwise completely devoid of merit  as not to involve a federal controversy"" a complaint is  properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Id. at 183-84. Plaintiff may be attempting bring claims under the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (""Dodd-Frank""); the Fair Debt  Page 4 of 4 Collection Practices Act (""FDCPA""); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act; the Fourth and Eighth  Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; and/or 18 U.S.C.  § 1341 (criminal mail fraud). To the extent she asserts  that her claims arise under these federal laws, Plaintiff  alleges no facts to support her claims. First, there is generally no private right of action under  Dodd-Frank.  [*9] See Downey v.United States, No. CV  19-1212-CFC, 2019 WL 5595291, at *4 (D. Del. Oct. 30,  2019). There is likewise no private right of action for  criminal mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341. See Alford  v.Mecklenburg Cnty. Clerk of Superior Ct., No. 3:19-CV- 156-MOC-DSC, 2019 WL 2881556, at *5 (W.D.N.C.  July 2, 2019). As to her FDCPA claim, Plaintiff does not  allege that any of the named Defendants attempted to  collect any consumer debt from Plaintiff. Next, Title VII  of the 6 Civil  Rights  Act  prohibits  discrimination  in  the  employment context. See Lemon v. Myers Bigel,P.A.,  985 F.3d 392, 396 (4th Cir. 2021). Plaintiff has not  alleged any employer-employee relationship with any  named Defendant, nor do her allegations sound in  employment.  Finally,  the  Fourth  and  Eighth  Amendments of the U.S. Constitution apply to  government actors, not private entities like Defendants.  Monroe v. City of Charlottesville, Va., 579 F.3d 380, 386  (4th Cir. 2009) (Fourth Amendment); Holly v. Scott, 434  F.3d 287, 291 (4th Cir. 2006) (Eighth Amendment). In  sum, Plaintiff fails to show that this Court may assert  subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff's claims as  arising under federal law under Section 1331. Plaintiff also fails to state a cognizable claim against any  of the named Defendants for breach of contract or fraud.  Specifically, Plaintiff does not allege facts showing that  any of the named Defendants breached any contract  with Plaintiff. She also does not plead any required  elements of fraud such as ""the time, place, and contents  of the false representations, as well as the identity of the  person making the misrepresentation and what he  obtained thereby."" Adolphev. Option One Mortg. Corp.,  No. 3:11-CV-418-RJC, 2012 WL 5873308, at *6  (W.D.N.C. Nov. 20, 2012) (internal quotation marks  omitted) (citing Harrison v. Westinghouse Savannah  RiverCo., 176 F.3d 776, 784 (4th Cir. 1999)). In sum, Plaintiff [*10]  has failed to clarify her claims and  to show how each claim is tied to each Defendant. She  has also failed to prove that this Court has subject  matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Thus, the  Court will dismiss this action.",0
"Rogers v. State, 2023 Ind. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1398","[*1] Appeal from the Clark Circuit Court The Honorable Nicholas A. Karaffa, Judge Trial Court Cause No. 10C01-1912-F1-6 Memorandum Decision by Judge Weissmann Chief Judge Altice and Judge Kenworthy concur. Weissmann, Judge. [1] While in his mid-50s, Shawn Rogers sexually  molested and impregnated his 13-year-old neighbor.  Rogers pleaded guilty to one count of Level 1 felony  child molesting, for which the trial court sentenced him  to 30 years in prison. Rogers now appeals his sentence  as inappropriate under Indiana Appellate Rule 7(B) in  light of the nature of the offense and the character of the  offender. We affirm. Facts [2] In 2019, Rogers lived with his elderly mother in  Louisville, Kentucky, next door to a 13-year-old child  (Child). Child resided with a guardian. In the summer of  that year, Rogers drove Child to a Clarksville, Indiana,  hotel several times and had sexual intercourse with her  during each stay. [3] After learning of the molestation, Child's guardian  took her to the hospital and discovered she was  pregnant. When interviewed by police, Rogers admitted  he had taken Child to the hotel but claimed he only  kissed her. The State charged Rogers with four counts  of child molesting, a Level 1 felony, for separate  acts [*2]  of sexual intercourse with Child on different  dates at the same hotel. [4] Three years later, shortly before Rogers's trial was to  start, the State and Rogers entered into a plea  agreement calling for Rogers to plead guilty to one  count of Level 1 child molesting in exchange for  dismissing the remaining counts. The plea agreement  provided that the trial court would have discretion to  sentence Rogers to a maximum of 30 years in prison.  Under the agreement, Rogers also would register for life on the sex offender registry and  have no contact with Child or her family. The trial court accepted Rogers's  guilty plea. [5] At the sentencing hearing, an emotional Child  testified that Rogers had manipulated her by purchasing  things for her and making her feel that she needed him.  Child reported that Rogers's molestation had ruined her  life, worsened her depression, and left her fearful and  unable to trust. She dreaded telling her son about his  father's identity and the context in which her son was  conceived. [6] When sentencing Rogers, the trial court found the  harm caused by Rogers's offense-the pregnancy of a  13-year-old  child,  among  other  things-was  an  aggravating circumstance. The court also found [*3]  as  Page 2 of 3 an aggravating circumstance Rogers's criminal history, which consisted of one felony  conviction for making a false statement to obtain a  firearm and one misdemeanor conviction for failing to  maintain insurance. As mitigating circumstances, the  trial court found that Rogers's imprisonment would  cause undue hardship to his family, whom he supported  in various ways. [7] The trial court imposed the maximum sentence  available  under  the  plea  agreement-30  years  imprisonment. Noting that it had struggled to decide on  the proper sentence, the trial court concluded it could  not suspend any portion of the sentence. Discussion and Decision [8] Rogers challenges his sentence under Appellate  Rule 7(B). This rule permits this Court to ""revise a  sentence  authorized  by  statute  if,  after  due  consideration of the trial court's decision, the Court finds  that the sentence is inappropriate in light of the nature of  the offense and the character of the offender."" App. R.  7(B).  Our  principal  role  in  reviewing  sentence  appropriateness is to ""attempt to leaven the outliers . . .  not to achieve a perceived 'correct' sentence."" Knapp  v.State, 9 N.E.3d 1274, 1292 (Ind. 2014). We therefore  defer substantially to the trial court's sentencing  decision,  which  prevails  unless  ""overcome  by  compelling [*4]  evidence portraying in a positive light  the nature of the offense . . . and the defendant's character."" Stephenson v. State, 29  N.E.3d 111, 122 (Ind. 2015). [9] Rogers pleaded guilty to Level 1 felony child  molesting under Indiana Code § 35-42-4-3(a)(1) (2015),  which carries a statutory sentencing range of 20 to 50  years, with an advisory sentence of 30 years. Ind. Code  § 35-50-2-4(c). Thus, although the trial court sentenced  Rogers to the maximum sentence available under his  plea agreement, Roger's 30-year sentence is only the  advisory sentence for his specific conviction. A  defendant challenging an advisory sentence bears a  particularly heavy burden of persuading us that  sentencing revision is warranted, given that an advisory  sentence is not likely to be inappropriate under Rule  7(B). Mise v. State, 142 N.E.3d 1079, 1088 (Ind. Ct.  App. 2020). We conclude Rogers has not met this  burden. Nature of the Offense [10] Rogers acknowledges the serious nature of his  offense and that its severity increased due to Child's  pregnancy. But he claims the nature of the offense  supports a sentencing revision because of Child's age.  According to Rogers, if he had engaged in sexual  intercourse with Child when she was 14, rather than 13,  he could only have been charged with sexual  misconduct with a minor, a Level 4 felony, which carries  a maximum sentence of 12 years imprisonment. [*5]  See Ind. Code § 35-42-4-9(a)(1) (providing that a  person at least 21 years of age who has sexual  intercourse with a child less than 16 years of age  commits sexual misconduct with a minor, a Level 4  felony); Ind. Code § 35-50-2-5.5 (providing sentencing  range of 2 to 12 years for Level 4 felonies). [11] But Rogers did not molest a 14-year-old. He  molested a younger child, and he does not allege that  he was unaware of Child's age at the time of the  offense. The General Assembly has determined that  sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old child is a more  serious crime that carries a harsher penalty than the  molestation of a slightly older child. See generally Miller  v. State, 709 N.E.2d 48, 50 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999) (""The  nature and extent of penal sanctions are primarily  legislative considerations.""). We reject Rogers's claim  that he is entitled to greater leniency simply because he  chose to engage in sexual intercourse with a 13-year- old, rather than an older child. Character of the Offender [12] Rogers's character also does not support sentence  revision. Rogers points to evidence showing he was an  Army veteran who financially supported his family and  helped care for his mother and her home. Rogers also  notes he has a limited criminal record, expressed  remorse, and accepted responsibility for his [*6]   offense by pleading guilty. [13] But this positive character evidence was offset by  evidence showing Rogers, as a 55-year-old man,  groomed, seduced, and impregnated a 13-year-old  child. In an apparent effort to conceal his wrongdoing,  Rogers took Child to a hotel in another state multiple  times over the summer of 2019. [14] Neither is Rogers's guilty plea particularly helpful to  his argument. The timing and nature of his guilty plea  suggests it was motivated by pragmatism, rather than  remorse. Rogers did not plead guilty until the eve of trial  more than three years after he was charged and only in  exchange for dismissing three of the four pending Level  Page 3 of 3 1 felony counts. See Anglemyer v. State, 875 N.E.2d  218, 221 (Ind. 2007). (""[A] guilty plea may not be  significantly mitigating when . . . the defendant receives  a significant benefit in return for the plea.""). Rogers's  arguments that his good character supported a  sentencing reduction are unpersuasive. [15] As Rogers has not shown that his advisory  sentence is inappropriate in light of the nature of the  offense and the character of the offender, we affirm the  trial court's judgment. Altice, C.J., and Kenworthy, J., concur.",0

Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment against the denial  of plaintiff's application for preapproval and any future  applications for preapproval of its imports of Patagonian  toothfish or Dissostichus eleginoides (""toothfish"") from  the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United  Nations Statistical Subarea 48.3 in the South Georgia  fishery (""Subarea 48.3""). Corrected Compl. ¶¶ 1, 9, 12,  54, ECF No. 14. The denial was due to the lack of a  conservation  measure  (""CM"")  in  force  for  the  Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources  (""CAMLR Convention""). Id. Plaintiff also challenges the  actions of NMFS under the Administrative Procedure  Act (""APA""), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). Id. ¶¶ 8-9, 56, 58. In their motion to dismiss, defendants argue that  plaintiff's action does not arise out of a law providing for  an ""embargo"" or other ""quantitative restriction"" under 28  Page 2 of 22 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(C) or (D) and that, even if plaintiff's  action did so arise, the Court lacks subject matter  jurisdiction because the district courts have exclusive  jurisdiction pursuant to 16 U.S.C. § 2440.

For the reasons discussed below, the court  concludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction. BACKGROUND I. Factual background The objective of the CAMLR Convention is ""the  conservation of Antarctic marine living resources."" Convention on the Conservation of  Antarctic Marine Living Resources art. II, ¶ 1, May 20,  1980, 33 U.S.T. 3476, 1329 U.N.T.S. 47 (""CAMLR  Convention""). ""For the purposes of this Convention, the term  'conservation' includes rational use."" Id. at art. II, ¶ 2.  Member  countries  of  the  Commission  for  the  Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources  (""CCAMLR""  or  ""the  Commission"")  establish  conservation measures for Subarea 48.3 by consensus.  Corrected Compl. ¶ 2; see CAMLR Convention art. IX, ¶ 1.f, 33 U.S.T. at 3483, 1329  U.N.T.S. at 51.

CAMLR Convention art. IX, ¶ 2.a-i, 33 U.S.T.  at 3483-84, 1329 U.N.T.S. at 52. The United States  implements the CAMLR Convention through the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Convention Act of  1984  (""AMLRCA""),  16  U.S.C.  §§  2431,  et  seq.2Commerce  has  promulgated  regulations  to  implement AMLRCA. See 50 C.F.R. § 300.100-116. 2 16 U.S.C. § 2431 sets forth the intent [*4]  of  Congress in the implementation of the Convention: (a) Findings The Congress finds that- (1) the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources establishes international  Court No. 22-00299 4  Under CCAMLR CM 31-01 (1986), ""the Commission  shall, at its 1987 Meeting, adopt limitations on catch, or equivalent measures,  binding for the 1987/88 season. . . . For each fishing season after 1987/88, the Commission  shall establish such limitations or other measures, as necessary, [for Subarea 48.3].""  CCAMLR CM 31-01 (1986). The CCAMLR did not adopt a catch limit or equivalent  measures for Subarea 48.3 for the 2021/22 fishing season because ""Russia blocked  consensus to adopt proposed CM 41- 02.""

Court No. 22-00299 5  On August 8, 2022, Commerce received plaintiff's  application for preapproval to import into the United States toothfish harvested from  Subarea 48.3 in June and July 2022. NMFS Denial Letter at 1; see Application for Pre- Approval Certificate to Import Frozen Toothfish, PR 56 (including application dated  July 27, 2022, and postmark dated [*6]  August 4, 2022). On September 15, 2022, NMFS denied Southern Cross'  application for preapproval (""the NMFS denial""). Decision Mem., PR  20; NMFS Denial Letter at 1. NMFS commented that statements made in the  Commission demonstrate that failure to establish such a catch limit ""effectively closes the  fishery."" NMFS Denial Letter at 2 (footnote omitted). NMFS noted that a ""conclusion that  fishing could proceed in the absence of a measure would also be inconsistent with  decades of CCAMLR practice."" Id. at 2-3. As such, Commerce did not issue a  preapproval certificate because ""the toothfish at issue was harvested in contravention of  CCAMLR CM 31-01."" Id. at 4 (citing 50 C.F.R. § 300.105(h)(2)). Commerce explained  further that, without a catch limit in effect, issuance of the preapproval application  would be contrary to 50 C.F.R. § 300.105(d) and (h)(2): In the absence of any measure affirmatively establishing  a catch limit and other fishery-specific requirements for  the current season, fishing in Subarea 48.3 was not authorized under CCAMLR  conservation measures. Therefore, as provided in the  regulations, at 50 CFR § 300.105(d) and (h)(2), NMFS may not issue a pre-approval certificate. Denial of this application is consistent with the AMLRCA  regulations and U.S. obligations under [*7]  the CCAMLR Catch  Documentation Scheme (CM 10-05) which prohibits [sic]  the importation of toothfish harvested in a manner  inconsistent with CCAMLR conservation measures.

Corrected Compl. The complaint as corrected challenges the denial by NMFS pursuant to 50  C.F.R. § 300.105 of the application by Southern Cross for preapproval to import  toothfish harvested from Subarea 48.3. Id. ¶ 1. Plaintiff argues that the  government's denial of plaintiff's preapproval application was ""in error"" and a violation of  the APA because the toothfish were not ""harvested or exported in violation of any  CCAMLR conservation measure in Page 4 of 22 force"" or by an illegal, unreported and unregulated  fishery or vessel.

Whether the denial of the preapproval application  by  NMFS  constitutes  an  embargo  or  other  quantitative restriction A. Legal framework The USCIT's residual jurisdiction statute states in  Page 5 of 22 relevant part: (1) In addition to the jurisdiction conferred upon the  Court of International Trade by subsections (a)-(h) of this section and subject  to the exception set forth in subsection (j) of this section,  the Court of International Trade shall have exclusive  jurisdiction of any civil action commenced against the  United States, its agencies, or its officers, that arises out of any  law of the United States providing for- . . . (C) embargoes or other quantitative restrictions on the  importation of merchandise for reasons other than the  protection of the public health or safety; or (D) administration and enforcement with respect to the  matters referred to in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of  this paragraph and subsections (a)-(h) of this section. 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(C)-(D). ""[T]he Court will not have  jurisdiction under section 1581(i)(3)4 in the absence of a  law providing for an embargo.""5 Salmon Spawning, 33 4The version of the USCIT's jurisdictional [*11]  statute  at 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(3) and (4) analyzed in Salmon  Spawning corresponds in substance to the current 28  U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(C) and (D). Compare 28 U.S.C. §  1581(i)(3) and (4) with current version at 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(C) and (D). 5The Supreme Court in K Mart ultimately held that there  was no embargo in that case because, under the  trademark law at issue (19 U.S.C. § 1526(a)), ""[t]he  private party, not the Government, by deciding whether  and how to exercise its private right, determines the quantity of any particular product that  can be imported."" K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 8 6 176, 185 (1988). Therefore, the  Government did not have ""any control over the extent or  the nature of § 526(a)'s prohibition."" Id. at 186.  Court No. 22-00299 9  CIT at 519, 626 F. Supp. 2d at 1282 (citing Friedman v.  Kantor, 21 CIT 901, 904, 977 F. Supp. 1242, 1246 (1997)). The Supreme Court has stated that ""the ordinary  meaning of 'embargo,' and the meaning that Congress  apparently  adopted  in  the  statutory  language  'embargoes or other quantitative restrictions,' is a  governmentally imposed quantitative restriction-of zero- on the importation of merchandise."" K Mart, 8 6 at 185.6  The Supreme Court added: ""[N]ot every governmental importation  prohibition is an embargo."" Id. at 187; Native Fed'n of Madre De Dios River & Tributaries  v. Bozovich Timber Prods., 31 CIT 585, 593 n.11, 491  F. Supp. 2d 1174, 1181 n.11 (2007) (citing K Mart, 485  U.S. at 187); see Salmon Spawning, 33 CIT at 519, 626  F. Supp. 2d at 1282 (""That restriction must be more than  a mere 'condition[] of importation.'"" (quoting K Mart, 485  U.S. at 189)). [*12]  The Supreme Court continued: ""To hold  otherwise would yield applications of the term 'embargo'  that are unnatural, to say the least."" K Mart, 485 U.S. at  187.6 The Supreme Court made clear that it was drawing a  distinction  between  governmental  importation  prohibitions  and  embargoes:  ""Congress  likewise  declined to grant the Court of International Trade  exclusive jurisdiction over importation prohibitions that  are not embargoes."" Id. at 189. The Supreme Court  added, ""Congress did not commit to the Court of  International Trade's exclusive jurisdiction every suit  against the Government challenging customs-related laws and  regulations."" Id. Finally, the Supreme Court clarified that drawing this distinction was  for the purpose of clarifying the ""division of jurisdiction  between the Customs Court (now the Court of  International 6 See infra Section I.C for a discussion of these  examples provided by the Supreme Court.  Court No. 22-00299 10  Trade) and the district courts and to 'ensure . . .  uniformity in the judicial decisionmaking process.'"" Id. at 188 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 96-1235, at 20  (1980), U.S. Code Cong. & Page 6 of 22 Admin. News 1980, pp. 3729, 3731). That is the very  issue presented to the court in the instant action. [*13]  The USCIT has noted that ""by choosing the word  'embargoes' over the phrase 'importation prohibitions' in Section 1581(i)(3), Congress  created a circumscribed sub- class of importation prohibitions that falls within the  [USCIT's] jurisdiction."" Native Fed'n, 31 CIT at 593, 491 F. Supp. 2d at 1181-82  (quoting K Mart, 485 U.S. at 189) (citing Earth Island Inst. v. Brown, 28 F.3d 76, 77 (9th  Cir. 1994)). In addition, ""Congress declined to grant [the USCIT] jurisdiction to  review challenges to 'conditions of  importation'  as  distinct  from  those  involving  embargoes."" Id. at 593, 491 F. Supp. 2d at 1182 (quoting K Mart, 485 U.S. at 189). At issue in this case, AMLRCA provides inter alia that it  is ""unlawful . . . to . . . import . . . any Antarctic marine living resource . . .  harvested in violation of a conservation measure in force with respect to the United  States pursuant to article IX of the Convention or in violation of any regulation  promulgated under this chapter."" 16 U.S.C. § 2435(3). In addition, Commerce regulations  implementing AMLRCA specify the circumstances under which NFMS will issue  a preapproval certificate for the importation of a shipment of toothfish: NMFS  may  issue  a  preapproval  certificate  for  importation of a shipment of frozen Dissostichus species  if the preapproval application form is complete and  NMFS determines that the activity proposed by the  applicant meets the requirements [*14]  of the Act and  that the resources were not harvested in violation of any  CCAMLR conservation measure or in violation of any  regulation in this subpart. No preapproval will be issued  for  Dissostichus  species  without  verifiable  documentation that the harvesting vessel  Court No. 22-00299 11  reported to C-VMS continuously and in real-time from  port-to-port, regardless of where such Dissostichus  species were harvested. 50 C.F.R. § 300.105(d). The regulations also provide  that ""NMFS will not issue a preapproval certificate for  any shipment of Dissostichus species . . . [d]etermined  to have been harvested or transshipped in contravention  of any CCAMLR Conservation Measure in force at the time of harvest or transshipment  . . . ."" Id. § 300.105(h)(2) (emphasis supplied). B. Positions of the parties Before the court is defendants' motion to dismiss.  Accordingly,  the  court  starts  with  defendants'  arguments. Defendants  argue  that  the  CAMLR  Convention,  AMLRCA and the regulations under which NMFS  denied Southern Cross' preapproval application do not  provide for an embargo. Defs. Mot.

Specifically,  defendants allege that the [*15]  denial, ""made pursuant  to 50 C.F.R. § 300.105(h), is not an embargo, and does  not 'arise[] out of any law of the United States providing  for' an embargo."" Defs. Mot. Dismiss at 5 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(C)).

That  may be true, but since we are agreed that only  prohibitions and not conditions come within the meaning  of embargo, that ambiguity will have to be grappled with  under the Court's view of things no less than under  mine.""). 8At oral argument, defendants noted: ""By [p]laintiff's  theory, any time a countermeasure [sic] of any type is  violated and therefore a certificate is denied, that would  constitute an embargo, and that's [*17]  simply not a  tenable outcome.""

Defs. Reply Br. at 2.  Likewise, defendants note that the USCIT in Native Federation found that a requirement  under the Endangered Species Act (""ESA"") for compliance with ""certain permitting and  documentation requirements"" under the Convention on  International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild  Fauna and Flora (""CITES"") did not entail an embargo.

Plaintiff argues that this Court has jurisdiction pursuant  to 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(C) because the decision to deny the  preapproval application is an embargo under K Mart or,  alternatively, a ""quantitative restriction.""

Plaintiff asserts that the language of AMLRCA, 16  U.S.C. § 2435(3), and the language of 19 C.F.R. §  12.60 (1987) - which the Supreme Court noted in K Mart  to be an example of an ""embargo[] . . . to further  interests relating to . . . ecology"" - is fundamentally the  same. Pl. Resp.

(2) No shipment of Dissostichus species shall be  released for entry into the United States unless  accompanied by an accurate, complete, valid and  validated CCAMLR CDS document. (3) Dissostichus species shall not be released for entry  into the United States unless all of the applicable  requirements of the CCAMLR Conservation Measures and U.S. regulations have been  met. 50 C.F.R. § 300.106(a).  Court No. 22-00299 15  12.60 prohibits the importation of most sea otter skins  taken contrary to the Provisional Fur Seal Agreement of 1942 between the United States  and Canada: The transportation, importation, sale, or possession of  the skins of fur seals or sea otters is prohibited if such  skins were taken contrary to the provisions of section 2  of the act of February 26, 1944 (58 Stat. 100-104) or,  the case of such skins taken [*20]  under the authority  of the act or any fur-seal agreement, if the skins are not  officially marked and certified as required by section 2 of  the act. Section 16 makes the act inapplicable to skins  taken for scientific purposes under a special permit. 19 C.F.R. § 12.60 (1987).10 Plaintiff urges the court to ""apply the same analysis"" as  in three decisions under which federal courts applied K Mart and found that there  was an embargo: Humane Soc'y of the United States v. Brown, 19 CIT 1104, 1110,  1112, 901 F. Supp. 338, 344, 10 Section 2 of the Provisional Fur Seal Agreement of  1942 between the United States and Canada provided  that: It shall be unlawful, except as hereinafter provided, for  any citizen or national of the United States, or person  owing duty of obedience to the laws or treaties of the  United States, or any vessel of the United States, or  person belonging to or on such vessel, to engage in  pelagic sealing or sea otter hunting in or on the waters  of the North Pacific Ocean; or for any person or vessel  to engage in sealing; or for any person or vessel to use  any port or harbor or other place subject to the  jurisdiction of the United States for any purpose  connected in any way with the operation of pelagic  sealing, sea otter hunting, or sealing; or for any person  to transport, import, offer for sale, or have [*21]  in  possession at any port, place, or on any vessel subject  to the jurisdiction of the United States, raw, dressed, or  dyed skins of sea otters taken contrary to the provisions  of this section or, where taken pursuant to section 3 of  this Act, not officially marked and certified as having  been so taken, or raw, dressed, or dyed skins of fur  seals taken in or on the waters of the North Pacific  Ocean or on lands subject to the jurisdiction of the  United States, except seal skins which have been taken  under the authority of this Act or under the authority of  the respective parties to any fur-seal agreement and  which have been officially marked and certified as  having been so taken. Provisional Fur Seal Agreement of 1942, Canada- United States., Feb. 26, 1944, ch. 65, § 2, 58 Stat. 100,  101 (repealed 1966).  Court No. 22-00299 16  346 (1995); Earth Island Inst. v. Christopher, 6 F.3d  648, 649 n.1, 651-52 (9th Cir. 1993); and Int'l Labor Rights Fund v. Bush, 357 F. Supp.  2d 204, 205, 208-10 (D.D.C. Page 9 of 22 2004). Pl. Resp. at 13-14; see also Oral Arg. Tr. at  16:10-17:10 (noting on behalf of plaintiff similarities  between the statutes at issue in those cases and the  language  at  issue  here).  In  addition,  plaintiff  distinguishes the Native Federation decision from the  instant action. Pl. Resp. at 14-15. Specifically, plaintiff  argues that the ""regulations at issue in Native  Federation merely regulated trade""- but did not bar it  entirely - ""based on the [*22]  presentation of a valid  export permit."" Id. at 15 (emphasis supplied). In  contrast, plaintiff states that ""NMFS is not regulating  trade in toothfish; NMFS is barring trade in toothfish  from Subarea 48.3 entirely."" Id.; see Oral Arg. Tr. at  31:16-20 (explaining on behalf of plaintiff that the  provisions at issue in Native Federation ""contemplated""  trade). Plaintiff adds: ""This is not a case where NMFS is  barring Southern Cross's imports because those imports  were unaccompanied by the required documents (i.e.,  the [Dissostichus Catch Document] and [Dissostichus  Export Document])."" Pl. Resp. at 16. Plaintiff alleges further that the Court has jurisdiction  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(D) based on the ""administration  and enforcement"" of 16 U.S.C. § 2435(3). Id. at 8; see Oral Arg. Tr. at 17:15- 21 (arguing on behalf of plaintiff that an ""embargo is  always enforced at the ports on an entry-by-entry  basis""). C. Analysis To determine whether the Court has jurisdiction over the  instant action, the court considers: (1) whether the  denial constitutes an embargo or other quantitative  restriction on the importation of merchandise; (2)  whether AMLRCA and its implementing  Court No. 22-00299 17  regulations provide for such an embargo or other [*23]   quantitative restriction; and (3) whether AMLRCA and its  implementing regulations provide for the administration  and enforcement of such an embargo or other  quantitative restriction. For the reasons discussed  below, the court concludes that (1) the denial pursuant  to AMLRCA regulations, 50 C.F.R. § 300.105(d) and  (h)(2), by NMFS of Southern Cross' preapproval  application does not constitute an embargo or other  quantitative restriction, and (2) neither AMLRCA, 16  U.S.C. § 2435(3), nor its regulations, 50 C.F.R. § 300.105(d) and (h)(2), provide for an  embargo or other quantitative restriction, or the  administration and enforcement thereof. 1. Whether NMFS' denial of plaintiff's preapproval  application  constitutes  an  embargo  or  other  quantitative restriction Plaintiff's action arises out of a challenge to the denial  by NMFS of plaintiff's preapproval application. Corrected  Compl. ¶ 1 (""This action concerns Defendants' unlawful  denial of Southern Cross's application for preapproval to  import [toothfish] . . . .""). Defendants argue that the Court does not have  jurisdiction over the denial. Defs. Mot. Dismiss at 5 (quoting 28 U.S.C. §  1581(i)(1)(C)). Plaintiff argues that NMFS, by its denial  of plaintiff's application, is ""barring trade in toothfish  from Subarea 48.3 entirely"" such that the [*24]  denial  constitutes an embargo - ""a governmentally imposed  quantitative restriction-of zero"", K Mart, 485 U.S. at 185  - or other quantitative restriction within the meaning of  the statute. Pl. Resp. at 15; see Pl. Resp. at 8 (arguing  that ""NMFS's action is an 'embargo'"" or else that ""it is  certainly a 'quantitative restriction on the importation of  merchandise'""). The court is unpersuaded. NMFS is not authorized under AMLRCA or its  implementing regulations to institute a blanket ban on  toothfish through the denial of an application for a  preapproval  Court No. 22-00299 18  certificate. See generally 16 U.S.C. §§ 2431, 2435; 50  C.F.R. § 300.105. Rather, NMFS ""may issue a preapproval certificate"" if certain  conditions are met, including that NMFS determines that the instant ""resources were not  harvested in violation of any CCAMLR  conservation  measure.""  50  C.F.R.  §  300.105(d) (emphasis supplied). Similarly, NMFS ""will  not issue a preapproval certificate"" for a toothfish  harvest or transshipment determined to be ""in  contravention of"" any conservation measure. 50 C.F.R. § 300.105(h)(2). Moreover, ""the proper focus  of an analysis of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i) is  the law upon which the plaintiffs' action is based, and  whether that law (rather than the specific claims set  Page 10 of 22 forth by the plaintiff) [*25]  provides for an embargo.""  Int'l Labor Rights Fund, 357 F. Supp. 2d at 209 n.3. The  court addresses the statutes and regulations governing  the instant action infra Section I.C.2. The NMFS denial before the court pertained to one  shipment of toothfish. As such, the denial does not  constitute an embargo or other quantitative restriction. The NMFS denial of plaintiff's preapproval certificate  was specific to plaintiff's application: ""[NMFS] is denying  issuance of a pre-approval certificate for this shipmentof  toothfish for the reasons outlined below."" NMFS Denial  Letter at 1 (emphasis supplied). The NMFS denial also  stated  the  foundational  legal  predicate  for  the  application of AMLRCA by NMFS, namely that ""fishing  in Subarea 48.3 was not authorized under CCAMLR  conservation measures"" and that ""the toothfish at issue  was [sic] harvested in contravention of CCAMLR CM  31-01."" NMFS Denial Letter at 4; see NMFS Denial Letter at 3-4 (quoting 50 C.F.R. §  300.105(d)). As such, NMFS determined not to issue a  preapproval certificate to Southern Cross because  NMFS determined that the specific toothfish shipment at  issue was ""harvested or transshipped  Court No. 22-00299 19  in contravention of a[] CCAMLR Conservation Measure  in force at the time of harvest or transshipment."" See  NMFS Denial [*26]  Letter at 411 (quoting 50 C.F.R. §  300.105(h)(2)). Similarly, in a different context, Southern Cross inquired  of NMFS whether Southern Cross could import fish from another part of  the South Georgia waters. NMFS responded in a  manner consistent with its explanation in the letter  denying the preapproval application in the instant case:  ""[a]ny final determination would, as always, be made  upon submission of an application for preapproval to  import a specific shipment."" Dawson Email.12 Accordingly, the NMFS denial is not an embargo or  other quantitative restriction within the meaning of 28  U.S.C. § 1581(i). 11It is notable that the language of subsection (h)(2),  applied by NFMS in this case, is distinct even from the  language of subsection (h)(1) of the same section of the  same statute. Compare 50 C.F.R. § 300.105(h)(1) with  50 C.F.R. § 300.105(h)(1). Subsection (h)(1) provides  that NMFS will not issue a preapproval certificate for  any shipment of Dissostichus species . . . [i]dentified as  originating from Statistical Area 51 or Statistical Area 57  in the eastern and western Indian Ocean outside and  north  of  the  Convention  Area"",  50  C.F.R.  §  300.105(h)(1) (emphasis supplied) whereas subsection  (h)(2) expressly requires NMFS to tie denial of a  preapproval application to only those shipments  """"[d]etermined to have been harvested or transshipped  incontravention of any CCAMLR [*27]  Conservation  Measure  in  force  at  the  time  of  harvest  or  transshipment."" Again, subsection (h)(2) expressly  contemplates and provides for import of shipments from  the identified region subject only to the conditions of  meeting the terms of the conservation measure whereas  subsection (h)(1) applies a restriction not tied to the  terms of a conservation measure. 12Moreover, plaintiff's contention that NMFS ""will  prohibit all toothfish imported from Subarea 48.3"" is conjecture. Pl. Resp. at 15 (emphasis  omitted). The AMLRCA regulations provide for a  process by which the United States can determine not  to accept a conservation measure. 16 U.S.C. § 2434(a).  The U.S. government could change its position with  respect to the requirement of adhering to conservation  measures  for  the  approval  or  preapproval  of  applications to import toothfish from Subarea 48.3.  Court No. 22-00299 20  2.  Whether  AMLRCA  and  its  implementing  regulations  provide  for  embargoes  or  other  quantitative restrictions i.Embargoes In light of plaintiff's request for declaratory judgment  applicable to future preapproval applications, the court  turns to whether the applicable statute and regulations  provide for an embargo. Corrected Compl. ¶¶ 9, 12, 51  (citing 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), which authorizes ""any [*28]  court  of the United States . . . [to] declare the rights and other  legal relations of any interested party seeking such  declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be  sought""). Plaintiff argues that the NMFS denial of  plaintiff's preapproval application amounts to an  embargo based on what plaintiff argues is the provision  for an embargo under AMLRCA, 16 U.S.C. § 2435(3). Pl. Resp. at 1-2. Page 11 of 22 The court examines first the applicable statutes and  regulations in the instant action, then considers the case  law in which this Court and other courts have concluded  that the statutes before them envisaged embargoes and  consequently fell within the jurisdiction of this Court. The  court concludes that AMLRCA and its implementing  regulations provide ""conditions of importation"" and the  potential for other types of ""governmental importation  prohibition[s]"" that do not constitute embargoes. See K  Mart, 485 U.S. at 187. AMLRCA, its implementing regulations and the CAMLR  Convention all ""anticipate[] trade in"" toothfish. Native  Fed'n, 31 CIT at 595, 419 F. Supp. 2d at 1183. Under AMLRCA, ""[i]t is unlawful . . . to . . . import . . .  any Antarctic marine living resource . . . harvested in  violation of a conservation measure in force with respect  to the United States pursuant [*29]  to article IX of the  Convention . . . ."" 16 U.S.C. § 2435(3).  Court No. 22-00299 21  See also 50 C.F.R. § 300.114(d). AMLRCA regulations  by their terms ""regulate[] . . . [t]he import . . . into the United States of any Antarctic  marine living resource."" 50 C.F.R. § 300.100(b)(2) (emphasis supplied); see 50  C.F.R. § 300.104(a)(1) (""A person may import . . . AMLR  into the United States only under a NMFS-issued  International Fisheries Trade Permit (IFTP)."" (emphasis  supplied)). Under the AMLRCA regulations, imports of  toothfish must have a preapproval certificate, which  NMFS may issue. See 50 C.F.R. § 300.105(d); see also  50 C.F.R. § 300.104(a)(2) (providing that frozen  toothfish shipments ""must also be accompanied by . . . a  preapproval certificate""); 50 C.F.R. § 300.106(e)(1)  (defining toothfish import requirements). For NMFS to  issue such a preapproval certificate, NMFS must be  able to determine that a condition has been met, namely  that the toothfish were not ""harvested in violation of any CCAMLR conservation measure ."" Id. § 300.105(d); see  id. § 300.105(h)(2). Under the CAMLR Convention, as noted supra Section  I, ""'conservation' includes rational use."" CAMLR  Convention, art. II.2 (emphasis supplied); see CAMLR  Convention art. IX.2(c) (""The conservation measures . . .  include . . . the designation of the quantity which may be  harvested from the populations of regions and sub- regions""). In addition, Congress found that ""the Convention [*30]   incorporates an innovative ecosystem approach to the  management of Antarctic marine living resources . . . ."" 16 U.S.C. § 2431(a)(2) (emphasis supplied). Further,  when certain conditions are met, NMFS ""may issue a  preapproval certificate for importation of a shipment of  frozen [toothfish]."" 50 C.F.R. § 300.105(d) (emphasis supplied).  As such, to the extent that the provisions amount to a  ""governmental  importation  prohibition,""  they  are  nonetheless not embargoes. K Mart, 485 U.S. at 187.  Instead, the regulation delineates the  Court No. 22-00299 22  preapproval framework for the importation of toothfish  that is harvested in compliance with CCAMLR  conservation measures and that meets certain other  prerequisites. See 50 C.F.R. § 300.105(d). In K Mart, the Supreme Court addressed two instances  of governmental importation prohibitions that did not  constitute embargoes: (1) a regulation requiring a permit  and  appropriate  ""tagging""  for  milk  and  cream  importation, 485 U.S. at 187 (quoting 19 C.F.R. § 12.7(a)-(b) (1987)13); and (2) a  regulation  requiring  inspection  for  meat  product  importation, id. (quoting 19 C.F.R. § 12.8 (1987)14). The  Supreme Court reasoned that ""[t]o hold [that every  governmental importation prohibition is an embargo]  would yield applications of the term 'embargo' that are  unnatural, to say the [*31]  least."" Id. The Supreme Court illustrated such an application by  explaining that the ""prohibitory nature"" of the milk and  cream regulations ""would convert licensing and tagging  requirements  into  embargoes  on  unlicensed  or  improperly tagged dairy products."" Id. Similarly, the Supreme Court noted that the meat  product  inspection  requirement  ""would  magically  become an embargo of uninspected (but not necessarily  tainted) meat."" Id. AMLRCA establishes as a condition of importation that  the shipment be harvested in compliance with CCAMLR  conservation measures. 16 U.S.C. § 2435(3). AMLRCA  provides the authority for NMFS to deny a pre-approval  Page 12 of 22 application on the 13The regulation provides in relevant part that ""the  importation into the United States of milk and cream is  prohibited unless the person by whom such milk or  cream is shipped or transported into the United States  holds a valid permit from the Department of Health and  Human Services."" 19 C.F.R. § 12.7(a) (1987). In  addition, the regulation outlines tagging requirements  and adds: ""Customs officers shall not permit the  importation of any milk or cream that is not tagged in  accordance with such regulations."" Id. § 12.7(b). 14The regulation provides in relevant part that ""meat . . .  products shall [*32]  not be released from Customs  custody prior to inspection . . . ."" 19 C.F.R. § 12.8(a)  (1987).  Court No. 22-00299 23  grounds that this condition has not been met. 16 U.S.C.  § 2436(b) (providing the authority to the Secretary of  Commerce to promulgate regulations to implement  conservation  measures);  50  C.F.R.  §  300.105  (implementing regulation of the statute). This denial may constitute a prohibition on importation  of the imports in question. 50 C.F.R. § 300.105(h)(2). As the Supreme Court found  in K Mart, such a prohibition may not ""magically""  become an embargo of imports that do not meet the  conditions of AMLRCA. In sum, the conditional regulatory language of  AMLR parallels that of the statute and regulations for  milk and meat importation, which the Supreme Court  previously discussed did not constitute embargoes  within the jurisdiction of the USCIT. See K Mart, 485 U.S. at 187. That conclusion is further supported by the USCIT's  holding in Native Federation. 31 CIT 585, 491 F. Supp. 2d 1174. Similar to AMLRCA,  the statute at issue in Native Federation stated that it was ""unlawful . . . to engage in  any trade in any specimens contrary to the provisions of  the Convention."" 16 U.S.C. § 1538(c)(1). In addition,  under the ESA regulations, imports of bigleaf mahogany  are required to be accompanied by an export permit.  Native Fed'n, 31 CIT at 594, 491 F. Supp. 2d at 1182 (citing 50 C.F.R. § 23.12(a)(2)(i)15). The [*33]   USCIT in Native Federation looked to the language of  CITES and the ESA to guide the Court's reasoning that  the regulation - including, in certain instances, a  prohibition - of mahogany imports did not constitute an  embargo: 15 50 C.F.R. part 23 was revised and ""reorganized the  sections and added provisions from certain applicable  resolutions and decisions adopted by the CITES  Conference of the Parties (CoP) at its second through  thirteenth meetings (CoP2 - CoP13)."" 72 Fed. Reg.  48,402-01. The 2007 version of the regulation reflects a  later version of the Final Rule in which 50 C.F.R. § 23.11-12 are condensed.  Court No. 22-00299 24  By entering into [CITES], the United States did not  agree to end trade in CITES-listed species, nor did it elect to do so by  enacting Section 9(c) to implement the Convention. On  the contrary, the aim of CITES and the provisions of the  ESA that implement it is to permit trade in certain  species in a controlled, sustainable manner. Id. at 597-98, 491 F. Supp. 2d at 1185 (emphasis  supplied) (citing CITES Proclamation of the Contracting States, 27 U.S.T. at 1090). The  Native Federation court concluded that the section of the ESA applicable to bigleaf  mahogany did not ""forbid"" or ""completely ban"" trade but rather ""regulate[s]"" such  trade through permit requirements. Id. at 593-94, 491 F. Supp. 2d at 1182-83. For the [*34]   category of species under which bigleaf mahogany falls, the ESA and CITES, ""while  restricting trade, do not restrict the quantity of imports to zero."" Id. at 598, 491 F. Supp. 2d  at 1185-86 (citing K Mart , 485 U.S. at 185).16 The  AMLRCA  regulations  spell  out  specific  requirements for preapproval certification, much like the CITES and ESA regulations  at issue in Native Federation set Page 13 of 22 out requirements for permitting. Compare 50 C.F.R. §  300.105(d) (requiring that the ""preapproval application form is complete and NMFS  determines that the activity proposed by the applicant meets the requirements of  the Act and that the resources 16 To reach this conclusion, the court highlighted  several aspects of the ESA and CITES statutes and  their similarity to aspects in the Supreme Court's  decision in K Mart: (1) the flexibility under the CITES  language for parties to ""adopt stricter measures,""  weighing against a ban; (2) the similarity between the  regulations noted in K Mart that provide for ""conditions  of importation"" - milk permits and meat inspections - to  CITES/ESA regulations; (3) that the CITES/ESA  regulation ""anticipates trade in those species, [which include bigleaf mahogany,] on the condition that  'the requirements in ... [50 C.F.R. § 23.12(a)(2)(i)] are  met,' i.e., the presentation [*35]  of a valid foreign export  permit;"" and (4) the ""qualitatively different"" nature of the  other examples of embargoes because they do not have  a ""simple permitting scheme"" but instead have ""stringent  statutory requirements"" and ""prohibit trade outright  albeit with limited exceptions."" Id. at 595-96, 491 F.  Supp. 2d at 1183-85 (quoting 50 C.F.R. § 23.11(a)).  Court No. 22-00299 25  were not harvested in violation of any CCAMLR  conservation measure or in violation of any regulation"")  with 50 C.F.R. § 23.12(a)(2)(i) (requiring ""a valid foreign  export permit issued by the country of origin""). Plaintiff raises four examples to support its argument  that AMLRCA and its regulations, as applied by NMFS,  provide for an embargo. Pl. Resp. at 12-14 (citing 19 C.F.R. § 12.60 (1987); Humane Soc'y, 19 CIT 1104,  901 F. Supp. 338; Earth Island, 6 F.3d 648; Int'l Labor Rights Fund, 357 F. Supp. 2d.  204). AMLRCA and its implementing regulations are distinct  from the examples of embargoes that plaintiff provides.  See 19 C.F.R. § 12.60 (1987); K Mart, 485 U.S. at 184  (describing 19 C.F.R. § 12.60 (1987) as an embargo);  Humane Soc'y, 19 CIT at 1112-1113, 901 F. Supp. at  346 (explaining that 16 U.S.C. § 1826a, which  ""prohibit[s] the importation"" of fishing-related products,  confers jurisdiction to this Court under the provision for  residual jurisdiction because § 1826a lists embargo  language); EarthIsland, 6 F.3d at 652 (concluding that  the 16 U.S.C. § 1537(b) implemented a ban on  importation of shrimp products and ""prohibit[ed]"" shrimp  imports  that  did  not  comply  with  regulations  protecting [*36]  sea turtles and holding that those terms  corresponded to the embargo language conferring  jurisdiction on the USCIT); Int'l Labor Rights, 357 F.  Supp. 2d at 207 (holding that the language of 19 U.S.C.  § 1307, stating that goods produced by forced labor and  ""importation thereof is hereby prohibited,"" constituted  embargo language conferring jurisdiction on this Court)  (emphasis supplied). The court analyzes each in turn. The first example that plaintiff references is 19 C.F.R. §  12.60 (1987), which the Supreme Court in K Mart referred to as providing for an  embargo. 485 U.S. at 184; see  Court No. 22-00299 26  Pl. Resp. at 12. The regulation in question prohibits the  importation of ""skins of fur seals or sea otters . . . if such skins were taken contrary  to the provisions of section 2 of the [Provisional Fur Seal Agreement of 1942 between  the United States of America and Canada]."" 19 C.F.R. § 12.60 (1987). The regulation  provides a limited exception for the import of sea otter skins and fur seals by ""Indians,  Aleuts, or other aborigines dwelling on the American coasts of the waters of the North  Pacific Ocean."" Provisional Fur Seal Agreement of 1942 (repealed 1944), ch. 65, § 3.17 The  CAMLR  Convention,  AMLRCA  and  its  implementing regulations expressly envision and provide that harvesting of Antarctic [*37]   marine resources will and should occur. See CAMLR Convention art. II.2 (noting that  ""'conservation' includes rational use""), art. II.3 (""Any harvesting and associated activities  in the area to which this Convention applies shall be conducted in accordance  with the provisions of this Page 14 of 22 Convention and with the following principles of  conservation . . . .""), art. IX.2(c) (noting ""the designation of the quantity [of species] which may  be harvested""). AMLRCA implements the CAMLR Convention, 16 U.S.C. §  2431(b), and the AMLRCA regulations provide a framework under which importers can attain  preapproval to import harvested 17 The Provisional Fur Seal Agreement of 1942  prohibited importing illegally taken skins, and forfeiture  thereof: The importation or bringing into territory of the United  States . . . of skins of fur seals or sea otters taken in the  waters mentioned in section 632 of this title . . . except  such as have been taken under the authority of the  respective parties to the convention between the  Governments of the United States, Great Britain, Japan, and Russia . . . to which  the breeding grounds of such herds belong, and have  been officially marked and certified as having been so  taken, is hereby prohibited . . . .

In sum, the Provisional Fur Seal Agreement of 1942 as addressed by the Supreme Court  in K Mart is not apposite to the assessment of the  CAMLR Convention, CCAMLR CMs and AMLRCA in  the instant case. K Mart , 485 U.S. at 184. Plaintiff next raises this Court's holding in Humane  Society that the High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act (""HSDFEA"") was  within the USCIT's exclusive jurisdiction. Pl. Resp. at 13;  see Humane Soc'y, 19 CIT at 1104, 1121, 901 F. Supp.  at 340, 352. The Court in Humane Society exercised  jurisdiction over plaintiff's action, concluding that the  language of the HSDFEA explicitly provided authority for  the Secretary of the Treasury at the direction of the  president to implement a prohibition on imports of fish  and fish products from nations that do not comply with  the requirements of the HSDFEA. Pl. Resp. at 13; see  Humane Soc'y, 19 CIT at 1104, 1112-1113, 901 F. Supp  at 338, 340, 346, 352. Plaintiffs there alleged that  defendants - the Secretary of Commerce and the  Secretary of State - had failed to exercise their  ""responsibilities"" under the HSDFEA to identify any  country (in that case, Italy) that engaged in the  proscribed fishing. Id. [*39]  at 1105-06, 1111, 901 F.  Supp. at 341, 345 (citing 16  U.S.C.  §  1826a(b)(1)(A)-(B)).  Upon  such  identification, the HSFDEA prohibited fish imports from  that nation.

Supp. at 344 (citing 16 U.S.C. § 1826a(b)(3)18 (delineating the procedure to  instate a ""[p]rohibition on 18 Specifically, 16 U.S.C. § 1826a authorizes the  President to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to  prohibit importation into the United States of fish and  fish products and sport fishing equipment:  Court No. 22-00299 28  imports of fish and fish products and sport fishing  equipment""). The Humane Society court relied on Earth Island to conclude that the USCIT  had exclusive jurisdiction over that action. Id. at 1112-13, 901 F. Supp at 346. AMLRCA again stands in contrast to the statute -  HSFDEA - before the court in Humane Society. The HSFDEA establishes a  procedure to implement a blanket prohibition. AMLRCA, by contrast, does not do so;  rather, it sets out the requirements necessary to import toothfish in compliance with the  conservation measures adopted. AMLRCA prohibits the import of products conditionally  and only if they are harvested in violation of regulations promulgated under this chapter.  16 U.S.C. § 2435. This (3) Prohibition on imports of fish and fish products and  sport fishing equipment (A) Prohibition Page 15 of 22 The President- [*40]  (i) upon receipt of notification of the identification of a  nation under paragraph (1)(A); or (ii) if the consultations with the government of a nation  under paragraph (2) are not satisfactorily concluded  within ninety days, shall direct the Secretary of the  Treasury to prohibit the importation into the United States of fish and fish products and sport fishing equipment (as that term is defined in section 4162 of  Title 26) from that nation. (B) Implementation of prohibition With respect to an import prohibition directed under  subparagraph (A), the Secretary of the Treasury shall  implement such prohibition not later than the date that is  forty-five days after the date on which the Secretary has  received the direction from the President. (C) Public notice of prohibition Before the effective date of any import prohibition under  this paragraph, the Secretary of the Treasury shall  provide public notice of the impending prohibition. 16 U.S.C. § 1826a(b)(3) (1995).  Court No. 22-00299 29  approach is comparable to that involving the conditions  on imports described in Native Federation, supra Section I.C.2.i. Specifically, 50 C.F.R.  § 300.105 requires that importers of toothfish provide a  ""complete"" preapproval application and that NMFS then ""determine[] that the activity proposed by the applicant  meets the [*41]  requirements of the Act and that the  resources were not harvested in violation of any  CCAMLR conservation measure or in violation of any  regulation in this subpart."" 50 C.F.R. § 300.105(d). The  language of the regulations is formulated in a way that  enables the importation of toothfish so long as the  conditions of the statute and regulations are met. The  CMs of the CAMLR Convention in turn provide a  framework and conditions such that importers that wish  to import fish from the area may seek to do so. See 16  U.S.C. § 2435(3). For the foregoing reasons, the statute  and holding in Humane Society are inapposite to the  statute and regulations at issue in the instant action. The third case that plaintiff presents to the court is the  decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth  Circuit (""Ninth Circuit"") in Earth Island. Pl. Resp. at 13- 14 (citing Earth Island, 6 F.3d at 649 n.1, 651-52).  There, the Ninth Circuit held that the statute at issue,  which banned shrimp imports from countries that did not  protect sea turtles from commercial nets, was an  embargo such that the USCIT had exclusive jurisdiction.  Earth Island, 6 F.3d at 649, 651 (citing The Departments  of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act, 1990, Pub.L. 101-162, Title VI, §  609, 103 Stat. 1037 (1989) (codified at 16 U.S.C. §  1537 note (""Section 609"") (2000)).19Section 609  prohibited shrimp imports harvested with 19 Section 609(b) provides [*42]  for a prohibition on  shrimp imports with exceptions - exceptions that must  be recognized and certified by the President:  Court No. 22-00299 30  technology harmful to sea turtles unless the president  otherwise certified to Congress that a country had taken steps to protect sea turtles. Id.  at 649 n.1, 650. The Ninth Circuit focused on two subsections of the statute: Subsection (a) of 16 U.S.C. § 1537 requires the  Secretary of State to initiate negotiations with foreign  countries to develop treaties to protect sea turtles, and  to report to Congress about such negotiations.  Subsection (b) requires limitations on the importation of  shrimp from nations that have not moved to protect sea  turtles. If the President certifies that a country has  undertaken measures to protect turtles, shrimp imports  from that country are not banned. Id. at 650 (citing Section 609(a)-(b)). The Ninth Circuit  drew a parallel to the embargo on sea otter and fur seal skins identified in K Mart to  hold that the ""prohibitions on (b)(1) IN GENERAL.-The importation of shrimp or  products from shrimp which have been harvested with  commercial fishing technology which may affect  adversely such species of sea turtles shall be prohibited  not later than May 1, 1991, except as provided in  paragraph (2). (2) CERTIFICATION PROCEDURE.-The ban [*43]  on  importation of shrimp or products from shrimp pursuant  Page 16 of 22 to paragraph (1) shall not apply if the President shall  determine and certify to the Congress not later than May  1, 1991, and annually thereafter that- (A) the government of the harvesting nation has  provided documentary evidence of the adoption of a  regulatory program governing the incidental taking of  such sea turtles in the course of such harvesting that is  comparable to that of the United States; and (B) the average rate of that incidental taking by the  vessels of the harvesting nation is comparable to the  average rate of incidental taking of sea turtles by United  States vessels in the course of such harvesting; or (C) the particular fishing environment of the harvesting  nation does not pose a threat of the incidental taking of  such sea turtles in the course of such harvesting. Section 609(b).  Court No. 22-00299 31  shrimp importation for environmental protection"" were,  similarly, within the USCIT's jurisdiction. Id. at 652.20 Section 609 is distinct in at least two respects from  AMLRCA. First, Section 609 authorizes the executive to impose a nation-wide ban -  an embargo - on importation of shrimp or products from shrimp from the specific  country. Section 609(b). As the Ninth Circuit found in Earth Island [*44] , the Section  609 ban on shrimp importation exists de facto unless the president certifies affirmatively that a  nation is in compliance with the 20Following the Ninth Circuit's decision, plaintiff refiled  at the USCIT and several USCIT decisions ensued. See  Turtle Island Restoration Network v. Evans, 284 F.3d  1282 (Fed. Cir. 2002); see also Turtle Island Restoration  Network v. Mallett, 24 CIT 627, 110 F. Supp. 2d 1005  (2000). In one such decision, the USCIT explained that  ""the catch of vessels equipped with TEDs from nations  without such comparable foundation [as in the U.S. program to require the use of TEDs] continues  subject to embargo"": This court was constrained to conclude in slip op. 99-32  yet again that paragraph (1) of section 609(b) is  specifically contingent upon the certification procedure  established by section 609(b)(2), which offers the only  congressionally-approved breaches of the embargo,  either via subparagraphs (A) and (B) or through (C).  Paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) are pari materia; they  cannot be read independently, or out of the context  adopted by Congress, including section 609(a), to slow  or stanch the extinction of species of sea turtles. And so  long as the U.S. government reports that the ""foundation  of  the  U.S.  program""  continues,  with  ""limited  exceptions"", to be that ""all other commercial shrimp  trawl vessels operating in waters subject to U.S.  jurisdiction in which there is a likelihood of intercepting  sea [*45]  turtles must use TEDs at all times"", the catch  of vessels equipped with TEDs from nations without  such comparable foundation continues subject to  embargo. Turtle Island Restoration Network v. Mallett, 24 CIT at  631, 110 F. Supp. 2d at 1009. The Federal Circuit noted later that ""the Ninth Circuit  ruled that because 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i) vests exclusive  jurisdiction over embargoes and other trade restrictions  in the USCIT, an action to compel enforcement of the  import prohibitions of section 609(b) could lie only with  [the USCIT]."" Turtle Island Restoration Network v.  Evans, 284 F.3d 1282, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citing  Earth Island, 6 F.3d at 652). Ultimately, the Federal  Circuit reversed in part the USCIT's decision in Turtle  Island Restoration Network v. Mallett for reasons unrelated to jurisdiction. See Turtle  Island Restoration Network v. Evans, 284 F.3d 1282, 1297.  Court No. 22-00299 32  requirements of the statute. 6 F.3d at 650. Section 609  itself provides for the establishment of an embargo; the  statute subsequently provides exceptions to the ""ban on  importation of shrimp"" if the President certifies that the  governments  of  harvesting  nations  meet  listed  requirements. Section 609(b). By contrast, subsection  (h)(2) of the AMLRCA regulations does not create a  nation-wide or other ban on imports; rather, subsection  (h)(2)  expressly  permits  NMFS  to  preapprove  certificates of importation of Antarctic marine living resources so long as they are not  harvested in violation of CMs. Page 17 of 22 See 50 C.F.R. § 300.105(h)(2). As noted, subsection  (h)(2) does not preliminarily [*46]  impose an embargo.  Id.; 16 U.S.C. § 2435(3). The second key distinction is that Section 609 and its  implementing regulations establish a mechanism for the  creation, application and administration of an embargo,  whereas  neither  AMLRCA  nor  its  implementing  regulations do the same. Unlike the embargo in Earth  Island, the action in the instant case that plaintiff would  portray as an ""embargo"" is the result of plaintiff failing to  meet the requirements of a NMFS preapproval  application and NMFS' inability to approve the  application for importation when plaintiff cannot show  compliance with CMs. See NMFS Denial Letter at 3-4  (citing 50 C.F.R. § 300.105(d), (h)(2)). The provision of the  statute and regulations in the instant action serve to  facilitate importation of toothfish within the parameters  of CCAMLR CMs, whereas the statute before the Ninth  Circuit in Earth Island served to prohibit the importation  of shrimp from an entire country if the country was found  not to comply with shrimp trawl fishing protocols that  protect sea turtles. Earth Island, F.3d at 649.  Court No. 22-00299 33  Further, the circumstances of the instant denial - based  on the failure of the CCAMLR ""to adopt catch limits or other measures as  necessary in accordance with CM 31-01,"" [*47]  NMFS Denial Letter at 3 - are distinct from  the prohibition in Section 609. Section 609 prohibits shrimp importation harvested in a  way that endangers sea turtles, whereas AMLRCA, prohibits importation of Antarctic  marine living resources harvested in a way that does not comply with measures adopted  by a committee pursuant an international convention. Compare Section 609, 16  U.S.C. § 1537(b), with AMLRCA, 16 U.S.C. § 2435(3). The inability of such a commission,  the CCAMLR, to adopt, by consensus, ""limitations [on catch] or other [equivalent]  measures,"" CM 31-01, is not the equivalent of a limitation instituted affirmatively by a law  of the United States government to effectuate an importation prohibition of  zero. See K Mart, 485 U.S. at 185. Last, plaintiff raises a decision of the U.S. District Court  for the District of Columbia (""D.D.C.""), International Labor Rights Fund,  357 F. Supp. 2d at 205, 208-10. The D.D.C. granted defendant's motion to dismiss for  lack of subject matter jurisdiction because plaintiffs' claims arose out of section 307 of the  Tariff Act of 1930 (""Section 307""),21 which expressly provides for an embargo on  goods produced from forced labor. 21 Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. §  1307, provided in relevant part that: All goods . . . mined, produced, or manufactured wholly  or in part in any foreign country by convict labor or/and  forced labor or/and indentured labor under penal  sanctions shall [*48]  not be entitled to entry at any of  the ports of the United States, and the importation thereof is hereby  prohibited, and the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to  prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the  enforcement of this provision. The provisions of this  section  relating  to  goods,  wares,  articles,  and  merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured by  forced labor or/and indentured labor, shall take effect on  January 1, 1932; but in no case shall  Court No. 22-00299 34  Id. at 206. On this basis, the D.D.C. concluded that the  USCIT had exclusive jurisdiction over an action under Section 307: In contrast to the provision of the Tariff Act at issue in K  Mart, Section 307 expressly ""provides for"" an ""embargo""  under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(3), as defined by the  Page 18 of 22 Supreme Court. The plain language of Section 307  states that goods produced in a foreign country as a  result of forced or convict labor ""shall not be entitled to  entry at any of the ports of the United States, and the  importation thereof is hereby prohibited."" Id. at 208 (citing 19 U.S.C. § 1307). The D.D.C. added  that ""[n]either the interest in uniformity of judicial review, nor Congress' intent to  reserve certain cases for the specific expertise of the CIT, would be served by  retaining jurisdiction [*49]  over the plaintiffs' claims."" Id. at 209. The D.D.C. also found support for its  position in the fact that the USCIT had exercised jurisdiction over Section 307  cases in the past. Id. at 209 (citing McKinney v. U.S. Dep't of Treasury, 9 CIT 315, 614 F.  Supp. 1226 (1985); China Diesel Imps., Inc. v. United States, 18 CIT 515, 855 F. Supp.  380 (1994)). The prohibition under Section 307 on importation of  goods produced or manufactured by forced labor is distinct from the  conditions on importation provided for by AMLRCA. Under Section 307, the importation of  goods produced by forced labor is banned in its entirety, and the statute provides for the  Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations for the enforcement of the statute.  19 U.S.C. § 1307. By contrast, such provisions be applicable to goods, wares, articles,  or merchandise so mined, produced, or manufactured  which are not mined, produced, or manufactured in such  quantities in the United States as to meet the  consumptive demands of the United States. 19 U.S.C. § 1307 (2000). Congress removed the  ""consumptive demand"" clause, as part of the Trade  Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act in 2015, which  Customs stated, would ""[enhance Customs'] ability to  prevent products made with forced labor from being  imported."" Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act  of 2015, Pub. L. No. 114-25, § 910, 130 Stat. 122, 239 .  Court No. 22-00299 35  AMLRCA does not provide for the issuance of a ban on  all imports of Antarctic marine living resources. Rather, as described [*50]  supra,  AMLRCA provides for mechanisms and legal obligations necessary for the protection and  conservation of Antarctic marine living resources. 16 U.S.C. § 2431(a)(1). Under AMLRCA,  were NMFS to determine that an importation of a shipment of Antarctic marine living  resources was harvested in violation of a CCAMLR CM under the international framework for  resource management established  by  the  CAMLR  Convention  and  implemented by AMLRCA, NMFS would be authorized to prohibit importation of that shipment. 16  U.S.C. § 2435. In contrast to the default ban provided for in Section 307, AMLRCA and  its implementing regulations do not provide for such a ban; rather, the statute and  regulations expressly provide for importation so long as importers meet delineated  requirements so that harvesting of Antarctic living resources can be balanced with the  underlying conservation efforts of the statute.22 Compare Section 307 (prohibiting entry of  all goods produced by forced labor), with 16 U.S.C. § 2435 (making unlawful the  import of Antarctic marine living 22 For similar reasons, the Uyghur Forced Labor  Prevention Act (""UFLPA""), Pub. L. No. 117-78, 135 Stat.  1525 (2021), is also distinguished from AMLRCA. See  Ninestar Corp.v. United States, 47 CIT __, __, Slip Op.  23-169, at 17, 19 (Nov. 30, 2023) (holding that the  UFLPA is a law providing for embargoes within the  meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i) and closely related to  section 307). On December 1, 2023, plaintiff filed a  notice of subsequent authority, [*51]  arguing that the  Ninestar decision supports the conclusion that a  ""[g]overnment action that bars the importation of  individual shipments is an embargo within the meaning  Page 19 of 22 of 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)."" Pl.'s Notice Sub. Auth. at 2,  ECF No. 50. The court concludes that the UFLPA is distinct from  AMLRCA in that the UFLPA provides for an embargo of  goods that are from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous  Region of the People's Republic of China or are  produced by entities associated with that region. The  UFLPA allows for exceptions to the default ban by  delineating a rebuttable presumption that the import  prohibition applies to goods from or associated with the  region. Pub. L. No. 117-78, § 3, 135 Stat. at 1529.  Court No. 22-00299 36  resources harvested in violation of the CAMLR  Convention or in violation of regulations promulgated  under the statute). In the instant action, the court concludes that AMLRCA,  16 U.S.C. § 2431 etseq., and the implementing  regulations, 50 C.F.R. §§ 300.105(d), (h)(2), as invoked  by NMFS, see NMFS Denial Letter at 4, regulate the  import of toothfish in conjunction with international  conservation efforts agreed to by the United States and  adopted by consensus by the CCAMLR under the  CAMLR Convention. The language in AMLRCA and its  implementing regulations making it unlawful to import  toothfish [*52]  is expressly conditioned on the terms of  the CAMLR Convention and the conservation measures  adopted thereunder. The denial by NMFS of the  preapproval  application  does  not  constitute  an  ""embargo"" under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(C). ii. ""Other quantitative restrictions"" Defendants argue further that NMFS' denial of plaintiff's  pre-approval application is not an ""other quantitative  restriction[]"" on the importation of toothfish within the  meaning of AMLRCA. See Defs. Mot. Dismiss at 6-7.  On this point, plaintiff does not present any specific  arguments but only asserts without support or legal  analysis: ""even if not an embargo, it is certainly a  'quantitative  restriction  on  the  importation  of  merchandise.'"" Pl. Resp. at 8. NMFS' denial of plaintiff's preapproval application does  not constitute an ""other quantitative restriction[]."" 28  U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(C). Just as the denial of plaintiff's  preapproval application does not arise out of a law  providing for an embargo, similarly, the denial does not  arise out of a law providing for ""other quantitative  restrictions on the importation of merchandise."" Id. As  described, the Supreme Court defined an embargo  Court No. 22-00299 37  in K Mart as a ""governmentally imposed quantitative  restriction-of [*53]  zero."" 485 U.S. at 185. By extension, under that interpretation, the  common meaning23 of the term ""quantitative  restriction""  would  appear  to  be  a  governmentally imposed quantifiable limit that is not  zero. See, e.g., Best Foods, Inc., 50 Cust. Ct. at 95, 218  F. Supp. at 577 (noting that 7 U.S.C. § 624 authorizes  the imposition of what the court describes as ""fees or quantitative restrictions (quotas)""); Bethlehem  Steel Corp., 28 CIT at 159 n.8, 316 F. Supp. 2d at 1314 n.8 (stating that a ""quantitative  restriction agreement"" under 19 U.S.C. § 1671c(c)(3) is ""an agreement by a foreign  government to limit the volume of imports of the  merchandise at issue into the United States-that is, an  agreement establishing a quota""); Maple Leaf Fish Co.,  762 F.2d at 88 (referencing a report by the U.S.  International Trade Commission that, the court said,  ""recommended import relief taking the form of  quantitative restrictions, or import quotas, for a 3-year  period"" (emphasis supplied)); American Ass'n of Exps. & Imps.- Textile & Apparel Grp. v. UnitedStates, 751 F.2d 1239,  1244 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (describing 7 U.S.C. § 1854  (1982) as ""a law providing for quantitative restrictions on  textiles"" and referring to ""quotas established under the  authority of [that] section"");24 see also R.J.F. Fabrics,  Inc. v. United States, 10 CIT 735, 741, 743, 651 F.  Supp. 1431, 1435, 1436-37 (1986) (finding that  ""jurisdiction 23 As the Supreme Court in K Mart focused on the  common meaning of ""embargo,"" so too does this court  focus on the common meaning of ""quantitative  restriction."" See K Mart, 485 U.S. at 189;see also [*54]  Conoco, 18 F.3d  at 1581.  24Under the statute at issue in American Ass'n of  Exporters & Importers-Textile &Apparel Group, 7 U.S.C.  § 1854 (1982), the President is permitted to negotiate  agreements ""limiting the export from such countries and  the importation into the United States"" of certain products. 751 F.2d at 1241 (quoting 7  Page 20 of 22 U.S.C. § 1854 (1982)). In the instant action, no such  provision authorizing the President to impose limits on  imports appears in AMLRCA, 16 U.S.C. § 2435, or its  implementing regulations, 50 C.F.R. § 300.105.  Court No. 22-00299 38  exists under § 1581(i) since plaintiff's cause of action  arises out of the administration and enforcement of a quantitative restriction on  imported goods"" where the ""action requires a determination as to country of origin of  merchandise excluded for possible violations of quota requirements""). Further, there are no ""catch limits or other measures"" in  place pursuant to CMs with respect to the harvest of the toothfish at issue in  this case. NMFS Denial Letter at 3; see Corrected Compl. ¶ 22 (""The most recently- adopted catch limits were for the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 seasons . . . ."" (citing CM 41- 02 ¶ 4 (2019-2021))).25 25 The laws at issue address violations of CCAMLR  conservation measures and do not address explicitly  violations of toothfish catch limits. See 16 U.S.C. §  2435(3); 50 C.F.R. § 300.105(d), (h)(2). Moreover,  CCAMLR conservation measures may be broader than  just [*55]  quantity designations; conservation measures  may address not only the quantity of a species that may  be harvested but also other aspects of harvesting, such  as the designation of harvesting seasons and the  regulation of harvesting methods. CAMLR Convention  art. IX(2)(a)-(i). Article IX states in relevant part: 2. The conservation measures referred to in paragraph  1(f) above include the following: (a) the designation of the quantity of any species which  may be harvested in the area to which this Convention  applies; (b) the designation of regions and sub-regions based on  the distribution of populations of Antarctic marine living  resources; (c) the designation of the quantity which may be  harvested from the populations of regions and sub- regions; (d) the designation of protected species; (e) the designation of the size, age and, as appropriate,  sex of species which may be harvested; (f) the designation of open and closed seasons for  harvesting; (g) the designation of the opening and closing of areas,  regions or sub-regions for purposes of scientific study or  conservation, including special areas for protection and  scientific study; (h) regulation of the effort employed and methods of  harvesting, including fishing gear, with a [*56]  view,  inter alia, to avoiding undue concentration of harvesting  in any region or sub-region; (i) the taking of such other conservation measures as  the Commission considers necessary for the fulfilment  of the objective of this Convention, including measures  concerning the effects of harvesting and associated  Court No. 22-00299 39  In sum, AMLRCA and its implementing regulations do  not impose a non-zero numerical or quantitative limit or  quota on the importation of toothfish. See generally 16 U.S.C. § 2435(3); 50 C.F.R. § 300.105(d), (h)(2).  Moreover, NMFS did not specify any such limit in its  denial. See generally NMFS Denial Letter. The denial by NMFS of the preapproval application does  not constitute an ""other quantitative restriction[]"" under  28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(C). iii. ""Administration and enforcement"" with respect  to the denial Plaintiff has failed to establish jurisdiction under 28  U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(C) based on the existence of an  embargo or other quantitative restriction. Accordingly,  the  Court  does  not  have  jurisdiction  under  §  1581(i)(1)(D) over the ""administration and enforcement""  of any such embargo or quantitative restriction. ""[S]ection 1581(i)(4) as it relates to section 1581(i)(3)  provides [that] the Court of International Trade [has] . . .  jurisdiction over cases that arise out of any law  providing for the administration [*57]  and enforcement  of an embargo."" Sakar Int'l, Inc. v. UnitedStates, 516  F.3d 1340, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2008). In Native Federation,  Page 21 of 22 this Court explained with respect to the statute at issue  in that case: ""Since Section 9(c) does not provide for an  embargo, Section 1581(i)(4) does not provide an  independent basis for jurisdiction."" 31 CIT at 598, 491 F.  Supp. 2d at 1186 (citing Retamal v. U.S. Customs  &Border Prot., 439 F.3d 1372, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2006));  see also Salmon Spawning, 33 CIT at 521, 626 F.

(citing Native Fed'n, 31 CIT at 598, 491 F. Supp. 2d at 1186)).  Similarly, as discussed supra Section I.C.2 and 3, AMLRCA, 16 U.S.C. § 2435, and its  implementing regulations, 50 C.F.R. § 300.105, do not provide for an embargo or  other quantitative restriction on the importation of  merchandise. The denial by NMFS of the preapproval  application does not constitute an embargo or other  quantitative restriction and does not reflect the  administration or enforcement of an embargo or other  quantitative  restriction  under  AMLRCA  or  its  implementing regulations. As such, the Court does not  have  jurisdiction  independently  under  section  1581(i)(1)(D). II. Whether the Court has exclusive jurisdiction over  this action Plaintiff  and  defendants  dispute  whether  this  Court [*58]  or the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the instant action. Compare  Defs. Mot. Dismiss at 8-12; Defs. Reply Br. at 7-16, with  Pl. Resp. at 8-11, 16-21. Parties' arguments pertain to  two potentially conflicting jurisdictional statutes: 28  U.S.C. § 1581(i), described supra Section I.A, and 16 U.S.C. § 2440, which states that  ""[t]he district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any case or  controversy arising under the provisions of this chapter  [governing 16 U.S. Code Chapter 44A - AMLRC] or of  any regulation promulgated under this chapter."" See  Defs. Mot. Dismiss at 8-12; Pl. Resp. at 8-11, 16-21;  Defs. Reply Br. at 7-16. The court will not consider whether its jurisdiction is  exclusive over the action, because the court concludes,  supra Section I, that it does not have jurisdiction over  this  Court No. 22-00299 41  action under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i) due to the lack of an  embargo or other quantitative restriction. III. Transfer of action If the ""court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the  court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action or appeal to any  other such court . . . in which the action or appeal could  have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed."" 28  U.S.C. § 1631; see Salmon Spawning, 33 CIT at 518, 626 F.  Supp. 2d at 1281 (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1631). ""It is in the  interest [*59]  of justice to transfer an action if it  preserves a party's right to be heard on its potentially  meritorious claim."" Salmon Spawning, 33 CIT at 518,  626 F. Supp. 2d at 1281 (citing Galloway Farms, Inc. v.  United States, 834 F.2d 998, 1000 (Fed. Cir. 1987)). During oral argument,  plaintiff stated that the Southern District of Florida would be the proper district court for  transfer of the case. Oral Arg. Tr. at 82:6-14.  Defendants did not adopt a definitive position, stating  that ""if the Court decides it doesn't have jurisdiction and  if the Court decides it's appropriate, [the government]  wouldn't oppose transfer of the action to the appropriate  District Court."" Oral Arg. Tr. at 82:17-24. The court invites parties to file motions to transfer under  28 U.S.C. § 1631 to the appropriate district court. Dalton  v. Southwest Marine, Inc., 120 F.3d 1249, 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (""[S]ection 1631 is a remedial statute  designed to eliminate any prejudice that results from  filing in an improper forum."").

S. Y. v. Wyndham Hotels(2),"[*1077]  OPINION AND ORDER This matter comes before the Court on review of the  following three motions to dismiss: (1) defendant H.I.  Naples, LLC's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint,  Motion to Strike, and Incorporated Memorandum of Law  (Doc. #16), filed on September 22, 2020; (2) defendant  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.'s Motion to [**2]   Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint (Doc. #17), filed on  September 30, 2020; and (3) defendant Hanuman of  Naples, LLC's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint,  Motion to Strike, and Memorandum of Law in Support  Thereof (Doc. #21), filed on October 2, 2020. Plaintiff  filed a Memorandum in Opposition to each motion (Doc.  #31; Doc. #38; Doc. #39) on October 20th, November  4th, and November 6, 2020. Defendant Wyndham  Hotels & Resorts, Inc. filed a Reply (Doc. #46) on  November 30, 2020. For the reasons set forth below,  the motions are denied. 519 F. Supp. 3d 1069, *1069; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28294, **28294 Page 7 of 19 I. The origins of this case began on October 30, 2019,  when plaintiff and another alleged victim of sex  trafficking filed a case in the Circuit Court of the  Twentieth Judicial Circuit in and for Collier County,  Florida. See S.Y. et al v. Naples Hotel Co. et al, Case  No. 2:20-cv-118 (Doc. #1, p. 3). On December 31, 2019,  the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint which  asserted ten claims against over forty defendants. Id. at  (Doc. #1, pp. 2-4). The case was removed to federal  court in February 2020. Id. at (Doc. #1). On April 15,  2020, the plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint.  Id. at (Doc. #85). On August 5, 2020, the undersigned  denied various [**3]  motions to dismiss, but determined  severance of the parties was appropriate. S.Y. v. Naples  Hotel Co., 476 F. Supp. 3d 1251, 1258-59 (M.D. Fla.  2020). Following the Court's severance order, plaintiff  and the other alleged victim filed nearly thirty new  actions against various defendants, including this case. The Complaint (Doc. #1) in this case was filed on  August 19, 2020, and alleges that plaintiff S.Y., a  resident of Collier County, Florida, was a victim of  continuous sex trafficking at a certain Days Inn Hotel  in Naples, Florida (the Days Inn Hotel) between 2013  and February 2016. (Id. ¶¶ 14, 23-25.) The Complaint  alleges that during this time period the Days Inn Hotel  was operated by various entities as franchisees of  defendant  Wyndham  Hotels  &  Resorts,  Inc.  (Wyndham). The Days Inn Hotel was operated by  defendant Hanuman of Naples, LLC (Hanuman) from an  unspecified date until 2015. (Id. ¶¶ 26, 27.) In 2015  Hanuman sold the Days Inn Hotel to defendant H.I.  Naples, LLC (H.I. Naples), which operated the hotel until  2016. In 2016 H.I. Naples sold the Days Inn Hotel to  defendant  Shree  Siddhivinayak  Hospitality,  LLC  (Shree). (Id. ¶¶ 27, 28.) In 2019, Shree sold the Days  Inn Hotel to a non-party, who converted it to a Holiday   [*1078]  Inn Express and operated it as [**4]  a  franchisee of defendant Holiday Hospitality Franchising,  LLC. (Id. ¶ 34.) The Complaint alleges the following six claims: (1)  violation  of  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection        Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), 18 U.S.C. §  1595; (2) violation of the Florida RICO statute, §  772.104, Florida Statutes; (3) premise liability; (4)  negligent hiring, supervision, and retention; (5) negligent  rescue; and (6) aiding and abetting, harboring,  confining, coercion, and criminal enterprise. (Id. pp. 35- 53.) Counts One through Four are asserted against  each defendant, while Counts Five and Six are asserted  against only Hanuman, Shree, and H.I. Naples. (Id.) II. The H.I. Naples, Wyndham, and Hanuman motions  raise numerous arguments as to why the Complaint as  whole, and each individual claim, should be dismissed.  The Court will address each of these arguments in turn. A. Shotgun Pleading Wyndham and Hanuman both argue the Complaint  must be dismissed as a shotgun pleading. (Doc. #17,  pp. 5-6; Doc. #21, pp. 5-6.) The Complaint identifies Wyndham, Hanuman, Shree,  and H.I. Naples collectively as the ""Days Inn  Defendants."" (Doc. #1, p. 1 introductory paragraph.)  Wyndham and Hanuman argue that because the  Complaint groups these four defendants together, it  should [**5]  be dismissed as a shotgun pleading. HN1[ ] One way in which a complaint may constitute  an impermissible shotgun pleading is if it ""assert[s]  multiple claims against multiple defendants without  specifying which of the defendants are responsible for  which acts or omissions, or which of the defendants the  claim is brought against."" Weiland v. Palm Beach Cty.  Sheriff's Office, 792 F.3d 1313, 1323 (11th Cir. 2015);  see also Barmapov v. Amuial, 986 F.3d 1321, 2021 U.S.  App. LEXIS 2962, 2021 WL 359632, *2 (11th Cir. Feb.  3, 2021). Such a pleading fails ""to give the defendants  adequate notice of the claims against them and the  grounds upon which each claim rests,"" Weiland, 792  F.3d at 1323, and violates the requirement that a  plaintiff provide ""a short and plain statement of the  claim,"" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).     519 F. Supp. 3d 1069, *1077; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28294, **2 Page 8 of 19 The Complaint does indeed repeatedly refer to the four  defendants collectively as the ""Days Inn Defendants.""  The failure to specify a particular defendant is not fatal,  however, when ""[t]he complaint can be fairly read to  aver that all defendants are responsible for the alleged  conduct."" Kyle K. v. Chapman, 208 F. 3d 940, 944 (11th  Cir. 2000). The Complaint typically (but not always)  alleges that ""each and every"" such defendant was  involved in the activity described in the particular  paragraph of the Complaint. A fair reading of the  Complaint is that each of these defendants was involved  in the identified conduct attributed to the ""Days Inn  Defendants."" While defendants may [**6]  disagree that  such allegations are accurate, that dispute is for another  day. The group allegations do not fail to state a claim,  Auto. Alignment & Body Serv., Inc. v. State Farm Mut.  Auto. Ins. Co., 953 F.3d 707, 732-33 (11th Cir. 2020),  and the Complaint does not constitute a shotgun  pleading.  [*1079]  B. Redundant and Immaterial Factual  Allegations H.I. Naples and Hanuman argue that the Complaint is  ""replete with redundant and conclusory allegations"" that  each defendant ""knew or should have known of the  prevalence of sex trafficking at hotels and motels,  knew or should have known sex trafficking and other  illegal activities were occurring at its hotel, and failed to  take actions to prevent them from occurring so it could  earn a profit."" (Doc. #16, pp. 3-4; Doc. #21, p. 6.) H.I.  Naples and Hanuman request the Court strike such  allegations, arguing they are redundant and immaterial,  constitute an impermissible attempt to ""puff"" the facts  against the defendants, and serve only to confuse the  issues and cause prejudice. (Id.) HN2[ ] Pursuant to Rule 12(f), a party may move to  strike ""any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or  scandalous matter"" within the pleadings. The Court  enjoys broad discretion in determining whether to grant  or deny a motion to strike. Anchor Hocking Corp. v.  Jacksonville Elec. Auth., 419 F. Supp. 992, 1000 (M.D.  Fla. 1976). ""The purpose of a motion to strike is to clean  up the pleadings, [**7]  streamline litigation, and avoid  unnecessary forays into immaterial matters."" Hutchings  v. Fed. Ins. Co., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75334, 2008 WL  4186994, *2 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 8, 2008) (marks and  citation omitted). It is not intended to ""procure the  dismissal of all or part of a complaint."" Id. A motion to  strike is a drastic remedy and is disfavored by the  courts. Schmidt v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 289 F.R.D.  357, 358 (M.D. Fla. 2012). Therefore, a motion to strike  should be granted only if ""the matter sought to be  omitted has no possible relationship to the controversy,  may confuse the issues, or otherwise prejudice a party.""  Id. It is accurate to say that the Complaint alleges that  defendants knew or should have known a great number  of  things.  Allegations  regarding  the  defendants'  knowledge of the prevalence of sex trafficking at hotels  in general and at their hotel in particular, and the failure  to prevent it, are relevant to the types of claims plaintiff  asserts. S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1259 n.5. The Court  does not find that the allegations identified by  defendants are overly redundant or unduly prejudicial,  and the ""drastic remedy"" of striking the allegations is not  justified.  Accordingly,  the  request  to  strike  the  allegations is denied. C. Failure to State a Claim Each defendant argues certain claims should be  dismissed due to plaintiff's failure to state a claim upon  which relief may [**8]  be granted. HN3[ ] Federal Rule  of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires that a complaint  contain a ""short and plain statement of the claim  showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed. R.  Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This obligation ""requires more than  labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the  elements of a cause of action will not do."" Bell Atl. Corp.  v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L.  Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). To survive  dismissal, the factual allegations must be ""plausible""  and ""must be enough to raise a right to relief above the  speculative level."" Id. at 555; see also Edwards v. Prime  Inc., 602 F.3d 1276, 1291 (11th Cir. 2010). This requires  ""more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully- harmed-me accusation."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,  678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009)  (citations omitted). HN4[ ] In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss,  the Court must accept all factual allegations in a  complaint as true and take them in the light most  favorable to the plaintiff, Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S.  89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007), but",1
S. Y. v. Wyndham Hotels(3),"[*1180]  OPINION AND ORDER This matter comes before the Court on review of the  following motions: (1) defendant Rist Properties, LLC's  Motion to Dismiss, Motion to Strike, or For a More  Definite Statement and Memorandum of Law in Support  Thereof (Doc. #13), filed on September 28, 2020, and  (2) defendant Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.'s Motion  to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint (Doc. #14), filed on  September 30, 2020. Plaintiff filed an Opposition to  each motion (Doc. #32; Doc. [**2]  #36) on November  2nd and November 4th, 2020. Defendant Wyndham  Hotels & Resorts, Inc. filed a Reply (Doc. #43) on  November 30, 2020. For the reasons set forth below,  the motions are denied. I. The origins of this case began on October 30, 2019,  when plaintiff and another alleged victim of sex  trafficking filed a case in the Circuit Court of the  Twentieth Judicial Circuit in and for Collier County,  Florida.

Following the Court's severance order, plaintiff  and the other alleged victim filed nearly thirty new  actions against various defendants, including this case. The Complaint (Doc. #1) in this case was filed on  August 19, 2020, and alleges that plaintiff S.Y., a  Page 2 of 14 resident [**3]  of Collier County, Florida, was a victim of  continuous sex trafficking at a certain Ramada by  Wyndham Naples Hotel in Naples, Florida (the Ramada  Hotel) between 2015 and February 2016. (Id. ¶¶ 2, 13,  22-24.) The Complaint alleges that during this time  period the Ramada Hotel was operated by defendant  Rist Properties, LLC (Rist) as a franchisee of defendant  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (Wyndham). (Id. ¶¶  25-28, 49.) The Complaint alleges the following six claims: (1)  violation  of  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), 18 U.S.C. §  1595; (2) violation of the Florida RICO statute, §  772.104, Florida Statutes; (3) premise liability; (4)  negligent hiring, supervision, and retention; (5) negligent  rescue; and (6) aiding and abetting, harboring,  confining, coercion, and criminal enterprise. (Id. pp. 33- 48.) Counts One through Four are asserted against  each defendant, while Counts Five and Six are asserted  against only Rist. (Id.) II. The Rist and Wyndham motions raise numerous  arguments as to why the Complaint as whole, and each  individual claim, should be dismissed. The Court will  address each of these arguments in turn.  [*1181]  A. Redundant, Irrelevant and Scandalous  Allegations Rist argues that the Complaint contains numerous [**4]   allegations  that  are  redundant,  irrelevant,  and  scandalous, and therefore should be struck. (Doc. #13,  pp. 4-7.) Pursuant to Rule 12(f), a party may move to  strike ""any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or  scandalous matter"" within the pleadings. The Court  enjoys broad discretion in determining whether to grant  or deny a motion to strike. Anchor Hocking Corp. v.  Jacksonville Elec. Auth., 419 F. Supp. 992, 1000 (M.D.  Fla. 1976). ""The purpose of a motion to strike is to clean  up the pleadings, streamline litigation, and avoid  unnecessary forays into immaterial matters."" Hutchings        v. Fed. Ins. Co., 2008 U.S. Dist.

A motion to  strike is a drastic remedy and is disfavored by the  courts. Schmidt v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 289 F.R.D.  357, 358 (M.D. Fla. 2012). Therefore, a motion to strike  should be granted only if ""the matter sought to be  omitted has no possible relationship to the controversy,  may confuse the issues, or otherwise prejudice a party.""  Id. Rist moves to strike ten paragraphs in the Complaint,  arguing the allegations therein contain (1) irrelevant  ""puffing"" about sex trafficking and its alleged  relationship with the hotel industry, and (2) immaterial  and scandalous matters regarding Rist's knowledge of  the tactics of sex traffickers. (Doc. #13, pp. 5-6.) Having  reviewed the [**5]  allegations at issue (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 3-5,  55-57, 78-80, 146), the Court declines to strike them.  The majority of the allegations relate to the defendants'  knowledge of sex trafficking, the failure to prevent it,  and the motivation for doing so. Such allegations are  relevant to the type of claims plaintiff asserts, S.Y., 476  F. Supp. 3d at 1259 n.5, and the Court does not find any  to  be  overly  redundant  or  unduly  prejudicial.  Accordingly, the request to strike the allegations is  denied. B. Shotgun Pleading The Complaint identifies Wyndham and Rist collectively  as the ""Ramada Defendants."" (Doc. #1, p. 1 introductory  paragraph.) Wyndham and Rist argue that because the  Complaint groups them together, it should be dismissed  as a shotgun pleading. (Doc. #13, pp. 7-10; Doc. #14,  pp. 5-6.)               521 F. Supp. 3d 1173, *1180; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32194, **2 Page 3 of 14 One way in which a complaint may constitute an  impermissible shotgun pleading is if it ""assert[s] multiple  claims against multiple defendants without specifying  which of the defendants are responsible for which acts  or omissions, or which of the defendants the claim is  brought against.""

Feb. 3,  2021). Such a pleading fails ""to give the defendants  adequate notice of the claims against them and the  grounds upon which each  [*1182]  claim rests,""  Weiland, 792 F.3d at 1323, and [**6]  violates the  requirement that a plaintiff provide ""a short and plain  statement of the claim,"" Fed.

In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court  must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true  and take them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197,  167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal conclusions  without adequate factual support are entitled to no  assumption of truth,"" Mamani v. Berzaín, 654 F.3d  1148, 1153 (11th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted).  ""Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of  action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do  not suffice."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Factual allegations  that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability fall  short of being facially plausible. Chaparro v. Carnival  Corp., 693 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir. 2012) (citations  omitted). Thus, the Court engages in a two-step  approach: ""When there are well-pleaded factual  allegations, a court should assume their veracity and  then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an  entitlement to relief."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. (1) Trafficking Victims [**8]  Protection  Reauthorization Act Wyndham challenges the one federal claim, the alleged  violation of the TVPRA  [*1183]  set forth in Count One.  The TVPRA provides a civil remedy to victims of certain  types of human trafficking. The civil remedy portion of  the Act provides: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). The phrase ""a violation of this  chapter"" refers to Chapter 77 of Title 18 of the United  States Code. The only violation of Chapter 77 relevant  to this case is contained in 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a), which  521 F. Supp. 3d 1173, *1181; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32194, **5 Page 4 of 14 provides in relevant part: (a) Whoever knowingly — (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign  commerce . . . recruits, entices, harbors,  transports,  provides,  obtains,  advertises,  maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any means  a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything  of value, from participation in a venture [**9]   which has engaged in an act described in  violation of paragraph (1), knowing, or except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). To state a section 1595(a) claim in  this case, plaintiff must plausibly allege that she was a  victim of a criminal offense under section 1591(a), and  then must plausibly allege that defendant (1)""knowingly  benefit[ted] financially or by receiving anything of value,""  (2) from participation in a venture, (3) which defendant  ""knew or should have known has engaged in"" sex  trafficking under section 1591(a). S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d  at 1255-56 (citing A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 455 F. Supp.  3d 171, 181 (E.D. Pa. 2020)). Wyndham argues the Complaint's allegations are  insufficient to state a claim under section 1595(a),  asserting four pleading deficiencies. (Doc. #14, pp. 6- 16.) (a) ""Participation"" in a ""Venture"" Wyndham first argues that the Complaint lacks well-pled  allegations that it participated in a ""venture,"" as required  by section 1595(a). (Doc. #14, pp. 6-10.) Drawing on the  definition [**10]  of ""venture"" used in the criminal portion  of the statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(6) Wyndham  asserts that a ""venture"" requires two or more individuals     ""associated in fact."" (Doc. #14, p. 6.) Borrowing from  the federal RICO definition of ""enterprise,"" Wyndham  argues that ""associated in fact"" requires that persons  must operate as a ""continuing unit that functions with a  common purpose."" (Id. p. 7.) Wyndham continues that in  the context of a TVPRA claim against a hotel  [*1184]   operator, the Complaint must ""at least"" allege a  ""continuous business relationship between the trafficker  and the hotels such that it would appear that the  trafficker and the hotels have established a pattern of  conduct or could be said to have a tacit agreement."" (Id.  pp. 7-8) (quoting M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts,  Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959, 970 (S.D. Ohio 2019)); see  also Doe v. Rickey Patel, LLC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  195811, 2020 WL 6121939, *5 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 30,  2020)( ""In order to plead Defendants participated in a  venture, Plaintiff must allege facts from which the Court  could reasonably infer the hotels could be said to have a  tacit agreement with the trafficker."" (marks omitted)).  Wyndham concludes that ""[a] commercial relationship,  such as a hotel owner renting a hotel room, does not  give rise to a reasonable inference that the participants  in such a relationship shared a common purpose or  otherwise 'associated in fact.'"" (Doc. [**11]  #14, p. 8.) Here, the Complaint alleges Wyndham participated in a  venture ""by engaging in a pattern of acts and omissions  that were intended to support, facilitate, harbor, and  otherwise further the traffickers' sale and victimization of  the Plaintiff S.Y. for commercial sexual exploitation by  repeatedly renting rooms at Ramada Hotel to people""  Wyndham ""knew or should have known were engaged  in sex trafficking."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 156.) The Complaint  also alleges why Wyndham should have been on notice  of the sex trafficking and how it failed to prevent it. (Id.  ¶¶ 4-16, 55-83, 114.) The Court finds the allegations in  the Complaint sufficient to allege participation in a  venture under section 1595(a). See Doe, 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 195811, 2020 WL 6121939, *5 (""The Court  finds it sufficient for Plaintiff to plead that Defendants  participated in a venture by renting rooms to individuals  that knew or should have known were involved in a sex- trafficking  venture,  including  the  sex-trafficking          521 F. Supp. 3d 1173, *1183; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32194, **8 Page 5 of 14 victim.""); M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 971 (""This Court finds  Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to show Defendants  'participated in a venture' under § 1595 by alleging that  Defendants rented rooms to people it knew or should  have known where [sic] engaged in sex trafficking.""). Wyndham also argues that ""participation"" [**12]  in a  venture requires an allegation of an overt act in  furtherance of the venture, and that failure to prevent  sex trafficking is not such an overt act. (Doc. #14, pp.  8-9.) The Court is not convinced. S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d  at 1256 (""In the absence of any controlling authority, the  Court concludes that actual 'participation in the sex  trafficking act itself' is not required to state a claim  under section 1595. Accordingly, plaintiffs' failure to  allege such actual participation is not fatal to its section  1595 claim under the TVPRA.""). Wyndham has not  identified any controlling authority to the contrary. (b) Knowingly Benefited From Participating in  Venture Wyndham next argues that the Complaint insufficiently  alleges that it knowingly benefitted from participating in  a  venture  that  committed  TVPRA  crimes,  with  knowledge of the causal relationship. (Doc. #14, p. 10- 11.) Wyndham asserts that the allegation that it  financially benefited from its relationship with the  franchisees because it received franchise fees is  insufficient, since that money is not ""from"" any act by  Wyndham that could plausibly constitute ""participation""  in a TVPRA ""venture."" (Id.)  [*1185]   The  Complaint  alleges  the  defendants  knowingly benefited from the sex trafficking of  plaintiff [**13]  ""by receiving payment for the rooms  rented for Plaintiff S.Y. and her traffickers at the  Ramada Hotel,"" and by receiving ""other financial  benefits in the form of food and beverage sales and  ATM fees from those persons who were engaging in  sex trafficking."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 154.) As to Wyndham as  franchisor, the Complaint alleges it ""received a  significant franchise fee and continuous royalties on the  Ramada Hotel's gross revenue,"" while also exercising  ""ongoing and systematic control over operations at the  Ramada Hotel."" (Id. ¶¶ 43, 111.) The Court finds such  allegations sufficient to satisfy the ""knowingly benefitted""  element. S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1257; Doe S.W. v.  Lorain-Elyria Motel, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961,  2020 WL 1244192, *5 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 16, 2020); H.H.  v. G6 Hosp., LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019  WL 6682152, *2 (S.D. Ohio Dec. 6, 2019); M.A., 425 F.  Supp. 3d at 965. (c) Knew or Should Have Known that Venture was  Committing Sex Trafficking Crimes Wyndham argues the Complaint fails to plausibly allege  that it knew or should have known that the ""venture""  was engaging in sex-trafficking crimes, i.e., that  Wyndham knew or should have known that an adult  plaintiff was caused to engage in commercial sex by  force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion. (Doc. #14, p.  11-13.) Rather, Wyndham argues, the Complaint only  alleges that the hotel staff did not interfere with plaintiff  and witnessed indicia of commercial sex [**14]  activity.  (Id. p. 11.) Wyndham argues that the allegations do not  give rise to a reasonable inference that it knew or  should have known about any commercial sex activity  at the Ramada Hotel, let alone that it was forced activity.  (Id.) The Court disagrees with this argument. First of all,  ""knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind  may be alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b); see Sun  Life Assurance Co. of Can. v. Imperial Premium Fin.,  LLC, 904 F.3d 1197, 1215 (11th Cir. 2018). Pleading  ""generally"" is not without limits, and a complaint must  still comply with ""the less rigid—though still operative— strictures of Rule 8."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 686-87. The  Complaint clearly satisfies this notice pleading standard. Plaintiff has alleged that the following was ""routine  conduct taking place at the Ramada Hotel as a result of  the human sex trafficking enterprise"": a. Plaintiff's sex traffickers frequently rented rooms  at the hotel close to each other; b. Plaintiffs' [sic] sex traffickers paid cash for the  rooms at the Ramada Hotel where the Plaintiff  engaged in commercial sex acts; c. Plaintiff's sex traffickers booked extended stays  at the Ramada Hotel for themselves and for the  Plaintiff on a routine basis and on a rotating basis  frequently throughout the year; d. Plaintiff and her sex traffickers would have few or  no luggage or personal [**15]  possessions for  these extended stays; e. Plaintiff was confined in the rooms at the  Ramada Hotel for long periods of time; f. Plaintiff's rooms and her sex traffickers' rooms  521 F. Supp. 3d 1173, *1184; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32194, **11 Page 6 of 14 consistently displayed ""Do Not Disturb"" signs on the  doors to the room where the Plaintiff was engaged  in commercial sex acts; g. Men (""Johns"") frequently entered and left the  rooms at the Ramada Hotel where the Plaintiff was  engaged  [*1186]  in illegal commercial sex acts at  all times of day and night; h. The staff and customers at the Ramada Hotel  that was owned, operated, managed, supervised,  controlled and/or otherwise held responsible by  each and every Ramada Defendant saw that the  rooms where the Plaintiff engaged in commercial  sex acts were messy, and contained sex and drug  paraphernalia and had an unclean smell; i. Plaintiff S.Y. was often tortured and raped in the  Ramada Hotel rooms; j. The rooms at the Ramada Hotel were filled with  evidence of sex trafficking and drug use; k. Plaintiff's sex traffickers consistently refused  housekeeping  services  and  otherwise  would  prohibit staff from entering their rooms and the  Plaintiff's rooms; l. Plaintiff would frequently request clean towels and  linens; m. Plaintiff dressed in [**16]  a sexually explicit  manner and would walk the hallways of the  Ramada Defendant [sic] where she was seen by  the hotel staff; n. Excessively loud noises would consistently come  from Plaintiff's rooms; o. During nighttime hours, Plaintiff and her ""Johns""  and drug clients would create noise at the Ramada  Hotel and, upon information and belief, would be a  disturbance to other guests using the hotel for their  intended purposes; and p. While at the hotel, the Plaintiff displayed clear  signs of physical abuse, diminished personal  hygiene, submissiveness and inappropriate attire. (Doc. #1, ¶ 96.) Further, the Complaint alleges  Wyndham and Rist ""knew or should have known about  the nature of the sex trafficking venture at the Ramada  Hotel, including as they related to Plaintiff S.Y."" due to  the following: a. Requests by the traffickers to rent rooms near  exit doors; b. Cash payments for the rooms by the sex  traffickers; c. Refusal of housekeeping services by those  persons engaged in sex trafficking; d. Excessive used condoms located in the rooms  used for sex trafficking; e. Excessive requests for towels and linens in the  rooms used for sex trafficking; f. Hotel staff observing Plaintiff S.Y. and her  traffickers [**17]  in the hotel; g. Plaintiff S.Y. being escorted by traffickers in and  around the hotel; h. Operation of sex trafficking ventures out of the  same hotel room for multiple days or weeks in  succession; i. Multiple men per day coming and going from the  same  rooms  without  luggage  or  personal  possessions; j. Blood stained sheets and linens found in Plaintiff's  room; and k. Knowledge of police and EMS activity at the  Ramada Hotel and at other locations near the  Ramada Hotel that was related to commercial sex  work. (Id. ¶ 155.) The  Court  finds  these  allegations  sufficient  to  reasonably infer the defendants knew or should have  known of the sex trafficking venture. S.Y., 476 F.  Supp. 3d at 1257; A.B., 455 F. Supp. 3d at 193-94; Doe  S.W., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192,  *5-6; H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL  6682152, *3; M.A., 425 F. Supp 3d at 967-68.  [*1187]  (d) Vicarious Liability Finally, Wyndham suggests the TVPRA claim should be  dismissed because ""[v]icarious liability is not viable  under the TVPRA"". (Doc. #14, p. 13.) The Court  disagrees. See S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1257-58  (finding  plaintiff  made  sufficient  allegations  that  franchisor was vicariously liable under section 1595 of  the TVPRA to survive dismissal); see also J.C. v.  Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073,  2020 WL 6318707, *10 (N.D. Ca. Oct. 28, 2020) (finding  plaintiff's vicarious liability claim had ""alleged sufficient  facts to support a plausible claim that [defendants]  received financial benefits from a venture they  vicariously  participate  in  (through [**18]   their  521 F. Supp. 3d 1173, *1185; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32194, **15 Page 7 of 14 franchisees) that the franchises should have known was  engaged in sex trafficking""). Wyndham also argues that even if it could be held  vicariously liable under the TVPRA, plaintiff's allegations  ""do not give rise to a plausible inference of an agency  relationship"" between Wyndham and its franchisee, Rist.  (Doc. #14, p. 14.) Wyndham argues that because the  Landham Act requires some degree of supervision by a  franchisor, such supervision cannot be the basis for  liability. (Id. at 14-16.) The Court finds that the  allegations in the Complaint do create such a plausible  inference. ""It is well-established that a franchise relationship does  not by itself create an agency relationship between the  franchisor and franchisee."" Cain v. Shell Oil Co., 994 F.  Supp. 2d 1251, 1252 (N.D. Fla. 2014). However,  ""[f]ranchisors may well enter into an agency relationship  with a franchisee if, by contract or action or  representation, the franchisor has directly or apparently  participated in some substantial way in directing or  managing acts of the franchisee, beyond the mere fact  of providing contractual franchise support activities.""  Mobil Oil Corp. v. Bransford, 648 So. 2d 119, 120 (Fla.  1995). Here, the Complaint alleges Wyndham was in an  agency relationship with Rist during the relevant time  period. (Doc. #1, ¶ 110.) The Complaint further [**19]   asserts that in a variety of ways Wyndham exercised  control over the means and methods of how Rist  conducted business, such as by profit sharing,  standardized training, standardized rules of operation,  regular inspection, and price fixing. (Id. ¶ 112.) The  Court finds such allegations sufficient to support a  plausible inference of an agency relationship. See S.Y.,  476 F. Supp. 3d at 1258; A.B., 455 F. Supp. 3d at 195- 97; Doe S.W., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL  1244192, *7; H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019  WL 6682152, *6; M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 972.             [*1188]  Because the allegations in the Complaint are  sufficient to state a claim under section 1595 of the  TVPRA, the Court denies Wyndham's motion for  dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). (2) Florida RICO Violation Count Two of the Complaint asserts a claim against  both defendants under Florida's civil RICO statute,  section 772.104, Florida Statutes. (Doc. #1, p. 35.) To  state a claim under the statute, plaintiff must allege  plausible facts showing ""(1) conduct or participation in  an enterprise through (2) a pattern of [criminal] activity.""  Horace-Manasse v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 521 Fed.  App'x 782, 784 (11th Cir. 2013) (quoting Lugo v. State,  845 So. 2d 74, 97 (Fla. 2003)). Each of the motions argue plaintiff has insufficiently pled  the enterprise element of her claim. (Doc. #13, pp. 10- 13; Doc. #14, pp. 17-18.) Florida's RICO statute defines  enterprise to include a ""group of individuals associated  in fact although not a legal entity."" § 772.102(3), Fla.  Stat. ""[A]n association-in-fact enterprise is simply a  continuing [**20]  unit that functions with a common  purpose."" Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 948,  129 S. Ct. 2237, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1265 (2009). To  sufficiently plead such an enterprise, ""a plaintiff must  allege that a group of persons shares three structural                          521 F. Supp. 3d 1173, *1187; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32194, **18 Page 8 of 14 features: (1) a purpose, (2) relationships among those  associated with the enterprise, and (3) longevity  sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the  enterprise's purpose."" Cisneros v. Petland, Inc., 972  F.3d 1204, 1211 (11th Cir. 2020) (marks and citations  omitted). The motions argue the Complaint fails to  sufficiently allege a ""common purpose"" among the  defendants. (Doc. #13, pp. 10-13; Doc. #14, pp. 17-18.) ""The purpose prong contemplates 'a common purpose  of engaging in a course of conduct' among the  enterprise's alleged participants."" Cisneros, 972 F.3d at  1211 (quoting United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576,  583, 101 S. Ct. 2524, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1981)). ""An  abstract common purpose, such as a generally shared  interest in making money, will not suffice. Rather, where  the participants' ultimate purpose is to make money for  themselves, a RICO plaintiff must plausibly allege that  the participants shared the purpose of enriching  themselves through a particular criminal course of  conduct."" Id. (citations omitted). Here, the Complaint alleges Rist and Wyndham  ""associated with each other and/or the Plaintiff S.Y.'s  sex traffickers for the common purpose of profiting off  an established sex trafficking [**21]  scheme."" (Doc.  #1, ¶ 161.) Plaintiff asserts this ""association-in-fact""  constitutes an ""enterprise"" under Florida's RICO statute,  and that the defendants conducted or participated in  their enterprises through a pattern of criminal activity,  ""related by their common purpose to profit off an  institutionalized sex trafficking scheme."" (Id. ¶¶ 161- 62.) The Court finds these allegations sufficient to allege  the defendants ""shared the purpose of enriching  themselves through a particular criminal course of  conduct."" Cisneros, 972 F.3d at 1211; see also United   [*1189]  States v. Church, 955 F.2d 688, 697-98 (11th  Cir. 1992) (noting that ""an association's devotion to  'making money from repeated criminal activity' . . .  demonstrates an enterprise's 'common purpose of  engaging in a course of conduct'"" (citations omitted));  Burgese v. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc.,  101 F. Supp. 3d 414, 424 (D. N.J. 2015) (on motion to  dismiss Florida RICO claim, court found that ""Plaintiff's  Amended Complaint can be read to allege a 'common  purpose' of furthering an institutionalized prostitution  scheme to increase profits for the participants,"" and that  ""[t]hese allegations, though thin, are sufficient for  purposes of this motion""). Each of the motions also argues the Complaint fails to  sufficiently plead the ""pattern of criminal activity""  element. (Doc. #13, pp. 13-14; Doc. #14, pp. [**22]  18- 19.) As previously stated, ""[i]n order to state a civil  cause of action under the Florida RICO Act, a plaintiff  must allege a pattern of criminal activity."" Arthur v. JP  Morgan Chase Bank, NA, 569 Fed. App'x 669, 682  (11th Cir. 2014) (citing §§ 772.103-104, Fla. Stat.). The  statute's definition of ""criminal activity"" provides ""that a  particular state law crime can serve as the predicate act  for a RICO claim if it is 'chargeable by indictment or  information' and falls within a series of specified  provisions."" Id. (citing § 772.102(1)(a), Fla. Stat.). ""In  order to establish a pattern of criminal activity, the  plaintiff must allege two or more criminal acts 'that have  the same or similar intents, results, accomplices,  victims, or methods of commission' that occurred within  a five-year time span."" Id. at 680 (citing § 772.102(4),  Fla. Stat.). As noted by Wyndham (Doc. #14, p. 19), plaintiff's  Florida RICO claim is predicated on the commission of  human trafficking crimes in violation of section 787.06,  Florida Statutes. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 163, 165); see also §  772.102(1)(a)15., Fla. Stat. (listing ""human trafficking""  under Chapter 787 among the types of ""criminal activity""  covered by the Florida RICO statute). This provision  provides various punishments for ""[a]ny person who  knowingly, or in reckless disregard of the facts, engages  in human trafficking, or attempts to engage in human  trafficking, [**23]  or benefits financially by receiving  anything of value from participation in a venture that has  subjected a person to human trafficking."" § 787.06(3),  Fla. Stat. Given the similarity between this language and  the TVPRA's civil liability provision, Wyndham argues  the Florida RICO claim fails ""for the same reasons that  Plaintiff failed to state a TVPRA claim."" (Doc. #14, p.  19.) The Court has, however, determined plaintiff's  TVPRA claim is sufficiently pled, and therefore rejects  Wyndham's argument as to the Florida RICO claim. Rist argues the RICO claim fails to allege a pattern of  criminal activity because the Complaint ""impermissibly  groups"" the defendants together, and therefore ""[i]t is  impossible to discern if Rist Properties committed two or  more predicate acts."" (Doc. #13, p. 13.) The Court  disagrees.  The  Complaint  alleges  plaintiff  was  trafficked on a ""regular, consistent and/or repeated  basis"" at various hotels in Naples, Florida, and at the  Ramada Hotel from approximately 2015 to February  2016. (Doc. #1, ¶ 84.) The Complaint describes how the  sex trafficking occurred at the Ramada Hotel and the  ""routine conduct"" taking place as a result, as well as  alleges  Rist's  employees  participated  in  the  trafficking, [**24]  made promises to the traffickers not  to interfere with it, and knowingly turned a blind eye to it.  521 F. Supp. 3d 1173, *1188; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32194, **20 Page 9 of 14 (Id. ¶¶ 88, 89, 91, 96, 233, 235.) Viewing the allegations  in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the Court finds this  sufficient to allege two or more predicate acts within the  applicable timeframe.  [*1190]  Finally, Rist argues the Complaint contains  insufficient allegations regarding causation. (Doc. #13,  pp. 14-15.) Under the Florida RICO statute, a plaintiff  must demonstrate that their injuries were proximately  caused by the RICO violations. See Bortell v. White  Mountains Ins. Grp., Ltd., 2 So. 3d 1041, 1047 (Fla. 4th  DCA 2009). ""A wrongful act is a proximate cause if it is  a substantive factor in the sequence of responsible  causation."" Green Leaf Nursery v. E.I. DuPont De  Nemours & Co., 341 F.3d 1292, 1307 (11th Cir. 2003)  (marks and citation omitted). Furthermore, a plaintiff  ""must show a 'direct relation between the injury asserted  and the injurious conduct alleged.'"" Id. (quoting Holmes  v. Sec. Inv'r Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268, 112 S. Ct.  1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1992)). ""Indirect harm is  insufficient to sustain a cause of action under the RICO  statutes."" Bortell, 2 So. 3d at 1047; see also O'Malley,  599 So. 2d at 1000 (""[I]ndirect injuries, that is, injuries  sustained not as a direct result of predicate acts . . . will  not allow recovery under Florida RICO.""). Rist argues that the Complaint contains no plausible  allegations that it engaged in any conduct that was the  proximate cause of plaintiff's [**25]  alleged injuries.  (Doc. #13, p. 14.) Rist also notes that the Complaint ""is  void of any allegation that that [sic] Rist Properties had  specific knowledge of Plaintiff."" (Id.) Plaintiff responds  that she has sufficiently pled proximate cause and  consequential damages by alleging she ""was at the  Ramada Inn as part of the sexual trafficking scheme  and her injuries were caused by and in furtherance of  the sexual trafficking scheme."" (Doc. #32, p. 16.)  Having reviewed the allegations in the Complaint, the  Court agrees with plaintiff.              The Complaint alleges each of defendants ""was on  notice of repeated incidents of sex trafficking occurring  on their hotel premises,"" and yet ""failed to take the  necessary actions to prevent sex trafficking from  taking place."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 60.) The Complaint also  alleges numerous ways in which these defendants could  have identified and prevented the sex trafficking from  occurring. (Id. ¶¶ 62-77.) Finally, the Complaint alleges  the ""acts and omissions of the Ramada Defendants  served to support, facilitate, harbor, and otherwise  further the traffickers' sale and victimization"" of plaintiff  ""for commercial sexual exploitation by repeatedly  renting rooms [**26]  to people they knew or should  have known were engaged in sex trafficking."" (Id. ¶  125.) ""[B]y knowingly, or with reckless disregard,  repeatedly allowing sex trafficking to occur on their  premises between 2015 and 2016,"" the defendants'  ""acts have yielded consistent results and caused  economic, physical, and psychological injuries"" to  plaintiff. (Id. ¶¶ 164, 167.) The Court finds these allegations sufficient to plead a  ""direct relation between the injury asserted and the  injurious conduct alleged,"" Holmes, 503 U.S. at 268,  and  therefore  the  Complaint  adequately  pleads  proximate cause. See Burgese, 101 F. Supp. 3d at 422  (finding allegations of physical injury and mental   [*1191]  anguish ""cognizable under the Florida RICO  Act"" and sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss); cf.  Berber, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 234385, 2018 WL  10436236, *5 (""Because Plaintiffs' asserted injuries  arise from a set of actions entirely distinct form [sic] the  alleged predicate RICO violations, proximate cause is  lacking as a matter of law.""). (3) Premise Liability Count Three of the Complaint asserts a claim of  premise liability against each defendant. (Doc. #1, p.  37.) A premise liability claim is a form of negligence  action. ""The elements for negligence are duty, breach,  harm, and proximate cause; the additional elements for  a [**27]   claim  of  premises  liability  include  the  defendant's possession or control of the premises and  notice of the dangerous condition."" Lisanti v. City of Port  Richey, 787 So. 2d 36, 37 (Fla. 2d DCA 2001). Plaintiff  alleges the defendants owed her a variety of duties, that  they breached these duties, and that as a direct and  proximate result, she suffered bodily injury. (Doc. #1, ¶¶  177-191.) Plaintiff also alleges the defendants had   521 F. Supp. 3d 1173, *1189; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32194, **24 Page 10 of 14 actual or constructive knowledge of sex trafficking  occurring on the premises, that they knew or should  have known the risk of such criminal conduct taking  place would be unreasonably high without appropriate  precautions, and that they had actual or constructive  knowledge of the dangerous conditions plaintiff was in.  (Id. ¶¶ 182-84.) (a) Statute of Limitations Wyndham argues the premise liability claim should be  dismissed because it is barred by the relevant statute of  limitations. (Doc. #14, p. 22.) Under Florida law, the  statute of limitations for negligence claims is four years.  § 95.11(3)(a), Fla. Stat. A statute of limitations bar is ""an affirmative defense,  and . . . plaintiff[s] [are] not required to negate an  affirmative defense in [their] complaint."" La Grasta v.  First Union Sec., Inc., 358 F.3d 840, 845 (11th Cir.  2004) (citation omitted). ""A dismissal for failure to state  a claim on statute of limitations grounds [**28]  is  appropriate only if it is apparent from the face of the  complaint that the claim is time-barred."" United States  ex rel. Hunt v. Cochise Consultancy, Inc., 887 F.3d  1081, 1085 (11th Cir. 2018) (marks and citation  omitted). Plaintiff alleges the sex trafficking occurred at the  Ramada Hotel ""[f]rom approximately 2015 to February  2016."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 84.) Wyndham argues that because  the Complaint was filed in August 2020, the premise  liability claim is time barred. (Doc. #14, p. 22.) ""Under Florida law, the statute of limitations begins to  run when the cause of action accrues."" Carnival Corp. v.  Rolls-Royce PLC, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107141, 2009  WL 3861482, *5 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 17, 2009) (citing §  95.031, Fla. Stat.). ""A cause of action accrues when the  last element constituting the cause of action occurs."" §  95.031(1), Fla. Stat. ""Under the continuing tort doctrine,  the cause of action accrues when the tortious conduct  ceases."" Effs v. Sony Pictures Home Entm't, Inc., 197  So. 3d 1243, 1244 (Fla. 3d DCA 2016) (emphasis and  citation omitted). ""A continuing tort is established by  continual tortious acts, not by continual harmful effects  from an original, completed act."" Id. at 1245 (marks,  emphasis, and citation omitted). Here, plaintiff alleges she was a repeat victim of sex  trafficking at the Ramada Hotel between 2015 and  February 2016. The Court finds such allegations  sufficient to invoke the continuing tort doctrine. See Nat'l  Sourcing, Inc. v. Bracciale, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  199436, 2018 WL 6172430, *2 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 26,  2018) (finding allegation that a defendant's  [*1192]   actions ""continued to this day"" inferred continuous  tortious [**29]  conduct, thereby making it plausible for  the plaintiffs to assert the continuing tort doctrine as a  basis to toll the statute of limitations). Accordingly, the  Court finds that plaintiff's premise liability claim did not  accrue until February 2016, and therefore she had until  February 2020 to file a complaint asserting premises  liability. Plaintiff met this deadline by filing her First Amended  Complaint against Wyndham on December 31, 2019.  S.Y. et al v. Naples Hotel Co. et al, Case No. 2:20-cv- 118 (Doc. #3). While the Court determined severance of  the parties was appropriate in the original action, S.Y.,  476 F. Supp. 3d at 1259, and this Complaint was filed in  August 2020, it appears that the December 2019 date is  applicable for statute of limitations purposes under the  relation-back provisions of Rule 15(c) of the Federal  Rules of Civil Procedure. Relation back is a legal fiction employed to salvage  claims that would otherwise be unjustly barred by a  limitations provision. See McCurdy v. United States,  264 U.S. 484, 487, 44 S.Ct. 345, 346, 68 L.Ed. 801  (1924); Moore v. Baker, 989 F.2d 1129, 1131 (11th  Cir. 1993). Under Rule 15, a claim in an amended  complaint relates back to the filing date of the  original complaint if it ""asserts a claim or defense  that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or  occurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in  the original pleading."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B).  When the facts in the original [**30]  complaint do  not put the defendant ""on notice that the new claims  of negligence might be asserted,"" but the new  claims instead ""involve[ ] separate and distinct  conduct,"" such that the plaintiff would have to prove  ""completely different facts"" than required to recover  on the claims in the original complaint, the new  claims do not relate back. Moore, 989 F.2d at 1132. Caron v. NCL (Bahamas), Ltd., 910 F.3d 1359, 1368  (11th Cir. 2018). Accordingly, since it is not apparent  from the face of the Complaint that the claim is time- barred, dismissal based upon the statute of limitations  affirmative defense is not appropriate. For the same reasons, the Court rejects Wyndham's  argument that plaintiff's negligent hiring, supervision,  and retention claim is also barred by the four-year  statute of limitations. (Doc. #14, p. 22.) 521 F. Supp. 3d 1173, *1191; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32194, **27 Page 11 of 14 (b) Failure to State a Claim Both defendants argue the premise liability claim is  insufficiently pled. In seeking to have the claim  dismissed, Rist first challenges the duty element of the  claim. (Doc. #13, pp. 15-16.) Under Florida law, a  property owner generally owes two duties to an invitee: (1) the duty to use reasonable care in maintaining  the property in a reasonably safe condition; and (2)  the duty to warn of latent or concealed dangers  which are or should [**31]  be known to the owner  and which are unknown to the invitee and cannot  be discovered through the exercise of due care. Dampier v. Morgan Tire & Auto, LLC, 82 So. 3d 204,  206 (5th DCA 2012). Rist argues that it did not have a  duty to warn plaintiff of the danger of sex trafficking  because plaintiff was aware of the trafficking herself.  (Doc. #13, p. 16); see also Emmons v. Baptist Hosp.,  478 So. 2d 440, 442 (Fla. 1st DCA 1985) (""A  prerequisite to the imposition upon the landowner of a  duty to warn is that the defendant's knowledge of the  danger must be superior to that of the business  invitee.""). However, plaintiff's premise liability claim is  not based upon a duty to warn, but rather a duty to  maintain the property in a reasonably  [*1193]  safe  condition. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 177-81.) Accordingly, Rist's  argument as it relates to a duty to warn is irrelevant.  See Dampier, 82 So. 3d at 206 (""The open and obvious  nature of a hazard may discharge a landowner's duty to  warn, but it does not discharge the landowner's duty to  maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition.""). Alternatively, Wyndham first argues the premise liability  claim fails because it does not allege that Wyndham  possessed or controlled the Ramada Hotel. (Doc. #14,  pp. 19-20.) The Court disagrees. As noted, a premise  liability claim requires a defendant possess or control  the premises [**32]  at issue. Lisanti, 787 So. 2d at 37.  Here, the Complaint alleges Wyndham and Rist were  the  ""owners,  operators,  managers,  supervisors,  controllers and innkeepers"" of the Ramada Hotel, and  that Wyndham exercised control over the means and  methods of how Rist conducted business at the hotel.  (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 28, 112.) While Wyndham may dispute  these allegations, the Court must accept them as true at  this stage of the proceedings and finds them sufficient to  allege Wyndham had sufficient control of the Ramada  Hotel for premise liability purposes. Next, Rist and Wyndham both argue there could be no  duty to protect plaintiff from the criminal conduct of third  parties because such conduct was not foreseeable.  (Doc. #13, pp. 17-18; Doc. #14, p. 20.) The Court  disagrees with this argument as well. ""Under Florida law, a business owes invitees a duty to  use due care to maintain its premises in a reasonably  safe condition. This includes the duty to protect  customers from criminal attacks that are reasonably  foreseeable."" Banosmoreno v. Walgreen Co., 299 Fed.  App'x 912, 913 (11th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). Foreseeability can be shown by two alternative  means. First, a plaintiff may demonstrate that a  proprietor knew or should have known of a  dangerous condition on his premises that was  likely [**33]  to cause harm to a patron. Second, a  plaintiff can show that a proprietor knew or should  have known of the dangerous propensities of a  particular patron. Id. (marks, citations, and footnote omitted). Such  knowledge must only be pled generally. Fed. R. Civ. P.  9(b). The Complaint contains sufficient allegations that sex  trafficking was occurring at the Ramada Hotel and that  Rist and Wyndham knew or should have known of it.  (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 55-61, 96-105, 155.) The Complaint also  contains sufficient allegations to support a claim of an  agency relationship between Wyndham and Rist, and  any factual challenge to such a relationship is  premature. See Cain, 994 F. Supp. 2d at 1253; Mobil Oil  Corp., 648 So. 2d at 120. Accordingly, the Court finds  the allegations in the Complaint are sufficient to satisfy  the notice pleading requirements. Finally, Rist argues the premise liability claim fails  because ""Plaintiff cannot establish a causal link  between her purported injuries and Rist Properties'  purported negligence."" (Doc. #13, p. 18.) The Court  disagrees. As noted, the Complaint alleges Rist was on  notice of the sex trafficking occurring at the Ramada  Hotel and not only failed to prevent it, but knowingly  turned a blind eye to it in exchange for increased profits.  The Complaint also [**34]  alleges that as a result of  Rist's actions, plaintiff suffered various injuries and  damages. Contrary to Rist's suggestion that plaintiff's  injuries were the result of a ""freakish and improbable  chain of events,"" (Doc. #13, p. 18), the Court finds the  Complaint  sufficiently  alleges  proximate  cause.  Accordingly, the Court denies Rist  [*1194]  and  Wyndham's request to dismiss the claim as insufficiently  pled. 521 F. Supp. 3d 1173, *1192; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32194, **30 Page 12 of 14 (4) Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention Count Four of the Complaint asserts a claim of negligent  hiring,  supervision,  and  retention  against  each  defendant. (Doc. #1, p. 41.) ""To state a claim under  Florida law for negligent hiring, supervision and/or  retention, a plaintiff must establish that the employer  owed a legal duty to the plaintiff to exercise reasonable  care in hiring and retaining safe and competent  employees."" Clary v. Armor Corr. Health Servs., Inc.,  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15633, 2014 WL 505126, *4  (M.D. Fla. Feb. 7, 2014) (citations omitted). ""Florida law  also holds employers liable for reasonably foreseeable  damages resulting from the negligent training of its  employees and agents."" Id. (citing Lewis v. City of St.  Petersburg, 260 F.3d 1260, 1265 (11th Cir. 2001)). ""For  an employer to owe a plaintiff a duty, the plaintiff must  be in the zone of risk that was reasonably foreseeable  to the employer."" Id. (citation omitted). Accordingly, to state a claim, [**35]  the plaintiff  must allege facts that would establish a nexus  between  the  plaintiff  and  the  tortfeasor's  employment from which a legal duty would flow  from the defendant-employer to the plaintiff. The  plaintiff must then establish that the defendant- employer breached that duty and that the breach  caused him damage. Id. (citations omitted). The Complaint alleges each Ramada Hotel defendant  was in control of the hiring, instructing, training,  supervising, and terminating of the hotel employees,  and that each defendant had a duty to make an  appropriate investigation of the employees. (Doc. #1, ¶¶  198-99.) The Complaint further alleges that the  defendants knew or should have known that hotel  employees were ""allowing criminals to rent rooms for  prostitution and drug dealing,"" ""failing to either identify  and/or  report  the  human  sex  trafficking  and  foreseeable harm"" of plaintiff, and ""failing to refuse  continued lodging services to human sex traffickers.""  (Id. ¶¶ 201-03.) The Complaint concludes that the  defendants were negligent in their hiring, employment,  supervision, and termination decisions regarding the  employees, and that the sex trafficking of plaintiff was  a foreseeable and direct [**36]  result. (Id. ¶¶ 204-08.) Each of the motions seeks dismissal of the negligent  hiring, supervision, and retention claim based on  pleading deficiencies. Rist and Wyndham both argue  that the claim fails because the Complaint lacks  sufficient factual allegations that either defendant knew  or should have known of any unfit employees. (Doc.  #13, p. 20; Doc. #14, pp. 21-22); see also Bright v. City  of Tampa, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 218868, 2017 WL  5248450, *8 (M.D. Fla. May 17, 2017) (""When an  employer fails to take a corrective action against an  employee because the employer had no notice of  problems with the employee's fitness, the employer is  not liable under Florida law for negligent supervision or  retention.""). The Court disagrees. The Complaint  sufficiently alleges facts suggesting sex trafficking was  occurring at the hotel, that the employees knew of it and  failed to prevent it, and that due to their control over the  employees, each defendant knew or should have known  of it. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 88-108, 195-203.) The Court finds  such allegations sufficient at this stage of the  proceedings. Wyndham also argues the claim should be dismissed  because the Complaint does not plausibly allege that  Wyndham hired or employed any of the employees at  issue.  (Doc.  #14,  p.  22.)  The  Court  is  not  persuaded, [**37]  as it has determined the Complaint's  allegations of an agency relationship  [*1195]  between  Wyndham and Rist are sufficient. Accordingly, the  Court denies the request to dismiss the negligent hiring,  supervision, and retention claim. (5) Negligent Rescue Count Five of the Complaint asserts a claim of negligent  rescue against Rist. (Doc. #1, p. 44.) The Complaint  alleges Rist, as the owner and operator of the Ramada  Hotel, had a duty to keep the premises safe and prevent  foreseeable criminal activity, as well as a duty ""to make  safe a dangerous condition at the Ramada Hotel and to  rescue their [sic] hotel guests, specifically Plaintiff S.Y.,                521 F. Supp. 3d 1173, *1194; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32194, **34 Page 13 of 14 from the peril they [sic] created."" (Id. ¶¶ 212, 215, 221.)  The Complaint alleges that by various acts and  omissions, Rist breached these duties and that the  continuous sex trafficking of plaintiff was the direct and  foreseeable result. (Id. ¶¶ 217-19, 223-24, 226.) Rist  argues the negligent rescue claim should be dismissed  because it is insufficiently pled. (Doc. #13, pp. 21-22.) There is no common law duty to rescue a stranger.  Estate of Ferguson v. Mascara, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  157824, 2010 WL 11558195, *2 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 7,  2010) (citing Bradberry v. Pinellas Cty., 789 F.2d 1513,  1516 (11th Cir. 1986)). ""A well-established exception to  this rule, however, provides that an innkeeper is 'under  an ordinary duty of care to [**38]  [a guest] after he  knows or has reason to know the [guest] is ill or injured.""  De La Flor v. Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co., L.L.C, 2013 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 5403, 2013 WL 148401, *3 (S.D. Fla. Jan.  14, 2013) (quoting L.A. Fitness, Int'l, LLC v. Mayer, 980  So. 2d 550, 557 (Fla. 4th DCA 2008)); see also  Abramson v. Ritz Carlton Hotel Co., LLC, 480 Fed.  App'x 158, 161 (3d Cir. 2012) (""Generally, there is no  duty to affirmatively assist an injured person unless a  special relationship, such as that between an innkeeper  and its guests, exists between the parties."" (citation  omitted)). Rist argues the negligent rescue claim should be  dismissed because it is insufficiently pled under the  ""rescue doctrine."" (Doc. #13, pp. 21-22.) Under Florida  law, the rescue doctrine holds a tortfeasor liable for  injuries to a third party who is hurt in attempting to  rescue the direct victim of the tortfeasor. Zivojinovich v.  Barner, 525 F.3d 1059, 1070 (11th Cir. 2008) (citation  omitted). ""The basic precept of this doctrine 'is that the  person who has created a situation of peril for another  will be held in law to have caused peril not only to the  victim, but also to his rescuer, and thereby to have  caused any injury suffered by the rescuer in the rescue  attempt.'"" Menendez v. W. Gables Rehab. Hosp., LLC,  123 So. 3d 1178, 1181 (Fla. 3d DCA 2013) (quoting  N.H. Ins. Co. v. Oliver, 730 So. 2d 700, 702 (Fla. 4th  DCA 1999)). As plaintiff correctly argues in response (Doc. #32, p.  21), the rescue doctrine is not implicated by plaintiff's  negligent rescue claim. See Krajcsik v. Ramsey, 2017  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143003, 2017 WL 3868560, *2 n.4 (D.  Md. Sept. 5, 2017) (""The rescue doctrine is related to,  but separate from, the affirmative duty to rescue   [*1196]   an  imperiled  party  that  the  courts  impose [**39]  on persons in some situations."").  Accordingly, because the rescue doctrine is not  applicable, Rist's request for dismissal based on the  doctrine is denied. (6) Aiding and Abetting, Harboring, Confining,  Coercion and Criminal Enterprise Finally, Count Six of the Complaint asserts a claim of  aiding and abetting against Rist. (Doc. #1, p. 46.) The  Complaint accuses Rist of ""aiding and abetting unlawful  activity including unlawful confinement, imprisonment,  assault and battery by [plaintiff's] sex traffickers and  'Johns.'"" (Id. ¶ 227.) Rist argues the claim must be  dismissed because (1) it asserts Risk ""aided and  abetted the criminal act of sex trafficking in violation of  the TVPRA,"" and (2) the TVPRA does not provide a  cause of action for aiding and abetting. (Doc. #13, pp.  22-23.) Having reviewed the allegations in the  Complaint and the relevant case law, the Court finds  Rist is misinterpreting the claim. Florida courts have recognized aiding and abetting the  commission of a tort as a standalone claim. See Gilison  v. Flagler Bank, 303 So. 3d 999, 1002 (Fla. 4th DCA  2020) (aiding and abetting fraud); MP, LLC v. Sterling  Holding, LLC, 231 So. 3d 517, 527 (Fla. 3d DCA 2017)  (aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty). This Court  has previously listed the following elements that must be  alleged ""to state a claim for aiding [**40]  and abetting a  common law tort"" under Florida law: ""(1) an underlying  violation on the part of the primary wrongdoer; (2)  knowledge of the underlying violation by the alleged  aider and abetter [sic]; and (3) the rendering of  substantial assistance in committing the wrongdoing by  the alleged aider and abettor."" Angell v. Allergan Sales,  LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142768, 2019 WL 3958262,  *8 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 22, 2019); see also Lawrence v. Bank  of Am., N.A., 455 Fed. App'x 904, 906 (11th Cir. 2012)  (applying the above elements to three Florida tort  claims). These cases demonstrate Florida recognizes a  common-law claim of aiding and abetting tortious  conduct. Here, the Complaint alleges Rist aided and abetted  plaintiff's  unlawful  harboring,  confinement,         521 F. Supp. 3d 1173, *1195; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32194, **37 Page 14 of 14 imprisonment, assault and battery, and to the extent the  claim alleges Rist has actual knowledge, the Court  finds it sufficient to state a claim. Accordingly, the Court  denies Rist's request for dismissal. D. More Definite Statement Finally, Rist asserts that the Complaint is vague,  ambiguous, and fails to provide sufficient information to  allow Rist to formulate a response. (Doc. #13, p. 23.)  Rist requests the Court exercise its discretion and order  plaintiff provide a more definite statement pursuant to  Rule 12(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Id.) Rule 12(e) provides that ""[a] party may move for a more  definite statement of a pleading to which a responsive  pleading [**41]  is allowed but which is so vague or  ambiguous  [*1197]  that the party cannot reasonably  prepare a response."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e); see also  Ramirez v. F.B.I., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132271, 2010  WL 5162024, *2 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 14, 2010) (""A Rule  12(e) motion is appropriate if the pleading is so vague or  ambiguous that the opposing party cannot respond,  even with a simple denial, in good faith, without  prejudice to [itself]."" (marks and citation omitted)). The Court finds the Complaint is not ""so vague or  ambiguous"" that Rist cannot reasonably prepare a  response, and therefore denies the request for a more  definite statement under Rule 12(e). See Ramirez, 2010  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132271, 2010 WL 5162024, *2 (""The  [Rule 12(e)] motion is intended to provide a remedy for  an unintelligible pleading, rather than a vehicle for  obtaining greater detail."" (citation omitted)); Eye Care  Int'l, Inc. v. Underhill, 92 F. Supp. 2d 1310, 1316 (M.D.  Fla. 2000) (noting that ""motions for a more definite  statement are not favored in light of the liberal discovery  practice,"" and that ""a motion for more definite statement  is not to be used as a substitute for discovery""); cf.  LeBlanc v. LVNV Funding, LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  99983, 2019 WL 2492124, *1 (M.D. Fla. June 14, 2019)  (granting motion for more definite statement, finding ""the  Complaint contains no facts"" and was ""not sufficiently  specific to place defendant on notice of the claims  against it"").          Accordingly, it is now ORDERED: 1. Defendant Rist Properties, LLC's Motion to  Dismiss, Motion to Strike, or For a More Definite  Statement and Memorandum [**42]  of Law in  Support Thereof (Doc. #13) is DENIED. 2. Defendant Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.'s  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint (Doc. #14) is  DENIED. DONE AND ORDERED at Fort Myers, Florida, this  22nd day of February, 2021. /s/ John E.

S.Y. v. Choice Hotels,"OPINION AND ORDER This matter comes before the Court on review of  defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc.'s Motion to  Dismiss Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint with  Prejudice (Doc. #19) filed on October 8, 2020, and  defendant R&M Real Estate Company, Inc.'s Motion to  Dismiss  with  Prejudice  Plaintiff's  Complaint  and  Incorporated Memorandum [*2]  of Law (Doc. #21) filed  on October 12, 2020. Plaintiff filed an Opposition (Doc.  #42) and a Memorandum in Opposition (Doc. #43) on  November 5, 2020, to which the defendants each filed a  Reply (Doc. #47; Doc. #48) on November 19, 2020. For  the reasons set forth below, the motions are denied. I. The origins of this case began on October 30, 2019,  when plaintiff and another alleged victim of sex  trafficking filed a case in the Circuit Court of the  Twentieth Judicial Circuit in and for Collier County,  Florida. See S.Y. et al v. Naples Hotel Co. et al, Case  No. 2:20-cv-118 (Doc. #1, p. 3). On December 31, 2019,  the plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint which  asserted ten claims against over forty defendants. Id. at  (Doc. #1, pp. 2-4). The case was removed to federal  court in February 2020. Id. at (Doc. #1). On April 15,  2020, the plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint.  Id. at (Doc. #85). On August 5, 2020, the undersigned  denied various motions to dismiss, but determined  severance of the parties was appropriate. S.Y. v. Naples  Hotel Co., 476 F. Supp. 3d 1251, 1258-59 (M.D. Fla.  2020). Following the Court's severance order, plaintiff  and the other alleged victim filed nearly thirty new  Page 2 of 15 actions against various defendants, including this case. The Complaint [*3]  (Doc. #1) in this case was filed on  August 19, 2020, and alleges that plaintiff S.Y., a  resident of Collier County, Florida, was a victim of  continuous sex trafficking at a certain Comfort Inn &  Executives Suites (the Comfort Inn Hotel) in Naples,  Florida between 2013 and February 2016. (Id. ¶¶ 2, 13,  22-24.) The Complaint alleges that during this time  period the Comfort Inn Hotel was owned and operated  by defendant R&M Real Estate Company, Inc. (R&M) as  a franchisee of defendant Choice Hotels International,  Inc. (Choice). (Id. ¶¶ 25-28, 49.) The Complaint alleges the following six claims: (1)  violation  of  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), 18 U.S.C. §  1595; (2) violation of the Florida RICO statute, §  772.104, Florida Statutes; (3) premise liability; (4)  negligent hiring, supervision, and retention; (5) negligent  rescue; and (6) aiding and abetting, harboring,  confining, coercion, and criminal enterprise. (Id. pp. 33- 49.) Counts One through Four are asserted against  each defendant, while Counts Five and Six are asserted  against R&M. (Id.) II. The motions to dismiss raise numerous arguments as to  why the Complaint as whole, and each individual claim,  should be dismissed. The Court will address each of  these [*4]  arguments in turn. A. Shotgun Pleading The Complaint identifies the defendants collectively as  the ""Comfort Inn Defendants."" (Doc. #1, p. 1  introductory paragraph.) Both motions argue that  because the Complaint groups them together, it should  be dismissed as a shotgun pleading. (Doc. #19, pp. 12- 13; Doc. #21, p. 5.) One way in which a complaint may constitute an  impermissible shotgun pleading is if it ""assert[s] multiple  claims against multiple defendants without specifying  which of the defendants are responsible for which acts      or omissions, or which of the defendants the claim is  brought against."" Weiland v. Palm Beach Cty. Sheriff's  Office, 792 F.3d 1313, 1323 (11th Cir. 2015); see also  Barmapov v. Amuial, 986 F.3d 1321, 1324-25 (11th Cir.  2021). Such a pleading fails ""to give the defendants  adequate notice of the claims against them and the  grounds upon which each claim rests,"" Weiland, 792  F.3d at 1323, and violates the requirement that a  plaintiff provide ""a short and plain statement of the  claim,"" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The Complaint does indeed repeatedly refer to the  defendants collectively as the ""Comfort Inn Defendants.""  The failure to specify a particular defendant is not fatal,  however, when ""[t]he complaint can be fairly read to  aver that all defendants are responsible for the alleged  conduct."" Kyle K. v. Chapman, 208 F.3d 940, 944 (11th  Cir. 2000). The Complaint typically (but not always)  alleges that ""each [*5]  and every"" such defendant was  involved in the activity described in the particular  paragraph of the Complaint. A fair reading of the  Complaint is that each of these defendants was involved  in the identified conduct attributed to the ""Comfort Inn  Defendants."" While defendants may disagree that such  allegations are accurate, that dispute is for another day.  The group allegations do not fail to state a claim, Auto.  Alignment & Body Serv., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co., 953 F.3d 707, 732-33 (11th Cir. 2020), and the  Complaint does not constitute a shotgun pleading. B. Failure to State a Claim The motions argue certain claims should be dismissed  due to plaintiff's failure to state a claim upon which relief  may be granted. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2)                       2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *2 Page 3 of 15 requires that a complaint contain a ""short and plain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is  entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This obligation  ""requires more than labels and conclusions, and a  formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action  will not do."" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,  555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation  omitted). To survive dismissal, the factual allegations  must be ""plausible"" and ""must be enough to raise a right  to relief above the speculative level."" Id. at 555; see also  Edwards v. Prime Inc., 602 F.3d 1276, 1291 (11th Cir.  2010). This requires ""more than an unadorned, the- defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation."" Ashcroft  v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed.  2d 868 (2009) (citations omitted). In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) [*6]  motion to dismiss, the  Court must accept all factual allegations in a complaint  as true and take them in the light most favorable to the  plaintiff, Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct.  2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal  conclusions without adequate factual support are  entitled to no assumption of truth,"" Mamani v. Berzaín,  654 F.3d 1148, 1153 (11th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted).  ""Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of  action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do  not suffice."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Factual allegations  that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability fall  short of being facially plausible. Chaparro v. Carnival  Corp., 693 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir. 2012) (citations  omitted). Thus, the Court engages in a two-step  approach: ""When there are well-pleaded factual  allegations, a court should assume their veracity and  then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an  entitlement to relief."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. (1) Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization  Act Both motions challenge the one federal claim, the  alleged violation of the TVPRA set forth in Count One.  The TVPRA provides a civil remedy to victims of certain  types of human trafficking. The civil remedy portion of  the Act provides: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). The phrase ""a violation of this  chapter"" refers to Chapter 77 of Title 18 of the United  States Code. The only violation of Chapter 77 relevant  to this case is contained in 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a), which  provides in relevant part: (a) Whoever knowingly - (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign  commerce . . . recruits, entices, harbors,  transports, provides, [*7]  obtains, advertises,  maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any means  a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything  of value, from participation in a venture which  has engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). To state a section 1595(a) claim in  this case, plaintiff must plausibly allege that she was a  victim of a criminal offense under section 1591(a), and  then must plausibly allege that defendant (1)""knowingly  benefit[ted] financially or by receiving anything of value,""  (2) from participation in a venture, (3) which defendant  ""knew or should have known has engaged in"" sex  trafficking under section 1591(a). S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d  at 1255-56 (citing A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 455 F. Supp.  3d 171, 181 (E.D. Pa. 2020)). (a) Plausible Allegations Re: § 1591 Violation Choice first argues that plaintiff fails to allege an  underlying section 1591 violation by failing ""to set out  any facts describing any criminal [*8]  investigation,  indictment, prosecution, or conviction."" (Doc. #19, p.  15.) The Complaint alleges: 83. From approximately 2013 through February  2016, Plaintiff S.Y. was recruited to, enticed to,  solicited to, held at, harbored as captive at and/or  transported to various hotels in Naples, Florida by  her sex traffickers to engage in commercial sex  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *5 Page 4 of 15 acts at these hotels on a regular, consistent and/or  repeated basis. From approximately 2013 to 2014,  Plaintiff S.Y. was trafficked by an individual only  known to Plaintiff as Rambo, as well as other  traffickers at the Comfort Inn Hotel. Then from  approximately 2015 to February 2016, Plaintiff S.Y.  was trafficked by Gregory Hines (aka Bowlegs),  Keith Lewis, Anthony Barrata and others at the  Comfort Inn Hotel. (Doc. #1, ¶ 83.) There is no requirement that the sex  trafficker have been convicted criminally to support a  civil claim against defendants for knowingly financially  benefitting from the sex trafficking, and Choice  provides no legal support for this argument. Choice also argues that plaintiff has not alleged  coercion giving rise to an underlying violation of section  1591, asserting that plaintiff was free to meet the ""John""  in the lobby, and she could [*9]  walk the hallways  without confinement. (Doc. #19, pp. 16-17.) For purposes of § 1591, ""coercion"" is defined as (1)  ""threats of serious harm to or physical restraint  against any person;"" (2) ""any scheme, plan, or  pattern intended to cause a person to believe that  failure to perform an act would result in serious  harm to or physical restraint against any person""; or  (3) ""the abuse or threatened abuse of law or the  legal process."" Id. § 1591(e)(2). ""Serious harm,"" in  turn, is ""any harm, whether physical or nonphysical,  including psychological, financial, or reputational  harm, that is sufficiently serious, under all the  surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable  person of the same background and in the same  circumstances to perform or to continue performing  commercial sexual activity in order to avoid  incurring that harm."" Id. § 1591(e)(4). United States v. Williams, 714 F. App'x 917, 918 (11th  Cir. 2017). The allegations in the Complaint are more  than conclusory with regard to the threats of serious  harm or physical restraint, and do not only allege sexual  abuse and prostitution. (Doc. #19, pp. 16-17.) Some of  the relevant allegations are as follows: 57. At all material times, each and every Comfort       Inn Defendant, as owners, operators, managers,  supervisors,  controllers  and/or [*10]   entities  otherwise responsible for hotels, including the  Comfort Inn Hotel, knew or should have known that  traffickers were harboring, raping and assaulting  victims at their hotels, including the Comfort Inn  Hotel, and were forcing them to engage in ""in call""  services, wherein buyers (""Johns"") would come to  the hotels solely to purchase sex from these  victims, as well as ""out call"" services, wherein the  buyer would rent a hotel room and the trafficker  would deliver the victim to the buyer's room to  complete the sordid transaction. . . . 68. Each and every Comfort Inn Defendant,  individually and by and through their actual or  apparent agents, servants, franchisees, employees  and/or staff, were aware of and/or should have  been aware of a number of warning signs at their  hotels, including the Comfort Inn Hotel, that  indicated the presence of human trafficking,  including but not limited to: a. persons showing signs of malnourishment,  poor  hygiene,  fatigue,  sleep  deprivation,  untreated illness, injuries, and/or unusual  behavior; b. persons lacking freedom of movement or  being constantly monitored; c.  persons  having  no  control  over  or  possession of money or ID; d. persons dressing inappropriately [*11]  for  their age or having lower quality clothing  compared to others in their party; e. persons requesting room or housekeeping  services (additional towels, new linens, etc.),  but denying hotel staff entry into the room; f. the presence of multiple computers, cell  phones, pagers, credit card swipers, or other  technology in the room; g. persons extending stay with few or no  personal possessions in the room; h. excessive amounts of sex paraphernalia in  rooms (condoms, lubricant, lotion); i. the same person reserving multiple rooms; j. a room being rented hourly, less than a day,  or for an atypical extended stay; k. attempts of persons to sell items to or beg  from patrons or staff; l. cars in the parking lot regularly parked  backward, so the license plates are not visible; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *8 Page 5 of 15 m. loitering and solicitation of male patrons; n. individuals waiting at a table or bar and then  being picked up by a male (trafficker or  customer); o. persons asking staff or patrons for food or  money; and p. persons taking cash or receipts left on  tables. . . . 136. Plaintiff S.Y. was a hotel guest at the Comfort  Inn  Hotel  and  Plaintiff  was  seriously  and  permanently injured as a direct result of each and  every Comfort Inn Defendants' [*12]  acts and  omissions, in that each and every Comfort Inn  Defendant permitted, harbored and facilitated illegal  sex trafficking ventures to take place at the  Comfort Inn Hotel whereby the Plaintiff S.Y. was  routinely and continuously abused, battered, falsely  imprisoned, raped, beaten, starved, forcibly injected  with drugs and enslaved. 137. More specifically, at all material times, in the  quest for profits, the acts and omissions of each  and every Comfort Inn Defendant regarding the  Comfort Inn Hotel caused the Plaintiff to suffer: a. Forced labor; b. Forced confinement without safe means of  escape; c. Assault and fear; d. Sickness, dizziness and headaches; e. Cuts, lacerations, abrasions and other  physical harm; f. Mental anguish, humiliation, exploitation,  degradation and mental distress; g. Suffocation, battery and rape; h. Shock, fright and post-traumatic stress; i. Overdose and drug-induced dangers (the  Plaintiff suffered drug overdoses, drug-induced  actions which caused harm to themselves [sic],  physical deformities and scarfing [sic] from  actions of the ""Johns"" and drug usage); and j. Invasion of privacy and wrongful entry of  ""Johns."" (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 57, 68, 136-137.) The allegations are  not [*13]  ""simply a regurgitation of the statutes' wording  woven together with conclusory statements and a  generous use of 'and/or.'"" Kelsey v. Goldstar Est.  Buyers Corp., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37361, 2014 WL  1155253, at *6 (D. Or. Mar. 21, 2014). The motion will  be denied as plaintiff has stated plausible facts in  support of a section 1591 violation. (b) ""Participation"" in a ""Venture"" The defendants argue that the Complaint lacks well-pled  allegations that it participated in a ""venture,"" as required  by section 1595(a). (Doc. #19, p. 23; Doc. #21, pp. 6-9.)  Drawing on the definition of ""venture"" used in the  criminal portion of the statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(6) ,  R&M asserts that a ""venture"" requires two or more  individuals ""associated in fact."" (Doc. #21, p. 6.)  Borrowing  from  the  federal  RICO  definition  of  ""enterprise,"" the defendants argue that ""associated in  fact"" requires that persons must operate as a  ""continuing unit that functions with a common purpose.""  (Doc. #19, p. 23; Doc. #21, pp. 6-7.) R&M continues that  in the context of a TVPRA claim against a hotel  operator, the Complaint must ""at least"" allege a  ""continuous business relationship between the trafficker  and the hotels such that it would appear that the  trafficker and the hotels have established a pattern of  conduct or could be said to have a tacit agreement."" (Id.  p. 7) (citing M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.,  425 F. Supp. 3d 959, 970 (S.D. Ohio 2019)); see also  Doe v. Rickey Patel, LLC, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  195811, 2020 WL 6121939, *5 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 30,  2020) (""In [*14]  order to plead Defendants participated  in a venture, Plaintiff must allege facts from which the  Court could reasonably infer the hotels could be said to  have a tacit agreement with the trafficker."" (marks  omitted)).  R&M  concludes  that  ""a  commercial  transaction,"" such as the rental of a hotel room, ""does  not give rise to a reasonable inference that the  participants in such a transaction shared any common  purpose or otherwise 'associated in fact.'"" (Doc. #21, p.  7.) Similarly, Choice asserts that plaintiff has failed to  allege it associated in fact with the non-party traffickers.  (Doc. #19, p. 23.) Here, the Complaint alleges the defendants participated  in a venture ""by engaging in a pattern of acts and  omissions that were intended to support, facilitate,  harbor, and otherwise further the traffickers' sale and  victimization of the Plaintiff S.Y. for commercial sexual  exploitation by repeatedly renting rooms at Comfort Inn  Hotel to people"" the defendants ""knew or should have  known were engaged in sex trafficking."" (Doc. #1, ¶  160.) The Complaint also alleges why the defendants  should have been on notice of the sex trafficking and  how it failed to prevent it. (Id. ¶¶ 4-16, 54-82,     2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *11 Page 6 of 15 115.) [*15]  The Court finds the allegations in the  Complaint sufficient to allege participation in a venture  under section 1595(a). See Doe, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  195811, 2020 WL 6121939, *5 (""The Court finds it  sufficient  for  Plaintiff  to  plead  that  Defendants  participated in a venture by renting rooms to individuals  that knew or should have known were involved in a sex- trafficking  venture,  including  the  sex-trafficking  victim.""); M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 971 (""This Court finds  Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to show Defendants  'participated in a venture' under § 1595 by alleging that  Defendants rented rooms to people it knew or should  have known where [sic] engaged in sex trafficking.""). Choice and R&M also argue that ""participation"" in a  venture requires an allegation of an overt act in  furtherance of the venture, and that failure to prevent  sex trafficking is insufficient. (Doc. #19, pp. 18-19;  Doc. #21, pp. 7-8.) The Court is not convinced. S.Y.,  476 F. Supp. 3d at 1256 (""In the absence of any  controlling authority, the Court concludes that actual  'participation in the sex trafficking act itself' is not  required to state a claim under section 1595.  Accordingly, plaintiffs' failure to allege such actual  participation is not fatal to its section 1595 claim under  the TVPRA.""). The defendants have not identified any  controlling authority to [*16]  the contrary. (c) Knowingly Benefited From Participating in  Venture The motions next argue that the Complaint insufficiently  alleges the defendants knowingly benefitted from  participating in a venture that committed TVPRA crimes,  with knowledge of the causal relationship. (Doc. #19,  pp. 17-23; Doc. #21, p. 9.) R&M argues that the  allegation that it benefited generally from the operation  of the hotel is insufficient for TVPRA liability. (Doc. #21,  p. 9.) The Complaint alleges the defendants knowingly  benefited from the sex trafficking of plaintiff ""by  receiving payment for the rooms rented for Plaintiff S.Y.  and her traffickers at the Comfort Inn Hotel,"" and by  receiving ""other financial benefits in the form of food and  beverage sales and ATM fees from those persons who  were engaging in sex trafficking."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 158.) As      to Choice as franchisor, the Complaint alleges it  ""received a significant franchise fee and continuous  royalties on the Comfort Inn Hotel's gross revenue,""  while also exercising ""ongoing and systematic control  over operations at the Comfort Inn Hotel."" (Id. ¶¶ 43,  115.) The Court finds such allegations sufficient to  satisfy the ""knowingly benefitted"" element. S.Y., 476 F.  Supp. 3d at 1257; Doe S.W. v. Lorain-Elyria Motel, Inc.,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192, *5  (S.D. Ohio Mar. 16, 2020); H.H. v. G6 Hosp., LLC, 2019  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, *2 (S.D.  Ohio Dec. 6, 2019) [*17] ; M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 965. (d) Knew or Should Have Known that Venture was  Committing Sex Trafficking Crimes Both motions argue the Complaint fails to plausibly  allege the defendants knew or should have known that  the ""venture"" was engaging in sex-trafficking crimes,  i.e., that the defendants knew or should have known  that an adult plaintiff was caused to engage in  commercial sex by force, threats of force, fraud, or  coercion. (Doc. #19, pp. 23-26; Doc. #21, pp. 10-12.)  Choice argues that ""[a]t most,"" the Complaint's  allegations address Choice's constructive knowledge of  prostitution and sex trafficking, but not the sex  trafficking of plaintiff. (Doc. #19, p. 25.) Similarly, R&M  argues the Complaint lacks plausible allegations that it  ""knew or should have known"" of any venture that  trafficked plaintiff. (Doc. #21, p. 12.) The Court disagrees with this argument. First of all,  ""knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind  may be alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b); see Sun  Life Assurance Co. of Can. v. Imperial Premium Fin.,  LLC, 904 F.3d 1197, 1215 (11th Cir. 2018). Pleading  ""generally"" is not without limits, and a complaint must  still comply with ""the less rigid—though still operative— strictures of Rule 8."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 686-87. The  Complaint clearly satisfies this notice pleading standard. Plaintiff has alleged that the following [*18]  was ""routine  conduct taking place at the Comfort Inn Hotel as a result  of the human sex trafficking enterprise"": a. Plaintiff's sex traffickers frequently rented rooms  at the hotel close to each other; b. Plaintiff's sex traffickers paid cash for the rooms  at the Comfort Inn Hotel where the Plaintiff  engaged in commercial sex acts; c. Plaintiff's sex traffickers booked extended stays  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *14 Page 7 of 15 at the Comfort Inn Hotel for themselves and for the  Plaintiff on a routine basis and on a rotating basis  frequently throughout the year; d. Plaintiff and her sex traffickers would have few or  no luggage or personal possessions for these  extended stays; e. Plaintiff was confined in the rooms at the Comfort  Inn Hotel for long periods of time; f. Plaintiff's rooms and her sex traffickers' rooms  consistently displayed ""Do Not Disturb"" signs on the  doors to the room where the Plaintiff was engaged  in commercial sex acts; g. Men (""Johns"") frequently entered and left the  rooms at the Comfort Inn Hotel where the Plaintiff  was engaged in illegal commercial sex acts at all  times of day and night; h. The staff and customers at the Comfort Inn Hotel  that was owned, operated, managed, supervised,  controlled and/or otherwise [*19]  held responsible  by each and every Comfort Inn Defendant saw  and/or reported to the Comfort Inn Hotel's  respective administration that the rooms where the  Plaintiff engaged in commercial sex acts were  messy, and contained sex and drug paraphernalia  and had an unclean smell; i. The rooms at the Comfort Inn Hotel were often  stained with Plaintiff's blood and that of other  trafficking victims after they were beaten or  violently raped; j. Plaintiff's sex traffickers consistently refused  housekeeping  services  and  otherwise  would  prohibit staff from entering their rooms and the  Plaintiff's rooms; k. Plaintiff would frequently request clean towels  and linens; l. Plaintiff dressed in a sexually explicit manner and  would walk the hallways of the Comfort Inn Hotel in  inappropriate attire; m. Plaintiff S.Y. and other trafficking victims were  often seen on the hotel's balconies in inappropriate  attire or without any clothes at all; n. Excessively loud noises would consistently come  from Plaintiff's rooms; o. During nighttime hours, Plaintiff and her ""Johns""  and drug clients would create noise in the public  area of the Comfort Inn Hotel and, upon information  and belief, would be a disturbance to other [*20]   guests using the hotel for their intended purposes;  and p. While at the hotel, the Plaintiff displayed clear  signs of physical abuse, diminished personal  hygiene, submissiveness and inappropriate attire. (Doc. #1, ¶ 98.) Further, the Complaint alleges the  defendants ""knew or should have known about the  nature of the sex trafficking venture at the Comfort Inn  Hotel, including as they related to Plaintiff S.Y."" due to  the following: a. Requests by the traffickers to rent adjoining  rooms; b. Cash payments for the rooms by the sex  traffickers; c. Refusal of housekeeping services by those  persons engaged in sex trafficking; d. Excessive used condoms located in the rooms  used for sex trafficking; e. Excessive requests for towels and linens in the  rooms used for sex trafficking; f. Hotel staff observing Plaintiff S.Y. and her  traffickers in the hotel; g. Plaintiff S.Y. being escorted by traffickers in and  around the hotel; h. Operation of sex trafficking ventures out of the  same hotel room for multiple days or weeks in  succession; i. Multiple men per day coming and going from the  same  rooms  without  luggage  or  personal  possessions; j. Knowledge of police and EMS activity at the  Comfort Inn Hotel and at [*21]  other locations near  the Comfort Inn Hotel that was related to  commercial sex work; and k. Knowledge that Plaintiff S.Y. and other sex  trafficking victims were often seen naked and/or in  inappropriate attire on the hotel's balconies. (Id. ¶ 159.) The  Court  finds  these  allegations  sufficient  to  reasonably infer the defendants knew or should have  known of the sex trafficking venture. S.Y., 476 F.  Supp. 3d at 1257; A.B., 455 F. Supp. 3d at 193-94; Doe  S.W., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192,  *5-6; H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *18 Page 8 of 15 6682152, *3; M.A., 425 F. Supp 3d at 967-68. (e) Vicarious Liability Finally, Choice argues the TVPRA claim should be  dismissed because ""[t]here is no vicarious liability under  the plain meaning of the TVPRA."" (Doc. #19, p. 26.) The  Court disagrees. See S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1257-58  (finding  plaintiff  made  sufficient  allegations  that  franchisor was vicariously liable under section 1595 of  the TVPRA to survive dismissal); see also J.C. v.  Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073,  2020 WL 6318707, *10 (N.D. Ca. Oct. 28, 2020) (finding  plaintiff's vicarious liability claim had ""alleged sufficient  facts to support a plausible claim that [defendants]  received financial benefits from a venture they  vicariously participate in (through their franchisees) that  the franchises should have known was engaged in sex  trafficking""). Choice also argues that even if it could be held  vicariously liable under the TVPRA, plaintiff's allegations  are insufficient to establish an agency relationship  between [*22]  Choice and its franchisee. (Doc. #19, p.  27.) Having reviewed the allegations at issue, the Court  finds them sufficient to create a plausible inference of an  agency relationship. ""It is well-established that a franchise relationship does  not by itself create an agency relationship between the  franchisor and franchisee."" Cain v. Shell Oil Co., 994 F.  Supp. 2d 1251, 1252 (N.D. Fla. 2014). However,  ""[f]ranchisors may well enter into an agency relationship  with a franchisee if, by contract or action or  representation, the franchisor has directly or apparently  participated in some substantial way in directing or  managing acts of the franchisee, beyond the mere fact  of providing contractual franchise support activities.""  Mobil Oil Corp. v. Bransford, 648 So. 2d 119, 120 (Fla.  1995). Here, the Complaint alleges Choice was in an agency  relationship with R&M during the relevant time period.  (Doc. #1, ¶ 115.) The Complaint further asserts that in a  variety of ways Choice exercised control over the  means and methods of how R&M conducted business,  such as by profit sharing, standardized training,  standardized rules of operation, regular inspection, and  price fixing. (Id. ¶ 116.) The Court finds such allegations  sufficient to support a plausible inference of an agency  relationship. See S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1258; A.B.,  455 F. Supp. 3d at 195-97; Doe S.W., 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192, *7; H.H., 2019 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, *6; M.A., 425 F.  Supp. 3d at 972. Because the allegations [*23]  in the Complaint are  sufficient to state a claim under section 1595 of the  TVPRA, the Court denies the motions for dismissal  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). (2) Florida RICO Violation Count Two of the Complaint asserts a claim against  both defendants under Florida's civil RICO statute,  section 772.104, Florida Statutes. (Doc. #1, p. 35.) To  state a claim under the statute, plaintiff must allege  plausible facts showing ""(1) conduct or participation in  an enterprise through (2) a pattern of [criminal] activity.""  Horace-Manasse v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 521 F.  App'x 782, 784 (11th Cir. 2013) (quoting Lugo v. State,  845 So. 2d 74, 97 (Fla. 2003)).                                  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *21 Page 9 of 15 The defendants argue that plaintiff lacks standing  because personal injuries cannot be remedied by RICO.  (Doc. #19, p. 21; Doc. #21, p. 16.) There is some  authority to suggest the Florida RICO statute, unlike the  federal equivalent, does not ""expressly limit recovery"" to  persons who have suffered injury to their business or  property, and that recovery for personal injuries may be  allowed. Berber v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 2018 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 234385, 2018 WL 10436236, at *3 (S.D.  Fla. May 24, 2018) (collecting cases). The motion will be  denied on this basis. Plaintiff's RICO claim is asserted under sections  772.104(1) and (2), which provide civil remedies for  violations of section 772.103, Florida Statutes. (Doc. #1,  ¶ 162.) Section 772.103 contains four subsections of  prohibited activities. § 772.103, Fla. Stat. R&M argues  that because plaintiff fails ""to specify the particular  subsection of Section 772.103 giving rise to a Florida  RICO [*24]  claim,"" the claim is defective. (Doc. #21, pp.  12-13.) Plaintiff fails to address this argument in her  response. This court has previously stated that a RICO claim's  failure to identify which subsection of section 772.103 is  implicated is sufficient to warrant dismissal. Lennon v.  Marriott Ownership Resorts, Inc., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  55004, 2019 WL 1440092, *10 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 31,  2019); Signeo Int'l Ltd. v. Wade, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  203002, 2013 WL 12153590, *6 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 1,  2013). However, the Court finds dismissal unnecessary  in this case because it is apparent which subsection  plaintiff is relying upon. Section 772.103(3) makes it  unlawful for any person associated with any enterprise  to conduct or participate in such enterprise through a  pattern of criminal activity. In the Complaint, plaintiff  alleges the defendants ""conducted or participated in . . .  the affairs of their respective RICO Enterprises through  a pattern of numerous acts of racketeering activity . . . in  violation of Fla. Stat. § 772.103."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 166.)  Because this allegation tracks the language of  subsection three, the Court finds it provides sufficient  notice of the applicable provision. Accordingly, the Court  denies R&M's request for dismissal on this basis. Each of the motions also argue plaintiff has insufficiently  pled the enterprise element of her claim. (Doc. #19, pp.  28-31; Doc. #19, pp. 13-15.) Florida's RICO statute  defines  enterprise  to  include  a  ""group  of  individuals [*25]  associated in fact although not a legal  entity."" § 772.102(3), Fla. Stat. ""[A]n association-in-fact   enterprise is simply a continuing unit that functions with  a common purpose."" Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S.  938, 948, 129 S. Ct. 2237, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1265 (2009).  To sufficiently plead such an enterprise, ""a plaintiff must  allege that a group of persons shares three structural  features: (1) a purpose, (2) relationships among those  associated with the enterprise, and (3) longevity  sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the  enterprise's purpose."" Cisneros v. Petland, Inc., 972  F.3d 1204, 1211 (11th Cir. 2020) (marks and citations  omitted). ""The purpose prong contemplates 'a common purpose  of engaging in a course of conduct' among the  enterprise's alleged participants."" Cisneros, 972 F.3d at  1211 (quoting United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576,  583, 101 S. Ct. 2524, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1981)). ""An  abstract common purpose, such as a generally shared  interest in making money, will not suffice. Rather, where  the participants' ultimate purpose is to make money for  themselves, a RICO plaintiff must plausibly allege that  the participants shared the purpose of enriching  themselves through a particular criminal course of  conduct."" Id. (citations omitted). Here, the Complaint alleges the defendants ""associated  with each other and/or the Plaintiff S.Y.'s sex traffickers  for the common purpose of profiting off an established  sex  trafficking  scheme.""  (Doc.  #1,  ¶  165.)  Plaintiff [*26]   asserts  this  ""association-in-fact""  constitutes an ""enterprise"" under Florida's RICO statute,  and that the defendants conducted or participated in  their enterprises through a pattern of criminal activity,  ""related by their common purpose to profit off an  institutionalized sex trafficking scheme."" (Id. ¶¶ 165- 66.) The Court finds these allegations sufficient to allege  the defendants ""shared the purpose of enriching  themselves through a particular criminal course of  conduct."" Cisneros, 972 F.3d at 1211; see also United  States v. Church, 955 F.2d 688, 697-98 (11th Cir. 1992)  (noting that ""an association's devotion to 'making money  from repeated criminal activity' . . . demonstrates an  enterprise's 'common purpose of engaging in a course  of conduct'"" (citations omitted)); Burgese v. Starwood  Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., 101 F. Supp. 3d 414,  424 (D. N.J. 2015) (on motion to dismiss Florida RICO  claim, court found that ""Plaintiff's Amended Complaint  can be read to allege a 'common purpose' of furthering  an institutionalized prostitution scheme to increase  profits for the participants,"" and that ""[t]hese allegations,  though thin, are sufficient for purposes of this motion""). Next, R&M argues plaintiff has failed to plead the claim  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *23 Page 10 of 15 with the heightened level of specificity required for RICO  claims. (Doc. #21, p. 15.) Plaintiff responds that  because the RICO claim is [*27]  based on non- fraudulent predicate acts, the heightened pleading  requirement is not applicable. (Doc. #42, p. 22.) The  Court agrees with plaintiff. While the Eleventh Circuit has described RICO claims  as ""essentially a certain breed of fraud claims"" that  ""must be pled with an increased level of specificity""  consistent with Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure, Arthur v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA, 569  F. App'x 669, 681 (11th Cir. 2014), such a standard  applies only when the RICO claim is based on fraud or  mistake, see D. Penguin Bros. Ltd. v. City Nat'l Bank,  587 F. App'x 663, 666 (2d Cir. 2014) (""In the RICO  context, a plaintiff must plead predicate acts sounding in  fraud  or  mistake  according  to  the  particularity  requirement of Rule 9(b); for other elements of a RICO  claim—such as non-fraud predicate acts or . . . the  existence of an 'enterprise'—a plaintiff's complaint need  satisfy only the 'short and plain statement' standard of  Rule 8(a).""); Cardenas v. Toyota Motor Corp., 418 F.  Supp. 3d 1090, 1098 (S.D. Fla. 2019) (""[B]ecause  particularity pleading under Rule 9(b) is limited to  circumstances  constituting  fraud,  the  non-fraud  elements of a RICO claim can be alleged under Rule  8(a) standards."" (citations and marks omitted)). As the  predicate acts in plaintiff's RICO claim are not based in  fraud, the Court finds Rule 9 is not applicable. See  Magnifico v. Villanueva, 783 F. Supp. 2d 1217, 1229,  1229 n.9 (S.D. Fla. 2011) (in addressing RICO  allegations, court applied Rule 9(b) to ""fraud-related  predicate acts,"" such as mail, wire, and immigration  document fraud, and Rule 8 to [*28]  ""non-fraud  predicate acts,"" such as human trafficking). Choice next argues the RICO claim fails to plausibly  allege plaintiff's harm was caused by Choice. (Doc.  #19, pp. 31-32.) Under the Florida RICO statute, a  plaintiff must demonstrate that their injuries were  proximately caused by the RICO violations. See Bortell  v. White Mountains Ins. Grp., Ltd., 2 So. 3d 1041, 1047  (Fla. 4th DCA 2009). ""A wrongful act is a proximate  cause if it is a substantive factor in the sequence of  responsible causation."" Green Leaf Nursery v. E.I.  DuPont De Nemours & Co., 341 F.3d 1292, 1307 (11th  Cir. 2003) (marks and citation omitted). Furthermore, a  plaintiff ""must show a 'direct relation between the injury     asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.'"" Id. (quoting  Holmes v. Sec. Inv'r Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268, 112  S. Ct. 1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1992)). ""Indirect harm is  insufficient to sustain a cause of action under the RICO  statutes."" Bortell, 2 So. 3d at 1047; see also O'Malley,  599 So. 2d at 1000 (""[I]ndirect injuries, that is, injuries  sustained not as a direct result of predicate acts . . . will  not allow recovery under Florida RICO.""). Choice argues that plaintiff has not alleged a direct  relation between her injuries and Choice's purported  violation of the RICO statute, and that the conduct  responsible for plaintiff's alleged harm was the actions  of the traffickers and ""Johns."" (Doc. #19, pp. 31-32.)  Plaintiff responds that she has sufficiently pled  proximate cause and losses as a direct result of [*29]   the sex trafficking enterprise by alleging she ""was at  the Comfort Inn as part of the sexual trafficking  scheme and her injuries were caused by and in  furtherance of the sexual trafficking scheme."" (Doc.  #43, p. 34.) Having reviewed the allegations in the  Complaint, the Court agrees with plaintiff. The Complaint alleges each of defendants ""was on  notice of repeated incidences of sex trafficking  occurring on their hotel premises,"" and yet ""failed to  take the necessary actions to prevent sex trafficking  from taking place."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 59.) The Complaint also  alleges numerous ways in which the defendants could  have identified and prevented the sex trafficking from  occurring. (Id. ¶¶ 61-76.) Finally, the Complaint alleges  the ""acts and omissions of the Comfort Inn Defendants  served to support, facilitate, harbor, and otherwise  further the traffickers' sale and victimization"" of plaintiff  ""for commercial sexual exploitation by repeatedly  renting rooms to people they knew or should have  known were engaged in sex trafficking."" (Id. ¶ 129.)  ""[B]y knowingly, or with reckless disregard, repeatedly  allowing sex trafficking to occur on their premises  between 2013 and 2016,"" the defendants' ""acts [*30]   have yielded consistent results and caused economic,  physical, and psychological injuries"" to plaintiff. (Id. ¶¶  168, 171.) The Court finds these allegations sufficient to plead a  ""direct relation between the injury asserted and the  injurious conduct alleged,"" Holmes, 503 U.S. at 268,  and  therefore  the  Complaint  adequately  pleads  proximate cause, see Burgese, 101 F. Supp. 3d at 422  (finding allegations of physical injury and mental  anguish ""cognizable under the Florida RICO Act"" and  sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss); cf. Berber,  2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 234385, 2018 WL 10436236, *5  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *26 Page 11 of 15 (""Because Plaintiffs' asserted injuries arise from a set of  actions entirely distinct form [sic] the alleged predicate  RICO violations, proximate cause is lacking as a matter  of law.""). Accordingly, the Court finds the Complaint's Florida  RICO claim sufficiently plead and therefore will deny the  motions to dismiss the claim. (3) Premise Liability Count Three of the Complaint asserts a claim of  premise liability against each defendant. (Doc. #1, p.  37.) A premise liability claim is a form of negligence  action. ""The elements for negligence are duty, breach,  harm, and proximate cause; the additional elements for  a claim of premises liability include the defendant's  possession or control of the premises and notice  of [*31]  the dangerous condition."" Lisanti v. City of Port  Richey, 787 So. 2d 36, 37 (Fla. 2d DCA 2001). Plaintiff  alleges the defendants owed her a variety of duties, that  they breached these duties, and that as a direct and  proximate result, she suffered bodily injury. (Doc. #1, ¶¶  181-95.) Plaintiff also alleges the defendants had actual  or constructive knowledge of sex trafficking occurring  on the premises, that they knew or should have known  the risk of such criminal conduct taking place would be  unreasonably high without appropriate precautions, and  that they had actual or constructive knowledge of the  dangerous conditions plaintiff was in. (Id. ¶¶ 186-88.) (a) Statute of Limitations The motions argue the premise liability claim should be  dismissed because it is barred by the relevant statute of  limitations. (Doc. #19, p. 33; Doc. #21, p. 17.) Under  Florida law, the statute of limitations for negligence  claims is four years. § 95.11(3)(a), Fla. Stat. A statute of limitations bar is ""an affirmative defense,  and . . . plaintiff[s] [are] not required to negate an  affirmative defense in [their] complaint."" La Grasta v.  First Union Sec., Inc., 358 F.3d 840, 845 (11th Cir.         2004) (citation omitted). ""A dismissal for failure to state  a claim on statute of limitations grounds is appropriate  only if it is apparent from the face of the complaint that  the claim [*32]  is time-barred."" United States ex rel.  Hunt v. Cochise Consultancy, Inc., 887 F.3d 1081, 1085  (11th Cir. 2018) (marks and citation omitted). Plaintiff alleges the sex trafficking occurred at the  Comfort Inn Hotel ""from approximately 2013 and  continuing through approximately February of 2016.""  (Doc. #1, ¶ 13.) Both defendants argue that because  plaintiff did not file her lawsuit until December 2019, her  premise liability claim is at least partially time barred.  (Doc. #19, p. 33; Doc. #21, p. 17.) ""Under Florida law, the statute of limitations begins to  run when the cause of action accrues."" Carnival Corp. v.  Rolls-Royce PLC, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107141, 2009  WL 3861482, *5 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 17, 2009) (citing §  95.031, Fla. Stat.). ""A cause of action accrues when the  last element constituting the cause of action occurs."" §  95.031(1), Fla. Stat. ""Under the continuing tort doctrine,  the cause of action accrues when the tortious conduct  ceases."" Effs v. Sony Pictures Home Entm't, Inc., 197  So. 3d 1243, 1244 (Fla. 3d DCA 2016) (emphasis and  citation omitted). ""A continuing tort is established by  continual tortious acts, not by continual harmful effects  from an original, completed act."" Id. at 1245 (marks,  emphasis, and citation omitted). Here, plaintiff alleges she was a repeat victim of sex  trafficking at the Comfort Inn Hotel between 2013 and  February 2016. The Court finds such allegations  sufficient to invoke the continuing tort doctrine. See Nat'l  Sourcing, Inc. v. Bracciale, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  199436, 2018 WL 6172430, *2 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 26,  2018) (finding allegation that a defendant's actions  ""continued to this day"" inferred [*33]  continuous tortious  conduct, thereby making it plausible for the plaintiffs to  assert the continuing tort doctrine as a basis to toll the  statute of limitations). Accordingly, the Court finds that  plaintiff's premise liability claim did not accrue until  February 2016, and therefore she had until February  2020 to file a complaint asserting premises liability. (1) Choice Plaintiff met this deadline by filing her First Amended  Complaint against Choice on December 31, 2019. S.Y.  et al v. Naples Hotel Co. et al, Case No. 2:20-cv-118  (Doc. #3). While the Court determined severance of the  parties was appropriate in the original action, S.Y., 476  F. Supp. 3d at 1259, and this Complaint was filed in  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *30 Page 12 of 15 August 2020, it appears that the December 2019 date is  applicable for statute of limitations purposes under the  relation-back provisions of Rule 15(c) of the Federal  Rules of Civil Procedure. Relation back is a legal fiction employed to salvage  claims that would otherwise be unjustly barred by a  limitations provision. See McCurdy v. United States,  264 U.S. 484, 487, 44 S.Ct. 345, 346, 68 L.Ed. 801  (1924); Moore v. Baker, 989 F.2d 1129, 1131 (11th  Cir. 1993). Under Rule 15, a claim in an amended  complaint relates back to the filing date of the  original complaint if it ""asserts a claim or defense  that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or  occurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in  the  original  pleading.""  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  15(c)(1)(B). [*34]  When the facts in the original  complaint do not put the defendant ""on notice that  the new claims of negligence might be asserted,""  but the new claims instead ""involve[ ] separate and  distinct conduct,"" such that the plaintiff would have  to prove ""completely different facts"" than required to  recover on the claims in the original complaint, the  new claims do not relate back. Moore, 989 F.2d at  1132. Caron v. NCL (Bahamas), Ltd., 910 F.3d 1359, 1368  (11th Cir. 2018). Accordingly, since it is not apparent  from the face of the Complaint that the claim is time- barred, dismissal based upon the statute of limitations  affirmative defense is not appropriate. For the same reasons, the Court rejects the argument  that plaintiff's negligent hiring, supervision, and retention  claim against Choice is also barred by the four-year  statute of limitations. (Doc. #19, p. 33.) (2) R&M R&M was not named in the December 2019 First  Amended Complaint. Rather, it was first added as a  defendant in April 2020. S.Y. et al v. Naples Hotel Co. et  al, Case No. 2:20-cv-118 (Doc. #85.) Nonetheless, the  Court declines to dismiss based on the statute of  limitations. As noted, plaintiff is not required to negate  an affirmative defense in her complaint. La Grasta, 358  F.3d at 845. It is not apparent from the face of the  Complaint that the [*35]  claim is time-barred because  the Court cannot determine that plaintiff's premise  liability claim does not relate back to the First Amended  Complaint or is not subject to statutory or equitable  tolling. Therefore, the motion to dismiss is denied at  this stage of the proceedings. To the extent R&M seeks dismissal of the other  negligent claims on the same grounds (Doc. #21, p. 17),  the Court's ruling applies to those claims as well. (b) Failure to State a Claim Both defendants argue the premise liability claim is  insufficiently pled. Choice argues the claim fails  because the Complaint does not plausibly allege that  Choice possessed or controlled the Comfort Inn Hotel.  (Doc. #19, pp. 37-38.) The Court disagrees. As noted, a  premise liability claim requires a defendant possess or  control the premises at issue. Lisanti, 787 So. 2d at 37.  Here, the Complaint alleges the defendants were the  ""owners, operators, managers, supervisors, controllers  and innkeepers"" of the Comfort Inn Hotel, and that  Choice exercised control over the means and methods  of how R&M conducted business at the hotel. (Doc.                                2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *33 Page 13 of 15 #1, ¶¶ 28, 116.) While Choice may dispute these  allegations, the Court must accept them as true at  this [*36]  stage of the proceedings and finds them  sufficient to allege Choice had sufficient control of the  Comfort Inn Hotel for premise liability purposes. R&M argues there could be no duty to protect plaintiff  from the criminal conduct of third parties because such  conduct was not foreseeable. (Doc. #21, pp. 17-18.)  The Court disagrees with this argument as well. ""Under Florida law, a business owes invitees a duty to  use due care to maintain its premises in a reasonably  safe condition. This includes the duty to protect  customers from criminal attacks that are reasonably  foreseeable."" Banosmoreno v. Walgreen Co., 299 F.  App'x 912, 913 (11th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). Foreseeability can be shown by two alternative  means. First, a plaintiff may demonstrate that a  proprietor knew or should have known of a  dangerous condition on his premises that was likely  to cause harm to a patron. Second, a plaintiff can  show that a proprietor knew or should have known  of the dangerous propensities of a particular patron. Id. (marks, citations, and footnote omitted). Such  knowledge must only be pled generally. Fed. R. Civ. P.  9(b). The Complaint contains sufficient allegations that sex  trafficking was occurring at the Comfort Inn Hotel and  that the defendants knew or should have [*37]  known  of it. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 54-60, 98-108, 159.) The Complaint  also contains sufficient allegations to support a claim of  an agency relationship between Choice and R&M, and  any factual challenge to such a relationship is  premature. See Cain, 994 F. Supp. 2d at 1253; Mobil Oil  Corp., 648 So. 2d at 120. Accordingly, the Court finds  the allegations in the Complaint are sufficient to satisfy  the notice pleading requirements. (4) Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and Retention Count Four of the Complaint asserts a claim of negligent  hiring,  supervision,  and  retention  against  the  defendants. (Doc. #1, p. 42.) The motions seek  dismissal of the claim based on pleading deficiencies.  Both defendants first argue plaintiff has improperly      lumped multiple claims together. (Doc. #19, pp. 33-34;  Doc. #21, p. 18.) ""A party may set out 2 or more  statements of a claim or defense alternatively or  hypothetically, either in a single count or defense or in  separate ones. If a party makes alternative statements,  the pleading is sufficient if any one of them is sufficient.""  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(2). The Court finds that the claims  are properly set forth in a single count. To state a claim for negligent hiring, plaintiff must allege  facts showing that (1) the employer was required to make an  appropriate [*38]  investigation of the employee and  failed to do so; (2) an appropriate investigation  would have revealed the unsuitability of the  employee for the particular duty to be performed or  for employment in general; and (3) it was  unreasonable for the employer to hire the employee  in light of the information he knew or should have  known. Groover v. Polk Cty. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs, 460 F. Supp.  3d 1242, 1251 (M.D. Fla. 2020) (quoting Malicki v. Doe,  814 So. 2d 347, 362 (Fla. 2002)). ""Different from  negligent hiring, '[n]egligent retention occurs when,  during the course of employment, the employer  becomes aware or should have become aware of  problems with an employee that indicated his unfitness,  and the employer fails to take further action such as  investigating, discharge, or reassignment.'"" Id. (quoting  Degitz v. S. Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 996 F. Supp. 1451,  1461 (M.D. Fla. 1998)). ""Florida law also holds  employers liable for reasonably foreseeable damages  resulting from the negligent training of its employees  and agents."" Clary v. Armor Corr. Health Servs., Inc.,  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15633, 2014 WL 505126, *4  (M.D. Fla. Feb. 7, 2014) (citing Lewis v. City of St.  Petersburg, 260 F.3d 1260, 1265 (11th Cir. 2001)). ""For  an employer to owe a plaintiff a duty, the plaintiff must  be in the zone of risk that was reasonably foreseeable  to the employer."" Id. (citation omitted). Accordingly, to state a claim, the plaintiff must  allege facts that would establish a nexus between  the plaintiff and the tortfeasor's employment from  which a legal duty would flow from the defendant- employer to [*39]  the plaintiff. The plaintiff must  then  establish  that  the  defendant-employer  breached that duty and that the breach caused him  damage. Id. (citations omitted). 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *35 Page 14 of 15 The Complaint alleges each defendant was in control of  the  hiring,  instructing,  training,  supervising,  and  terminating of the hotel employees, and that each  defendant had a duty to make an appropriate  investigation of the employees. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 202-03.)  The Complaint further alleges that the defendants knew  or should have known that hotel employees were  ""allowing criminals to rent rooms for prostitution and  drug dealing,"" ""failing to either identify and/or report the  human sex trafficking and foreseeable harm"" of  plaintiff, and ""failing to refuse continued lodging services  to human sex traffickers."" (Id. ¶¶ 205-07.) The  Complaint concludes that the defendants were negligent  in their hiring, employment, supervision, and termination  decisions regarding the employees, and that the sex  trafficking of plaintiff was a foreseeable and direct  result. (Id. ¶¶ 208-12.) The Court finds these allegations  sufficient to state plausible claims for negligent hiring,  and negligent supervision/retention. Both motions further argue the claim should [*40]  be  dismissed because the Complaint does not identify the  alleged employees at issue. (Doc. #19, pp. 34-35; Doc.  #21, p. 19.) The Complaint alleges ""[e]ach and every""  defendant ""was in control of the hiring"" of hotel  employees, and responsible for ""instructing, training and  supervising,"" yet employees failed ""to refuse continued  lodging services to human sex traffickers"" and failed ""to  either identify and/or report the human sex trafficking.""  (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 202, 206-07.) The Court is required to  accept all factual allegations as true, Erickson, 551 U.S.  at 94, and ""[i]n adjudicating a motion to dismiss, the  district court may not resolve factual disputes,"" Page v.  Postmaster Gen. & Chief Exec. Officer of U.S. Postal  Serv., 493 F. App'x 994, 995 (11th Cir. 2012). The Court  finds that specific employees are not required to be  named. Accordingly, the Court denies the request to  dismiss the negligent hiring, supervision, and retention  claim. (5) Negligent Rescue Count Five of the Complaint asserts a claim of negligent  rescue against R&M. (Doc. #1, p. 45.) The Complaint  alleges R&M, as the owner and operator of the Comfort  Inn Hotel, had a duty to keep the premises safe and  prevent foreseeable criminal activity, as well as a duty  ""to make safe a dangerous condition at the Comfort Inn     Hotel and to rescue their [sic] hotel [*41]  guests,  specifically Plaintiff S.Y., from the peril they [sic]  created."" (Id. ¶¶ 215, 218, 224.) The Complaint alleges  that by various acts and omissions, R&M breached  these duties and that the continuous sex trafficking of  plaintiff was the direct and foreseeable result. (Id. ¶¶  220-22, 226-27, 229.) R&M argues the negligent rescue  claim should be dismissed because it is insufficiently  pled. (Doc. #21, p. 20.) There is no common law duty to rescue a stranger.  Estate of Ferguson v. Mascara, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  157824, 2010 WL 11558195, *2 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 7,  2010) (citing Bradberry v. Pinellas Cty., 789 F.2d 1513,  1516 (11th Cir. 1986)). ""A well-established exception to  this rule, however, provides that an innkeeper is 'under  an ordinary duty of care to [a guest] after he knows or  has reason to know the [guest] is ill or injured.'"" De La  Flor v. Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co., L.L.C, 2013 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 5403, 2013 WL 148401, *3 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 14,  2013) (quoting L.A. Fitness, Int'l, LLC v. Mayer, 980 So.  2d 550, 557 (Fla. 4th DCA 2008)); see also Abramson v.  Ritz Carlton Hotel Co., LLC, 480 F. App'x 158, 161 (3d  Cir. 2012) (""Generally, there is no duty to affirmatively  assist an injured person unless a special relationship,  such as that between an innkeeper and its guests,  exists between the parties."" (citation omitted)). R&M argues that hotels only have a limited duty to  render aid to a guest it knew or should have known was  ill or injured, and that the Complaint contains no  plausible facts to suggest R&M knew plaintiff was in  need of aid. (Doc. #21, p. 20.) However, the Court finds  the Complaint contains sufficient allegations [*42]  to  satisfy this requirement. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 99, 100, 225.) (6) Aiding and Abetting, Harboring, Confining,  Coercion and Criminal Enterprise Finally, Count Six of the Complaint asserts a claim of  aiding and abetting against R&M. (Doc. #1, p. 47.) The  Complaint accuses R&M of ""aiding and abetting  unlawful  activity  including  unlawful  confinement,  imprisonment, assault and battery by [plaintiff's] sex  traffickers and 'Johns.'"" (Id. ¶ 230.) R&M argues that the  claim must be dismissed because it is overly vague,  fails to articulate a cognizable, independent cause of  action, and lacks well-pled factual allegations. (Doc.  #21, p. 21.) The Court disagrees. Florida courts have recognized aiding and abetting the  commission of a tort as a standalone claim. See Gilison  v. Flagler Bank, 303 So. 3d 999, 1002 (Fla. 4th DCA  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *39 Page 15 of 15 2020) (aiding and abetting fraud); MP, LLC v. Sterling  Holding, LLC, 231 So. 3d 517, 527 (Fla. 3d DCA 2017)  (aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty). This Court  has previously listed the following elements that must be  alleged ""to state a claim for aiding and abetting a  common law tort"" under Florida law: ""(1) an underlying  violation on the part of the primary wrongdoer; (2)  knowledge of the underlying violation by the alleged  aider and abetter [sic]; and (3) the rendering of  substantial  assistance  in  committing [*43]   the  wrongdoing by the alleged aider and abettor."" Angell v.  Allergan Sales, LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142768,  2019 WL 3958262, *8 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 22, 2019); see  also Lawrence v. Bank of Am., N.A., 455 F. App'x 904,  906 (11th Cir. 2012) (applying the above elements to  three Florida tort claims). These cases demonstrate  Florida recognizes a common-law claim of aiding and  abetting tortious conduct. The  Court  finds  plaintiff's  allegations  are  not  impermissibly vague and, to the extent they allege  actual knowledge , are sufficient to state a claim.  Therefore, the Court denies R&M's request for  dismissal. C. Anonymity Finally, Choice argues that plaintiff is not entitled to  proceed anonymously as a matter of right, and that  plaintiff must be required to file a formal motion to do so.  (Doc. #19, p. 39.) On February 24, 2021, plaintiff filed a  Motion to Proceed Anonymously and for Entry of a  Protective Order. (Doc. #55.) Therefore, this issue is  moot. Accordingly, it is now ORDERED: 1. Defendant Choice Hotels International, Inc.'s  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Third Amended  Complaint with Prejudice (Doc. #19) is DENIED. 2. Defendant R&M Real Estate Company, Inc.'s  Motion  to  Dismiss  with  Prejudice  Plaintiff's  Complaint and Incorporated Memorandum of Law           (Doc. #21) is DENIED. DONE AND ORDERED at Fort Myers, Florida, this 26th  day of April, 2021. /s/ John E. Steele JOHN E. [*44]  STEELE SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78927, *42",1
S.Y. v. Wyndham Hotels(4),"OPINION and ORDER This matter comes before the Court on review of the  following two motions [*2]  to dismiss: (1) defendant  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.'s Motion To Dismiss  Plaintiff's Complaint (Doc. #14) filed on September 30,  2020; and (2) defendant Laxmi of Naples, LLC's Motion  to Dismiss, Motion to Strike, or For a More Definite  Statement and Memorandum of Law in Support Thereof  (Doc. #13) filed on September 28, 2020. Plaintiff filed an  Opposition (Doc. #20) on September 28, 2020. Plaintiff  filed a Memorandum in Opposition to each motion (Doc.  #37; Doc. #41) on November 2nd, and November 4,  2020. Defendant Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. filed  a Reply (Doc. #48) on November 30, 2020. For the  reasons set forth below, the motions are denied. I. The origins of this case began on October 30, 2019,  when Plaintiff and another alleged victim of sex  trafficking filed a case in the Circuit Court of the  Twentieth Judicial Circuit in and for Collier County,  Florida. See S.Y. et al v. Naples Hotel Co.et al, Case  No. 2:20-cv-118 (Doc. #1, p. 3). On December 31, 2019,  the Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint which  asserted ten claims against over forty defendants. Id. at  (Doc. #1, pp. 2-4). The case was removed to federal  court in February 2020. Id. at (Doc. #1). On April 15,  2020, [*3]  the Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended  Complaint. Id. at (Doc. #85). On August 5, 2020, the  undersigned denied various motions to dismiss, but  determined severance of the parties was appropriate.  S.Y. v. Naples Hotel Co., 476 F. Supp. 3d 1251, 1258- Page 2 of 14 59 (M.D. Fla. 2020). Following the Court's severance  order, plaintiff and the other alleged victim filed nearly  thirty new actions against various defendants, including  this case. The Complaint (Doc. #1) in this case was filed on  August 19, 2020, alleging that plaintiff S.Y. was a  resident of Collier County, Florida, and was a victim of  continuous sex trafficking at a certain Super 8  Wyndham Hotel in Naples, Florida (the Super 8)  between 2014 and February 2016. (Id. at ¶¶ 13-14, 22- 24.) The Complaint further alleges that during this time  period defendants Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and  Laxmi of Naples, LLC (Defendants, or Wyndham or  Laxmi)  are  hotel  owners,  operators,  managers,  supervisors, controllers, and/or entities responsible for  hotels at which sex trafficking has taken place,  including the Super 8. (Id. at ¶ 2.) The Complaint sets forth the following six claims:  violation  of  the  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), 18 U.S.C. § 1595  (Count I); violation of the Florida RICO statute, §  772.104, Florida Statutes [*4]  (Count II); premise  liability (Count III); negligent hiring, supervision, and  retention (Count IV); negligent rescue (Count V); and  aiding and abetting, harboring, confining, coercion, and  criminal enterprise (Count VI). (Id., pp. 33-49.) Counts I  through IV are asserted against both Defendants, while  Counts V through VI are asserted against only Laxmi.  (Id.) II. Defendant's motions seek to have the Court strike  several allegations in the Complaint, as well as raise  several arguments as to why the Complaint in its                 entirety, and each individual claim should be dismissed.  (Doc. #13, pp. 4-23; Doc. #14, pp. 5-25.) The Court will  address each of these arguments in turn. A. Shotgun Pleading Each Defendant argues in its motions, that the  Complaint constitutes a shotgun pleading based upon  Plaintiff grouping the Defendants together as the ""Super  8 Defendants"" (Doc. #1, p. 1 introductory paragraph)  and should be dismissed. (Doc. #13, pp. 7-9; Doc. #14,  pp. 5-6.) One way in which a complaint may constitute an  impermissible shotgun pleading is if it ""assert[s] multiple  claims against multiple defendants without specifying  which of the defendants are responsible for which acts  or omissions, or which of the defendants the claim is  brought against."" Weiland v. Palm Beach Cty. Sheriff's  Office, 792 F.3d 1313, 1323 (11th Cir. 2015); see also  Barmapov v. Amuial, 986 F.3d 1321, 1325 (11th Cir.  2021). Such a pleading fails ""to give the defendants  adequate notice of the claims [*5]  against them and the  grounds upon which each claim rests,"" Weiland, 792  F.3d at 1323, and violates the requirement that a  plaintiff provide ""a short and plain statement of the  claim,"" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The Complaint does in fact repeatedly references the  defendants collectively as the ""Super 8 Defendants.""  The failure to specify a particular defendant is not fatal,  however, when ""[t]he complaint can be fairly read to  aver that all defendants are responsible for the alleged  conduct."" Auto. Alignment & Body Serv. v. State Farm  Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 953 F.3d 707, 733 (11th Cir.  2020)(quoting Kyle K. v. Chapman, 208 F.3d 940, 944  (11th Cir. 2000)). The Complaint typically (but not  always) alleges that ""each and every"" such defendant  was involved in the activity described in the particular  paragraph of the Complaint. See (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 4-5, 8-18,  55-62, 69-83, 87-88, 97-98, 102-08, 126-43, 145, 147- 50, 153-56, 162-67, 169-73, 176-207.) A fair reading of  the Complaint is that each of these defendants was  involved in the identified conduct attributed to the ""Super  8 Defendants."" See Sprint Sols., Inc. v. Fils-Amie, 44 F.  Supp. 3d 1224, 1226-27 (S.D. Fla. 2014)(finding that  reference to ""defendants"" in a complaint was not fatal  where pleading alleged that each of the two defendants  perpetrated the wrongs, often acting together). While  defendants may disagree that such allegations are  accurate, that dispute is for another day. The group  allegations do not fail [*6]  to state a claim, Auto.  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *3 Page 3 of 14 Alignment & Body Serv., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co., 953 F.3d 707, 732-33 (11th Cir. 2020), and the  Complaint does not constitute a shotgun pleading. B. Redundant, Irrelevant, and Scandalous Factual  Allegations In its Motion, Laxmi notes that this Court previously  ordered Plaintiff to remove those allegations ""regarding  sex trafficking in general and its relationship to the  hospitality industry."" S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1259.  Defendant Laxmi, however, argues that contrary to the  Court's prior directive, Plaintiff has included redundant,  irrelevant, and scandalous allegations in her Complaint  that should be struck. (Doc. #13, pp. 4-7.) Pursuant to Rule 12(f), a party may move to strike ""any  redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous  matter"" within the pleadings. The Court enjoys broad  discretion in determining whether to grant or deny a  motion to strike. Northrop & Johnson Holding Co. v.  Leahy, No. 16-cv-63008-BLOOM/Valle, 2017 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 193365, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 22, 2017). ""The  purpose of a motion to strike is to clean up the  pleadings, streamline litigation, and avoid unnecessary  forays into immaterial matters."" Monsoon, Inc. v. BizJet  Int'l  Sales  &  Support,  Inc.,  No.  16-80722-CV- MARRA/MATTHEWMAN, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26987,  2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26987, at *28 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 27,  2017). It is not intended to ""procure the dismissal of all  or part of a complaint."" Id. A motion to strike is a drastic  remedy and is disfavored by the courts. Schmidt v. Life  Ins. Co. of N. Am., 289 F.R.D. 357, 358 (M.D. Fla.  2012). Therefore, a motion [*7]  to strike should be  granted only if ""the matter sought to be omitted has no  possible relationship to the controversy, may confuse  the issues, or otherwise prejudice a party."" Id. Defendant urges the Court to strike ten paragraphs in  the Complaint that it maintains contain ""puffing"" about  sex trafficking and its alleged relationship to the hotel  industry, scandalous matter about Laxmi's knowledge of  the tactics of sex traffickers, and that such tactics are  used against children. (Doc. #13, pp. 6-7.) Upon review  of these allegations (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 3-5, 55-57, 78-80,  146), the Court finds the majority of them relate to  Defendant's knowledge of sex trafficking, its failure to  prevent the alleged criminal conduct, and Defendants'  profiting from the sex trafficking industry. Such  allegations are relevant to the type of claims plaintiff  asserts, S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1259 n.5, and the  Court does not find any to be overly redundant or unduly  prejudicial. See Schmidt, 289 F.R.D. at 358. Admittedly,  general allegations of sex trafficking in paragraph  three and tactics of sex traffickers implemented against  children in paragraph five may be immaterial, but the  Court cannot say that these allegations are unduly  prejudicial to justify the ""drastic"" remedy [*8]  sought.  Schmidt, 289 F.R.D. at 358. The Court therefore denies  Defendant's request to strike the aforementioned  allegations. C. Failure To State a Claim Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires that a  complaint contain a ""short and plain statement of the  claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed.  R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This obligation ""requires more than  labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the  elements of a cause of action will not do."" Bell Atl. Corp.  v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L.  Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citation omitted). To survive  dismissal, the factual allegations must be ""plausible""  and ""must be enough to raise a right to relief above the  speculative level."" Id. at 555; see also Edwards v. Prime  Inc., 602 F.3d 1276, 1291 (11th Cir. 2010). This requires  ""more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully- harmed-me accusation."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,  678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009)  (citations omitted). In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court  must accept all factual allegations in a complaint as true  and take them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197,  167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007), but ""[l]egal conclusions  without adequate factual support are entitled to no  assumption of truth."" Mamani v. Berzaín, 654 F. 3d  1148, 1153 (11th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted).  ""Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of  action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do  not suffice."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Factual allegations  that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability fall  short of being facially plausible. Chaparro v. Carnival  Corp., 693 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir. 2012)  (citations [*9]  omitted). Thus, the Court engages in a  two-step approach: ""When there are well-pleaded  factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity  and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to  an entitlement to relief."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. 1. Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization  Act 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *6 Page 4 of 14 Defendant Wyndham challenges Count I of the  Complaint, alleging that Defendants violated the  TVPRA, 18 U.S.C. § 1595. (Doc. #14, pp. 6-16.) The  TVPRA provides a civil remedy to victims of certain  types of human trafficking. The civil remedy portion of  the Act provides: (a) An individual who is a victim of a violation of this  chapter may bring a civil action against the  perpetrator  (or  whoever  knowingly  benefits,  financially or by receiving anything of value from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in an act in  violation of this chapter) in an appropriate district  court of the United States and may recover  damages and reasonable attorneys fees. 18 U.S.C. § 1595(a). The phrase ""a violation of this  chapter"" refers to Chapter 77 of Title 18 of the United  States Code. The only violation of Chapter 77 relevant  to this case is contained in 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a), which  provides in relevant part: (a) Whoever knowingly — (1) in [*10]  or affecting interstate or foreign  commerce . . . recruits, entices, harbors,  transports,  provides,  obtains,  advertises,  maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any means  a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything  of value, from participation in a venture which  has engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), knowing, or except where the act constituting the  violation of paragraph (1) is advertising, in reckless  disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of  force, fraud, coercion described in subsection  (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be  used to cause the person to engage in a  commercial sex act, or that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act, shall be punished  as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). To state a section 1595(a) claim in  this case, Plaintiff must plausibly allege that she was a  victim of a criminal offense under section 1591(a), and  then must plausibly allege that Defendant (1)""knowingly  benefit[ted] financially or by receiving anything of value,""  (2) from participation in a venture, (3) which Defendant  ""knew or should have known has engaged in"" sex  trafficking under section 1591(a). S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d  at 1255-56 (citing A.B. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc.,, 455 F.  Supp. 3d 171, 181 (Pa. 2020))). Wyndham argues the Complaint's allegations are  insufficient to state [*11]  a claim under section 1595(a),  asserting four pleading deficiencies. (Doc. #14, pp. 6- 16.) (a) ""Participation"" in a ""Venture"" Wyndham first argues that the Complaint lacks well-pled  allegations that it participated in a ""venture,"" as required  by section 1595(a). (Doc. #14, pp. 6-10.) Drawing on the  definition of ""venture"" used in the criminal portion of the  statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(6), Wyndham asserts that  a ""venture"" requires two or more individuals ""associated  in fact."" (Doc. #14, p. 6.) Borrowing from the federal  RICO definition of ""enterprise,"" Wyndham argues that  ""associated in fact"" requires that persons must operate  as a ""continuing unit that functions with a common  purpose."" (Id., p. 7.) Wyndham continues that in the  context of a TVPRA claim against a hotel operator, the  Complaint must ""at least"" allege a ""continuous business  relationship between the trafficker and the hotels such  that it would appear that the trafficker and the hotels  have established a pattern of conduct or could be said  to have a tacit agreement."" (Id., p. 8) (quoting M.A. v.  Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959,  970 (S.D. Ohio 2019)); see also Doe v. Rickey Patel,  LLC, No. 0:20-60683, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, at  *14 (S.D. Fla. Sep. 29, 2020)(""In order to plead  defendants participated in a venture, plaintiff must  allege facts from which the Court could reasonably infer  the hotels could be said [*12]  to have a tacit agreement  with the trafficker.""). Wyndham concludes that ""[a]  commercial relationship, such as a hotel owner renting a  hotel room, does not give rise to a reasonable inference  that the participants in such a relationship shared a  common purpose or otherwise 'associated in fact.'""  (Doc. #14, p. 8.) Here, the Complaint alleges Wyndham participated in a  venture ""by engaging in a pattern of acts and omissions  that were intended to support, facilitate, harbor, and  otherwise further the traffickers' sale and victimization of           2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *9 Page 5 of 14 the Plaintiff S.Y. for commercial sexual exploitation by  repeatedly renting rooms at Super 8 Wyndham Hotel to  people"" Wyndham and Laxmi ""knew or should have  known were engaged in sex trafficking."" (Doc. #1, ¶  158.) The Complaint also alleges why Wyndham should  have been on notice of the sex trafficking and how it  failed to prevent it. (Id. ¶¶ 4-16, 56-83, 120-22.) The  Court finds the allegations in the Complaint sufficient to  allege participation in a venture under section 1595(a).  See Doe, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195811, at *14 (""The  Court finds it sufficient for Plaintiff to plead that  Defendants participated in a venture by renting rooms to  individuals that knew or should have known were  involved in a sex-trafficking [*13]  venture, including  the sex-trafficking victim.""); M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at  971 (""This Court finds Plaintiff has alleged sufficient  facts to show Defendants 'participated in a venture'  under § 1595 by alleging that Defendants rented rooms  to people it knew or should have known where [sic]  engaged in sex trafficking.""). Wyndham also argues that ""participation"" in a venture  requires an allegation of an overt act in furtherance of  the venture, and that failure to prevent sex trafficking is  not such an overt act. (Doc. #14, pp. 8-9.) The Court is  not convinced. S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1256 (""In the  absence of any controlling authority, the Court  concludes  that  actual  'participation  in  the  sex  trafficking act itself' is not required to state a claim  under section 1595. Accordingly, plaintiffs' failure to  allege such actual participation is not fatal to its section  1595 claim under the TVPRA.""). Wyndham has not  identified any controlling authority to the contrary. (b) Knowingly Benefited From Participating in  Venture Wyndham next argues that the Complaint insufficiently  alleges that it knowingly benefitted from participating in  a  venture  that  committed  TVPRA  crimes,  with  knowledge of the causal relationship. (Doc. #14, p. 10- 11.) Wyndham asserts that the allegation that it  financially [*14]  benefited from its relationship with the  franchisees because it received franchise fees is  insufficient, since that money is not ""from"" any act by  Wyndham that could plausibly constitute ""participation""  in a TVPRA ""venture."" (Id.) The Complaint alleges the  Defendants  knowingly  benefited  from  the  sex  trafficking of plaintiff ""by receiving payment for the    rooms rented for Plaintiff S.Y. and her traffickers at the  Super 8 Wyndham Hotel,"" and by receiving ""other  financial benefits in the form of food and beverage sales  and ATM fees from those persons who were engaging  in sex trafficking."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 154.) As to Wyndham as  franchisor, the Complaint alleges it ""received a  significant franchise fee and continuous royalties on the  Super 8 Wyndham Hotel's gross revenue,"" while also  exercising ""ongoing and systematic control over  operations at the Super 8 Wyndham Hotel."" (Id. at ¶¶  43, 111.) The Court finds such allegations sufficient to  satisfy the ""knowingly benefitted"" element. S.Y., 476 F.  Supp. 3d at 1257; S.W. v. Lorain-Elyria Motel, Inc., 2020  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192, at *5 (S.D.  Ohio Mar. 16, 2020); H.H v. G6 Hosp., LLC, 2019 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL 6682152, at *2 (S.D.  Ohio Dec. 6, 2019); M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 965. (c) Knew or Should Have Known that Venture was  Committing Sex Trafficking Crimes Wyndham argues the Complaint fails to plausibly allege  that it knew or should have known that the ""venture""  was engaging [*15]  in sex-trafficking crimes, i.e., that  Wyndham knew or should have known that an adult  plaintiff was caused to engage in commercial sex by  force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion. (Doc. #14, pp.  11-13.) Rather, Wyndham argues, the Complaint only  alleges that the hotel staff did not interfere with plaintiff  and witnessed indicia of commercial sex activity. (Id. p.  11.) Wyndham argues that the allegations do not give  rise to a reasonable inference that it knew or should  have known about any forced commercial sex activity at  the Super 8 Hotel. (Id.) The Court disagrees with this argument. First of all,  ""knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind  may be alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b); see Sun  Life Assurance Co. of Can. v. Imperial Premium Fin.,  LLC, 904 F.3d 1197, 1215 (11th Cir. 2018). Pleading  ""generally"" is not without limits, and a complaint must  still comply with ""the less rigid—though still operative— strictures of Rule 8."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 686-87. The  Complaint clearly satisfies this notice pleading standard. Plaintiff has alleged that the following was ""routine  conduct taking place at the Super 8 Wyndham Hotel as  a result of the human sex trafficking enterprise"": a. Plaintiff's sex traffickers frequently rented rooms  at the hotel close to each other; b. Plaintiff's sex traffickers would rent multiple  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *12 Page 6 of 14 rooms — one to [*16]  be used for sex trafficking  and the other to be used for drug sales; c. Plaintiff's sex traffickers often paid cash for the  rooms at the Super 8 Wyndham Hotel where the  Plaintiff engaged in commercial sex acts; d. Plaintiff's sex traffickers booked extended stays  at the Super 8 Wyndham Hotel for themselves and  for the Plaintiff on a routine basis and on a rotating  basis frequently throughout the year; e. Plaintiff and her sex traffickers would have few or  no luggage or personal possessions for these  extended stays; f. Plaintiff was confined in the rooms at the Super 8  Wyndham Hotel for long periods of time; g. Plaintiff's rooms and her sex traffickers' rooms  consistently displayed ""Do Not Disturb"" signs on the  doors to the room where the Plaintiff was engaged  in commercial sex acts; h. Men (""Johns"") frequently entered and left the  rooms at the Super 8 Wyndham Hotel where the  Plaintiff was engaged in illegal commercial sex acts  at all times of day and night; i. The staff and customers at the Super 8 Wyndham  Hotel that was owned, operated, managed,  supervised,  controlled  and/or  otherwise  held  responsible by each and every Super 8 Defendant  saw that the rooms where the Plaintiff engaged in  commercial [*17]  sex acts were messy, and  contained sex and drug paraphernalia and had an  unclean smell; j. The rooms at the Super 8 Wyndham Hotel were  filled with evidence of sex trafficking and drug use; k. Plaintiff's sex traffickers consistently refused  housekeeping  services  and  otherwise  would  prohibit staff from entering their rooms and the  Plaintiff's rooms; l. Plaintiff would frequently request clean towels and  linens; m. Plaintiff dressed in a sexually explicit manner  and would walk the hallways of the Super 8  Defendant [sic]; n. The staff at the Super 8 Wyndham Hotel  routinely observed sex trafficking activities taking  place out in the open, and injured sex trafficking  victims wandering the halls at all hours; o. Excessively loud noises would consistently come  from Plaintiff's rooms; p. During nighttime hours, Plaintiff and her ""Johns""  and drug clients would create noise at the Super 8  Wyndham Hotel and, upon information and belief,  would be a disturbance to other guests using the  hotel for their intended purposes; and q. While at the hotel, the Plaintiff displayed clear  signs of physical abuse, diminished personal  hygiene, submissiveness and inappropriate attire. (Doc. #1, ¶ 96.) Further, the Complaint [*18]  alleges  Wyndham and Laxmi ""knew or should have known  about the nature of the sex trafficking venture at the  Super 8 Wyndham Hotel, including as they related to  Plaintiff S.Y."" due to the following: a. Requests by the traffickers to rent rooms near  exit doors; b. Cash payments for the rooms by the sex  traffickers; c. Refusal of housekeeping services by those  persons engaged in sex trafficking; d. Excessive used condoms located in the rooms  used for sex trafficking; e. Excessive requests for towels and linens in the  rooms used for sex trafficking; f. Hotel staff observing Plaintiff S.Y. and her  traffickers in the hotel; g. Plaintiff S.Y. being escorted by traffickers in and  around the hotel; h. Operation of sex trafficking ventures out of the  same hotel room for multiple days or weeks in  succession; i. Multiple men per day coming and going from the  same  rooms  without  luggage  or  personal  possessions; j. Hotel staff routinely observing the sex trafficking  of Plaintiff S.Y. and other sex trafficking victims;  and k. Knowledge of police and EMS activity at the  Super 8 Wyndham Hotel and at other locations  near the Super 8 Wyndham Hotel that was related  to commercial sex work. (Id. ¶ 155.) The Court finds [*19]  these allegations sufficient to  reasonably infer the defendants knew or should have  known of the sex trafficking venture. S.Y., 476 F.  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *15 Page 7 of 14 Supp. 3d at 1257; A.B., 455 F. Supp. 3d at 193-94; Doe  S.W., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192,  at *5-6; H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL  6682152, at *3; M.A., 425 F. Supp 3d at 967-68. (d) Vicarious Liability Finally, Wyndham suggests the TVPRA claim should be  dismissed because ""[v]icarious liability is not viable  under the TVPRA"". (Doc. #14, p. 13.) The Court  disagrees. See S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1257-58  (finding  plaintiff  made  sufficient  allegations  that  franchisor was vicariously liable under section 1595 of  the TVPRA to survive dismissal); see also J.C. v.  Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc.,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201073,  2020 WL 6318707, *10 (N.D. Ca. Oct. 28, 2020) (finding  plaintiff's vicarious liability claim had ""alleged sufficient  facts to support a plausible claim that [defendants]  received financial benefits from a venture they  vicariously participate in (through their franchisees) that  the franchises should have known was engaged in sex  trafficking.""). Wyndham also argues that even if it could be held  vicariously liable under the TVPRA, plaintiff's allegations  ""do not give rise to a plausible inference of an agency  relationship"" between Wyndham and its franchisee,  Laxmi. (Doc. #14, p. 14.) Wyndham argues that  because the Landham Act requires some degree of  supervision by a franchisor, such supervision cannot be  the basis for liability. (Id. at 14-16.) The Court finds that  the allegations in the [*20]  Complaint do create such a  plausible inference. ""It is well-established that a franchise relationship does  not by itself create an agency relationship between the  franchisor and franchisee."" Cain v. Shell Oil Co., 994 F.  Supp. 2d 1251, 1252 (N.D. Fla. 2014). However,  ""[f]ranchisors may well enter into an agency relationship  with a franchisee if, by contract or action or  representation, the franchisor has directly or apparently  participated in some substantial way in directing or  managing acts of the franchisee, beyond the mere fact  of providing contractual franchise support activities.""  Mobil Oil Corp. v. Bransford, 648 So. 2d 119, 120 (Fla.  1995). Here, the Complaint alleges Wyndham was in an  agency relationship with Laxmi during the relevant time  period. (Doc. #1, ¶ 111.) The Complaint further asserts  that in a variety of ways Wyndham exercised control  over the means and methods of how Laxmi conducted  business, such as by profit sharing, standardized  training, standardized rules of operation, regular  inspection, and price fixing. (Id. at ¶ 112.) The Court  finds such allegations sufficient to support a plausible  inference of an agency relationship. See S.Y., 476 F.  Supp. 3d at 1258; A.B., 455 F. Supp. 3d at 195-97; Doe  S.W., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44961, 2020 WL 1244192,  at *7; H.H., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211090, 2019 WL  6682152, at *6; M.A., 425 F. Supp. 3d at 972. Because the allegations in the Complaint are sufficient  to state a claim under section 1595 of the TVPRA, the  Court denies Wyndham's motion for dismissal [*21]   pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). 2. Florida RICO Violation In Count II of the Complaint, Plaintiff asserts a claim  against both defendants under Florida's civil RICO  statute, section 772.104, Florida Statutes. (Doc. #1, p.  35.) To state a claim under the statute, plaintiff must  allege  plausible  facts  showing  ""(1)  conduct  or  participation in an enterprise through (2) a pattern of  [criminal] activity."" Horace-Manasse v. Wells Fargo  Bank, N.A., 521 F. App'x 782, 784 (11th Cir. 2013)                             2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *19 Page 8 of 14 (quoting Lugo v. State, 845 So. 2d 74, 97 (Fla. 2003)). Each of the motions argue plaintiff has insufficiently pled  the enterprise element of her claim. (Doc. #13, pp. 9-14;  Doc. #14, pp. 16-19.) Florida's RICO statute defines  enterprise to include a ""group of individuals associated  in fact although not a legal entity."" § 772.102(3), Fla.  Stat. ""[A]n association-in-fact enterprise is simply a  continuing unit that functions with a common purpose.""  Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 948, 129 S. Ct.  2237, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1265 (2009). To sufficiently plead  such an enterprise, ""a plaintiff must allege that a group  of persons shares three structural features: (1) a  purpose, (2) relationships among those associated with  the enterprise, and (3) longevity sufficient to permit  these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.""  Cisneros v. Petland, Inc., 972 F.3d 1204, 1211 (11th  Cir. 2020) (marks and citations omitted). The motions  argue the Complaint fails to sufficiently allege a  ""common purpose"" among the defendants. (Doc. #13,  pp. 10-13; Doc. #14, [*22]  p. 18.) ""The purpose prong contemplates 'a common purpose  of engaging in a course of conduct' among the  enterprise's alleged participants."" Cisneros, 972 F.3d at  1211 (quoting United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576,  583, 101 S. Ct. 2524, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1981)). ""An  abstract common purpose, such as a generally shared  interest in making money, will not suffice. Rather, where  the participants' ultimate purpose is to make money for  themselves, a RICO plaintiff must plausibly allege that  the participants shared the purpose of enriching  themselves through a particular criminal course of  conduct."" Id. (citations omitted). Here, the Complaint alleges Laxmi and Wyndham  ""associated with each other and/or the Plaintiff S.Y.'s  sex traffickers for the common purpose of profiting off  an established sex trafficking scheme."" (Doc. #1, ¶  161.)  Plaintiff  asserts  this  ""association-in-fact""  constitutes an ""enterprise"" under Florida's RICO statute,  and that the defendants conducted or participated in  their enterprises through a pattern of criminal activity,  ""related by their common purpose to profit off an          institutionalized sex trafficking scheme."" (Id. ¶¶ 161- 62.) The Court finds these allegations sufficient to allege  the defendants ""shared the purpose of enriching  themselves through a particular criminal course [*23]  of  conduct."" Cisneros, 972 F.3d at 1211; see also United  States v. Church, 955 F.2d 688, 697-98 (11th Cir. 1992)  (noting that ""an association's devotion to 'making money  from repeated criminal activity' . . . demonstrates an  enterprise's 'common purpose of engaging in a course  of conduct'"" (citations omitted)); Burgese v. Starwood  Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc.,, 101 F. Supp. 3d 414,  424 (D. N.J. 2015) (on motion to dismiss Florida RICO  claim, court found that ""Plaintiff's Amended Complaint  can be read to allege a 'common purpose' of furthering  an institutionalized prostitution scheme to increase  profits for the participants,"" and that ""[t]hese allegations,  though thin, are sufficient for purposes of this motion.""). Each of the motions also argues the Complaint fails to  sufficiently plead the ""pattern of criminal activity""  element. (Doc. #13, p. 13; Doc. #14, pp. 18-19.) As  previously stated, ""[i]n order to state a civil cause of  action under the Florida RICO Act, a plaintiff must allege  a pattern of criminal activity."" Arthur v. JP Morgan  Chase Bank, NA, 569 Fed. App'x 669, 682 (11th Cir.  2014) (citing §§ 772.103-104, Fla. Stat.). The statute's  definition of ""criminal activity"" provides ""that a particular  state law crime can serve as the predicate act for a  RICO claim if it is 'chargeable by indictment or  information' and falls within a series of specified  provisions."" Id. (citing § 772.102(1)(a), Fla. Stat.). ""In  order to establish a pattern of criminal activity, the  plaintiff must allege [*24]  two or more criminal acts 'that  have the same or similar intents, results, accomplices,  victims, or methods of commission' that occurred within  a five-year time span."" Id. at 680 (citing § 772.102(4),  Fla. Stat.). As noted by Wyndham (Doc. #14, p. 19), plaintiff's  Florida RICO claim is predicated on the commission of  human trafficking crimes in violation of section 787.06,  Florida Statutes. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 163, 165); see also §  772.102(1)(a)15., Fla. Stat. (listing ""human trafficking""  under Chapter 787 among the types of ""criminal activity""  covered by the Florida RICO statute). This provision  provides various punishments for ""[a]ny person who  knowingly, or in reckless disregard of the facts, engages  in human trafficking, or attempts to engage in human  trafficking, or benefits financially by receiving anything  of value from participation in a venture that has  subjected a person to human trafficking."" § 787.06(3),  Fla. Stat. Given the similarity between this language and  the TVPRA's civil liability provision, Wyndham argues  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *21 Page 9 of 14 the Florida RICO claim fails ""for the same reasons that  Plaintiff failed to state a TVPRA claim."" (Doc. #14, p.  19.) The Court has, however, determined plaintiff's  TVPRA claim is sufficiently pled, and therefore rejects  Wyndham's argument as to the Florida RICO claim. Laxmi [*25]  argues the RICO claim fails to allege a  pattern of criminal activity because the Complaint  ""impermissibly groups"" the defendants together, and  therefore ""[i]t is impossible to discern if Laxmi committed  two or more predicate acts."" (Doc. #13, p. 13.) The  Court disagrees. The Complaint alleges plaintiff was  trafficked on a ""regular, consistent and/or repeated  basis"" at various hotels in Naples, Florida, and at the  Super 8 Hotel from approximately 2014 to February  2016. (Doc. #1, ¶ 84.) The Complaint describes how the  sex trafficking occurred at the Super 8 Hotel and the  ""routine conduct"" taking place as a result, as well as  alleges Laxmi's employees made promises to the  traffickers not to interfere with the trafficking and  knowingly turned a blind eye to it. (Id. at ¶¶ 88, 89-90,  99, 234, 236.) Viewing the allegations in the light most  favorable to plaintiff, the Court finds this sufficient to  allege two or more predicate acts within the applicable  timeframe. Finally, Laxmi argues the Complaint contains insufficient  allegations regarding causation. (Doc. #13, pp. 13-14.)  Under the Florida RICO statute, a plaintiff must  demonstrate that their injuries were proximately caused  by the RICO [*26]  violations. See Bortell v. White  Mountains Ins. Grp., Ltd., 2 So. 3d 1041, 1047 (Fla. 4th  DCA 2009). ""A wrongful act is a proximate cause if it is  a substantive factor in the sequence of responsible  causation."" Green Leaf Nursery v. E.I. DuPont De  Nemours & Co., 341 F.3d 1292, 1307 (11th Cir. 2003)  (marks and citation omitted). Furthermore, a plaintiff  ""must show a 'direct relation between the injury asserted  and the injurious conduct alleged.'"" Id. (quoting Holmes  v. Sec. Inv'r Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 268, 112 S. Ct.  1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1992)). ""Indirect harm is  insufficient to sustain a cause of action under the RICO  statutes."" Bortell, 2 So. 3d at 1047; see also O'Malley,  599 So. 2d at 1000 (""[I]ndirect injuries, that is, injuries  sustained not as a direct result of predicate acts . . . will  not allow recovery under Florida RICO.""). Laxmi argues that the Complaint contains no plausible  allegations that it engaged in any conduct that was the  proximate cause of plaintiff's alleged injuries. (Doc. #13,  p. 14.) Laxmi also notes that the Complaint ""is void of  any allegation that that [sic] Laxmi had specific  knowledge of Plaintiff."" (Id.) Plaintiff responds that she  has sufficiently pled proximate cause and consequential  damages by alleging she ""was at the Super 8 Motel as  part of the sexual trafficking scheme and her injuries  were caused by and in furtherance of the sexual  trafficking scheme."" (Doc. #37, p. 16.) Having reviewed  the allegations in the Complaint, the Court agrees with  plaintiff. [*27]  The Complaint alleges each of defendants ""was on  notice of repeated incidents of sex trafficking occurring  on their hotel premises,"" and yet ""failed to take the  necessary actions to prevent sex trafficking from  taking place."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 60.) The Complaint also  alleges numerous ways in which these defendants could  have identified and prevented the sex trafficking from  occurring. (Id. at ¶¶ 62-77.) Finally, the Complaint  alleges the ""acts and omissions of the Super 8  Defendants served to support, facilitate, harbor, and  otherwise further the traffickers' sale and victimization""  of plaintiff ""for commercial sexual exploitation by  repeatedly renting rooms to people they knew or should  have known were engaged in sex trafficking."" (Id. at ¶  129.) ""[B]y knowingly, or with reckless disregard,  repeatedly allowing sex trafficking to occur on their  premises between 2014 and 2016,"" the defendants'  ""acts have yielded consistent results and caused  economic, physical, and psychological injuries"" to  plaintiff. (Id. at ¶¶ 164, 167.) The Court finds these allegations sufficient to plead a  ""direct relation between the injury asserted and the  injurious conduct alleged,"" Holmes, 503 U.S. at 268,  and therefore the Complaint [*28]  adequately pleads  proximate cause. See Burgese, 101 F. Supp. 3d at 422  (finding allegations of physical injury and mental  anguish ""cognizable under the Florida RICO Act"" and  sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss); cf. Berber,  2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 234385, 2018 WL 10436236, at                2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *24 Page 10 of 14 *5 (""Because Plaintiffs' asserted injuries arise from a set  of actions entirely distinct form [sic] the alleged  predicate RICO violations, proximate cause is lacking as  a matter of law.""). 3. Premise Liability Count III of the Complaint asserts a claim of premise  liability against each defendant (Doc. #1, ¶ 173), which  is a form of negligence action. ""The elements for  negligence are duty, breach, harm, and proximate  cause; the additional elements for a claim of premises  liability include the defendant's possession or control of  the premises and notice of the dangerous condition.""  Lisanti v. City of Port Richey, 787 So. 2d 36, 37 (Fla. 2d  DCA 2001). Plaintiff alleges Defendants owed her a  variety of duties, that they breached these duties, and  that as a direct and proximate result, she suffered bodily  injury. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 176-91.) Plaintiff also alleges the  defendants had actual or constructive knowledge of sex  trafficking occurring on the premises, that they knew or  should have known the risk of such criminal conduct  taking place would be unreasonably high without [*29]   appropriate precautions, and that they had actual or  constructive knowledge of Plaintiff being in dangerous  conditions. (Id. at ¶¶ 182-84.) (a) Statute of Limitations Wyndham argues the premise liability claim should be  dismissed because it is barred by the relevant statute of  limitations. (Doc. #14, p. 22.) Under Florida law, the  statute of limitations for negligence claims is four years.  § 95.11(3)(a), Fla. Stat. A statute of limitations bar is ""an affirmative defense,  and . . . plaintiff[s] [are] not required to negate an  affirmative defense in [their] complaint."" La Grasta v.  First Union Sec., Inc., 358 F.3d 840, 845 (11th Cir.  2004) (citation omitted). ""A dismissal for failure to state  a claim on statute of limitations grounds is appropriate  only if it is apparent from the face of the complaint that  the claim is time-barred."" United States ex rel. Hunt v.  Cochise Consultancy, Inc., 887 F.3d 1081, 1085 (11th  Cir. 2018) (marks and citation omitted). Plaintiff alleges the sex trafficking occurred at the  Super 8 Hotel ""[f]rom approximately 2014 to February  2016."" (Doc. #1, ¶ 84.) Wyndham argues that because  the Complaint was filed in August 2020, the premise  liability claim is time barred. (Doc. #14, p. 22.) ""Under Florida law, the statute of limitations begins to  run when the cause of action accrues."" Carnival Corp. v.  Rolls-Royce PLC, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107141, 2009  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107141, 2009 WL 3861482, *5 (S.D.  Fla. Nov. 17, 2009) (citing § 95.031, Fla. Stat.). ""A  cause of action accrues when the last element  constituting [*30]  the cause of action occurs."" §  95.031(1), Fla. Stat. ""Under the continuing tort doctrine,  the cause of action accrues when the tortious conduct  ceases."" Effs v. Sony Pictures Home Entm't, Inc., 197  So. 3d 1243, 1244 (Fla. 3d DCA 2016) (emphasis and  citation omitted). ""A continuing tort is established by  continual tortious acts, not by continual harmful effects  from an original, completed act."" Id. at 1245 (marks,  emphasis, and citation omitted). Here, plaintiff alleges she was a repeat victim of sex  trafficking at the Super 8 Hotel between 2014 and  February 2016. The Court finds such allegations  sufficient to invoke the continuing tort doctrine. See Nat'l  Sourcing, Inc. v. Bracciale, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  199436, 2018 WL 6172430, *2 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 26,  2018) (finding allegation that a defendant's actions  ""continued to this day"" inferred continuous tortious  conduct, thereby making it plausible for the plaintiffs to  assert the continuing tort doctrine as a basis to toll the  statute of limitations). Accordingly, the Court finds that  plaintiff's premise liability claim did not accrue until  February 2016, and therefore she had until February  2020 to file a complaint asserting premises liability. Plaintiff met this deadline by filing her First Amended  Complaint against Wyndham on December 31, 2019.  S.Y. et al v. Naples Hotel Co. et al, Case No. 2:20-cv- 118 (Doc. #1, p. 3). While the Court determined  severance [*31]  of the parties was appropriate in the  original action, S.Y., 476 F. Supp. 3d at 1259, and this  Complaint was filed in August 2020, it appears that the  December 2019 date is applicable for statute of  limitations purposes under the relation-back provisions  of Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Relation back is a legal fiction employed to salvage  claims that would otherwise be unjustly barred by a  limitations provision. See McCurdy v. United States,  264 U.S. 484, 487, 44 S.Ct. 345, 346, 68 L.Ed. 801  (1924); Moore v. Baker, 989 F.2d 1129, 1131 (11th  Cir. 1993). Under Rule 15, a claim in an amended  complaint relates back to the filing date of the  original complaint if it ""asserts a claim or defense  that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or  occurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in  the original pleading."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B).  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *28 Page 11 of 14 When the facts in the original complaint do not put  the defendant ""on notice that the new claims of  negligence might be asserted,"" but the new claims  instead ""involve[ ] separate and distinct conduct,""  such that the plaintiff would have to prove  ""completely different facts"" than required to recover  on the claims in the original complaint, the new  claims do not relate back. Moore, 989 F.2d at 1132. Caron v. NCL (Bahamas), Ltd., 910 F.3d 1359, 1368  (11th Cir. 2018). Accordingly, since it is not apparent  from the face of the Complaint that the claim is time- barred, dismissal based upon the statute of limitations  affirmative defense is not appropriate. For the same reasons, [*32]  the Court rejects  Wyndham's argument that plaintiff's negligent hiring,  supervision, and retention claim is also barred by the  four-year statute of limitations. (Doc. #14, p. 22.) (b) Failure to State a Claim Both defendants argue the premise liability claim is  insufficiently pled. (Doc. #13, pp. 14-18; Doc. #14, pp.  19-20.) In seeking to have the claim dismissed, Laxmi  first challenges the duty element of the claim. (Doc. #13,  pp. 15-16.) Under Florida law, a property owner  generally owes two duties to an invitee: (1) the duty to use reasonable care in maintaining  the property in a reasonably safe condition; and (2)  the duty to warn of latent or concealed dangers  which are or should be known to the owner and  which are unknown to the invitee and cannot be  discovered through the exercise of due care. Dampier v. Morgan Tire & Auto, LLC, 82 So. 3d 204,  206 (5th DCA 2012). Laxmi argues that it did not have a  duty to warn plaintiff of the danger of sex trafficking  because plaintiff was aware of the trafficking herself.  (Doc. #13, pp. 15-16); see also Emmons v. Baptist  Hosp., 478 So. 2d 440, 442 (Fla. 1st DCA 1985) (""A  prerequisite to the imposition upon the landowner of a  duty to warn is that the defendant's knowledge of the  danger must be superior to that of the business  invitee.""). However, plaintiff's premise liability [*33]   claim is not based upon a duty to warn, but rather a duty  to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition.  (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 177-81.) Accordingly, Laxmi's argument as  it relates to a duty to warn is irrelevant. See Dampier, 82  So. 3d at 206 (""The open and obvious nature of a  hazard may discharge a landowner's duty to warn, but it  does not discharge the landowner's duty to maintain the  property in a reasonably safe condition.""). Alternatively, Wyndham first argues the premise liability  claim fails because it does not allege that Wyndham  possessed or controlled the Super 8 Hotel. (Doc. #14,  pp. 19-20.) The Court disagrees. As noted, a premise  liability claim requires a defendant possess or control  the premises at issue. Lisanti, 787 So. 2d at 37. Here,  the Complaint alleges Wyndham and Laxmi were the  ""owners, operators, managers, supervisors, controllers  and innkeepers"" of the Super 8 Hotel, and that  Wyndham exercised control over the means and  methods of how Laxmi conducted business at the hotel.  (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 28, 115.) While Wyndham may dispute  these allegations, the Court must accept them as true at  this stage of the proceedings and finds them sufficient to  allege Wyndham had sufficient control of the Super 8  Hotel for premise liability [*34]  purposes. Next, Laxmi and Wyndham both argue there could be  no duty to protect plaintiff from the criminal conduct of  third parties because such conduct was not foreseeable.  (Doc. #13, pp. 16-17; Doc. #14, p. 20.) The Court  disagrees with this argument as well. ""Under Florida  law, a business owes invitees a duty to use due care to  maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition.  This includes the duty to protect customers from  criminal attacks that are reasonably foreseeable.""  Banosmoreno v. Walgreen Co., 299 F. App'x 912, 913  (11th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). Foreseeability can be shown by two alternative  means. First, a plaintiff may demonstrate that a  proprietor knew or should have known of a  dangerous condition on his premises that was likely  to cause harm to a patron. Second, a plaintiff can  show that a proprietor knew or should have known  of the dangerous propensities of a particular patron. Id. (marks, citations, and footnote omitted). Such  knowledge must only be pled generally. Fed. R. Civ. P.  9(b). The Complaint contains sufficient allegations that sex  trafficking was occurring at the Super 8 Hotel and that  Laxmi and Wyndham knew or should have known of it.  (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 56-61, 97-98, 102-08, 155-56.) The  Complaint also contains sufficient allegations to [*35]   support a claim of an agency relationship between  Wyndham and Laxmi, and any factual challenge to such  a relationship is premature. See Cain, 994 F. Supp. 2d  at 1253; Mobil Oil Corp., 648 So. 2d at 120. Accordingly,  the Court finds the allegations in the Complaint are  sufficient to satisfy the notice pleading requirements. Finally, Laxmi argues the premise liability claim fails  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *31 Page 12 of 14 because ""Plaintiff cannot establish a causal link  between her purported injuries and Laxmi' [sic]  purported negligence."" (Doc. #13, pp. 17-18.) The Court  disagrees. As noted, the Complaint alleges Laxmi was  on notice of the sex trafficking occurring at the Super 8  Hotel and not only failed to prevent it, but knowingly  turned a blind eye to it in exchange for increased profits.  (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 4, 60, 234, 236.) The Complaint also  alleges that as a result of Laxmi's actions, plaintiff  suffered various injuries and damages. (Doc. #1, ¶ 191.)  Contrary to Laxmi's suggestion that plaintiff's injuries  were the result of a ""freakish and improbable chain of  events,"" (Doc. #13, p. 17), the Court finds the Complaint  sufficiently alleges proximate cause. Accordingly, the  Court denies Laxmi and Wyndham's request to dismiss  the claim as insufficiently pled. 4. Negligent Hiring, Supervision, [*36]  and  Retention Count IV of the Complaint asserts a claim of negligent  hiring,  supervision,  and  retention  against  each  defendant. (Doc. #1, ¶ 192.) ""To state a claim under  Florida law for negligent hiring, supervision and/or  retention, a plaintiff must establish that the employer  owed a legal duty to the plaintiff to exercise reasonable  care in hiring and retaining safe and competent  employees."" Clary v. Armor Corr. Health Servs., No.  6:13-cv-90-Orl-31KRS, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15633, at  *11 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 7, 2014) (citations omitted). ""Florida  law also holds employers liable for reasonably  foreseeable damages resulting from the negligent  training of its employees and agents."" Id. (citing Lewis v.  City of St. Petersburg, 260 F.3d 1260, 1265 (11th Cir.  2001)). ""For an employer to owe a plaintiff a duty, the  plaintiff must be in the zone of risk that was reasonably  foreseeable to the employer."" Id. (citation omitted). Accordingly, to state a claim, the plaintiff must  allege facts that would establish a nexus between  the plaintiff and the tortfeasor's employment from  which a legal duty would flow from the defendant- employer to the plaintiff. The plaintiff must then  establish that the defendant-employer breached  that duty and that the breach caused him damage. Id. (citations omitted). The Complaint alleges each Super [*37]  8 Hotel  defendant was in control of the hiring, instructing,  training, supervising, and terminating of the hotel  employees, and that each defendant had a duty to make  an appropriate investigation of the employees. (Doc. #1,  ¶¶ 198-200.) The Complaint further alleges that the  defendants knew or should have known that hotel  employees were ""allowing criminals to rent rooms for  prostitution and drug dealing,"" ""failing to either identify  and/or  report  the  human  sex  trafficking  and  foreseeable harm"" of plaintiff, and ""failing to refuse  continued lodging services to human sex traffickers.""  (Id. ¶¶ 201-03.) The Complaint concludes that the  defendants were negligent in their hiring, employment,  supervision, and termination decisions regarding the  employees, and that the sex trafficking of plaintiff was  a foreseeable and direct result. (Id. ¶¶ 204-08.) Each of the motions seeks dismissal of the negligent  hiring, supervision, and retention claim based on  pleading deficiencies. Laxmi and Wyndham both argue  that the claim fails because the Complaint lacks  sufficient factual allegations that either defendant knew  or should have known of any unfit employees. (Doc.  #13, p. 19; Doc. #14, pp. 21-22); [*38]  see also Bright  v. City of Tampa, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 218868, 2017  WL 5248450, *8 (M.D. Fla. May 17, 2017) (""When an  employer fails to take a corrective action against an  employee because the employer had no notice of  problems with the employee's fitness, the employer is  not liable under Florida law for negligent supervision or  retention.""). The Court disagrees. The Complaint  sufficiently alleges facts suggesting sex trafficking was  occurring at the hotel, that the employees knew of it and  failed to prevent it, and that due to their control over the  employees, each defendant knew or should have known  of it. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 88-107-08, 195-203.) The Court finds  such allegations sufficient at this stage of the  proceedings. Wyndham also argues the claim should be dismissed  because the Complaint does not plausibly allege that  Wyndham hired or employed any of the employees at  issue. (Doc. #14, p. 22.) The Court is not persuaded, as  it has determined the Complaint's allegations of an  agency relationship between Wyndham and Laxmi are  sufficient. Accordingly, the Court denies the request to            2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *35 Page 13 of 14 dismiss the negligent hiring, supervision, and retention  claim. 5. Negligent Rescue Plaintiff also asserts a claim for negligent rescue in  Count V of the Complaint against Laxmi. (Doc. #1, ¶  209.) The Complaint [*39]  alleges Laxmi, as the owner  and operator of the Super 8 Hotel, had a duty to keep  the premises safe and prevent foreseeable criminal  activity, as well as a duty ""to make safe a dangerous  condition at the Super 8 Wyndham Hotel and to rescue  their [sic] hotel guests, specifically Plaintiff S.Y., from  the peril they [sic] created."" (Id. ¶¶ 211, 214, 220.) The  Complaint alleges that by various acts and omissions,  Laxmi breached these duties and that the continuous  sex trafficking of plaintiff was the direct and  foreseeable result. (Id. ¶¶ 216-18, 222-23, 225.) Laxmi  argues the negligent rescue claim should be dismissed  because it is insufficiently pled. (Doc. #13, p. 21.) There is no common law duty to rescue a stranger.  Estate of Ferguson v. Mascara, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  157824, 2010 WL 11558195, *2 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 7,  2010) (citing Bradberry v. Pinellas Cty., 789 F.2d 1513,  1516 (11th Cir. 1986)). ""A well-established exception to  this rule, however, provides that an innkeeper is 'under  an ordinary duty of care to [a guest] after he knows or  has reason to know the [guest] is ill or injured.'"" De La  Flor v. Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co., L.L.C., 2013 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 5403, 2013 WL 148401, *3 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 14,  2013) (quoting L.A. Fitness, Int'l, LLC v. Mayer, 980 So.  2d 550, 557 (Fla. 4th DCA 2008)); see also Abramson v.  Ritz Carlton Hotel Co., LLC, 480 Fed. App'x 158, 161  (3d Cir. 2012) (""Generally, there is no duty to  affirmatively assist an injured person unless a special  relationship, such as that between an innkeeper and its  guests, exists between the parties."") (citation omitted). Laxmi argues the negligent rescue claim should [*40]   be dismissed because it is insufficiently pled under the  ""rescue doctrine."" (Doc. #13, p. 21.) Under Florida law,  the rescue doctrine holds a tortfeasor liable for injuries  to a third party who is hurt in attempting to rescue the  direct victim of the tortfeasor. Zivojinovich v. Barner, 525  F.3d 1059, 1070 (11th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted). ""The  basic precept of this doctrine 'is that the person who has  created a situation of peril for another will be held in law      to have caused peril not only to the victim, but also to  his rescuer, and thereby to have caused any injury  suffered by the rescuer in the rescue attempt.'""  Menendez v. W. Gables Rehab. Hosp., LLC, 123 So. 3d  1178, 1181 (Fla. 3d DCA 2013) (quoting N.H. Ins. Co. v.  Oliver, 730 So. 2d 700, 702 (Fla. 4th DCA 1999)). As plaintiff correctly argues in response (Doc. #37, p.  21), the rescue doctrine is not implicated by plaintiff's  negligent rescue claim. See Krajcsik v. Ramsey, 2017  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143003, 2017 WL 3868560, *2 n.4 (D.  Md. Sept. 5, 2017) (""The rescue doctrine is related to,  but separate from, the affirmative duty to rescue an  imperiled party that the courts impose on persons in  some situations.""). Accordingly, because the rescue  doctrine is not applicable, Laxmi's request for dismissal  based on the doctrine is denied. 6. Aiding and Abetting, Harboring, Confining,  Coercion and Criminal Enterprise Finally, Count VI of the Complaint asserts a claim of  aiding and abetting against Laxmi. (Doc. #1, ¶¶ 226.)  Plaintiff [*41]  accuses Laxmi of ""aiding and abetting  unlawful  activity  including  unlawful  confinement,  imprisonment, assault and battery by [plaintiff's] sex  traffickers and 'Johns.'"" (Id.) Laxmi argues the claim  must be dismissed because (1) it asserts Laxmi ""aided  and abetted the criminal act of sex trafficking in  violation of the TVPRA,"" and (2) the TVPRA does not  provide a cause of action for aiding and abetting. (Doc.  #13, p. 22.) Having reviewed the allegations in the  Complaint and the relevant case law, the Court finds  Laxmi is misinterpreting the claim. Florida courts have recognized aiding and abetting the  commission of a tort as a standalone claim. See Gilison  v. Flagler Bank, 303 So. 3d 999, 1002 (Fla. 4th DCA  2020) (aiding and abetting fraud); MP, LLC v. Sterling  Holding, LLC, 231 So. 3d 517, 527 (Fla. 3d DCA 2017)  (aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty). This Court  has previously listed the following elements that must be  alleged ""to state a claim for aiding and abetting a  common law tort"" under Florida law: ""(1) an underlying         2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86849, *38 Page 14 of 14 violation on the part of the primary wrongdoer; (2)  knowledge of the underlying violation by the alleged  aider and abetter [sic]; and (3) the rendering of  substantial assistance in committing the wrongdoing by  the alleged aider and abettor."" Angell v. Allergan Sales,  LLC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142768, 2019 WL 3958262,  at *8 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 22, 2019); see also Lawrence v.  Bank of Am., N.A., 455 F. App'x 904, 906 (11th Cir.  2012) (applying the above elements to three [*42]   Florida tort claims). These cases demonstrate Florida  recognizes a common-law claim of aiding and abetting  tortious conduct. Here, the Complaint alleges Laxmi aided and abetted  plaintiff's  unlawful  harboring,  confinement,  imprisonment, assault and battery, and to the extent the  claim alleges Laxmi has actual knowledge, the Court  finds it sufficient to state a claim. Accordingly, the Court  denies Laxmi's request for dismissal. D. More Definite Statement Finally, Laxmi asserts that the Complaint is vague,  ambiguous, and fails to provide sufficient information to  allow Laxmi to formulate a response. (Doc. #13, pp. 22- 23.) Laxmi requests the Court exercise its discretion and  order plaintiff provide a more definite statement  pursuant to Rule 12(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure. (Id.) Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(e), ""[a]  party may move for a more definite statement of a  pleading to which a responsive pleading is allowed but  which is so vague or ambiguous that the party cannot  reasonably prepare a response."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e);  see also Euro RSCG Direct Response, LLC v. Green  Bullion Fin. Servs., 872 F. Supp. 2d 1353, 1358 (S.D.  Fla. 2012) (quoting Ramirez v. FBI, No. 8:10-cv-1819-T- 23TBM, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132271, 2010 WL  5162024, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 14, 2010)) (""A Rule 12(e)  motion is appropriate if the pleading is so vague or  ambiguous that the opposing party cannot respond,  even with a simple denial, in good faith, without  prejudice to [itself].""). [*43]  The Court finds the Complaint is not ""so vague or           ambiguous"" that Defendant could not reasonably  respond. Euro RSCG Direct Response, 872 F. Supp. 2d  at 1358 (""[A Rule 12(e)] motion is intended to provide a  remedy for an unintelligible pleading, rather than a  vehicle for obtaining greater detail.""); Eye Care Int'l, Inc.  v. Underhill, 92 F. Supp. 2d 1310, 1316 (M.D. Fla. 2000)  (noting that ""motions for a more definite statement are  not favored in light of the liberal discovery practice,"" and  that ""a motion for more definite statement is not to be  used as a substitute for discovery""); cf. LeBlanc v. LVNV  Funding, LLC, No. 2:19-cv-285-FtM-99MRM, 2019 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 99983, at *1 (M.D. Fla. June 14, 2019)  (granting motion for more definite statement, finding ""the  Complaint contains no facts"" and was ""not sufficiently  specific to place defendant on notice of the claims  against it""). Here, Plaintiff has provided specific facts about the  elements of each cause of action, Defendant's  purported knowledge and participation in ongoing and  continuous sex trafficking at the Super 8 by Wyndham  Naples in Naples, Florida, that occurred from 2014  through February 2016 with respect to Plaintiff, and its  failure to prevent this criminal conduct, which ultimately  resulted in Defendant profiting from the trafficking. The  Court finds such allegations are sufficiently specific to  place Defendant on [*44]  notice of the claims against it,  and as such, Defendant's Motion for a More Definite  Statement is denied. Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED: 1. Defendant Laxmi of Naples, LLC's Motion to  Dismiss, Motion to Strike, or For a More Definite  Statement and Memorandum of Law in Support  Thereof (Doc. #13) is DENIED. 2. Defendant Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc.'s  Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint (Doc. #14) is  DENIED. DONE and ORDERED at Fort Myers, Florida, this 6th  day of May, 2021. /s/ John E.

"Samsung Fire & Marine Ins. Co., Ltd. v. UFVS Mgmt. Co., LLC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46508","MEMORANDUM KENNEY, J. I. INTRODUCTION Plaintiff Samsung Fire and Marine Insurance, Co. LTD., U.S. Branch (""Samsung) brings a declaratory judgment  action against UFVS Management Company, LLC (""UFVS""), Roosevelt Motor Inn, Inc. (""Roosevelt Inc.""), Roosevelt  Inn, LLC (""Roosevelt LLC""), and Yagna Patel (""Patel"") (collectively, ""Policyholders"") seeking a declaration that  Samsung does not have a duty to defend or indemnify Policyholders in four state court actions brought [*5]  against  them. Third-Party Defendants Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and Harleysville Preferred Insurance  Company (collectively, ""Nationwide"") bring a similar declaratory judgment action against Policyholders. Additionally,  Third-Party Defendant ACE Property and Casualty Insurance Company (""ACE"") seeks dismissal of a Fourth  Amended Third-Party Complaint filed by Policyholders and seeks similar declaratory judgment. In turn,  Policyholders seek declaratory judgment against Samsung and, separately, against Nationwide. These motions are  fully briefed and, for the reasons set forth below, the Court will enter declaratory judgment in favor of Samsung,  Nationwide, and ACE (collectively, ""Providers""). II. BACKGROUND Four women allege, in separate state court actions, that they were victims of human sex trafficking at the Roosevelt  Inn in Philadelphia (the ""Hotel""), which was owned and operated by Policyholders at all relevant times. In relevant  part, the women contend that there were clear signs of their trafficking at the Hotel and that Policyholders  negligently failed to prevent or stop the sex trafficking scheme. Policyholders were insured by Providers at the  relevant times and seek coverage [*6]  against the state court claims accordingly. a. M.B. Action On March 10, 2017, a civil action was filed on behalf of M.B., a minor, against Policyholders in the Court of  Common Please of Philadelphia County. M.B. v. Roosevelt Inn, LLC, et al., Philadelphia Ct. Com. Pl., No.  170300712 (""M.B. Action""). M.B.'s Fourth Amended Complaint, filed November 8, 2019, correctly asserts that  human sex trafficking ""is a form of modern day slavery"" and is a ""form of evil in the abuse and exploitation of the  most innocent and vulnerable."" M.B. Action, Fourth Am. Compl. ¶ 1. According to the Fourth Amended Complaint, M.B. was trafficked for sex at the Hotel as early as 2014 (when M.B.  was fourteen years old). Id. ¶ 4. In support of her negligence claim, M.B. alleges that her traffickers frequently  lingered in the Hotel's hallways and on the premises while she was engaged in commercial sex acts, paid for motel  rooms in cash (because men paid for sex in cash), displayed ""Do Not Disturb"" signs, often refused housekeeping  services, and visibly treated M.B. in an aggressive manner when in public areas of the Hotel. Id. at ¶¶ 39-49. M.B.  alleges that she was forced to engage in multiple sex acts per day and [*7]  that the many men who purchased sex     2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46508, *4 Page 4 of 12 entered and exited her room frequently throughout her stay at the Hotel and were often loitering in the hallway. Id.  at ¶¶ 50-51. Indeed, she was trafficked so frequently that the rooms she occupied were often littered with used  condoms. Id. at ¶¶ 43-44. Despite her young age, M.B. wore sexually explicit clothing when in public spaces of the  Hotel and was often accompanied by older men. Id. at ¶¶ 45, 53. Though she stayed at the Hotel for extended  periods of time, she had very few personal items at the Hotel. Id. at ¶ 52. Additionally, throughout her extended  stays, M.B. exhibited visible fear and anxiety while in public spaces of the Hotel. Id. at ¶ 47. In sum, M.B. alleges that there were ""open and obvious"" signs of sex trafficking at the hotel and that Policyholders  knew or should have known that sex crimes were occurring at the Hotel. Id. at ¶ 57. M.B. alleges that, as a result of  Policyholders' shortcomings, she suffered physical harm, mental anguish, humiliation, exploitation, degradation,  mental distress, caught a sexually transmitted disease, and lost the enjoyments of life of life's pleasures. Id. at ¶¶  63-65. M.B. asserts that Policyholders' [*8]  actions were outrageous and in reckless disregard for M.B.'s health and  welfare, thereby warranting punitive damages. Id. at ¶¶ 66-67. Through her Fourth Amended Complaint, M.B.  asserts one count of negligence and one count of negligent infliction of emotional distress against Policyholders. Id.  at ¶¶ 68-77, 88-90. b. C.A. Action On March 27, 2019, a second action was filed against Policyholders by C.A. C.A. v. Roosevelt Inn, LLC, et al.,  Philadelphia Ct. Com. Pl., No. 190303355 (""C.A. Action""). The Second Amended Complaint, filed January 7, 2021,  is similar to that of M.B. and begins by reiterating the heinous nature of human sex trafficking. C.A. Action, Sec. Am.  Compl. at ¶ 1. C.A. alleges that she was trafficked at the Hotel between 2012 and 2013. Id. at ¶ 9. The trafficking  scheme and operative facts alleged by C.A. are virtually identical to those alleged by M.B. See generally, id. at ¶¶  55-120. Additionally, C.A. alleges that she had conversations with the Hotel's employees who knew or should have  known the purpose of her stay at the Hotel. Id. at ¶ 69. C.A. alleges similar harms to those of M.B. and similarly  alleges that Policyholders' actions were outrageous and in reckless [*9]  disregard for her health and welfare. Id. at  ¶¶ 117-118. C.A. asserts one count of negligence, one count of negligent infliction of emotional distress, and one  count of negligent hiring, training, and/or supervision against Policyholders. Id. at ¶¶ 121-131, 164-166, 176-182. c. B.H. Action On November 5, 2019, a third action was filed by B.H. B.H. v. Roosevelt Inn, LLC, et al., Philadelphia Ct. Com. Pl.,  No. 190303356 (""B.H. Action""). The Second Amended Complaint, filed January 12, 2021, is similar to the two prior  actions and again begins by highlighting the devastating impact of human sex trafficking. B.H. Action, Sec. Am.  Compl. at ¶¶ 1-7. B.H. alleges that she was trafficked from January 2013 through May 2013 before being rescued  by police at the Hotel. Id. at ¶ 80. The factual allegations asserted by B.H. are similar to those of C.A., including  allegations as to conversations with the Hotel's employees. Id. at ¶¶ 55-120. Similarly, C.A. asserts one count of  negligence, one count of negligent infliction of emotional distress, and one count of negligent hiring, training, and/or  supervision against Policyholders. Id. at ¶¶ 121-131, 164-166, 176-182. d. K.R. Action On November 5, 2019, [*10]  a fourth action was filed against Policyholders by K.R. K.R. v. Roosevelt Inn, LLC, et  al., Philadelphia Ct. Com. Pl., No. 191100552 (""K.R. Action""). K.R. alleges that she was trafficked for sex at the  Hotel from March 2013 through October 2013. K.R. Action, Compl. at ¶ 8. As in the prior actions, K.R.'s Complaint  begins by admonishing human trafficking as a ""form of evil in the abuse and exploitation of the most innocent and  vulnerable."" Id. at ¶ 1. The allegations asserted by K.R. are largely similar to those of M.B., C.A., and B.H.  Additionally, the K.R. Complaint includes quoted testimony of a trafficker in which the Hotel was likened to a ""strip   2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46508, *7 Page 5 of 12 club with girls wearing little to no clothing and [where] prostitution was open and obvious."" Id. at ¶ 63. Moreover, as  articulated in the Complaint, at least two security guards observed young girls loitering in the halls ""half-naked,""  men buying sex from the young girls, and pimps being aggressive or violent with the girls. Id. at ¶¶ 65-67. K.R. similarly alleges that, by renting rooms to the traffickers and allowing the trafficking to continue, Policyholders  caused K.R. to suffer physical harm, a sexually transmitted disease, mental [*11]  anguish, humiliation, exploitation,  degradation, mental distress, and loss of the enjoyments of life. Id. at ¶ 95. Like the other actions, K.R. also alleges  that Policyholders acted outrageously and in reckless disregard of her health and welfare, thereby warranting  punitive damages. Id. K.R. asserts one count of negligence, one count of negligent infliction of emotional distress,  and one count of negligent hiring, training and/or supervision against the Policyholders. Id. at ¶¶ 98-107, 128-130,  137-143. e. Insurance Policies The relevant insurance policies were provided by Nationwide, Samsung, and ACE. Nationwide insured  Policyholders under consecutive policies from April 1, 2012 through April 20, 2013. ECF No. 70 at 6-7.  Subsequently, Samsung issued two consecutive commercial package policies of insurance to UFVS d/b/a  Roosevelt LLC which collectively covered April 20, 2013 through April 20, 2015. ECF No. 71-4 at 10. The relevant  provisions of both the Nationwide and Samsung policies are those providing coverage for bodily injury and property  damage (Coverage A) and personal and advertising injury (Coverage B). Id.; ECF No. 70 at 7. Additionally, ACE  insured UFVS d/b/a Roosevelt LLC [*12]  under three consecutive Umbrella Plus Commercial Liability Policies from  April 2011 through April 2014. ECF No. 74 at 12. The ACE policies apply in excess of the underlying primary  policies issued by Samsung and Nationwide. Id. at 12-13. In relevant part, the ACE policies all include an exclusion  for abuse or molestation, which is not included in the underlying policies. Id. at 13. III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY Samsung initiated this declaratory judgment action on October 10, 2018 and it was assigned to the Honorable  Judge Jones. ECF No. 1. Pleadings were amended several times, and many motions mooted accordingly, to  address amendments made to the complaints in the underlying cases over the course of several years. Additionally,  the pleadings were expanded to encompass cross claims, counterclaims, and claims against and by additional  insurance providers. Ultimately, on January 6, 2020, Samsung filed a Second Amended Complaint (""Samsung  Complaint"") seeking a declaration that it does not have a duty to defend or indemnify Policyholders in the  underlying cases. ECF No. 50. Included in Policyholders' Answer to the Samsung Complaint was a counterclaim for  declaratory judgment against Samsung, to [*13]  which Samsung responded on January 23, 2020. ECF Nos. 52,  53. On February 12, 2020, Policyholders filed a Fourth Amended Third-Party Complaint (""Third-Party Complaint"")  against ACE and Nationwide. ECF No. 63. Through the Third-Party Complaint, Policyholders seek declaratory  judgment against both ACE and Nationwide and further assert a breach of contract claim against ACE. Id.  Nationwide filed an Answer to the Fourth Amended Complaint and brought a counterclaim for declaratory judgment  against Policyholders on February 19, 2020, to which Policyholders responded on March 2, 2020. ECF Nos. 66, 69.  On March 12, 2020, Nationwide filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings against Policyholders. ECF No. 70.  This motion was fully briefed throughout March and April 2020. ECF Nos. 77, 81, 83, 86. On March 13, 2020, Samsung filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings against Policyholders. ECF No. 71.  This motion was fully briefed throughout March and April 2020. ECF Nos. 76, 80, 82. Also on March 13, 2020,     2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46508, *10 Page 6 of 12 Policyholders filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings against Nationwide. ECF No. 72. This Motion was fully  briefed throughout Spring 2020. ECF Nos. 75, 84, 89, 92. Additionally, on [*14]  March 13, 2020, Policyholders filed  a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings against Samsung. ECF No. 73. This motion was fully briefed throughout  Spring 2020. ECF Nos. 78, 85, 89, 90. Finally, also on March 13, 2020, ACE filed a Motion to Dismiss the Fourth  Amended Complaint. ECF No. 74. This too was fully briefed throughout March and April 2020. ECF Nos. 79, 87. On November 3, 2020, Nationwide filed a Fourth Amended Complaint against Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance  Company (""Philadelphia Indemnity"") seeking a monetary judgment for costs and fees incurred in defending  Policyholders. ECF No. 94. On January 8, 2021, Philadelphia Indemnity filed an Answer and Counterclaim against  Nationwide, to which Nationwide responded on January 14, 2021. ECF Nos. 100, 102. Also on January 8, 2021,  Philadelphia Indemnity filed a Fifth-Party Complaint against Capitol Specialty Insurance Corporation (""Capitol  Specialty"") seeking declaratory judgment, among other relief. ECF No. 101. On February 26, 2021, Capitol  Specialty filed an Answer to Philadelphia Indemnity's Fourth Amended Complaint and, additionally, brought a  Counterclaim and Crossclaim for declaratory judgment against Policyholders, Samsung, [*15]  ACE, Nationwide,  and Philadelphia Indemnity. ECF No. 106. Nationwide, ACE, Philadelphia Indemnity, and Policyholders filed their  respective Answers throughout March 2021. ECF Nos. 107, 109, 110, 113. Samsung, in turn, filed a Motion to  Dismiss the claims brought by Capitol Specialty. ECF No. 108. Samsung's Motion to Dismiss was fully briefed in  March 2021. ECF No. 112. On June 16, 2021, Roosevelt LLC and Roosevelt Inc. filed for bankruptcy, which automatically stayed this case  pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 362. ECF No. 116. Subsequently, on March 2, 2022, Judge Jones ordered that this case  be placed in civil suspense and terminated all deadlines. ECF No. 120. On November 21, 2022, this case was  reassigned from the Honorable Judge Jones to this Court. ECF No. 125. That same day the Court lifted the stay in  its entirety and removed the case from suspense, as requested by counsel and permitted by the United States  Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. ECF No. 124-3 (Order permitting that the stay be lifted  ""solely to permit the continuance and adjudication of"" this action); ECF No. 126. On November 23, 2022, Samsung  filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority, to which ACE and Nationwide [*16]  subsequently joined. ECF Nos. 127,  130, 131. Policyholders subsequently opposed the supplemental authority. ECF No. 133. Samsung, ACE, and  Nationwide responded to Policyholders' opposition in January 2023. ECF Nos. 137, 138, 139. The Court held a  status conference with all parties on December 16, 2022 to discuss the open motions. ECF No. 132. The motions  pending before the Court have now been extensively briefed and are ripe for consideration. IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), a party may move for judgment on the pleadings after the pleadings  are closed, provided the party does so early enough not to delay trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). Such a motion are only  granted ""if, on the basis of the pleadings, the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed Cetera, LLC v.  Nat'l Credit Servs., Inc., 938 F.3d 466, 469 n.7 (3d Cir. 2019) (quoting DiCarlo v. St. Mary Hosp., 530 F.3d 255, 262  (3d Cir. 2008)). Courts in this circuit construe motions for judgment on the pleadings under the same standard as motions to  dismiss made pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Katzenmoyer v. City of Reading, 158 F. Supp. 2d 491, 496 (E.D. Pa.  2001). ""The only notable difference between these two standards is that the court in a motion on the pleadings  reviews not only the complaint but also the answer and written instruments attached to the pleadings."" Sprague v.  Neil, No. 1:05-CV-1605, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77767, 2007 WL 3085604, at *2 (M.D. Pa. Oct. 19, 2007) (citing 2  Moore's Fed. Practice Civil § 12.38 (2004)). As is also true generally, ""courts must consider the complaint in its      2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46508, *13 Page 7 of 12 entirety, as [*17]  well as . . . documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and matters of which a court  may take judicial notice."" Inst. Inv'rs Grp. v. Avaya, Inc., 564 F.3d 242, 252 (3d Cir. 2009). To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), ""a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,  accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'"" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.  Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167  L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). A complaint is plausible on its face when its factual allegations allow a court to draw a  reasonable inference that a defendant is liable for the harm alleged. Santiago v. Warminster Twp., 629 F.3d 121,  128 (3d Cir. 2010). A court must accept as true all factual allegations contained in a complaint and interpret them in  the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Argueta v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf't, 643 F.3d 60, 74 (3d  Cir. 2011). V. DISCUSSION Providers argue that there is no duty to defend or indemnify because of both the language of each respective policy  (or relevant exclusions) and because Pennsylvania public policy bars coverage. Assuming, arguendo, that the  policies trigger a duty to defend or indemnify, the Court would still have to decide the public policy question.  Accordingly, because the Court finds that public policy bars coverage as to all Providers and for the sake of judicial  economy, the Court solely addresses this issue. a. Legal Standard The interpretation of any contract, including [*18]  insurance policies, is a question of law for the Court to decide.  Kvaerner Metals Div. of Kvaerner U.S., Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 589 Pa. 317, 908 A.2d 888, 897 (Pa.  2006). Where the language of a policy is clear and unambiguous, such language must be given effect. Standard  Venetian Blind Co. v. American Empire Ins. Co., 503 Pa. 300, 469 A.2d 563, 566 (Pa. 1983). An insurer's defense  obligation is determined by the factual allegations of the underlying complaint which are taken as true and,  generally, construed in favor of coverage. See Gedeon v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 410 Pa. 55, 188 A.2d  320, 321-22 (Pa. 1963). Specifically, to prevent ""artful pleading designed to avoid policy exclusions,"" the facts  alleged in the underlying complaint are controlling—not the legal theories or requested relief. See Nautilus Ins. Co.  v. Motel Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 320 F. Supp. 3d 636, 640 (E.D. Pa. 2018) (""[T]he focus of the coverage inquiry is on  the substance, not the form, of the allegations.""); see also Kvaerner Metals Div. of Kvaerner U.S., 908 A.2d at 896  (""[A]n insurer's duty to defend is triggered, if at all, by the factual averments contained in [the underlying]  complaint.""). Because the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify, a finding that the former is not  triggered will also preclude the latter. Kvaerner Metals Div. of Kvaerner, 908 A.2d at 896 n.7. b. The Nautilus Decisions Providers assert that, even if the four corners of their respective policies provide coverage to Policyholders, public  policy requires declaratory judgment in their favor. This is an issue that has been contemplated to some degree by  several courts in this District and [*19]  the Third Circuit. Because the parties disagree as to both their precedential  value and their applicability to this case, the Court will describe each case in turn. Nautilus Ins. Co. v. Motel Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 320 F. Supp. 3d 636 (E.D. Pa. 2018) (hereinafter ""Nautilus I"") In Nautilus I, Nautilus Insurance Company (""Nautilus"") sought a declaration that it did not have a duty to defend and  indemnify its insured, Motel Management Services (""MMS""), in a state court action alleging that MMS negligently   2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46508, *16 Page 8 of 12 failed to prevent human sex trafficking occurring on its property. 320 F. Supp. 3d 636, 638 (E.D. Pa. 2018). In the  underlying action, plaintiff E.B. alleged that she was ""recruited, enticed, solicited, harbored and/or transported to  engage in commercial sex acts"" at a motel owned and operated by MMS. Id. She alleged that rooms at the motel  were paid for in cash, that she was ""visibly"" treated aggressively by her traffickers, that MMS knowingly permitted  the traffickers' activity on its property, that MMS financially profited from the sex trafficking, and that MMS failed to  intervene and report the trafficking. Id. at 638-39. Nautilus argued that it had no duty to defend or indemnify  because: (1) coverage was excluded by an ""all assault and battery"" exclusion in the relevant policy; and (2)  public [*20]  policy bars coverage of an insured for allegations of human trafficking. Id. at 638. The Nautilus I court first analyzed whether Nautilus had a duty to defend or indemnify because the relevant policy  contained an exclusion for all assault or battery. Id. at 640-43. After finding that this exclusion barred coverage, the  court also discussed public policy considerations. Though all but one of the claims asserted against MMS sounded  in negligence (including negligent violation of Pennsylvania Human Trafficking Law) and MMS had not been  criminally charged, the court provided that ""public policy precludes coverage"" because it is against public policy to  insure against criminal acts and ""financially benefitting from human sex trafficking is criminalized under the  Pennsylvania Human Trafficking Law."" Id. at 643; see also ECF No. 136-1 (E.B. Complaint). On appeal, the Third Circuit affirmed the district court's interpretation of the assault and battery exclusion and left  open whether public policy would also preclude insurance coverage. Nautilus Ins. Co. v. Motel Management Servs.,  Inc., 781 Fed. App'x 57, 60 n.5 (3d Cir. 2019) (""Because the insurance policy excludes coverage, we need not  address whether public policy would also preclude insurance coverage for the criminal conduct and intentional torts  alleged in [*21]  E.B.'s complaint""). Nautilus Ins. Co. v. Motel Mgmt. Servs., No. 20-cv-289, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139386, 2021 WL 3164292 (E.D. Pa.  July 27, 2021) (hereinafter ""Nautilus II021) (hereinafter ""Nautilus II"") Following Nautilus I, E.B. revised her underlying complaint to remove allegations related to being held at gunpoint  and Nautilus again sought declaratory judgment that it did not need to defend or indemnify MMS in the underlying  action. Nautilus II, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139386, [WL] at *1, *3. In her amended complaint, E.B. brought two  claims under the Pennsylvania Human Trafficking Law and four negligence claims. ECF No. 136-3. Nautilus again  argued that insurance coverage was precluded because of: (1) the ""all assault or battery"" exclusion; and (2) public  policy. Nautilus II, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139386, [WL] at *3. The Nautilus II court found that Nautilus was entitled  to declaratory judgment due to res judicata. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139386, [WL] at *1. Additionally, even if res  judicata did not apply, the court found that declaratory judgment was warranted both because of the ""all assault or  battery"" exclusion and because of public policy. Indeed, ""[t]he amended complaint in the underlying action still  seeks damages against the Insured Defendants for their facilitation of illegal conduct, . . . [t]herefore, the public  policy reasoning continues to apply."" Id. at *5 n.4. Nautilus Ins. Co. v. Motel Mgmt. Servs., No. 20-cv-1607, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170748, 2021 WL 4123915 (E.D.  Pa. Sept. 9, 2021) (hereinafter ""Nautilus III21) (hereinafter ""Nautilus III"") In nearly identical underlying complaints, G.D. and N.Z. alleged that they were victims of human sex trafficking that  occurred [*22]  at and was facilitated by MMS. Nautilus III, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170748, [WL] at *1. Specifically,  G.D. and N.Z. alleged that they were ""visibly treated in an aggressive manner"" and were ""forced to take crack  cocaine . . . and [were] 'shot up' with heroin."" 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170748, [WL] at *3. The underlying complaints  asserted one claim for the violation of Pennsylvania's Human Trafficking statute and three negligence claims. 2021  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170748, [WL] at *1. As in prior cases, Nautilus argued that coverage was barred under the policy's  ""all assault or battery"" exclusion and because of public policy. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170748, [WL] at *1. The  Nautilus III court reasoned that because the allegations were clearly assaults and/or batteries and were the ""but for""   2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46508, *19 Page 9 of 12 cause of the alleged injuries, the ""all assault or battery"" exclusion applied, and coverage was barred. 2021 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 170748, [WL] at *3. Additionally, the court provided that ""insurance coverage would be against public  policy."" Id. at n.31. In a consolidated appeal of both Nautilus II and III, the Third Circuit affirmed the denial of  coverage. Nautilus Ins. Co. v. Motel Mgmt. Servs., No. 21-2590, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 30033, 2022 WL 15722613  (3d Cir. Oct. 28, 2022). The Third Circuit's decision was based solely, and entirely, on the ""all assault or battery""  exclusion. Id. c. Public Policy Bars Coverage The Third Circuit has not decided the question posed today: whether public policy bars insurance coverage for  those allegedly involved [*23]  in enabling human trafficking. However, the Nautilus cases suggest consensus  among other courts in this district, which this Court now adopts. There is no duty to defend or indemnify against  actions arising out of an insured's criminal conduct related to the sex trafficking of minors. The Court appreciates  that it may make public policy the basis of a judicial decision only in ""the clearest of cases."" See Minnesota Fire &  Cas. Co. v. Greenfield, 579 Pa. 333, 855 A.2d 854, 868 (Pa. 2004) (quoting Hall v. Amica Mut. Ins. Co., 538 Pa.  337, 648 A.2d 755, 760 (Pa. 1994)). Yet, the Court strains to imagine a clearer case than the one presented here in  which the facts alleged indicate that Policyholders engaged in criminal conduct in violation of Pennsylvania's  Human Trafficking Law. In Greenfield, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that an insured cannot invoke their insurance policy to defend  against a civil action stemming from insured's criminal activity. Minnesota Fire & Cas. Co. v. Greenfield, 579 Pa.  333, 855 A.2d 854, 868 (Pa. 2004). The relevant issue presented in Greenfield was whether there was a duty to  defend an insured whose criminal conduct (selling Schedule I drugs) resulted in an unintended death in a  negligence action. Id. at 860. The court explained that the Commonwealth's enactment of a statute criminalizing the  alleged conduct provided a ""clear enunciation"" of public policy [*24]  such that insurers were not required to defend  or indemnify against damages arising out of insured's criminal conduct. Id. at 868-69. Indeed, unlike the negligent  violation of a federal equal pay statute or unlawful tax collections, public policy ""demand[ed]"" that the sale of a  Schedule I controlled substance be excluded from insurance coverage. Id. at 867 n. 14. Here, human sex  trafficking, which has been ""explicit[ly] criminaliz[ed]"" and has a ""high potential for abuse"" (to say the very least), is  more akin to illegal drug sales than the violation of equal pay or tax laws. See id. at 867. Indeed, other Courts in this  district have relied upon public policy to bar coverage for similarly repugnant conduct that infringes upon public  safety, morals, and welfare. See Teti v. Huron Ins. Co., 914 F.Supp. 1132, 1141 (E.D. Pa. 1996) (concluding that  public policy barred insuring against damages resulting from intercourse between a teacher and minor student). Here, the Pennsylvania Human Trafficking Law provides:                2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46508, *22 Page 10 of 12 (a) Offense Defined - A person commits a [first degree] felony if the person: (1) ""[R]ecruits, entices, solicits, advertises, harbors, transports, provides, obtains, or maintains an individual if  the person knows or recklessly disregards that [*25]  the individual will be subject to sexual servitude; [or] (2) [K]nowingly benefits financially or receive anything of value from any act that facilitates any activity  described in paragraph (1)[.]"" 18 Pa. C.S. § 3011. Where an element involves a result of a person's conduct, such as here, a person acts  knowingly if they are ""aware that it is practically certain that [their] conduct will cause such a result."" Id. at § 302. A  person acts recklessly by ""consciously disregard[ing] a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element  exists or will result from his conduct."" Id. The risk must be ""of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature  and intent of the actor's conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from  the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the [person's] situation."" Id. The ""factual allegations contained in the [underlying] complaint"" are determinative of whether a duty to defend or  indemnify is triggered, rather than the cause of action pled. Mutual Benefit Ins. Co. v. Haver, 555 Pa. 534, 725 A.2d  743, 745 (Pa. 1999). Based on the facts alleged, rather than the theory of liability pled, the Pennsylvania legislature  ""has criminalized the conduct that resulted in the damages"" in the underlying case. [*26]  See Greenfield, 855 A.2d  at 868. Each complaint alleges that Policyholders ignored open and obvious signs of sex trafficking including, but  not limited to: (1) rooms littered with used condoms; (2) men loitering outside of the hotel rooms; (3) rooms paid for  in cash; (4) frequent refusal of housekeeping; (5) aggression directed at the young victims (approximately 14-16  years old) in public spaces; (6) young victims (approximately 14-16 years old) wearing sexually explicit clothing; (7)  different men entering and exiting the hotel rooms; and (8) young victims (approximately 14-16 years old) exhibiting  fear and anxiety in public spaces. See supra II(a)-(d). Collectively, these facts allege what a trafficker later  confirmed: that the Hotel ""operated like a strip club where prostitution was open and obvious."" K.R. Action, Compl.  at ¶ 63. Indeed, police rescued at least one trafficking victim from the Hotel premises prior to or concurrent with the  trafficking of other victims. B.H. Action, Compl. at ¶ 80. These facts, if true, make plain that Policyholders knowingly benefitted from acts facilitating the trafficking scheme  by renting rooms to traffickers despite the overwhelming evidence of the trafficking scheme. [*27]  Moreover, even if  Policyholders did not knowingly benefit, at the very least, Policyholders looked the other way and feigned ignorance  when confronted with clear indicia of sex trafficking. Indeed, the underlying facts alleged leave no question that  Policyholders harbored the underlying plaintiffs in reckless disregard of the sex trafficking that would result.  Plainly, Policyholders' continued business dealings with traffickers and harboring of underlying plaintiffs represent a  gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in a similar situation.  Accordingly, the Court is convinced that the factual allegations contained in the M.B., B.H., C.A., and K.R.  complaints implicate Policyholders' conduct that is criminalized under the Pennsylvania Human Trafficking Law  and repugnant to Pennsylvania public policy. As reasoned by Pennsylvania courts, it is against public policy to  provide insurance for loss attributable to particularly harmful criminal conduct. See Greenfield, 855 A.2d at 860.  Here, shielding Policyholders from the consequences of their criminal conduct would be against the safety, morals,            2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46508, *24 Page 11 of 12 and welfare of the Commonwealth. Therefore, public policy bars coverage and [*28]  Providers do not have a duty  to defend or indemnify Policyholders in the underlying state court actions.",1
"Shultz v. Cnty. of Franklin, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217077","REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION I. Introduction. The plaintiff, Allen L. Shultz, III (""Shultz""), claims that the  legal proceedings surrounding the dissolution of his  marriage were rife with illegalities, including federal  crimes, constitutional violations, and violations of the  Americans with Disabilities Act (""ADA""). Doc. 8 at 1, 5.  We  reviewed  Shultz's  first  amended  complaint,  concluded that it failed to state a claim upon which relief  can be granted and, accordingly, recommended that the  court dismiss Shultz's complaint and grant him leave to  amend his complaint a second time. Doc. 9. On  September 18, 2023, Judge Wilson adopted our  recommendation. Doc. 21. And on October 10, 2023,  Shultz filed a second amended complaint. Doc. 22. After  reviewing Shultz's second amended complaint, we  conclude that it still fails to state a claim upon which  relief can be granted. We, therefore, recommend that  the court dismiss Shultz's second amended complaint,  without leave to amend. II. Background and Procedural History. Shultz initiated this suit on March 10, 2023, by filing a  complaint and a motion for leave to proceed in  forma [*2]  pauperis, which we granted. Docs. 1, 2, 3.  We advised that we would conduct a preliminary review  prior to issuing the summons and, because Shultz filed  an amended complaint (""first amended complaint) on  March  20,  2023,  we  ultimately  conducted  our  preliminary review of the first amended complaint. Docs.  7, 8. We recommended that the court dismiss the first  amended complaint for failure to state a claim but grant  Shultz an opportunity to file a second amended  complaint.  Doc.  8.  The  court  adopted  our  recommendation (doc. 21) and Shultz filed a second  amended complaint (doc. 22) on October 10, 2023. On  October 24, 2023, Shultz filed a flash drive containing  ""exhibits"" to be attached to the second amended  complaint.Doc. 23. The following facts are taken from              Page 2 of 17 the second amended complaint. A. Defendants. The  second  amended  complaint  identifies  51  defendants. Doc. 22. Shultz brings claims against three  individuals he describes as ""private persons"": his exwife,  Faith Shultz (""Faith""); Faith's girlfriend, Vicky Eshe  (""Eshe""); and a real estate appraiser, Timothy  Ausherman (""Ausherman""). Id. at 90-94. Shultz also  identifies 5 private attorneys as defendants: (1) Maria  Cognetti (""Attorney [*3]  Cognetti""), Faith's attorney; (2)  Martha  Walker  (""Attorney  Walker""),  who  briefly  represented Shultz in his divorce from Faith; (3) Archie  Diveglia (""Attorney Diveglia""), who also represented  Shultz in his divorce from Faith; (4) Jeff Troutman  (""Attorney Troutman""), who represented Shultz in a  bankruptcy action; and (5) Gary Imblum (""Attorney                                     Imblum""), who worked with Attorney Troutman on  Shultz's bankruptcy action. Id. at 85-88. Additionally,  Shultz names Karen Sheriff, Attorney Cognetti's  paralegal, as a defendant as well, although she does  not appear in the factual allegations of the second  amended complaint. Id. at 84. Shultz also names  Timothy Sponseller (""Attorney Sponseller"") as a  defendant under the title ""Administrative Office of the  Courts[.]"" Id. at 80-81. Attorney Sponseller is, according  to Shultz, Judge Sponseller's uncle. Id. at 80. Attorney  Sponseller appears nowhere in the factual allegations of  the second amended complaint. Shultz names six Franklin County Judges (""Franklin  County Judicial Defendants"") as defendants: (1) Senior  Judge Carol Van Horn (""Judge Van Horn""); (2) Judge  Todd Michael Sponseller (""Judge Sponseller""); (3)  President Judge Shawn Myers (""Judge Myers""); [*4]  (4)  Judge Mary Beth Shank (""Judge Shank""); (5) Judge  Angela Krom (""Judge Krom""); and (6) Judge Jeremiah  Zook (""Judge Zook""). Id. at 75-78. Shultz also names  four Pennsylvania Superior Court Judges (""Superior  Court Judicial Defendants""), none of whom are named  in the factual allegations of the second amended  complaint: (1) Judge Debroah Kunzleman (""Judge  Kunzleman""); (2) Judge Daniel McCafferty (""Judge  McCafferty""); (3) Judge James Colins (""Judge Colins"").  Id. at 79-80. Shultz also identifies many defendants as being  associated with or employed by the Franklin County  Domestic Relations Section (""DRS""). See id. at 81-82,  85, 88-89. Shultz names five ""County Employees under  DRS"" (""DRS employees""): (1) Anne Verdel (""Verdel"");  (2) Jennifer Muzzio (""Muzzio""); (3) Katherine Wilburne  (""Wilburne""); (4) Mandy Olson (""Olson""); and (5) Troy  Young (""Young""). Id. at 81. None of the DRS employees  appear in the factual allegations of the second amended  complaint. See generally id. Shultz also names five             Page 3 of 17 individuals who he identifies as ""Head Contractors  under [DRS]"" (""Contractor Defendants""): (1) the DRS  Director, Teresa Anthony (""Director [*5]  Anthony""); (2)  Jennifer Newman (""Attorney Newman""); (3) Jodi Foose  (""Foose"");  (4)  Anne  Johnson  (""Support  Master  Johnson""); and (5) James Stein (""Support Master  Stein""). See id. at 81-82, 84. According to Shultz,  Support Master Stein is the ""Support/ Divorce Master[.]""  Id. at 88-89 (unnecessary capitalization omitted). Shultz also identifies as defendants three ""County  Commissioners"" (""the County Commissioners""), who  are neither named nor identified by title in the factual  allegations of the second amended complaint. Shultz  also brings claims against eight defendants associated  with the Sheriff's Office (""Sheriff's Office Defendants""):  six sheriff's deputies or security guards (""John Does"");  Sheriff Dane Anthony (""Sheriff Anthony""), who is  identified as the husband of Director Anthony and not  otherwise named in the second amended complaint;  and Chief Deputy Benjamin Sites (""Deputy Sites""), who  also is not named in the factual allegations of the  second amended complaint. Id. at 82-83. Finally, Shultz names 11 members of the Judicial  Conduct Board as defendants (""Judicial Conduct Board  Defendants""): (1) Melissa Norton, [*6]  Chief Counsel;  (2) the Honorable William C. Wenner; (3) Nancy L.  Clemens; (4) the Reverend James P. McCloskey; (5)  the Honorable Susan P. Grantman; (6) the Honorable  Renée Cohn Jubelirer; (7) Andrew E. Masich; (8)  Michael Brunelle; (9) Attorney Scott B. Cooper; (10)  Attorney Sudhir R. Patel; and (11) Tara Mobley. Id. at  94-96. B. Factual Allegations. Shultz states that the ""central subject matter"" of the  instant case is his disability status. Doc. 22 at 11. But  the allegations of the second amended complaint all  arise out of the dissolution of Shultz's marriage to Faith.          See id. generally. Shultz invites the court to examine not  only the defendants' behavior in dividing marital assets  but also the marriage itself and the cause of its  dissolution. See id. According to Shultz, he and Faith wed on August 23,  1986. Id. at 7. At the beginning of the marriage, Shultz  worked in logging and excavating, and Faith worked at  Knouse Foods. Id. at 8. When Faith had their first son,  however, she stopped working outside the home. Id.  Shultz continued working in logging and excavating as  their family grew by three more sons. Id. at 8. In 1991  and 1992, Shultz had two ""major back surgeries,"" and in  2010, [*7]  Shultz had thoracotomy surgery (""the 2010  surgery""). Id. at 8. After the 2010 surgery, Shultz  transitioned  to  working  in  ""lighter  residential  contracting."" Id. at 8. Shultz describes his marriage to Faith as ""successful""  (id. at 93) until 2014.Id. at 22. Per Shultz, he and Faith  attended church, ""jointly"" homeschooled their four sons,  and lived in a house Shultz built on 28 acres of land. Id.  at 8. Shultz states that Faith ""enjoyed relaxed status as  a stay at home [sic] mom with 4 productive young men  for lots of household help."" Id. at 8. In Shultz's view,  Faith ""would come and go as she pleased, and run with  her friends, while [Shultz] was bound by the marital  responsibilities."" Id. And Shultz claims that, when their  four sons entered adulthood, he attempted to ""train""  their sons ""so that they would be prepared to be  productive young men[.]"" Id. at 9. Meanwhile, Faith  ""bred rebellion"" into their sons. Id. On December 18, 2014, Faith initiated a separation  (""first separation""), leaving the marital home to live with  her mother. Id. at 22. According to Shultz, Faith left him  because he was ""conserv[ing]"" ""the family resources""  and ""restructuring the marital equity[.]"" Id. Further, [*8]   Shultz characterizes the first separation as a product of  alienation of affections, committed by Eshe. Id. at 22.  The first separation lasted for approximately ten months.  Id. During this time, on June 24, 2015, the Social                            Page 4 of 17 Security Administration determined that Shultz was  eligible for disability benefits. Id. at 10. The second  amended complaint is not entirely clear on his  disabilities, although Shultz outlines his previous  surgeries, stating he was ""cut in half"" and that the  ""hardware is broken"" from one of the back surgeries he  underwent in 1991 and 1992. See id. at 8. After approximately ten months, Faith ended the first  separation by returning to the marital home, a decision  Faith describes as ""coerced""—falsely, according to  Shultz. Id. at 22. Faith and Shultz resumed a marital  relationship, ""including sexual relations at the good will  of [Shultz]."" Id. During this reconciliation, however, Faith  ""maintained a rebellious spirit[,] taunting [Shultz] by  further close associations, and non repentance [sic] of  her former actions."" Id. at 22-23. Further, per Shultz,  Faith sought an allowance from Shultz in an amount  equal to the payments she had previously received from  Social Security [*9]  Insurance through some sort of  alleged scheme. Id. at 24. Despite pastoral advice, Faith  initiated a second period of separation (""second  separation"") on June 30, 2016, ""without due cause[.]"" Id.  at 23. The second separation appears to have ended in  divorce, although Shultz does not clearly state when or  if the divorce was finalized. See id. generally. The  remaining allegations in the second amended complaint  all relate to the division of assets. According to Shultz, the ""defendants are playing fast  and loose with the entirety of the Shultz Marital Estate  [that Shultz] acquired with little assistance [from Faith].""  Id. at 14. Shultz alleges that the DRS ""slammed"" him  with a support order of $921 per month, ""effectively  forcing [Shultz] into debt slavery, peonage, and . . .  dishonor,  and  default  from  the  defendants[']  [i]nterference with [i]nterstate commerce."" Id. at 21.  Shultz alleges that the support order ""is fraudulent""  because it is ""based on false speculative figures of  assumption, presumption, and hearsay[.]"" Id. at 21.  Shultz also alleges that $807 of his $1,045 monthly  Social Security benefit now goes to Faith. Id. at 11. He  classifies this as ""stealing."" Id. at 11. Further, [*10]   Shultz complains about the division of marital assets,  alleging that ""the defendants are set to put $675,000 of  false claims 'debts' [sic] onto the disabled husband who  worked his guts out for all, while giving the maliciously  abandoning [Faith] over $350,000 of readily liquidable  [sic], unburdened properties on top of seizing his [social  security disability (""SSD"") b]enefits every month."" Id. at  11. Shultz also alleges that he has been ""fined"" $5,000  for Faith's attorneys fees. Id. at 13. Shultz claims that  this ""fine"" puts him at risk of contempt of court because  all actors know Shultz will be unable to afford to pay the  fine.Id. at 13. Further, according to Shultz, ""the  extreme inequity"" of the division of assets is evidence of  ""retaliation of his continued redress of their crimes."" Id.  at 40. Shultz theorizes that the state benefits directly from  falsely increasing spousal support. See generally id.  According to Shulz, The wrongly perceived 'monied' parent rather than  the wife, is made to pay child/spousal support[,] not  so the child/spouse can benefit, but so the state  can benefit financially in de facto partnership with  the non-monied spouse by using them as leverage  to extract [*11]  money from the monied parent and  the federal government. Id. at 36. Specifically, per Shultz, the DRS, Stein, Judge  Sponseller,  Judge  Myers,  and  the  Contractor  Defendants ""are all profiting from title 4 Federal Grants,  and Incentives in unlawful conversions of [Shultz's]  stolen Social Security Benefits, and the confiscation of  his marital estate through scheme, scam, and fraud, and  corrupt agency practices."" Id. at 25. Shultz further  alleges that ""the defendants"" are using null and void  orders to reach various thresholds to increase funding  and ""garner incentives."" Id. at 31. Shultz also alleges  that the defendants are acting out of ""Psychotic  SHARED PERSECUTORY DELUSIONS[,]"" attempting  to ""cover their crimes[,]"" and ""retaliat[ing] for [Shultz's]  constitutional redress."" Id. at 17. According to Shultz, the defendants are accessing these  benefits through various illegal acts. Shultz believes that  the defendants act together to steal social security  benefits from him (and others) by finding a heightened  earning capacity such that the social security benefits  are paid in alimony to Faith and then accessed by the  other defendants. See, e.g., id. at 18. Central to these  efforts are the defendants' [*12]  efforts to dispute that  Shultz is disabled, despite Shultz's repeated attempts to  proffer evidence thereof. See id. at 11, 19, 20, 34.  Shultz states that the defendants are denying his  ""certified disability status [which] immunizes him from an  assigned income earning capacity, and exploitation, and  extortion as a protected class of citizen."" Id. at 37. And,       Page 5 of 17 according to Shultz, ""these defendants"" are lying to the  court about his income. Id. at 13. Shultz further alleges  that the ""signatory defendants"" are using case  precedent improperly to impute earning capacity to  Shultz. Id. at 17. The defendants, Shultz states, are also  forcing certain properties into foreclosure as a method  of liquidation to ""clear the titles[,]"" while also refusing  other property sales which Shultz sought to pay marital  debts. Id. at 32, 38. Shultz also alleges that the  defendants are attempting to ""convolute"" the date of  separation in order to somehow get all of his SSD  benefits. Id. at 23. Shultz also alleges certain actions taken by specific  defendants in order to further this elaborate scheme.  Per Shultz, ""[t]he DRS, and other Contractors (Domestic  Relations Section) Defendants"" were dishonest and  ""willfully [*13]   misleading""  when  conducting  their  ""investigative, fiduciary duties[,]"" imputing inflated  income earning capacities to Shultz. Id. at 29. And,  according to Shultz, in 2016 the ""Domestic Relations  Section Defendants, [sic] and the Court Defendants""  refused to toll the time limit for Shultz's medical  evaluations, thereby violating due process. Id. at 20.  Pointing to eight years' worth of denied motions, Shultz  states that Support Master Stein ""is a liar"" who defers to  Attorney Cognetti. Id. at 14. Shultz also alleges that  Support Master Stein has a conflict of interest based on  a former business relationship with Judge Zook, who  once denied a motion to modify the support order. Id. at  35. And Faith, allegedly, ""refused to act amicably in  order to at least maintain the integrity of the status quo  of the marital estate."" Id. at 38. Shultz also includes a number of allegations against  Judge Sponseller. ""Judge Todd Sponseller acting in  ultra vires under Title 4 contract as administrative law  clerk, and debt collector for the county, ordered his  sister in law support master Kristin Nicklaus to calculate  a repugnant support order on [Shultz] 'as if he is not  disabled' . . . in order to cleverly [*14]  absorb the  entirety of his social security disability benefits as well  as shove him into debt slavery, and peonage in  retaliation for enumerating the bad actors clearly prima  facie crimes against [Shultz]."" Id. at 24 (errors in  original). Shultz further alleges that Judge Sponseller  ""clearly worked together"" with Attorney Cognetti ""to  violate [Shultz's] clearly established disability rights, and  immunities."" Id. at 32. Ostensibly to evidence this,  Shultz points to Judge Sponseller's statement in court to  Attorney Cognetti: ""'we need to word this properly  (convolute the record), so that when the upper courts  read it, they will know what we are talking about[.]'"" Id. According  to  Shultz,  these  actions  have  also  discriminated against him due to his disability. See  generally id. For example, per Shultz, Anne Johnson  once ""verbally chastised"" him and issued ""repugnant""  support orders despite Shultz's ""disability immunity."" Id.  at 21. Shultz further alleges that the defendants issued  orders that ""were purposeful discrimination against his  federal disability status and immunities[.]"" Id. at 28.  Smith also describes several violations of his ADA  rights that occurred during an in-person hearing [*15]   over which Support Master Stein presided: Plaintiff had requested ADA accommodations. The  clerk of court promised those accommodations.  When Plaintiff showed up the day of trial, the  accommodations  were  not  available.  Upon  Plaintiff's request of Franklin County Sheriff's  guards, Plaintiff was first told he had to park a block  away across traffic, than later ""there was no place  for him to lie down so he could recuperate at  breaks, as required by the accommodation request,  and promise under the courts own ADA bragged  compliance on every order they send out. Disabled  Plaintiff was told by Sheriffs deputies he would  have to lie on the floor if he needed to lie down.  That is unacceptable. The Defendants all treated  innocent disabled Plaintiff as if he was hardened  convicted criminal who had no rights. [Support  Master] Stein did allow a few measly breaks, which  didn't help because Plaintiff could only lie on the  floor a few minutes, and not recoup any vigor to  continue. Plaintiff's car was a block away across  traffic. Even After an hour at home Plaintiff has to  lie down, or can become very symptomatic.  Defendants pushed Plaintiff well past the clearly  evident physical distress of his disabilities. [*16]   Within an hour of sham predetermined trial, Plaintiff  started to lose cognitive comprehension of the trial  due to having to deal with the oncoming symptoms  overcoming him, and being severely restricted of  being able to medicate or act otherwise to mitigate  the ramping symptoms. [Support Master] Stein as  officiator of the star chamber tribunal failed to even  offer any medical assistance, and pretended  Plaintiff was not lying on the floor in severe pain  difficulty breathing,while [Support Master] Stein, in  callous disregard, tried to continue the hearing  when it was obvious Plaintiff was in no physical, or  mental condition to proceed.   Page 6 of 17 Id. at 33-34 (errors in original). James Stein then  concealed these ADA violations from the record,  according to Shultz. Id. at 33. Shultz also alleges wrongdoing by his own attorneys in  various matters. Attorney Walker, per Shultz, was  ""willfully absent"" from a 2016 hearing related to the  divorce proceedings. Id. at 21. According to Shultz, he  had retained Attorney Walker but she ""claimed 'support  master Anne Johnson of domestic relations is a friend of  mine, I know the decision she is going to make,  therefore, I cannot represent you, and ruin my  reputation.'"" [*17]  Id. Attorney Walker filed a praecipe to  withdraw, but only two weeks after the hearing in  question. Id. Shultz later hired Attorney Diveglia for the  divorce proceedings, but Attorney Diveglia later had to  withdraw his representation soon after Shultz filed  bankruptcy. Id. Shultz states that Attorney Diveglia had  to withdraw ""due to the trial court[']s prejudice against  [him] for objecting to [Judge] Sponseller's attempts to  use  hearsay  as  evidentiary  without  lawful  substantiation."" Id. at 35. Attorney ""Diveglia under his  own admission, 'is black balled from taking any clients  within Franklin County 39th District Court of Pa.['] in that  any client of his would suffer extreme prejudice by the  39th district court actors[.]"" Id. Shultz refers to a bankruptcy proceeding as ""the sister  causes of action"" and states his intention to ""enjoinder  to this case"" a bankruptcy proceeding.Id. at 17.  According to Shultz, ""[t]he Bankruptcy courts acted in  discrimination of Plaintiff's disabilities, and his Pro Se  status. The Bankruptcy court denied Plaintiff's due  process to a 363H hearing to sell properties while  Plaintiff held good faith sales contracts of which sales  would have helped satisfy creditors."" [*18]  Id. Shultz  alleges that he hired Attorney Imblum for the bankruptcy  proceeding in 2020 and that Attorney Imblum hired  Attorney Troutman ""onto [Shultz's] case without  consent."" Id. Attorneys Imblum and Troutman then  conspired with Attorney Cognetti ""to have [Shultz] jailed  for contempt of court from the courts peonage [sic], so  they could steal the marital properties while [he] would  be unlawfully in jail."" Id. And Shultz alleges that an  unnamed real estate agent was involved in this scheme  in some unspecified way. Further, according to Shultz,  Attorneys Imblum and Troutman ""refused[ ] to make  affirmative defense against high profile Attorney  Cognetti[.]"" Id. ""Eventually[, Shultz could no longer hold     bankruptcy  plan  solvent  due  to  sabotage,  and  interference of interstate commerce by Defendants."" Id. Shultz also alludes to participating in the appeals  process with the state court, although he is not clear  which orders he appealed or the results of these  appeals. Shultz alleges that ""[t]he trial courts, and now  the superior court is upholding, withour procedural, or  substantant due process, AND without substantiation, in  false debt claims, repugnant null,and void orders in  severe retaltiation [*19]  against innocent disabled  plaintiff."" Id. at 13 (errors in original). And, according to  Shultz, the Superior Court ""vacate/ remanded [sic]""  some of Judge Sponseller's orders on January 23,  2019, but Judge Sponseller ""never vacated, and  remanded only to [retaliate], and once again abused  discretion[.]"" Id. at 26. Further, per Shultz, the Superior  Court now ""refuses to enforce"" it's January 23, 2019  order vacating and remanding Judge Sponseller's  orders. Id. Despite these allegations against the Superior Court,  Shultz also alleges that ""the defendants"" are somehow  conspiring to deny him access to appeals ""through  administrative fiat, un constitutional [sic] appeals fees,  and the application of unconstitutional rules[.]"" Id. at 32.  ""[Shultz's] appeals were withdrawn for non payment [sic]  of their barratry fees."" Id. ""At one time [Judge]  Sponseller unlawfully revoked in[ ]forma pauperis  denying access to appeal courts, th[e]n reinstated it  after the toll period had gone, simply so that naïve  Plaintiff could not effectively appeal."" Id. at 32-33. On September 29, 2022, Shultz filed a judicial conduct  board complaint alleging that Judge Sponseller ""acting  Ultra Vires in conjunction with other [*20]  listed  defendants has, and is [sic] engaged in treason, warring  against his oath of office[.]"" Id. at 31. Although the  judicial conduct board complaint was ""well researched  and produced[,]"" the Judicial Conduct Board dismissed  it ""arbitrarily, and capriciously"" ""without any due process  of review, no findings of fact, nor conclusions of law."" Id.  at 31-32. Shultz concludes that ""[t]he Judicial [C]onduct  [B]oard  is  nothing  less  than  a  gatekeeping  administration protecting the judges unless there is  some kind of legal infighting and they can use it to  attack a political opponent."" Id. at 32. C. Claims and Relief Sought. Shultz spends approximately 15 pages of the second  amended complaint listing statutes under which he  brings ""Claims of Damages[.]"" Id. at 43-57. Of the 65  Page 7 of 17 federal statutes and regulations Shultz cites, 53 do not  provide a private cause of action. Shultz also brings  claims for civil rights violations and under the Americans  with Disabilities Act (""ADA""), and the Rehabilitation Act  (""RA""). See id. In this section, Shultz does not  distinguish against which defendants he brings each  claim. See id. Shultz also identifies claims specific to certain  defendants which, in some cases, clarify against whom  he brings certain claims identified [*21]  by statute  earlier in the second amended complaint. See id. at 72- 95. Sometimes these lists of claims also include general  allegations of wrongdoing for which we have been  unable to find a cause of action. For example, Shultz  attempts to bring claims against the Franklin County  Judicial Defendants for ""malfeasance, misfeasance, non  feasance, misprision, neglect to protect. collusion,  conspiracy, RICO, Nepotism, Cronyism, Patronage,  Trading in Influence, Title 4grants, and incentives,  Gombeenism and Parochialism."" Id. at 74 (errors in  original). After carefully reviewing the second amended  complaint in its entirety, we find that Shultz is also  bringing  claims  for  violations  of  the  Racketeer  Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (""RICO"") and  Freedom of Information Act (""FOIA"") violations. See,  e.g., id. at 74, 82. Shultz also brings state claims. See  generally id. Shultz requests that the court ""vacate repugnant null,  and void orders of the trial court in a 60 b motion to  dismiss due to fraud, fraud on the courts, et,al."" Id. at 97  (errors in original). Shultz also requests the following:  (1) ""Cease, and desist extortion of Social [S]ecurity  benefits by Domestic Relations, order refund in Replevin  En cepit [sic] the [*22]  entirety of benefits stolen under  color of law times four""; (2) ""Stay all transfers of real  estate except those that are to be sold under pre  separation signatory obligations""; (3) ""Stay all county tax  sales on the properties now dismissed from bankruptcy  protections until remedy is adjudicated""; (4) ""Seize             residual marital real estate properties for immediate  sales, and proceeds paid to the creditors""; (5) ""Provide  full Constitutional authority of Plaintiff to engage in  commerce""; (6) ""Take Judicial Notice, and order lower  courts to acknowledge the certified Disability status of  the Plaintiff, and order courts to take actions to remedy  the ADA accommodations [sic] cause of action as well  as  properly  adjudicate  the  Domestic  Relations  assessment acknowledging the same""; (7) ""Order  Protection  from  abuse  from  these  high  profile  Defendants""; (8) ""appoint ADA counsel to assist  Disabled plaintiff in the administrative duties of this  cause of action under victims rights""; and (9) ""kindly  put a stop to the egregious abuse[.]"" Id. at 97-98.  Although Shultz has a section in his second amended  complaint titled ""Memorandum of law, Claims of  Damages"" he does not clearly state the damages he  seeks, [*23]  instead listing in this section 15 pages of  statutes, as described above. We also must note that  Shultz seeks ""protection from abuse orders against all  Defendants."" Id. at 14. III. Review of In Forma Pauperis Complaints— Standard of Review. This court has a statutory obligation to conduct a  preliminary review of complaints brought by plaintiffs  proceeding in forma pauperis. Specifically, the court  must review the complaint in accordance with 28 U.S.C.  § 1915(e), which provides, in pertinent part: (2) Notwithstanding any filing fee, or any portion  thereof, that may have been paid, the court shall  dismiss the case at any time if the court determines  that— . . . (B) the action or appeal— . . . (ii) fails to state a claim on which relief may be  granted . . . . This statutory text mirrors the language of Rule 12(b)(6)  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides  that a complaint should be dismissed for ""failure to state  a claim upon which relief can be granted."" Fed. R. Civ.  P. 12(b)(6). ""A Rule 12(b)(6) motion tests the sufficiency of the    Page 8 of 17 complaint against the pleading requirements of Rule  8(a)."" I.H. ex rel. D.S. v. Cumberland Valley Sch. Dist.,  842 F. Supp. 2d 762, 769-70 (M.D. Pa. 2012). ""Under  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a pleading must  contain a 'short and plain statement of the claim  showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.'"" Ashcroft v.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 677-78 (2009) (quoting Fed. R. Civ.  P. 8(a)(2)). The statement required by Rule 8(a)(2) must  give the defendant fair notice of the [*24]  nature of the  plaintiff's claim and of the grounds upon which the claim  rests. Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007).  Detailed factual allegations are not required, but more is  required than ""labels,"" ""conclusions,"" or ""a formulaic  recitation of the elements of a cause of action."" Bell  Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). ""In  other words, a complaint must do more than allege the  plaintiff's entitlement to relief."" Fowler v. UPMC  Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 211 (3d Cir. 2009). ""A  complaint has to 'show' such an entitlement with its  facts."" Id. A complaint filed by a pro se litigant is to be liberally  construed and ""'however inartfully pleaded, must be  held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings  drafted by lawyers.'"" Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (quoting  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976)). ""[A] court  must make reasonable allowances to protect pro se  litigants from the inadvertent forfeiture of important  rights due merely to their lack of legal training."" Garrett  v. Wexford Health, 938 F.3d 69, 92 (3d Cir. 2019). Thus,  ""[c]ourts are more forgiving of pro se litigants for filing  relatively unorganized or somewhat lengthy complaints.""  Id. Nevertheless, ""pro se litigants still must allege  sufficient facts in their complaints to support a claim.""  Mala v. Crown Bay Marina, Inc., 704 F.3d 239, 245 (3d  Cir. 2013). IV. Discussion. Liberally  construing  Shultz's  second  amended  complaint, we assume factual assertions contained  within are true, but we are under no obligation to do so  with legal conclusions [*25]  that lack factual support.  We nevertheless conclude that the second amended  complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be  granted. Shultz's second amended complaint utterly fails to  provide fair notice of the claims and the grounds upon  which they rest. Many defendants are not named in the  second  amended  complaint  aside  from  their  identification as defendants and when the claims  against them are listed. The description of some  defendants' relevancy to the case remains confined to a  familial relationship with other defendants. And it is  unclear which claims are asserted against which  defendants. Further, Shultz's second amended complaint fails to  comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 20. Federal Rule of Civil  Procedure 20 permits joinder of defendants in one  action if (1) ""any right to relief is asserted against them  jointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or  arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or  series of transactions or occurrences;"" or (2) ""any  question of law or fact common to all defendants will  arise in the action."" As described above, however,  Shultz includes 51 defendants involved in his divorce  proceeding, his appeal thereof, a separate bankruptcy  proceeding,  and  a  judicial  conduct  board  complaint. [*26]  Shultz's second amended complaint  thus fails to comply with the pleading requirements of  the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Moreover, we lack  jurisdiction over some of Shultz's claims. Further, Shultz  cannot bring claims pursuant to many of the statutes he  cites as these statutes do not have personal causes of  action. And many of the defendants identified in the  second amended complaint are improper defendants for  the claims identified therein. Shultz seeks relief that is  unavailable. And we recommend that the Court decline  to exercise jurisdiction over Shultz's state claims. A. Domestic Relations Exception. The Domestic Relations Exception ""divests federal  courts of jurisdiction over cases 'involving the issuance  of a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree.'""  Mayercheck v. Judges of Pennsylvania Supreme Court,  395 Fed. Appx. 839, 842 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting  (Matusow v. Trans-County Title Agency, LLC, 545 F.3d  241, 245 (3d Cir. 2008) (quotation marks omitted) (itself  quoting Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U.S. 689, 704  (1992))). To the extent that Shultz seeks orders entering  such decrees, we find that we lack jurisdiction to enter  such an order. B. Rooker Feldman. Many of Shultz's claims are based on his disagreement  with the division of assets decided in the Franklin  County Court. This is evident throughout the second  amended complaint, but nowhere as clear as in the two  pages  Shultz  dedicates [*27]   to  ""Injunctions  Page 9 of 17 Requested"" where he requests we, among other things,  ""vacate repugnant null, and void orders of the trial court  in a 60 b motion to dismiss due to fraud, fraud on the  courts et,al. [sic]"" Doc. 22 at 97-98. But, although 28  U.S.C. § 1257 confers on the United States Supreme  Court appellate jurisdiction to review final judgments of  the states' highest courts, Congress has not ""conferred  a similar power of review on the United States District  Courts[.]"" Desi's Pizza, Inc. v. City of Wilkes-Barre, 321  F.3d 411, 419 (3d Cir. 2003). ""The Rooker-Feldman  doctrine prevents district courts from mistakenly relying  on their original jurisdiction to engage in appellate  review of state-court orders."" Merritts v. Richards, No.  19-1335, 2023 WL 2532055, at *5 (3d Cir. 2023)  (precedential). The Supreme ""Court has repeatedly emphasized that  the [Rooker-Feldman] doctrine is a narrow one that  defeats federal subject-matter jurisdiction only under  limited circumstances."" Vuyanich v. Smithton Borough,  5 F.4th 379, 382 (3d Cir. 2021). ""And [the Third Circuit  has set forth] a precise four-pronged inquiry for when  Rooker-Feldman should be invoked."" Id. The Rooker  Feldman doctrine applies when: ""(1) the federal plaintiff  lost in state court; (2) the plaintiff complain[s] of injuries  caused by [the] state-court judgments; (3) those  judgments were rendered before the federal suit was  filed; and (4) the plaintiff is [*28]  inviting the district  court to review and reject the state court judgments.""  Great Western Mining & Mineral Co. v. Fox Rothschild  LLP, 615 F.3d 159, 166 (3d Cir. 2010) (internal  quotation marks omitted) (quoting Exxon Mobile, 544  U.S. at 284). ""When even one of the four prongs is not  satisfied, it is not proper to dismiss on Rooker-Feldman  grounds."" Vuyanich, 5 F.4th at 382. Here, Shultz appears to have lost in the Franklin County  Court of Common Pleas, resulting in unfavorable  support orders and division of assets. At least some of  the claims Shultz attempts to bring are based on  perceived injuries caused by these support orders,  which were rendered before this suit was filed. And  Shultz directly asks us to ""vacate"" these unfavorable  orders and to ""put a stop to the egregious abuse"" that  he is experiencing as a direct result of the enforcement  of these orders. Accordingly, we find that the Rooker- Feldman doctrine applies, and we have no jurisdiction  over Shultz's claims that directly seek the review and  rejection of state court judgments. C. Statutes Without Private Causes of Action. In his first amended complaint, Shultz attempted to bring  claims under several criminal statutes. The court thus  explained that such statutes cannot provide the basis for  a private cause of action and gave Shultz leave to  amend only those claims [*29]  brought under statutes  which provide private causes of action. In his second  amended complaint, however, Shultz again attempts to  bring a claim under 18 U.S.C. § 4, and many other  statutes that cannot provide the basis for a private  cause of action. Shultz attempts to bring claims under several criminal  statutes. See doc. 22 at 43-57. Violations of these  statutes are punishable by fines or imprisonment or  both. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2; 18 U.S.C. §§ 4, 1621,  1622, 2112, 3571; 22 U.S.C. § 4217; 42 U.S.C. § 1011,  1307; 25 C.F.R. § 11.432. Similarly, Shultz also cites  one statute that is punishable only by court martial. 10  U.S.C. § 927. Shultz cannot seek these punishments  through a civil complaint because there is no ""federal  right to require the government to initiate criminal  proceedings."" Rodriguez v. Salus, 623 F. App'x 588,  590 (3d Cir. 2015); see also Linda R.S. v. Richard D.,  410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973) (""[A] private citizen lacks a  judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or  nonprosecution of another.""). Further, there is no private  right of action for alleged violations of criminal statutes.  Courts have found time and time again that criminal  statutes do not create private causes of action. See,  e.g., Davis v. Warden Lewisburg USP, 594 Fed. Appx.  60, 61 n.3 (3d Cir. 2015) (""§ 242 is a criminal statute,  through which no private cause of action is created."");  Dugar v. Coughlin, 613 F.Supp. 849, 852 n.1 (S.D.N.Y  1985) (""Sections 241, 242, and 245 relate to deprivation  of civil rights, however there is no private right of action  under any of these statutes.""); [*30]  Pankey v. Webster,  816 F.Supp. 553, 559 (W.D. Missouri 1993) (""18 U.S.C.  § 4 defines a criminal offense and does not provide civil  complaints with a private right of action. Thus, plaintiff  cannot base a civil cause of action on 18 U.S.C. § 4,  and cannot invoke that statute as a jurisdictional basis  for her present complaint."" (internal citations omitted))  (citing Dugar, 613 F.Supp. at 852 n.1). Shultz cannot  bring a private action under any of the criminal statutes  to which he cites because no such private action exists. Similarly, Shultz also cites to statutes that permit certain  action to be taken by government actors, for example,  the courts and regulatory agencies. See 10 U.S.C. §  333 (giving the Secretary of Defense authority to build  capacity of foreign security forces); 12 U.S.C. § 4631  (regarding the authority of the Director of the Federal  Housing Finance Agency to send a notice of charges to  Page 10 of 17 regulated entities that violate laws, rules, regulations,  orders, or conditions); 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u-2 (""the  Commission or the appropriate regulatory agency may  impose a civil penalty""), 57b(1)(b) (""Actions conducted  by Commission respecting unfair or deceptive acts or  practices in or affecting commerce""); 26 U.S.C. §  6331(a) (authorizing the Secretary to collect tax by  levy); 28 U.S.C. § 1927 (""Any attorney . . . who so  multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably  and vexatiously may [*31]  be required by the court to  satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and  attorneys' fees""); 37 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733, 3802 (setting  forth the False Claims Act which permits actions by  private citizens only in the name of the government); 42  U.S.C. § 14141 (""Whenever the Attorney General has  reasonable cause to believe that a violation . . . has  occurred, the Attorney General, for or in the name of the  United States, may in a civil action obtain appropriate . .  . relief""). As a private citizen, Shultz cannot bring a  cause of action pursuant to any of these statutes. Shultz also cites statutes that do no more than set forth  congressional  findings,  definitions,  and  other  background information for other statutes. See 15  U.S.C. §§ 80a-46 (""Validity of contracts""), 1681  (""Congressional findings and statement of purpose""),  1692 (""Congressional findings and declaration of  purpose""); 22 U.S.C. § 7101 (""Purposes and findings"");  29 U.S.C. § 621 (""Congressional statement of findings  and purpose""); 32 C.F.R. § 536.52 (""Subrogation.""); 42  C.F.R. § 488.301 (""Definitions""). Because none of these  statutes provide bases for relief, Shultz cannot bring  claims pursuant to these statutes. Shultz also attempts to bring claims under statutes— and, curiously, one executive order—that govern United  States judicial officers and employees. See 5 U.S.C. §§  3331 (setting [*32]  forth the oath of office for those  ""elected or appointed to an office of honor or profit in the  civil service or uniformed services""), 7311 (setting forth  those conditions in which ""an individual may not accept  or hold a position in the Government""); 28 U.S.C. §§  453  (""Oaths  of  justices  and  judges""),  455  (""Disqualification of justice, judge, or magistrate judge"");  5 C.F.R. § 2635.101 (""Basic obligation of public  service""); 18 F.R. 2489 (""Security requirements for  Government employment""). And Shultz also cites to  statutes that set forth certain procedural requirements  for United States Courts. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1495 (""The  United States Court of Federal Claims shall have  jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim for  damages by any person unjustly convicted of an offense  against the United States and imprisoned.""), 2072  (""Rules  of  procedure  and  evidence;  power  to  prescribe""); 2201 (""Creation of remedy""), 2202 (""Further  necessary or proper relief based on a declaratory  judgment or decree may be granted""), 2283 (""Stay of  State court proceedings""). Again, Shultz cannot bring  claims pursuant to these statutes because no such  claims exist. Shultz also cites to statutes that restrict the actions of  the federal or state governments, but not in a way that  can be enforced [*33]  by a private citizen. See 2 C.F.R.  § 200.338 (""No Federal awarding agency may place  restrictions on the non-Federal entity that limit public  access to the records of the non-Federal entity pertinent  to a Federal award""); 15 U.S.C. § 16(b)-(h) (""Consent  judgments  and  competitive  impact  statements;  publication in Federal Register; availability of copies to  the public""; ""Publication of summaries in newspapers"";  ""Consideration of public comments by Attorney General  and  publication  of  response"";  ""Public  interest  determination"";  ""Procedure  for  public  interest  determination""; ""Filing of written or oral communications  with the district court""; ""Inadmissibility as evidence of  proceedings before the district court and the competitive  impact statement""); 29 U.S.C. § 524A (""each State shall  have the authority to enact and enforce, . . ., a provision  of law that applies equally to employers, employees,  and collective bargaining representatives""); 10602(c)  (""any amount of crime victim compensation . . . shall not  be included in the income of the applicant""). Again,  these statutes provide no cause of action. Shultz cites to a statute that provides only that certain  relief is available in actions brought under Federal  Consumer Financial Protection law, although [*34]  not  clearly bringing claims under this law. 12 U.S.C. § 5565.  Shultz cites to chapter one of title 42 of the United  States Code, despite all sections of this chapter having  been omitted or repealed. Shultz cites to 15 U.S.C. §  77q, despite this statute also lacking a private cause of  action. See Trustcash Holdings, Inc. v. Moss, 668 F.  Supp. 2d 650, 656 (D.N.J. 2009) (""The Court finds that  there is no implied private right of action under Section  17(a) [codified at 15 U.S.C. § 77q] for a nonpurchaser of  the security at issue. In so holding, the Court follows the  almost universal trend among circuit courts and the  majority of courts in this district.""). Bafflingly, Shultz  also cites to statutes governing loss of nationality by      Page 11 of 17 native-born or naturalized United States citizens, the  National Park Foundation and its members, claims  brought under the Military Claims Act, and employee  benefit plan fiduciaries. None of the above statutes set forth a cause of action  and, therefore, none of them can form the basis of a  viable claim. Further, the court only gave Shultz leave to  amend his first amended complaint to plead claims that  have a private cause of action. Doc. 21. Accordingly, we  recommend that the court dismiss all claims brought  pursuant to the above listed statutes. D. Peonage. Shultz also brings claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1994  which [*35]  states that ""[t]he holding of any person to  service or labor under the system known as peonage is  abolished and forever prohibited in any Territory or  State of the United States[.]"" ""'Peonage' is a system of  labor wherein the laborer is compelled to work for his  creditor in order to satisfy a debt."" Jenkins v. Trustees of  Sandhills Community College, 259 F. Supp. 2d 432, 445  (M.D. N.C. 2003) (citing Bailey v. Alabama, 219 U.S.  219, 242 (1911)). But Shultz fails to allege that he has  been ""held to compulsory labor."" See id. Accordingly,  we find that he has failed to state a 42 U.S.C. § 1994  claim and we recommend that the court dismiss this  claim. E. Fair Housing Act. In his 15-page list of statutes under which he intends to  bring claims, Shultz cites 42 U.S.C. § 3617, a provision  of the Fair Housing Act. Doc. 22 at 46. This provision  states that ""[i]t shall be unlawful to coerce, intimidate,  threaten, or interfere with any person in the exercise or  enjoyment of, or on account of his having exercised or  enjoyed . . . any right granted or protected by section  3603, 3604, 3605, or 3606 of this title."" 42 U.S.C. §  3617. Because this statute incorporates those rights  granted or protected by 42 U.S.C. §§ 3603, 3604, 3605,  and 3606, we must begin by determining whether  Shultz's second amended complaint sufficiently alleges      these statutes' applicability. Sections 3603-3606 relate to ""prohibitions against  discrimination in the sale or rental of housing,""  ""residential real estate-related [*36]  transactions,"" and  ""the provision of brokerage services."" Here, Shultz  alleges only that some real estate transactions he  sought were denied by the court and that some real  estate transactions sought by Faith were permitted by  the court. Although he states that he is disabled and  conclusively states that he is being discriminated  against, he does not allege facts sufficient for a claim of  discrimination; instead, it is clear that Shultz is disputing  the equitable distribution following the dissolution of his  marriage. Further, ""the prohibition on interference [found  in § 3617] cannot be so broad as to prohibit any action  whatsoever tha[t] in any way hinders a member of a  protected class."" Revock v. Cowpet Bay West  Condominium Association, 853 F.3d 96, 113 (3d Cir.  2017) (internal quotations omitted). This is all Shultz  alleges—that he is a member of a protected class as a  disabled person and that the defendants hindered his  ability to engage in real estate transactions as he  wished. Accordingly, we find that Shultz has failed to  state a claim upon which relief can be granted under 42  U.S.C. § 3617, and we recommend that the court  dismiss this claim. F. Claims for Civil Rights Violations. In his second amended complaint, Shultz alleges  violations of his civil rights, and brings claims  under [*37]  42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, 1985, 1986, and  1988. See doc. 22 at 46. Section 1981, however,  ""afford[s] a federal remedy against discrimination . . . on  the basis of race'"" such that ""to prevail [under § 1981], a  plaintiff must initially plead and ultimately prove that, but  for race, [he] would not have suffered the loss of a  legally protected right."" Comcast Corporation v. National  Association of African American-Owned Media, 140  S.Ct. 1009, 1016, 1019 (2020) (quoting Johnson v.  Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U.S. 454, 459  (2020)). Because Shultz makes no allegations regarding  his race at all, we recommend that the court dismiss this  claim and we will address it no further. And section 1988  sets forth the ""[a]pplicability of statutory and common  law"" and permits recovery of ""a reasonable attorney's  fee"" and expert fees by a prevailing party. 42 U.S.C. §  1988. Accordingly, it does not set forth a separate cause  of action. Moreover, because Shultz is proceeding pro  se, he is unable to recover attorneys' fees for his work  litigating a case. See Kay v. Ehrler, 499 U.S. 432, 438  Page 12 of 17 (1991); see also Pitts v. Vaughn, 679 F.2d 311, 313 (3d  Cir. 1982). We also recommend that the court dismiss  this claim and we will address it no further. We turn now to 42 U.S.C. § 1985, which contains three  subparts. Neither 42 U.S.C. § 1985(1), which deals with  preventing an officer from performing his or her duties,  nor the first part of 42 U.S.C. § 1985(2), which deals  with intimidation of parties, witnesses, or jurors, are  relevant here. The second part of § 1985(2), which  ""applies to conspiracies to obstruct [*38]  the course of  justice in state courts,"" Kush v. Rutledge, 460 U.S. 719,  725 (1983), is potentially relevant in this case, as is §  1985(3) which ""permits an action to be brought by one  injured by a conspiracy formed 'for the purpose of  depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or  class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or  of equal privileges an immunities under the laws.'""  Farber v. City of Paterson, 440 F.3d 131, 134 (3d Cir.  2006) (quoting § 1985(3)). Both the second part of §  1985(2) and § 1985(3) are limited to conspiracies based  on racial or some other class-based invidiously  discriminatory animus. See Davis v. Twp. of Hillside,  190 F.3d 167, 171 (3d Cir. 1999); Griffin v.  Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 102 (1971). Liberally  construing the second amended complaint, Shultz  appears to be alleging that he is part of a class of  disabled persons for purposes of this analysis. Shultz  fails, however, to allege conspiracy. Instead, he relies  on legal conclusions that all the 51 defendants  ""conspired,"" ""colluded,"" and ""agreed upon, approved, or  ratified each other's conduct[.]"" See doc. 22 at 12, 22,  33, 70. These conclusions are not enough to state a  claim, especially as they apply sweepingly to 51  defendants. Moreover, as discussed below, many of  these defendants are entitled to immunity from these  claims. Accordingly, we find that Shultz has failed to  state a § 1985 claim. Shultz also cites to 42 U.S.C. § 1986, which  provides [*39]  a cause of action for failing to prevent a  conspiracy under § 1985. ""Section 1986, therefore, is  derivative of section 1985."" Dennison v. PA Dept. of  Corrections, 268 F.Supp.2d 387, 402 n.10 (M.D. Pa.  2003). Because the second amended complaint fails to  state a § 1985 claim upon which relief can be granted, it  follows that the second amended complaint fails to state  a § 1986 claim upon which relief can be granted. All that remains, then, are Shultz's claims brought  pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. ""Section 1983 imposes  civil liability under any person who, acting under the  color of state law, deprives another individual of any  rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the  Constitution or laws of the United States."" Shuman v.  Penn Manor School Dist., 422 F.3d 141, 1146 (3d Cir.  2005). Section 1983 ""does not create any new  substantive rights but instead provides a remedy for the  violation of a federal constitutional or statutory right."" Id.  To establish a claim under § 1983, the plaintiff must  establish a deprivation of a federally protected right and  that this deprivation was committed by a person acting  under color of state law. Woloszyn v. County of  Lawrence, 396 F.3d 314, 319 (3d Cir. 2005). Shultz has  failed to state a § 1983 claim against any of the  defendants. The defendants can be categorized into  three groups: those that are immune from suit, those  that are not state actors, and those that, as alleged,  have no personal involvement in any deprivation of  rights. We analyze each [*40]  group below. 1. Immunity. i. Judicial Defendants. Shultz attempts to bring civil rights claims against the  Franklin County judicial defendants and the Superior  Court Judicial Defendants. Shultz does not clarify  whether he brings claims against these defendants in  their official or personal capacities. We will, therefore,  analyze both possibilities. When a claim is brought against a judge in his or her  official capacity, that claim may fail due to Eleventh  Amendment immunity. Official-capacity suits are ""only  another way of pleading an action against an entity of  which an officer is an agent."" Monell v. New York City  Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 690 n.55 (1978).  Here, the Franklin County judicial defendants are judges  for the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas and the  Superior Court Judicial Defendants are judges for the  Superior Court—which, as parts of the unified judicial  system, are Commonwealth entities—and, accordingly,  the claims against the judicial defendants are really  claims against the Commonwealth and, as such, may  be barred by the Eleventh Amendment. See Benn v.  First Judicial Dist. of Pa., 426 F.3d 233, 241 (3d Cir.  2005) (""The Pennsylvania constitution envisions a  unified state judicial system, of which the Judicial  District is an integral component. From a holistic  analysis of the Judicial District's relationship with the  state, it is undeniable [*41]  that Pennsylvania is the real  party in interest in Benn's suit and would be subjected to  both indignity and an impermissible risk of legal liability  Page 13 of 17 if the suit were allowed to proceed.""); see also  Haybarger v. Lawrence Cty. Adult Prob. & Parole, 551  F.3d 193, 198 (3d Cir. 2008) (concluding that ""as an arm  of the State, an individual judicial district and its  probation and parole department are entitled to  Eleventh Amendment immunity,"" but holding that in that  case, the Eleventh Amendment was waived by  acceptance of federal funds under the Rehabilitation  Act). There are two circumstances when the Eleventh  Amendment does not bar a suit against a state or state  agency. First, a state may waive its Eleventh  Amendment immunity by consenting to suit. College  Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Educ.  Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 670 (1999). Second,  Congress may abrogate a state's Eleventh Amendment  immunity when it unequivocally intends to do so and  when it acts pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional  authority. Geness v. Admin. Off. of Pennsylvania Cts.,  974 F.3d 263, 269-70 (3d Cir. 2020). Neither of these circumstances are present here. The  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has not waived its  Eleventh Amendment immunity. See 42 Pa. Stat. and  Cons. Stat. Ann. § 8521(b) (""Nothing contained in this  subchapter shall be construed to waive the immunity of  the Commonwealth from suit in Federal courts  guaranteed by the Eleventh Amendment to the  Constitution of the United States.""); Downey v.  Pennsylvania Dep't of Corr., 968 F.3d 299, 310 (3d Cir.  2020) (""Pennsylvania has not waived its sovereign  immunity defense in federal court.""). And Shultz has  failed  to  cite  any  statute  that  waives  the  Commonwealth's Eleventh Amendment immunity in the  circumstances [*42]  of this case. See Quern v. Jordan,  440 U.S. 332 (1979); Kokinda v. Pennsylvania  Department of Corrections, 779 Fed.Appx. 944, 948 (3d  Cir. 2019). Accordingly, we find that the Franklin County  Judicial Defendants and the Superior Court Judicial  Defendants are entitled to immunity from claims brought  in their official capacities. The Eleventh Amendment, however, does not bar  claims against state officials in their individual or  personal capacities. Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 30-31  (1991). Instead, absolute judicial immunity may apply to  individual-capacity claims. See Yarris v. County of  Delaware, 465 F.3d 129, 134-35 (3d Cir. 2006). ""[A]bsolute immunity attaches to those who perform  functions integral to the judicial process."" Williams v.  Consovoy, 453 F.3d 173, 178 (3d Cir. 2006). A two-part  inquiry is used to determine whether judicial immunity is  applicable. Gallas, 211 F.3d at 768. First, because  immunity applies only to actions taken in a judge's  judicial capacity, a determination must be made whether  the challenged actions of the judge were taken in his or  her judicial capacity. Id. The relevant factors ""'relate to  the nature of the act itself, i.e., whether it is a function  normally performed by a judge, and to the expectations  of the parties, i.e., whether they dealt with the judge in  his judicial capacity.'"" Id. at 768 (quoting Stump v.  Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 362 (1978)). ""Our task is to  'draw the line between truly judicial acts for which  immunity is appropriate and acts that simply happen to  have  been  done  by  judges,'  such  as  administrative [*43]  acts."" Id. (quoting Forrester, 484  U.S. at 227). ""Second, a judge is not immune for actions, though  judicial in nature, taken in the complete absence of all  jurisdiction."" Id. In this regard, ""we must distinguish  between acts in the 'clear absence of all jurisdiction,'  which do not enjoy the protection of absolute immunity,  and acts that are merely in 'excess of jurisdiction,' which  do enjoy that protection."" Id. at 769 (quoting Stump, 435  U.S. at 357 n.6). The Supreme Court has explained that  distinction: Where there is clearly no jurisdiction over the  subject-matter any authority exercised is a usurped  authority, and for the exercise of such authority,  when the want of jurisdiction is known to the judge,  no excuse is permissible. But where jurisdiction  over the subject-matter is invested by law in the  judge, or in the court which he holds, the manner  and extent in which the jurisdiction shall be  exercised are generally as much questions for his  determination as any other questions involved in  the case, although upon the correctness of his  determination in these particulars the validity of his  judgments may depend. Stump, 435 U.S. at 356 n.6 (quoting Bradley v. Fisher,  80 U.S. 335, 351-52 (1871)). ""Generally, therefore,  'where a court has some subject matter jurisdiction,  there  is  sufficient  jurisdiction  for  immunity [*44]   purposes.'"" Figueroa v. Blackburn, 208 F.3d 435, 443- 44 (3d Cir. 2000) (quoting Barnes v. Winchell, 105 F.3d  1111, 1122 (6th Cir. 1997)); see also Gallas, 211 F.3d  at 771 (holding that ""a judge does not act in the clear  absence of all jurisdiction when the judge enters an  order at least colorably within the jurisdiction of her court  even though a court rule or other procedural constraint  required another judge to act in the matter""). Page 14 of 17 As to the first part of this inquiry, judicial immunity  shields a judge from liability for judicial acts even if  those acts were taken in error, if they were done  maliciously, if they were in excess of the judge's  authority, if the judge committed grave procedural  errors, or if the judge's actions were unfair or  controversial. Gallas, 211 F.3d at 769. A judge will be  subject to liability only when he or she has acted in the  clear absence of all jurisdiction. Id. ""In sum, our analysis  must focus on the general nature of the challenged  action, without inquiry into such 'specifics' as the judge's  motive or the correctness of his or her decision."" Id. Shultz alleges that the Franklin County Judicial  Defendants signed various orders relating to his divorce  and support proceedings and that the Superior Court  Judicial Defendants issued an opinion on Shultz's  appeal from these actions. These are functions normally  performed [*45]  by judicial officers and, as such, are  judicial acts. Furthermore, Courts of Common Pleas  have ""unlimited original jurisdiction in all cases except  as may otherwise be provided by law."" Pa. Const. art. V  §§ 1, 5. And the Superior Court has ""exclusive appellate  jurisdiction of all appeals from final orders of the courts  of common pleas, regardless of the nature of the  controversy or the amount involved[.]"" 42 Pa.C.S. § 742.  The Franklin County Judicial Defendants and the  Superior Court Judicial Defendants, therefore, are  entitled to absolute immunity from Shultz's personal- capacity claims against them. Accordingly, the judicial  defendants are all entitled to immunity from both official- and individual-capacity claims here. ii. Judicial Conduct Board Defendants. Shultz also fails to clearly indicate whether he brings  claims against the Judicial Conduct Board Defendants  in either their official or individual capacities, or both.  Accordingly, we will analyze both options. We reiterate that official-capacity suits are ""only another  way of pleading an action against an entity of which an  officer is an agent."" Monell v. New York City Dept. of  Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 690 n.55 (1978). And,  like the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas and  the Superior Court, the Judicial Conduct Board is a part  of Pennsylvania's [*46]  unified judicial system. See  Vacek v. Penn. Judicial Conduct Bd., C.A. No. 08-221  Erie, 2010 WL 3338809, *7 (W.D. Pa. Aug. 3, 2010)  (citing 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 2101; Commonwealth ex rel.  Judicial Conduct Bd. v. Griffin, 591 Pa. 351, 918 A.2d  87, 94-94 (Pa. 2007); 591 Pa. Const. art. V, § 18). ""As  such, they are arms of the Commonwealth and have  immunity under the Eleventh Amendment as to all of  Plaintiff's claims."" Vacek, 2010 WL 3338809, *7; see  also Lattaker v. Rendell, 269 Fed.Appx. 230, 232 (3d  Cir. 2008); Democracy Rising PA v. Celluci, 603  F.Supp.2d 780, 795-96 (Mar. 20, 2009). Members of the judicial conduct board may also be  entitled to absolute immunity for claims brought against  them in their personal capacity. Here, Shultz alleges  that the Judicial Conduct Board defendants dismissed  his complaint against Judge VanHorn, Judge Myer,  Judge Sponseller, Judge Krom, Judge Zook, Judge  Shank, and the ""Superior Court (per curium, yet to be  identified through discovery)"" ""without any due process  of review, no findings of fact, nor conclusions of law.""  Doc. 22 at 31-32; Flash Drive of Exhibits, JUDICIAL- CONDUCT-BD-DISMISSAL  EXHIBIT  2A  225202320230225_11370738.pdf.  But  ""prosecutors  enjoy absolute immunity for the failure to adequately  investigate a case and for the decision to initiate, or  decline to initiate, a prosecution."" Sanders v. Downs,  420 F. App'x 175, 180 (3d Cir. 2011). And this absolute  immunity applies to members of the Judicial Conduct  Board, as well. See Lokuta v. Sallemi, No. 3:CV-13- 0288, 2013 WL 5570227, *10 (M.D. Pa. Oct. 9, 2013).  Accordingly, we find that the Judicial Conduct Board  defendants are entitled to absolute immunity from  Shultz's civil rights claims. iii. Support Masters. As described above, ""[a] judicial [*47]  officer in the  performance of his duties has absolute immunity from  suit and will not be liable for his judicial acts."" Acavino v.  Wilson, No. 18-2312, 2018 WL 5848982 *2 (E.D. Pa.  Nov. 8, 2018). Quasijudicial immunity, however,  ""protects a range of judicial actors, including 'those who  make  discretionary  judgments  ""functional[ly]  comparab[le]"" to judges.'"" Ke v. DiPasquale, 828 Fed.  Appx. 98, 100 (3d Cir. 2020). ""The doctrine provides  absolute immunity from liability for damages."" Id. at 100- 01. Support masters are ""entitled to quasi-judicial  immunity because [their] adjudicative tasks . . . are  functionally comparable to those performed by a judge.""  Id. at 101. And because Shultz's claims against Support  Master Johnson and Support Master Stein (""the support  masters"") are all based on their actions presiding over  Shultz's support actions, the support masters are  entitled to quasi-judicial immunity from these claims. Page 15 of 17 2. Lack of State Action. To establish a claim under § 1983, the plaintiff must  establish a deprivation of a federally protected right and  that this deprivation was committed by a person acting  under color of state law. Woloszyn v. County of  Lawrence, 396 F.3d 314, 319 (3d Cir. 2005). Shultz's  claims against people who did not act under color of  state law, therefore, must fail. Faith, Eshe, Ausherman,  Attorney Cognetti, Attorney Walker, Attorney Diveglia,  Attorney Troutman, Attorney Imblum, [*48]  and Karen  Sheriff are all private citizens who do not work for the  government and are not alleged to have acted on behalf  of the government in some way. None of these  defendants acted under color of state law. Accordingly,  we find that Shultz has failed to state a § 1983 claim  against Faith, Eshe, Ausherman, Karen Sheriff, and  Attorneys Cognetti, Walker, Diveglia, Troutman, and  Imblum. 3. Lack of Personal Involvement. Liability in a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action is personal in  nature, and to be liable a defendant must have been  personally involved in the wrongful conduct. Thus,  respondeat superior cannot form the basis of liability.  Jutrowski v. Twp. of Riverdale, 904 F.3d 280, 290 (3d  Cir. 2018). In other words, ""each Government official,  his or her title notwithstanding, is only liable for his or  her own misconduct."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,  677 (2009). ""[A] plaintiff must aver facts to show the  defendants' personal involvement in the alleged  misconduct."" Dooley v. Wetzel, 957 F.3d 366, 374 (3d  Cir. 2020). ""Personal involvement requires particular  'allegations of personal direction or of actual knowledge  and acquiescence.'"" Id. (quoting Rode v. Dellarciprete,  845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988)). Here, Shultz fails to allege the remaining defendants'  personal involvement. Attorney Sponseller, the DRS  employees, Director Anthony, Attorney Newman, Foose,  and the County Commissioners appear in the second  amended complaint [*49]  only when they are identified  as defendants, with no factual allegations against them.  See doc. 22 generally. The same is true of Sheriff  Anthony and Deputy Sites. See generally id. Shultz  does, however, make three allegations toward unnamed  sheriff's deputies: (1) ""The sheriff's deputies already assaulted  Disabled Plaintiff at the Prothonatory [sic] on July  15, 2022."" Id. at 12. (2) ""These actors"" ""are willing to injure, or kill  Plaintiff through their unlawfully contracted goons  the sheriff's office when Plaintiff cannot pay their  confiscatory $5000, and they drag him in for  contempt of court."" Id. at 13 (errors in original). (3) ""Upon Plaintiff's request of Franklin County  Sheriff's guards, Plaintiff was first told he had to  park a block away across traffic, than later 'there  was no place for him to lie down so he could  recuperate  at  breaks,  as  required  by  the  accommodation request[.]"" Id. at 33-34 (errors in  original). This allusion to an unspecified assault, assumption that  other defendants will somehow in the future use sheriff's  deputies to charge him with contempt of court, and  allegation that sheriff's deputies informed Shultz that  certain accommodations were not available are [*50]   not only insufficient to allege personal involvement by  any of the named defendants but also do not provide  notice of claims against John Doe defendants. Because,  according to the second amended complaint, Attorney  Sponseller, the DRS employees, Director Anthony,  Attorney Newman, Foose, the County Commissioners,  Sheriff Anthony, Deputy Sites, and the John Does were  not personally involved in any alleged violations of his  civil rights, Shultz has failed to state a § 1983 claim  against these defendants. G. ADA Shultz also brings claims for ADA violations, seemingly  against all of the defendants. But Shultz's second  amended complaint lacks factual allegations against  nearly all of the defendants, instead only containing  sweeping  and  conclusory  accusations  of  ""discrimination"" in the distribution of assets after his  divorce. Moreover, the ADA applies only to: (1)  ""employer[s],  employment  agenc[ies],  labor  organization[s],  or  joint  labor-management  committee[s,]"" 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111-12; (2) public  entities, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-32; (3) entities involved in  transportation, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12141-50; and (4) people  who own, lease, or operate ""a place of public  accommodation[,]"" 42 U.S.C. § 12182. Shultz brings no  allegations surrounding his employment, transportation,  or presence at [*51]  a place of public accommodation.  See doc. 22 generally. And he does not allege that any  of the defendants were his employer, involved in  transportation, or own, lease, or operate a place of  public accommodation. Page 16 of 17 Aside from general allegations of ""discrimination,"" Shultz  alleges ADA violations that took place at the courthouse  and only involved a fraction of the defendants. Shultz  alleges that when he arrived at the courthouse for a  court proceeding, he was ""told he had to park a block  away across traffic[.]"" Doc. 22 at 33-34. Although he  states that sheriff's ""guards"" informed him where to  park, he does not allege that they were the decision- makers in denying him an accessible parking spot.  Furthermore, Shultz alleges that, although ""the clerk of  court promised . . . accommodations[,]"" he was not  provided with ""a place for him to lie down so he could  recuperate at breaks[.]"" Id. at 34. According to the  second amended complaint, this led to Shultz being  unable to fully participate in the hearing due to his  physical limitations. See id. Support Master Stein  allegedly presided over this hearing and ""failed to even  offer any medical assistance, and pretended Plaintiff  was not lying on the [*52]  floor in severe pain difficulty  breathing[.]"" Id. (errors in original). Shultz thus fails to  make any ADA allegations against a public entity. And  we recommend that the court also dismiss Shultz's ADA  claims for failure to state a claim. H. Protection From Abuse Act. Shultz states that he is seeking ""protection from abuse  orders against all Defendants"" because they are  ""dangerous people due to their discrimination, and  willingness to violate an innocent disabled man."" Doc.  22 at 14. We construe this as seeking protection from  abuse orders under Pennsylvania's Protection from  Abuse Act. See 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 6101 et seq. This  statute provides that ""the court may grant any protection  order . . . to bring about a cessation of abuse of the  plaintiff or minor children."" 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 6101(a).  ""The Protection From Abuse Act allows certain persons  to seek relief by filing a petition with the court alleging  abuse by the defendants."" McCullers v. Lehigh Cnty.,  NO. 15-cv-3732, 2018 WL 3387380, at *11 (E.D. Pa.  July 11, 2018). ""Instead of filing a petition for a protection from abuse  order with the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas, as  [he] is required to do, [Shultz] filed the instant [second  amended complaint] in federal court apparently seeking  relief under the Act by"" referring to Protection From  Abuse orders. Gok v. United States, No. 22-4838, 2023  WL 4189758, *2 n.1 (E.D. Pa. June 26, 2023).  Furthermore, the [*53]  Protection From Abuse Act  defines abuse only as certain acts occurring ""between  family or household members, sexual or intimate  partner[,] or persons who share biological parenthood[.]""  23 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 6102. Only one of the 51  defendants in the second amended complaint qualifies  as such a person, Shultz's ex-wife, Faith. In light of the  above, we do not recommend that the court issue any  such Protection From Abuse Orders. I. State Law Claims. In addition to federal claims, Shultz is asserting state  law claims. See generally doc. 22. Such claims would  fall within the court's supplemental jurisdiction. Whether  to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is within the  discretion of the court. 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3) provides  that district courts may decline to exercise supplemental  jurisdiction over a state-law claim if the district court has  dismissed all claims over which it has original  jurisdiction.  When  deciding  whether  to  exercise  supplemental jurisdiction, ""a federal court should  consider and weigh in each case, and at every stage of  the  litigation,  the  values  of  judicial  economy,  convenience, fairness, and comity."" City of Chicago v.  Int'l Coll. of Surgeons, 522 U.S. 156, 173 (1997)  (quoting Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cahill, 484 U.S. 343,  350 (1988)). The Third Circuit has held that ""where the  claim over which the district court has original  jurisdiction [*54]  is dismissed before trial, the district  court must decline to decide the pendent state claims  unless considerations of judicial economy, convenience,  and fairness to the parties provide an affirmative  justification for doing so."" Hedges v. Musco, 204 F.3d  109, 123 (3d Cir. 2000) (quoting Borough of West Miflin  v. Lancaster, 45 F.3d 780, 788 (3d Cir. 1995)). There is nothing unique about this case such that  considerations of judicial economy, convenience, and  fairness provide an affirmative justification for exercising  supplemental jurisdiction over his state-law claims.  Accordingly, we recommend that the court decline to  exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law  claims. V. Leave to Amend. Before dismissing a complaint under a screening  provision of 28 U.S.C. § 1915, the Court must grant the  plaintiff  leave  to  amend  his  complaint  unless  amendment would be inequitable or futile. See Grayson  v. Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 114 (3d Cir.  2002). ""Under Rule 15(a), futility of amendment is a  sufficient basis to deny leave to amend."" Great W.  Page 17 of 17 Mining & Mineral Co. v. Fox Rothschild LLP, 615 F.3d  159, 175 (3d Cir. 2010). ""Futility 'means that the  complaint, as amended, would fail to state a claim upon  which relief could be granted.'"" Id. (quoting In re Merck  & Co. Sec., Derivative & ERISA Litig., 493 F.3d 393,  400 (3d Cir. 2007)). Thus, in determining whether an  amendment would be futile, we apply the same  standard as we apply in determining whether a  complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be  granted under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Id. ""In other  words, [*55]  '[t]he District Court determines futility by  taking all pleaded allegations as true and viewing them  in a light most favorable to the plaintiff.'"" Id. (quoting  Winer Family Trust v. Queen, 503 F.3d 319, 330-31 (3d  Cir. 2007)). Here, the Court gave Shultz leave to amend those  claims which had private causes of action. See doc. 21.  But Shultz's second amended complaint, as described  above, again fails to state a claim. And we find that  further leave to amend would be futile for the reasons  discussed above. VI. Recommendations. For the foregoing reasons, we recommend that the court  dismiss Shultz's second amended complaint, without  leave to amend. The Parties are further placed on notice that pursuant to  Local Rule 72.3: Any party may object to a magistrate judge's  proposed findings, recommendations or report  addressing a motion or matter described in 28  U.S.C.  §  636  (b)(1)(B)  or  making  a  recommendation for the disposition of a prisoner  case or a habeas corpus petition within fourteen  (14) days after being served with a copy thereof.  Such party shall file with the clerk of court, and  serve on the magistrate judge and all parties,  written objections which shall specifically identify  the  portions  of  the  proposed  findings,  recommendations or report to which objection is  made and the basis for such [*56]  objections. The  briefing requirements set forth in Local Rule 72.2  shall apply. A judge shall make a de novo  determination of those portions of the report or  specified proposed findings or recommendations to  which objection is made and may accept, reject, or  modify, in whole or in part, the findings or  recommendations made by the magistrate judge.  The judge, however, need conduct a new hearing  only in his or her discretion or where required by  law, and may consider the record developed before  the magistrate judge, making his or her own  determination on the basis of that record. The judge  may also receive further evidence, recall witnesses  or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with  instructions. Submitted this 6th day of December 2023. /s/ Susan E.

"Solis v. Okeechobee Shooting Sports, LLC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216887","ORDER DENYING THE DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR  SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND REFERRING CASE  FOR A SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE This matter is before the Court on the Defendant's  Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at docket entry  72. The Plaintiff filed a response at docket entry 81, but  the Defendant did not elect to file a reply. For the  reasons set forth below, the Motion is denied. The Defendant seeks partial summary judgment on the  Plaintiff's Count I, a hostile work environment claim  alleging discrimination on the basis of sex and national  origin. The Motion focuses on the fourth element that  the Plaintiff must prove for her claim, that ""the  harassment was sufficiently [*2]  severe or pervasive to  alter the terms and conditions of employment and create  a discriminatory abusive working environment."" Miller v.  Tillman, 277 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir. 2002). As to this  element, the Defendant contends that the Plaintiff lacks  sufficient evidence for trial. DE 72 at 16. The Plaintiff lacks sufficient evidence, the Defendant  argues, because she only has evidence of a few,  sporadic comments about her national origin over the  span of five years. To support this argument, the  Defendant cites to a number of cases where sporadic  comments, although inappropriate, were not ""sufficiently  severe or pervasive"" to alter the terms and conditions of  employment. By way of example, the Defendant cites to  a case where a few dozen comments over eleven  months were insufficient and where ""several incidents""  over two years were insufficient. In contrast to cases  with sporadic comments, ""all of the []hostile work  environment claims decided by the Supreme Court have  involved patterns or allegations of extensive, long  lasting, unredressed, and uninhibited sexual threats or         Page 2 of 2 conduct  that  permeated  the  plaintiffs'  work  environment."" Indest v. Freeman Decorating, Inc., 164  F.3d 258, 263 (5th Cir. 1999). The Court begins its analysis of the evidence by  summarizing the content of the statements allegedly  made to [*3]  the Plaintiff. The Defendant summarizes  the content of the statements as ""your people  [Mexicans] are here to take American jobs, Mexicans do  a great job on the lawn, and Hepatitis B was because  [Plaintiff's] people caused it because they did not get  shots in their County."" DE 72 at 13. For the Plaintiff's  part, she contends that an employee of the Defendant: repeatedly made the same or similar inappropriate  comments regularly in the workplace so that at  least one sex-related comment or one national  origin comment was made at least once a week. DE 80 at 6 (emphasis added). The Plaintiff supported  her contention with a proper evidentiary citation in her  statement of additional facts at docket entry 80: Q. Okay. And the comments occurred at least once  a week in the workplace; is that right? A. Yes. DE 74-1 at 75 (Plaintiff's deposition). In the Plaintiff's  own words, the reason inappropriate comments were  made with such frequency was because: There was a lot of political going on in the news at  the time when I started, so it was very political the  whole time. And like politics, there's always  immigration in the mix, so it was a constant  conversation of how he disagreed with this,  disagreed [*4]  with that, so it was something that I  would hear all the time. Id. In response to this evidence, the Defendant filed no  reply. As a result, pursuant to Local Rule 56.1(c), the  Plaintiff's assertion and corresponding evidence is  deemed admitted by the Defendant. Thus, the  Defendant has admitted that an employee made  derogatory comments about the Plaintiff's national origin  (and sometimes her sex) a minimum of once per week  for the duration of the Plaintiff's employment—five  years—which is approximately 260 comments. Based  upon the content of the statements, the Court is  persuaded by the Plaintiff's argument that 260  comments over five years is extensive and long lasting,  such that it could substantially alter the terms and  conditions of employment. Thus, the sporadic-comment  case law relied upon by the Defendant does not apply— the Plaintiff has evidence that the discriminatory  comments made to her were not sporadic—and the  Defendant's Motion is denied. The parties shall participate in a second settlement  conference before the Honorable Magistrate Judge  Shaniek M. Maynard on or before January 9, 2024. The  parties shall immediately contact the Chambers of  Judge Maynard to schedule the conference.

"State v. Burns, 2023 La. App. LEXIS 2107","[Pg 1] ORTEGO, Judge. In this criminal case, Defendant, David Anthony Burns,  appeals his conviction of second-degree murder, in  violation of La.R.S. 14:30.1(A)(1) and (2). The central  issue presented is whether the State offered sufficient  evidence to support Defendant's second-degree murder  conviction, over fifteen years after the murder occurred,  with the evidence tying Defendant to the crime being  almost entirely circumstantial. For the following reasons,  we affirm Defendant's conviction and sentence. PROCEDURAL HISTORY [*2]  On April 13, 2021, Defendant, David Anthony Burns,  was charged by bill of indictment with second degree  murder, in violation of La.R.S. 14:30.1(A)(1) and (2). On  November 23, 2021, defense counsel filed a ""Motion to  Suppress"" an out-of-court identification, arguing that the  lineup and identification procedures used by the police  were suggestive and produced a substantial likelihood  of misidentification. The trial court denied the motion  after finding the arguments raised therein addressed the  weight of the evidence. On January 24, 2022,  Defendant filed a ""Motion to Quash with Incorporated  Memorandum,"" wherein he argued Rapides Parish was  an improper venue for trial because it was unknown  where the homicide occurred and because the victim's  body was found in Texas. On April 11, 2022, the trial  court denied the motion following a hearing, and this  court denied Defendant's supervisory writ application.  State v. Burns, 22-416 (La.App. 3 Cir. 7/17/22)  (unpublished opinion). On October 25, 2022, Defendant's trial commenced with  Page 2 of 27 jury selection. After resting its case-in-chief, the State  amended the bill of indictment to charge Defendant with  the offense of second-degree murder, in violation of  La.R.S. [Pg 2] 14:30.1(A)(1), with the specific intent to  kill or inflict great bodily harm. On [*3]  October 31,  2022, the jury unanimously found Defendant guilty as  charged. On November 21, 2022, Defendant filed a ""Motion for  Judgment of Acquittal or Alternatively for a New Trial""  and a ""Motion for New Trial."" Both motions were denied.  On November 29, 2022, Defendant was sentenced to  the mandatory term of life imprisonment at hard labor  without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of  sentence. The trial court granted Defendant an appeal,  and he is now before this court alleging there was  insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for several  reasons. FACTS On Monday, October 4, 2004, the semi-nude and  decomposing body of nineteen-year-old Courtney Coco  was found in an abandoned building on Farm to Market  Road 1406 (""FM 1406"") near Interstate 10 in Winnie,  Texas. Coco was a resident of Alexandria, Louisiana,  and had last been seen alive at approximately 4:30 a.m.  on Saturday, October 2, 2004. Despite numerous leads  in the investigation, the case went cold. Fifteen years  after Coco's body was discovered, the police arrested  Defendant, who had been engaged to Coco's sister in  2004, for her murder. Defendant proceeded to trial, and,  after ninety minutes of deliberation, [*4]  a Rapides  Parish jury unanimously found him guilty of second- degree murder. ERRORS PATENT In accordance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 920, all  appeals are reviewed for errors patent on the face of the  record. After reviewing the record, we find there are no  errors patent. [Pg 3] ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR In his sole assignment of error, Defendant asserts: The evidence was insufficient to prove David  Anthony Burns was guilty of Second-Degree  Murder. Experts hired by the State questioned  whether a homicide even occurred, instead opining  that Courtney Coco died of an accidental overdose.  Further, after nearly two decades as a cold case,  the  State's  evidence  amounted  to  the  ""identification"" by a witness that Anthony Burns  looked like a person at the location where Ms. Coco  was later found dead. The State also claimed  Anthony ""confessed"" to being involved in Ms.  Coco's death and/or dumping her body. LAW AND DISCUSSION The relevant standard of review when assessing the  sufficiency of the evidence is as follows: When the issue of sufficiency of evidence is  raised on appeal, the critical inquiry of the  reviewing court is whether, after viewing the  evidence in the light most favorable to the  prosecution, any rational trier of fact [*5]  could  have found the essential elements of the crime  proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v.  Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61  L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); State ex rel. Graffagnino  v. King, 436 So.2d 559 (La.1983); State v.  Duncan, 420 So.2d 1105 (La.1982); State v.  Moody, 393 So.2d 1212 (La. 1981). It is the  role of the fact finder to weigh the respective  credibilities of the witnesses, and therefore, the  appellate court should not second guess the  credibility determinations of the trier of fact  beyond the sufficiency evaluations under the  Jackson standard of review. See Graffagnino,  436 So.2d at 563, citing State v. Richardson,  425 So.2d 1228 (La.1983). To obtain a  conviction, the elements of the crime must be  proven beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Freeman, 01-997, pp. 2-3 (La.App. 3 Cir.  12/12/01), 801 So.2d 578, 580. Furthermore, the testimony of a single witness is  sufficient to support a conviction ""[i]n the absence  of internal contradiction or irreconcilable conflicts  with physical evidence."" State v. Dixon, 04-1019, p.  12 (La.App. 5 Cir. 3/15/05), 900 So.2d 929, 936.  The trier of fact may accept or reject the testimony  of any witness, and the determination of the  credibility of that witness, in whole or in part, is [Pg  4] left to its sound discretion and ""will not be re- weighed on appeal."" Id. at 936. State v. F.B.A., 07-1526, pp. 1-2 (La.App. 3 Cir.  5/28/08), 983 So.2d 1006, 1009, writ denied, 08-1464  (La. 3/27/09), 5 So.3d 138. Page 3 of 27 As  for  appellate  review  in  cases  relying  on  circumstantial evidence, this court has stated the  following: When the conviction is based upon circumstantial  evidence, La.R.S. 15:438 provides that the state  ""must exclude every reasonable hypothesis of  innocence"" in order to convict. State v. Camp, 446  So.2d  1207,  1209  (La.1984).  ""Circumstantial  evidence consists [*6]  of proof of collateral facts  and circumstances from which elemental factors  may be inferred according to reason, experience  and common sense."" State v. Burns, 441 So.2d  843, 845 (La.App. 3 Cir.1983). However, La.R.S.  15:438 does not establish a stricter standard of  review  on  appeal  than  the  rational  juror's  reasonable doubt standard. The statute serves as a  guide for the jury when considering circumstantial  evidence. On appeal, the issue is whether a rational  trier of fact, when viewing the evidence in a light  most favorable to the prosecution, could find that all  reasonable  hypotheses  of  innocence  were  excluded. State v. Williams, 13-497 (La.App. 3 Cir.  11/6/13), 124 So.3d 1236, writ denied, 13-2774 (La.  5/16/14), 139 So.3d 1024. State v. Baumberger, 15-1056, pp. 10-11 (La.App. 3 Cir.  6/1/16), 200 So.3d 817, 826-27, writ denied, 16-1251  (La. 5/26/17), 221 So.3d 859, cert. denied,     U.S.    ,  138 S.Ct. 392 (2017). Louisiana  Revised  Statutes  14:30.1(A)(1)  defines  second degree murder as ""the killing of a human being .  . . [w]hen the offender has a specific intent to kill or to  inflict great bodily harm[.]"" ""Specific criminal intent is that  state of mind which exists when the circumstances  indicate that the offender actively desired the prescribed  criminal consequences to follow his act or failure to act.""  La.R.S. 14:10(1). ""Specific intent may be inferred from  the circumstances surrounding the offense and the  conduct of the defendant."" State v. Draughn, 05-1825,  pp. 7-8 [Pg 5] (La. 1/17/07), 950 So.2d 583, 592-93  (citations omitted), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1012, 128  S.Ct. 537 (2007). Louisiana Revised Statutes 14:24 defines a principal as:  ""All persons concerned in the commission of a crime,  whether present [*7]  or absent, and whether they  directly commit the act constituting the offense, aid and  abet in its commission, or directly or indirectly counsel  or procure another to commit the crime, are principals."" Only those persons who knowingly participate in  the planning or execution of a crime are principals  to that crime. An individual may only be convicted  as a principal for those crimes for which he  personally has the requisite mental state, and the  mental state of one defendant may not be imputed  to another defendant. Thus, mere presence at the  scene of a crime does not make one a principal to  the crime. However, it is sufficient encouragement  that the accomplice is standing by at the scene of  the crime ready to give some aid if needed,  although in such a case it is necessary that the  principal actually be aware of the accomplice's  intention. State v. Page, 08-531 (La.App. 5 Cir.  11/10/09), 28 So.3d 442, 449, writ denied, 09-2684  (La.6/4/10), 38 So.3d 299. State v. Petty, 12-278, p. 11 (La.App. 5 Cir. 10/30/12),  103 So.3d 616, 623. The State is required ""to negate any reasonable  probability of misidentification"" when the key issue in a  case is the defendant's identity. State v. Hughes, 05- 992, p. 5 (La. 11/29/06), 943 So.2d 1047, 1051 (citing  State v. Weary, 03-3067 (La. 4/24/06), 931 So.2d 297,  cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1062, 127 S.Ct. 682 (2006); State  v. Neal, 00-674 (La. 6/29/01), 796 So.2d 649, cert.  denied, 535 U.S. 940, 122 S.Ct. 1323 (2002)). However,  ""[p]ositive identification by only one witness is sufficient  to support a conviction. It is the factfinder who weighs  the respective credibilities [*8]  of the witnesses, and  this court will generally not second-guess those  determinations."" Id. (citations omitted). [Pg 6] Evidence Presented at Trial This matter and these charges are primarily fact driven.  Therefore, our review of the factual evidence accepted  and presented to the jury, although extensive, laborious,  and sometimes repetitive in this opinion, is vital for a  thorough and complete analysis of the complex and  interwoven issues presented in this appeal. We now set forth the evidence presented at trial, noting  also at the outset that the jury was confronted with  contradictory and conflicting testimony and was,  consequently, called upon to resolve several factual  disputes. The first witness to testify at trial was Waylon Durison.  At the time of trial, Durison was living in a homeless  shelter in Missouri, where he was arrested and  transported to Louisiana for him to testify. Durison  testified that he had known Defendant for twenty-five to  thirty years. In May 2011, Durison had a conversation  with Defendant on the subject of killing. Durison told  Page 4 of 27 Defendant he did not think he could ever kill someone,  and Defendant responded by saying, ""[I]t ain't as hard  as you think[.]"" Defendant [*9]  then told Durison about  someone he had killed by smothering them and said he  hauled the body somewhere to dump. Durison thought  Defendant said he smothered the person with a pillow  ""or something like that."" Durison testified that Defendant  said he wrapped the body in a blanket, and he thought  Defendant dumped the body in Texas. Defendant  mentioned Coco's name and said the blanket was  Coco's.  Durison  thought  Coco  was  Defendant's  girlfriend or girlfriend's sister. Durison reported the  conversation to the police immediately thereafter and  gave a taped statement. According to Durison,  Defendant was worried that Chris Clark, their mutual  friend, might provide information to the police. [Pg 7] On cross-examination, Durison admitted that he  had been convicted of theft on several occasions.  Durison did not know what color the blanket was or who  the blanket belonged to, but he thought the blanket  might have belonged to Coco. Defense counsel  questioned Durison about his prior statement to police in  which he said Defendant and Lace Evans, Coco's sister,  killed Coco to get insurance money from her. In his prior  statement, Durison also said Coco was wrapped in ""his""  blanket, but Durison testified [*10]  the blanket was  ""hers."" Durison told police Evans was involved in Coco's  murder. Durison denied that his history of drug use  affected or impaired his memory. On redirect, Durison  testified that Defendant never said Evans killed Coco,  but that Defendant said Evans was involved in  something to do with the money. Durison said he had no  reason to lie. Skylor Hearn was an investigator with the Texas  Rangers in 2004. On October 4, 2004 Hearn received a  call from the Chambers County Sheriff's Office  (""CCSO"") requesting assistance with an unidentified  body that was discovered in an abandoned building.  Hearn testified the body was nude from the waist down,  except for socks, and was posed in a ""sexual position""  on her back with her knees bent, legs spread open, and  arms out to the side. Her body had been placed by the  open doorway of the building with her genitals facing the  roadway. Hearn testified that Coco's body was in  varying stages of decomposition and that there was an  artificial flattening of her nose and mouth, which  appeared to have occurred post-mortem. Coco was  identified by her class ring, which was engraved with her  name. The layer of dust on the floor was undisturbed  which suggested [*11]  that a sexual assault had not  occurred in the building, but Hearn took photographs of  nearby shoe impressions and tire impressions. The  State introduced several photographs depicting Coco's  body and the crime scene in conjunction with Hearn's  testimony. [Pg 8] According to Hearn, one photograph of  Coco's body showed a slight heel drag in the dust,  which indicated she was placed in that spot and not  dragged. Hearn spoke with the Alexandria Police Department  (""APD"") after identifying Coco, and Hearn learned her  car and phone were missing. Coco drove a Pontiac  Bonneville sedan with Louisiana license plate number  JUW468. Detective Cedric Green with the APD  searched Coco's house and told Hearn that her  bedroom was in disarray and her comforter was  purportedly missing. Hearn also learned Coco had  inherited a large sum of money, and there was an empty  cash box at Coco's house that he recalled had appeared  to have been pried open. Hearn attended an autopsy of Coco conducted by Dr.  Tommy Brown. Based on information from the APD, he  learned Coco had last been seen alive about fifty-two  hours prior to the discovery of her body. Dr. Brown  concluded that Coco's body was located somewhere  else where [*12]  the temperature was higher due to her  body's advanced stage of decomposition. It would have  taken four to seven days for her body to reach the  advanced stage of decomposition in the building where  she was discovered. Based on the fact that Coco's car was missing, Hearn  conducted research to determine how high the  temperature would be in the trunk of a car. It was about  eighty-eight degrees in Alexandria, which meant the  temperature inside a car would be over one hundred  degrees. Hearn tracked Coco's phone to Houston. A  juvenile found with Coco's phone told police he had  bought the phone from an African American individual  he knew as ""Red."" Hearn tracked Coco's car to the  same general area in Houston, where it was being  rented to people in exchange for drugs. The people  found in possession of the car indicated they got the car  from ""Red."" None of the people found with Coco's  possessions were implicated in her [Pg 9] death, and  the police never identified ""Red."" Hearn testified Coco's  DNA was found in the trunk of her car, and Fred  Landry's DNA was found on the trunk latch of her car.  The APD advised Hearn of a suspect they had in  custody, Levay Duncan, but Hearn did not find    Page 5 of 27 anything [*13]  in his investigation to believe Duncan  was involved. On cross-examination, Hearn indicated he was not privy  to the progress of the APD investigation after October  2005. During his investigation, he learned ""Red"" was  with his unnamed cousin when he dumped Coco's car  and phone in Houston. Hearn agreed that if Coco's car  was used to transport her body, and the car was left in  Houston, then the killer would need ""another vehicle to  get back to wherever he's going[.]"" Defense counsel  asked if Landry could be considered a suspect since his  DNA was found on the trunk latch. Hearn testified that it  would have to be determined when and how Landry's  DNA got on the latch, but he would be considered a  person of interest. Hearn testified Dr. Brown did not find  any trauma to Coco's body during the autopsy and  concluded the cause of death was homicide by  undetermined means. Hearn said a sexual assault kit  was performed, but no sperm was detected, and the  only DNA found under Coco's fingernails was her own.  Defense counsel asked Hearn if his testimony proved  Defendant killed Coco, and Hearn answered in the  negative. Dr. Tommy Brown, a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine,  was accepted as an expert in forensic [*14]  pathology.  Dr. Brown became board-certified in anatomic and  clinical pathology in 1976, nuclear medicine in 1979,  and forensic pathology in 1990. Dr. Brown said he had  conducted more than 15,000 autopsies throughout [Pg  10] his medical career and had been accepted as an  expert in forensic pathology over a hundred times. Dr. Brown performed an autopsy of Coco on October 5,  2004.  He  testified  Coco's  body  was  severely  decomposed, and the stench was terrible. The State  asked if someone who handled a decomposing body  would have the same stench on them, and Dr. Brown  agreed they would. Dr. Brown said it was important to  have background information before forming an opinion.  Dr. Brown was informed Coco was last seen on October  2, 2004 at 4:30 a.m., which was not consistent with the  advanced stage of decomposition. Dr. Brown testified  Coco must have been exposed to high heat during the  period, which accelerated the decomposition state. Dr.  Brown agreed being in the trunk of a car could be a  cause of accelerated decomposition. Dr. Brown's external examination of Coco revealed no  signs of trauma. Coco's stomach contained French fries  and chewing gum, and she had alcohol in her system.  Dr. Brown [*15]  concluded the cause of death was  homicide by undetermined means due to the body's  ""severe state of decomposition which obscured the  anatomic findings."" He testified the most likely  mechanism was asphyxia due to smothering based on  the lack of trauma to the body, lack of diseases, and  after reviewing the toxicology report. His autopsy report  was admitted into evidence and detailed his findings as  follows: CAUSE OF DEATH: Homicide by undetermined  means in a severely decomposed body. MANNER OF DEATH: Homicide. COMMENT: All procedures were performed by  the  prosecutor  including,  collection  of  decomposition fluid and spleen for toxicology,  rape kit, fingernail scrapings, clippings and  swabs, [Pg 11] pulled head hair, pulled and  combed pubic hair, removal of clothing and  recovery of hair from clothing and body. The  body  was  in  a  severe  state  of  decomposition, which obscured the anatomic  findings. The circumstances of the case are  indicative of a homicide. The mechanisms  would most likely be due to asphyxia due to  smothering. Toxicology results revealed an  ethanol content contributed most likely from the  severity of the decomposition state. Dr.  Brown  was  then  questioned  regarding  the  toxicology [*16]  results as follows: Q. So the last sentence there, toxicology results  revealed an ethanol content contributed most likely  from the severity of the decompositional state.  What on earth does that mean? A. The, um, autopsy findings on NMS, our  toxicology with NMS shows that, uh, a toxicology  analysis was done, uh, 2016 [sic] and sent to NMS.  Um, and their results showed that the ethanol or the  alcohol level was 0.178, um, grams per hundred,  uh, milliliters and that is about, uh, half of what, uh,  the original, um, autopsy findings at Ameritox was.  It also showed, uh, that she had ingested some  Tramadol which is a synthetic opioid, uh, uh, that is  used, uh, for pain and, and it is also an opium  derivative. Uh, that 1100, uh, nanograms per  milliliter. Nanograms is billionths of a milliliter. Q. So, so explain that to me. How is it we have, uh,    Page 6 of 27 a NMS Lab's report which finds the blood alcohol  concentration of .178 and the spleen has a .32.  How does that happen? A. The interval of time for one reason, but also the  spleen, um, its -- there's no studies that I know of  that you take blood in the spleen and you can  quantitate the amount of blood from the spleen, uh,  and put it into your, uh, milieu [*17]  or the findings  that you're going to make your decision on for the  autopsy. . . . . A. In my opinion, she was probably drinking at the  time, but that would not account for her being, uh,  totally -- or could have died from her alcohol  intoxication. Q. All right. A. There's a number of things that might interfere  with the results. Number one is it's postmortem.  Number two is there's a, a peripheral distribution of  the, uh, alcohol and the drugs within the [Pg 12]  system. After death, it goes to different parts of the  organs . . . and the spleen is a peripheral organ, so  it is going to show an elevated level also. However,  there's no studies in forensic and, uh, toxicology  does not use the spleen as a quantitative reason . .  . to determine that the person had died from alcohol  intoxication.  It's  not  acceptable,  uh,  as  a  quantitative means. Qualitative you can say there's  alcohol there, and I can try to divide it up saying  that . . . she probably did imbibe with alcohol, but I - - it was not near where they are referring to as .32. Generally, up to 0.16 of blood alcohol concentration  may be attributed to body decomposition; however, Dr.  Brown restated that the spleen is not an acceptable  means [*18]   of  determining  blood  alcohol  concentration. In his opinion, Dr. Brown did not think  Coco died from alcohol poisoning or a drug overdose.  The chewing gum was a significant factor in determining  Coco was asphyxiated, because it suggested to Dr.  Brown that she was likely chewing the gum when she  was smothered to death, which caused her to  accidentally swallow the gum. Drs. Harry Bonnell and  Adel Shaker reached the same conclusions as Dr.  Brown.       On cross-examination, Dr. Brown testified that there  were no lacerations around Coco's neck or fractures on  the coracoid or hyoid bones to suggest strangulation.  His conclusion that Coco was asphyxiated was a  diagnosis of exclusion based on his education and  experience. Dr. Brown testified that he wanted to see  which drugs were in her system, so he extracted blood  from her spleen for the purpose of qualitative analysis  only. The 2015 toxicology report indicated Coco had  tramadol in her system, but Dr. Brown did not think the  amount of tramadol was enough to indicate an  overdose: A. Not in my opinion. No. The, um, um, one study  shows, um, five deaths, uh, due to Tramadol. The  mean was . . . six thousand one hundred. She only  had one thousand [Pg 13] [*19]  one hundred so  the deaths that were reported due to Tramadol  were five thousand nanograms per milliliter higher  than what she had in her bloodstream. The therapeutic level for tramadol was listed up to eight  hundred nanograms, so Coco was ""a little bit over the  therapeutic level"" according to Dr. Brown. The State called Fred Landry to testify. Landry testified  that he had a sexual relationship with Coco while she  was dating her boyfriend, ""Jitty."" He said he did not  have anything to do with her death. On cross- examination, Landry stated he did know that his DNA  had been found on the trunk latch of Coco's car. Detective Cedric Green, an APD detective on the case  since its inception, also testified. Det. Green testified he  searched Coco's house and spoke with Jackie  Hampton, Lonnie Melbert, and Lewis Jones, the last  people known to have seen Coco alive. They were  never eliminated as suspects, but Det. Green testified  there was no evidence to suggest their involvement in  Coco's death. Evidence at the house revealed Coco,  Hampton, Melbert, and Jones had been playing  dominos and smoking weed. Det. Green learned that on  the night of October 1, 2004 prior to her disappearance,  Coco went to a [*20]  convenience store called The  Gate. Photographs taken of the surveillance footage  show the clothes Coco was wearing, and the police         Page 7 of 27 found those clothes at her house. Further investigation  revealed Coco had visited the Rapides Parish Health  Unit and been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted  disease shortly before her disappearance. In a letter to  Coco dated September 23, 2004 a nurse from the  health unit indicated it was important [Pg 14] for Coco's  sexual partner to also receive treatment. Someone  handwrote the name ""Jitty"" on the letter, indicating he  was Coco's sexual partner. On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Det.  Green about other persons of interest in the case. Det.  Green testified that Levay Duncan went by Coco's  house with Melbert, and that on October 2, 2004 Coco  brought Hampton and Jones home after the domino  game. Det. Green testified that Coco had been dating  multiple people before her disappearance, one being  Hampton's brother, Floyd Williams, also known as  ""Jitty."" Coco's sister, Evans, was another person of  interest in the investigation. Det. Green stated that  Evans was evasive and did not want to talk to the  police. Coco was also dating Earnest Veal or [*21]   ""Prince,"" who became a person of interest. Det. Green  testified that Coco's house had been burglarized at least  two times leading up to her death, and the police never  found the culprit or culprits. When she turned eighteen,  Coco began receiving inheritance money. In June 2004,  Coco received a $20,000 lump sum payment, and by  July, the money was gone from her bank account. Officer William Bates, a crime scene officer with the  APD for nineteen years before his retirement, also  testified. Officer Bates testified he conducted a search  of Coco's house and took photographs in October of  2004, after Coco's body was discovered in Texas.  According to Officer Bates, all the entrances of the  house were locked, and he had to break a window to  gain access. Otherwise, there was no sign of forced  entry into her house, so Officer Bates testified either the  perpetrator walked through an unlocked door or was let  into the house. He noted a garbage can had been  turned over in the kitchen and Coco's mattress had  been lifted. The lockbox under the bed was empty  except for a box of cigarettes. Officer Bates testified the  last time Coco's phone was used in Alexandria was 4:30  a.m. on [Pg 15] October 2, 2004. [*22]  Coco's last  phone call was to a house belonging to Latonya  Anderson, Williams' girlfriend. Janet Vayon lived in Winnie, Texas, and worked at the  CCSO as a civilian employee in 2004. Vayon testified  that she was friends with identification witness, Jude  Wilson, and had graduated with Wilson in 1981.  According to Vayon, Wilson had a photographic memory  and was an artist. Vayon stated the Texas Rice Festival  was held on the first weekend in October every year.  Vayon was contacted by investigators in September  2022 and asked if she had any recollection of an  incident which occurred on FM 1406 in 2004. Initially,  she did not remember anything. However, she later  remembered October 3, 2004 was a Sunday and the  day of the goat and lamb show at the Rice Festival.  Vayon was a chairman of the show and recalled it  started at 5:00 p.m. and lasted until about 9:00 p.m. On  her way home, Vayon passed by the abandoned  building where Coco's body was later found. Vayon was  following Wilson in her truck when a vehicle ""shot out"" in  between them. Vayon testified that Wilson went to the  CCSO ""probably four days later"" to report the incident. Q. All right. Ms. Vayon, at the time that he came to  the Sheriff's [*23]  Office had Courtney Coco's body  been discovered in that building? A. No, sir. This was the day before I think the body  was found, so we knew nothing about a body. We  were just -- but when he came in four days later,  the body had been found, and he felt like that  information would be very important. Q. That, that's what I mean. Let me, let me be clear  about the question I'm asking. A. Okay. [Pg 16] Q. At the time that you see this almost  wreck with the person you later find out was Mr.  Wilson, when you see that wreck, you had no clue  there was a body in that building? A. Not at all. No, sir. Q. Mr. Wilson comes into the Sheriff's Office after  the body is found? A. Correct. The only thing Vayon could remember about the other  car was that it was dark colored. Vayon testified that she  had some knowledge that a body was found at the  abandoned building from working at the CCSO, but she  had not thought about what day the body was  discovered. Q. So is there any doubt in your mind that what you  observed, this near wreck between Mr. Wilson and  this car, was on that weekend? A. No doubt. Q. [W]as it, uh, a Friday night, Saturday night, or  Sunday night?   Page 8 of 27 A. It was Sunday, [be]cause I went to work the  next [*24]  morning, Monday. Vayon said she tried to write down the car's license  plate number, but she lost the piece of paper and could  not remember the license plate number at trial. On cross-examination, Vayon stated the Rice Festival  usually starts on a Wednesday and ends on a Sunday.  In 2004, though, the Rice Festival was longer than  usual, with a barbecue cookoff taking place the  weekend before. The cookoff was on Friday and  Saturday but some teams left on Sunday. Defense  counsel introduced into evidence the 2004 Rice Festival  program which listed the dates of the festival as  September 24 to October 3, 2004. Vayon did not recall  whether Wilson was hired to design the brochures or  programs in 2004. [Pg 17] Vayon was contacted by Trooper Younger in  August 2022, at which time Vayon said she had no  recollection of the near wreck between Wilson and the  unidentified car. Vayon explained that Trooper Younger  brought up the Coco case, which she did not think had  anything to do with the incident at the time. Trooper  Younger told Vayon what the police thought she was a  witness to on October 3, 2004. She could not recall  whether Trooper Younger mentioned Wilson's name,  but she testified she did not speak [*25]  with Wilson  after her conversation with Trooper Younger. Vayon  said ""[r]ight after [she] got off the phone"" with Trooper  Younger, she remembered the incident. When she was  contacted by Trooper Younger in September, a month  before trial, Vayon provided a detailed statement. Vayon testified that people who are interviewed at the  CCSO usually write down their statements in their own  handwriting, and then the police type the statements for  the witnesses' signatures. She explained that some  investigators listened and took notes during the  interview and typed the witness's statement from their  notes before asking the witness to sign. Vayon was  certain the incident occurred on October 3, because she  would not have been in a truck and trailer any other day  of the Rice Festival. Jude Wilson lived in Winnie for most of his life and  traveled on FM 1406 all the time. The State questioned  Wilson about his recollection of the night of the near  wreck: Q. So, uh, tell me, tell me kind of the  circumstances. When was this? What time of day? A. Um, it was at night and, um, I don't remember  what the day was exactly or anything like that. I, I'm  terrible with dates and stuff like that. Um, but I do  remember [*26]  that, um, my wife had asked me to  pick up some cigarettes . . . [Pg 18] . . . . A. I went across the street to Texaco, which I know  they close about ten o'clock, so, um, I got it there  and then I took off, uh, and then headed back  home. And as I was coming over the overpass, um,  I noticed there was a car there and (interrupted) Q. Car where? A. At this, um, house. Uh, there was an abandoned  house. Wilson testified that as he was driving over the  overpass, he saw someone walk in front of the  headlights of a car that was parked roughly ten or  twelve feet away from the building. The person got in  the car and started backing out of the driveway. Wilson  said he had to swerve to avoid hitting the car as he was  driving between fifty-five and sixty miles per hour.  Wilson saw part of the car's license plate, and he  testified it was a Louisiana license plate with the letters  ""J"" and ""W"" and the number eight. Wilson specifically  remembered the letters because they were his initials.  Wilson testified the person driving the car sped off and  got on I-10 going towards Houston. When asked to describe the person he saw, Wilson said  he appeared young, had really short hair, and did not  have facial hair. Wilson [*27]  testified the person ""had  the features of a white person"" with ""regular lips"" and a  regular nose. Wilson did not see the person's face from  the front; he only saw the person's profile. Wilson drew the map on the Rice Festival brochure and  passed the brochures out. Q. So, in relation to the Rice Festival, when is this  almost wreck that we're talking about? A. Um, I couldn't tell you right off hand because I --  there were so many things going on. Um, it, it was  just everything was just like a blur. [Pg 19] Q. When you say so many things going on,  you mean, so many things going on at the Rice  Festival? A. At the Rice Festival. I was up and down the road  all the time. Q. So, generally, when is the Rice Festival? A. Um, it used to be the, the first week of October. Wilson did not report the near wreck immediately but  made a report on October 8, 2004 after he saw that a  body had been found. Wilson said he told the police at  Page 9 of 27 the CCSO that he did not remember what day the  incident occurred because he had been busy passing  out the brochures so he could get paid for his work. He  provided information regarding the person's description  and license plate number. After talking with the police,  he was provided [*28]  with a prepared statement to  sign. Wilson's written statement at the CCSO provided: My name is Jude Wilson. . . . I travel FM 1406  several times a day. There is an abandoned house  on FM 1406 in which the body was found. I was  traveling down FM 1406 I believe it was Monday,  September 27, 2004. I had gone to the Power Fuel  and I was on my way back to the house. I believe it  was about 10:15 PM because Power Fuel closes at  10:00 PM and I had just made it in there before  they closed. I was coming over the overpass at  Interstate 10 and I noticed a car backing out of this  abandoned house. I really paid attention to the car  because it did not appear that they were going to  stop and I thought they might back out in front of  me. They stopped almost at the road. I noticed the  car was a dark color and it had Louisiana plates. I  recall part of the license plates as being JW  because [those are] my initials and it stood out to  me. It appeared to me to be an older model car  because I noticed the tail lights to be boxier than  that of a modern car. It was dark inside the vehicle  so I could not see inside the vehicle. I did look in  the mirror after I had passed and the vehicle was  traveling South on FM [*29]  1406 over the bridge  and heading back toward the Winnie area. The only  other car that I have ever seen at this abandoned  house was a white four door car which was  approximately one month ago[;] this car also had  Louisiana Plates on it. [Pg 20] When I saw the news last night, October 7,  2004, with the description of the vehicle, there was  no doubt in my mind that this is the vehicle that I  saw backing out of the driveway of this abandoned  house. Wilson was not contacted about the Coco case until  Detective Dryden from the APD contacted him a few  years prior to trial, approximately fifteen years after the  near wreck. Wilson drew a silhouette of the person  based on his memory for Detective Dryden. Detective  Dryden called Wilson to ask if he would be willing to  look at a photographic lineup, and Wilson testified he  ""was kind of skeptical at first"" but agreed to do so.  Wilson identified Defendant, a white man, as the person  driving the car both in the photographic lineup and at  trial. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Wilson  why he had not mentioned seeing the number eight in  the license plate number in any of his prior statements  to police. Wilson said he told the CCSO but ""that [*30]   apparently did not get into the statement."" The  statement also did not mention that Wilson saw the  person walking and getting into the car, which Wilson  claimed he told the police. Wilson acknowledged that he  signed an affidavit certifying his statement was true and  accurate, but he said he did not read the statement  before signing. Wilson testified that he had never read  his 2004 statement. Regarding his statements to  Detective Dryden in 2020, defense counsel asked  Wilson  why  he  was  skeptical  about  doing  a  photographic lineup. The following colloquy occurred: A. Because it's almost twenty years later, and . . .  I've never done a lineup before. Uh, as I said I did  a, I did a drawing for him and sent it to him, and  that's when he asked me to pick him out of a lineup,  and I didn't know whether -- [be]cause if, if I hadn't  of been able to recognize his features, I certainly  would not have done that. Q. But did you not tell Detective Dryden I didn't see  his full face? Did you not tell him that? A. I'm sorry. Repeat that. [Pg 21] Q. Did you not tell him you did not see his  full face? A. Correct. Q. Wouldn't that be why you'd be skeptical to pick  someone out of a lineup? A. No, [be]cause if I, [*31]  if I see a side profile of  somebody, um, and they had a side profile, then  that would be acceptable as well. Q. But they didn't show you a side profile. They  showed you a frontal picture of six individuals.  Right? A. That is correct. . . . . Q. So, if you didn't see his full face, how could you  pick him out of a lineup? A. Because I can use my mind and I turned him  (interrupted) Q. They didn't (interrupted) A. -- sideways and (interrupted) Q. Oh -- the silhouette with regular lips and a nose.  Correct? A. Yes. Q. Regular lips and nose that could be just about  on anybody. Correct? A. Yes, sir. Wilson told Det. Dryden he remembered the car's  Page 10 of 27 license plate contained his initials, ""JGW,"" but he did not  mention the number eight in his statement. Wilson  stated that he had a photographic memory. Wilson  testified that before giving his statement at the CCSO,  he recognized part of the license plate number from the  news, which listed the plate number and location where  Coco's body had been found. [Pg 22] Defense counsel questioned Wilson about the  date of the near wreck. Wilson told Det. Dryden it  occurred the week of the Rice Festival. Defense counsel  asked why Wilson would have been passing out  brochures [*32]  on the last day of the festival, October  3, 2004, and Wilson testified he thought they had run  out of brochures. Wilson testified he usually delivered  the brochures on the Monday or Tuesday before the  festival began. The festival usually began on a Friday,  went through the next week, and concluded on a  Sunday. In 2004, the festival was held September 24  through October 3, 2004. Coco's body was discovered  on October 4, 2004. The statement he signed at CCSO  indicated the incident occurred on Monday, September  27, 2004. Q. [T]o be clear you told Detective Dryden that on a  Monday or Tuesday before the festival began which  was in September that this incident happened to  you, the car almost backing [into] you. A. Well, that's -- I didn't give any dates. I thought  that may, that might be the time, but I really am not  sure as to what time that was. Q. We get that. But you said it was before the  Festival. Right? A. Uh, yes. Q. And did you not just see this piece of evidence  that said the Festival was between the dates of  September 24th and October 3rd . Is that correct? A. Yes. Q. So if it was the Wednesday before the Festival  began, you would have seen that when? In October  or in September? Based [*33]  on these dates, sir. A. Uh, it would have been in September. [Pg 23] On redirect, Wilson said he had a problem  remembering dates. Wilson testified that he trusted the  CCSO to draft his statement based on all the  information he provided to them, but they failed to do so.  Wilson opined Caucasians have narrow noses whereas  African Americans, Native Americans, and Vietnamese  people have wider noses that are flatter to the face.  Wilson said that when he looked at an individual, he  took a snapshot of the person in his mind and turned the  person sideways to see his or her profile. He testified he  could also do the opposite to see a person's face from  the front by looking at his or her profile. Clyde Griffin also testified at trial that he saw Coco at a  club the Friday before her body was discovered. The  following Saturday afternoon, he saw a man driving  Coco's green Pontiac Bonneville in Alexandria. Griffin  had seen the man before but did not know his name.  Griffin ultimately identified Veal as the driver of Coco's  car in a photographic lineup. Michelle Paul was Coco's aunt. She testified the family  was able to enter Coco's house after it was released by  the police, which was about eighteen days [*34]  after  the body was discovered. Paul noticed Coco's comforter  was missing from her bed, and she found a load of  ""maybe six, no more than ten . . . mechanic rags"" in the  dryer. Paul testified that she thought it was weird that  Coco would wash only a few rags and that the rags  smelled strongly of bleach. Paul could not think of a  reason why Coco would have mechanic shop rags. Dr. Charles Delzell was accepted as an expert in  mathematics. He performed a mathematical experiment  to test the probability of a test subject correctly guessing  certain independent variables. Dr. Delzell testified that  the probability of the test subject correctly guessing two  out of three letters on a license plate and correctly  guessing it was a Louisiana license plate was less than  [Pg 24] one percent. The percentage of probability  would be smaller if the test subject also correctly  identified the perpetrator in a six-person lineup. On  cross-examination, Dr. Delzell said his probability  experiment would be invalidated if the test subject knew  the license plate information, because his ""experiment  assumes the test subject does not know the license  plate[.]"" Lace Evans was Coco's sister and had been  Defendant's fiancée [*35]  for six years. Evans testified  that she last spoke with Coco on a Thursday. **date**  Evans testified that in the early morning hours on the  following Saturday, she and Defendant got into an  argument, and Defendant left the house. Defendant  came back to the house thirty minutes to an hour later,  then he left again. Evans did not see Defendant again  until Monday, the day Coco's body was discovered.  Evans and Defendant lived together and shared one  vehicle. Evans testified that Defendant had given her a  promise ring. When the funeral home gave Evans the  jewelry from Coco's body, she found a gold ring that fit  Page 11 of 27 directly into her promise ring as if it was a wedding set.  Evans claimed this confirmed her suspicion that Coco  and Defendant were seeing each other behind her back.  Evans said Coco and Defendant would disappear at the  same time. One time, Evans called Defendant's phone  and he ""butt answered it,"" and Evans heard Coco's  voice in the background. When Evans confronted them  about her suspicions, both Coco and Defendant denied  having an affair. Evans said Coco had a leopard print  comforter. She claimed that she saw the comforter, or  one exactly like it, at Defendant's mother's house  about [*36]  four years after Coco's death. The State  introduced three videos [Pg 25] Evans recorded of  Defendant driving near the time of Coco's death. Evans  disagreed with Det. Green's testimony regarding her  level of cooperation in the investigation. On cross-examination, Evans was shown a timeline  which indicated her last phone call with Coco was on a  Friday. She agreed the call was on Friday, not a  Thursday  as  she  previously  testified.  Evans  acknowledged that she was a person of interest during  the 2004 investigation. Evans testified that she saw  Coco every day because they worked together, but she  never paid attention to Coco's ring. Evans said it was  possible that the comforter she saw at Defendant's  mother's house was not Coco's. Evans testified that  after Coco's death, she found a bag containing a  license, among other items, that Coco had hidden in  Evans' house. The license belonged to Alexandra  Wolfe, Coco's ex-roommate. According to Evans, Wolfe  had threatened to gut Coco with a blade when Coco  kicked her out of the house. Evans never met Wolfe. Charlene Goleman was married to Chris Clark, one of  Defendant's friends. Goleman testified at trial she had a  few troubling conversations with [*37]  Defendant. One  such conversation occurred when Defendant brought up  Veal, whom Goleman had witnessed murder her friend's  husband. She said Defendant bragged that Veal ""had  killed someone in cold blood"" and only had to serve a  seventeen year sentence. Goleman was asked whether  Defendant talked about Coco, and she responded: A. Um, he would just make comments about the trip  to Texas, um, uh, her body being found in the, in  the warehouse wrapped up, um, her Mustang. Just  different, different things along the lines that -- I  mean, I didn't know Courtney so, I mean, I just, I  would listen.    [Pg 26] Goleman testified that she, Clark, and  Defendant went to Toledo Bend, and they discussed  Coco after Defendant had been drinking. Goleman  claimed that she did not know any details about the  Coco case at the time. The State questioned Goleman  about the conversation as follows: Q. And did he tell you anything about what part he  played in the murder of Courtney Coco? A. He didn't say what part he played[;] he just said .  . . it was him and Earnest Veal and Earnest Veal's  cousin. I don't know, I don't know his name. I didn't  -- Q. And what did he say about him and Earnest Veal  and Earnest Veal's cousin? [*38]  A. He told me that they'd all had sex with Courtney  at one time but nobody would ever get in trouble for  it because they used condoms. Um (interrupted) Q. [Was] there an occasion where, uh, he admitted,  to choke, choking Courtney to you? A. Right. He just (interrupted) Q. Okay. Well, when . . . and where was that? A. Um, it was either in Toledo Bend or it was in  Alexandria. One of the two. Q. All right. And what do you remember about him  saying he choked Courtney? A. He made the comment about he did his hands  like that, uh, choking Courtney and that was, I  mean, that was just about it. Defendant told Goleman that Coco's body was wrapped  in plastic and put in a warehouse in Winnie close to I-10.  Goleman answered affirmatively when asked whether a  silver Mustang ""played some part"" in the ""business  concerning Courtney Coco[.]"" Goleman had multiple  conversations with Defendant about Coco in 2009 or  2010. Goleman said she gave a statement to the APD  around the same time. [Pg 27] She indicated that she  did not know anything about Coco's death other than  what she had seen ""on the news or whatever[.]"" On cross-examination, Goleman said she later learned  that Veal had dated Coco and was a person of [*39]   interest in the case. According to Goleman, Veal  received a forty year sentence for killing her friend's  husband. Goleman testified that she possibly knew that  Coco's  body  was  found  in  Texas  before  her  conversation with Defendant. She also clarified that  Defendant said the choking was a separate act from the  sex, and Defendant did not say anything about Coco  being choked during the sex he, Veal, and Veal's cousin  allegedly had with her. Goleman testified that Defendant  Page 12 of 27 mentioned a Mustang, but she did not know if it was  used for anything. Lieutenant Carla Whitstine from APD testified next. Lt.  Whitstine testified that phone records indicated on  September 8, 2004 Coco called Evans' landline phone  during Evans' work hours. Lt. Whitstine did not know  whether Defendant answered the phone. The last time  Coco's phone was used in Alexandria was October 2,  2004 at 4:30 a.m., and Coco's phone became active in  Houston on October 3, 2004 at 10:00 p.m. Ina Laborde was Coco's grandmother. Laborde testified  she had last visited Coco at Coco's house about three  weeks before her body was found. Laborde said Coco  had a shower curtain with fish and seashells that she  discovered was missing when she entered [*40]  the  house in the weeks following Coco's death. On cross- examination, Laborde indicated that she mentioned the  missing shower curtain to Paul but to no one else. [Pg 28] Shamus Setliff was married to Tiffany Cedars  from 2001 through 2013. Setliff had been friends with  Defendant since childhood and had known Coco ""since  she was in diapers."" Setliff testified that a month prior to  Coco's death, he went on a camping trip to the  Louisiana Dunes with Coco, Evans, and Defendant. A  video taken during the trip reflected a date of February  21, 2004, but Setliff testified he remembered the trip  took place on Labor Day weekend because he suffered  injuries  from  a  four-wheeler  accident.  Setliff's  impression was that ""[t]here was something going on""  between Defendant and Coco. According to Setliff,  Defendant called him on the phone the week after  Coco's death and told him the police found her body.  Defendant told Setliff that ""he'd done it."" The State  questioned Setliff about a conversation he had with his  ex-wife, Cedars, that was recorded. Setliff said he was probably at a residence he did not  share with Cedars the weekend of Coco's death. At that  time, he was employed with the Lafayette Drug  Company [*41]  delivering merchandise to various  stores. Setliff claimed he delivered as far as Port Arthur,  but he denied delivering to Winnie. In his prior statement  to the police, Setliff had said his delivery route went  through Winnie and that he had passed by the  abandoned building where Coco's body was found three      times the weekend of her disappearance. Setliff testified  that he learned what Coco's body looked like from  listening to a true crime podcast about the Coco case.  Setliff told Cedars that Coco's body was ""blue from the  waist up[.]"" Setliff said that his best friend, William Ahart,  owned a red Mustang with silver ground effects in 2004. [Pg 29] On cross-examination, Setliff said he talked to  police on three different occasions and gave three  different statements. In his last statement, which was  two or three weeks before trial, Setliff recanted every  allegation he had made against Defendant. Setliff was  again questioned about his whereabouts the weekend  of Coco's disappearance: Q. Isn't it true that when you came back from that  mysterious weekend of being gone, didn't your ex- wife find panties in your van? A. No, sir. Q. Didn't she find . . . cellophane wrap in your van? A. Yes, she did [*42]  [be]cause I got pallets of stuff  wrapped in cellophane. Q. And didn't she say you came home smelling the  worst stink she's ever smelled in her entire life? A. Oh, yeah. I didn't know that. Q. Smell of death, sir? Did you have the smell of  death on you? A. A camping trip maybe, but not death. Q. Um. A. I probably smelled pretty rough after a weekend. Setliff said he went to Texas on Monday morning;  despite his earlier testimony, he claimed, ""I've never  been to Winnie, Texas."" Tiffany Cedars testified that she did not know where  Setliff was the weekend of Coco's disappearance.  Cedars said that Setliff claimed he was not coming  home because of injuries he sustained in a four-wheeler  wreck. When he got home around two or three o'clock  on Monday morning, Setliff was dirty and smelled bad.  Cedars told him to wash his clothes in bleach and to  take a shower. [Pg 30] Cedars went to Setliff's work van  to get his shaving kit and found a pair of panties that did  not belong to her and also Saran wrap in the van. When  she confronted him, Setliff said the panties belonged to  one of her friends. Cedars testified that Setliff's work  delivery route went through Beaumont and Winnie.  Cedars knew he went to Winnie, [*43]  because Setliff  had to go to the emergency room one time, and he went  to a hospital in Winnie. The State asked Cedars about  her recorded conversation with Setliff, and Cedars said  Setliff's friend, Ahart, drove a silver Mustang in 2004. On  Page 13 of 27 cross-examination, Cedars denied having any personal  knowledge of Coco's death and stated any information  she knew about Coco's death was provided by Setliff.  She said she was aware of Setliff's recent recantation.  Cedars said Setliff lied to her and cheated on her during  their marriage, but she did not tell the police about their  conversation in order to get back at him for having  affairs. Tanner Dryden was a detective with the APD during the  reinvestigation of the case in 2019. He identified Veal as  the person Griffin said was driving Coco's car on  Saturday. Det. Dryden named Defendant as the person  Wilson identified as driving ""Courtney's car"" on Sunday.  On cross-examination, Det. Dryden said he developed  Wilson as a possible witness after reviewing the files  from the prior investigations. Det. Dryden testified that  after speaking with Wilson about his statement to the  CCSO in 2004, Wilson determined the listed date of the  near wreck, September [*44]  27, 2004 was incorrect.  Det. Dryden agreed Wilson's ""original statement was not  in line with the timeline of Coco's death[,]"" because  Coco was alive on September 27, 2004. Defense  counsel asked whether Det. Dryden [Pg 31] suggested  the October 4 date to Wilson. Det. Dryden testified as  follows: A. Well, so what helped me establish the dates, as  far as mentioned October 4th, um, the way he  explained in the interview was that, uh, the night  when he was almost in a wreck with, uh, Courtney's  car or the car we now believe was Courtney's car  that he . . . identified Anthony in. Um, the following,  uh -- the days following that, he saw it on the news.  That's how he was able to determine that that was  the car he saw[;] that's why I asked about those  dates. Det. Dryden said he was unable to find the dates for the  2004 Rice Festival. Defense counsel showed Det.  Dryden the 2004 Rice Festival Program, which had  previously been entered into evidence, and asked: Q. So if the official start date of the Rice Festival  was September 29th and Mr. Wilson said he was  doing what he was doing the Monday before it  officially began (interrupted) A. Um, hmm. Q. -- what date would that have been? A. The 27th . Q. And [*45]  what day was in his original  statement? A. The 27th . On redirect, Detective Dryden testified that Wilson  consistently stated the incident occurred the day before  Coco's body was found. The State re-called Evans to ask a single question:  whether she had anything to do with the murder of her  sister. Evans denied having any involvement. Dr. Timothy Scanlan was offered and accepted as an  expert in crime scene analysis and crime scene  reconstruction. Dr. Scanlan testified there were three  reasons a body might be staged in a sexualized manner  at a crime scene. The first reason for sexual staging is  to demean the victim, to cause a shock factor, or to get  revenge. The second possible reason for sexual staging  is because the crime was committed by sexual serial  killer. Dr. Scanlan said there was no evidence to [Pg 32]  suggest the second reason in this case. The third and  final possible reason for sexual staging is to trick the  police into believing there was a sexual motivation to the  killing when one did not exist. Dr. Scanlan testified  Coco's body was not hidden; rather, it was displayed or  presented in a place where it could be easily found. Dr.  Scanlan testified that someone had to completely [*46]   outstretch her arms and manipulate her legs to put her  in the position she was found in. He also found it  important that the bottom half of her clothing was  missing. The State asked Dr. Scanlan to read aloud the  letter Coco had been sent from the Health Department  regarding her STD diagnosis. Dr. Scanlan determined the primary crime scene, ""the  location of the original criminal activity,"" was Coco's  house, based on an examination of the photographs  and her family's statements to police. Dr. Scanlan  testified that ""DNA and fingerprints play a larger role on  stranger crimes, when you don't expect to see that  person's DNA or fingerprints there."" However, if it is  reasonably expected to find a person's DNA or  fingerprints somewhere, the significance of finding it is  diminished because it cannot be determined when the  DNA or fingerprint was left. Dr. Scanlan knew of the  relationship between Coco and Landry, and he stated it  could be reasonably expected to find Landry's DNA on  Coco's car trunk latch. Similarly, Dr. Scanlan said he  ""wouldn't put any additional weight"" into Defendant's  DNA being found in Coco's car because of their  relationship. The lack of Defendant's DNA and  fingerprints, [*47]   on  the  other  hand,  was  not  determinative to Dr. Scanlan as to whether Defendant  had been in Coco's car. He testified that fingerprints are  often unusable due to smudging, and DNA must be in a  detectable limit. Page 14 of 27 [Pg 33] The State then asked Dr. Scanlan whether the  lack of anyone else's DNA under Coco's fingernails was  significant: Q. All right. So, explain how the lack of foreign DNA  doesn't mean that she wasn't murdered or that she  didn't touch whoever was killing her at the time. A. Again, it's the absence of evidence, uh, theory.  So, um, just because she doesn't have the DNA  under her fingernails doesn't mean she wasn't in an  altercation. It just means she didn't get DNA under  her fingernails. Um, it's all the other factors around  a case that you rely upon in that case. Um, I can tell  you I've, I've had both. I've had some with DNA  under the fingernails and sometimes violent  scenes, um, sexual assaults, uh, close encounters  where they have not had DNA under the fingernails.  So, it's just that the DNA is present or not. Q. So, the bottom line is, is there any significance  that this jury should draw from lack of foreign DNA  under her fingernails? A. No, sir. Although the police originally [*48]  thought the tire  tracks by the abandoned building where Coco's body  was found were consistent with the tires on Coco's car,  Dr. Scanlan requested expert analysis from the  Louisiana State Police, who determined the tire tracks  did not match Coco's car. Dr. Scanlan was aware of  Wilson's identification of Coco's car at the scene but  testified there was no physical evidence placing Coco's  car at the scene. Dr. Scanlan testified there could have  been more than one person who dumped Coco's body. Stephanie Belgard was Coco's mother. Belgard said  Williams was Coco's ""steady boyfriend"" at the time of  her death, but she denied that Coco only dated African  American men. The State introduced a photograph  taken at Coco's prom of Coco and her date, Dustin  Olson, who was Caucasian. Belgard testified she  thought Coco was going to marry Olson one day.  Regarding the money Coco inherited, Belgard explained  that Coco's father had been receiving money for a [Pg  34] work accident when he died, and the money passed  to Coco, his only child. Coco received fifteen hundred  dollars a month and a lump sum of money every five  years. Her inheritance was common knowledge in  Coco's family. Belgard said Coco usually [*49]  wore a t- shirt and underwear and sometimes a bra to bed. On cross-examination, Belgard testified that she thought  Coco ""was being used by many people."" Coco moved  out of Belgard's house when she graduated high school.  Defense counsel asked if Coco's preference for dating  African American men became a point of contention  after she moved out. Belgard said they did not talk  about it but agreed that most of the people Coco dated  were African American. Following Belgard's testimony,  the State rested. Dr. Stephen Norman was accepted as an expert in  anatomic pathology, clinical pathology, and forensic  pathology. Dr. Norman became board-certified in  anatomic and clinical pathology in 1982. From 1984 to  2004, Dr. Norman was a deputy coroner at the Rapides  Parish Coroner's Office before going into private  practice  to  focus  on  autopsies  and  laboratory  management. Dr. Norman's involvement in the Coco case began in  2016 when he was contacted by a detective with the  Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office (""RPSO"") and asked to  review several cold case files. Dr. Norman was provided  with three sets of documents to aid his review: Dr.  Brown's autopsy report, which included the 2004  toxicology report; the 2015 [*50]  toxicology report; and  a crime lab report from the Texas Department of Public  Safety Crime Laboratory. Dr. Norman prepared a report  for the RPSO wherein he concluded Coco's cause of  death was an overdose of a combination of ethanol and  tramadol. [Pg 35] His report described why he made  such a conclusion: The toxicology analysis attached to the autopsy  report (TOX 2004) was peculiar in that there is no  indication that blood was tested. The only sample  seems to be spleen, which is an organ that is not  commonly tested in my experience. However, for  ethanol in particular it appears to be a reasonable  indicator and the finding of 0.32% (w/v) of ethanol  would suggest that a similar level would have been  present in the blood of Courtney Coco. The fact that  stored blood was tested eleven years later (TOX  2015) and showed a level of 0.178% (w/v) further  substantiates the original level, because stored  blood is known to show decreases in the amount of  ethanol over time. . . . When extrapolated to the  eleven years of storage in this case, the two levels  obtained in TOX 2004 and TOX 2015 are quite  comparable, leading strength to the original level. Another  factor  to  consider  relative  to  estimating [*51]  the degree of ethanol intoxication  is the fact that after death[,] there can be  endogenous production of small amounts of ethanol  by the breakdown of glucose and by production of  bacteria. This amount has been found to be as high  as 0.15% (w/v) but this maximum level does not  Page 15 of 27 occur until the tenth day postmortem, only  beginning to be detectable by the second or third  day. . . . I believe that the ethanol level found in the  spleen in TOX 2004 is most likely a very close  approximation of the level that would have been in  Ms. Coco's blood at the time of death. This level is  very high and can by itself be lethal in some  subjects. In the TOX 2015 report we also find tramadol  (Ultram) in a concentration of 1100 ng/mL.  Literature is not available regarding whether or not  the level would decrease over time, but there is  logically no reason to expect that it would increase.  Therefore[,] I find this level most likely accurately  reflects the level present in Ms. Coco's blood at the  time of death. This is a very high level and would be  considered by many to be ""toxic"" but not high  enough to be lethal all by itself. However, the  effects of ethanol and tramadol on sedation are not  only additive but [*52]  potentiating. Therefore[,] it is  my conclusion that the death of Courtney Megan  Coco was due to overdosage with ethanol and  tramadol. (footnotes omitted). Dr. Norman referenced several articles pertaining to the  stability of blood alcohol in forensic blood samples and  the interpretation of analytical changes in toxicology  results post-mortem. Based on Coco's high level of  blood alcohol concentration, Dr. Norman said that ""at  least part of it was . . . from consumption [Pg 36] of  alcohol before death."" He said Coco's blood alcohol  concentration  could  not  be  solely  attributed  to  fermentation of the blood caused by decomposition. Dr.  Norman opined that the spleen was a good organ to  accurately measure the concentration of blood alcohol  since it contains a lot of blood. When asked why the lab did not originally test for  tramadol or ecstasy, Dr. Norman explained that the lab  used in 2004 was ""probably limited in what it . . . had the  ability to test for[.]"" In 2015, when a new toxicology test  was performed, it was revealed that Coco had 1100  ng/mL of tramadol and an unknown amount of ecstasy  in her system. Dr. Norman testified that level of  tramadol had been fatal in some cases  and,  combined [*53]  with ""a good solid dose of alcohol,""  could explain Coco's death.   Dr. Norman was aware that Dr. Bonnell reviewed the  case in 2007 and that Dr. Bonnell wrote a one-page  letter agreeing with the original findings made by Dr.  Brown. Dr. Norman testified that he did ""not have any  respect for"" Dr. Bonnell's opinion, because Dr. Bonnell  was a ""hired gun"" who made his living off testifying. Dr.  Norman said he thought Dr. Bonnell could be hired to  say anything. Dr. Norman was not hired by the defense. He further testified that there are five accepted manners  of death: homicide, suicide, accidental, natural, and  undetermined. Dr. Norman said the most likely manner  of Coco's death was accidental. Dr. Norman said the  autopsy by Dr. Brown was likely conducted thoroughly  and completely; however, he felt Dr. Brown's ultimate  findings were ""absolutely ridiculous."" Dr. Norman  testified the cause of death and manner of death should  have been listed as undetermined based on the  information Dr. Brown had in 2004. Dr. Brown should  not have based his [Pg 37] conclusion of homicide  solely on the fact that Coco's body was dumped, and Dr.  Norman also disagreed that the gum in Coco's stomach  supported a finding [*54]  of homicide by asphyxiation.  Dr. Norman testified that gum is found in decedents'  stomachs ""all the time."" There was nothing to support  Dr. Brown's speculation that Coco had been chewing  the gum when she was asphyxiated, which caused her  to swallow it. Consequently, Dr. Norman ""completely  disagree[d]"" with Dr. Brown's conclusions. On cross-examination, Dr. Norman said that of the  autopsies he has performed throughout his career, fifty  of them were performed on people who died a violent  death. He testified he was not board-certified in forensic  pathology and the last formal training he had in forensic  pathology was in 1978. Dr. Norman opined that it was  reasonable to assume a non-alcoholic with a 0.25 blood  alcohol concentration would be unconscious, but he did  not believe an alcoholic with a 0.25 blood alcohol  concentration would function normally. Dr. Norman did  not talk to any of Coco's family members or friends to  determine her drug and alcohol tolerance levels. Dr.  Norman testified that he did not read any of the police  reports, look at the crime scene photographs, or talk to  any of the responding officers. Dr. Norman agreed  obtaining background information is helpful, but he  said, [*55]  ""[I]t's not to be used exclusively as the cause  of death or the manner of death."" On redirect, Dr. Norman said it was common practice in  forensic autopsies to collect vitreous humor, or fluid  from the eyeballs, to determine how much of the alcohol  concentration  could  be  attributed  to  body  Page 16 of 27 decomposition. Dr. Norman indicated he was surprised  that vitreous humor was not collected in this case as it  could have answered a lot of the unresolved questions.  Following Dr. Norman's testimony, the defense rested. [Pg 38] ASSIGMENT OF ERROR NUMBER ONE Although Defendant asserts one assignment of error, it  is divided into two primary arguments. Defendant first  argues the State failed to prove a homicide occurred.  Alternatively, if a homicide was committed, he argues  there was insufficient evidence to prove he committed it. Arguments on Coco's Cause and Manner of Death Defendant's predominant argument to this court is that  the State failed to prove Coco died as a result of a  homicide as opposed to an accidental overdose.  Defendant summarizes his argument as follows: Courtney suffered no obvious trauma and was  extremely intoxicated when she died. It is  understandable to initially think that because  of [*56]  the ""circumstances"" of how she was found,  she was killed by someone else. But the placement  of her body in another state and in a sexually  suggestive position does not prove a homicide  occurred. Since the autopsy was inconclusive on  cause  of  death,  these  ""circumstances""  are  essentially what led Dr. Brown to declare this a  homicide instead of another manner of death. Defendant argues that because Dr. Brown testified there  was no definitive conclusion he could reach ""from the  findings on the body"" to indicate a homicide occurred,  the autopsy was inconclusive. The sexual assault kit  was negative, and no foreign DNA was found under  Coco's fingernails to indicate she struggled. Defendant  observes ""there was no testimony or evidence in the  autopsy that noted other common indications of  asphyxiation, such as visceral congestion via dilation of  the venous blood vessels and blood stasis, petechiae,  cyanosis and fluidity of the blood."" Further, the 2015  toxicology report revealed Coco had tramadol, ecstasy,  and alcohol in her system, which could have caused her  death. Noting Dr. Brown based his conclusion of homicide, in  part, on the circumstances surrounding the discovery of  Coco's body, Defendant [*57]  poses an [Pg 39]  alternative scenario that aligns with both Dr. Norman's  conclusion  of  an  accidental  overdose  and  the  circumstances surrounding the discovery of Coco's  body. In this scenario, Defendant theorizes someone  who was with Coco could have, according to Defendant,  ""freak[ed] out"" after she overdosed on drugs and  alcohol, and he or she decided to put her body in the  trunk of Coco's car. According to Defendant, this could  reasonably explain why Coco's body was kept in the  trunk for up to fifty-two hours before being dumped in  Winnie. Defendant claims if someone went to Coco's  house with the intent to kill her, that person would not  have waited so long to dump her body because there  would have been a plan in place. Further, he points out  that Dr. Scanlan testified a body might be sexually  posed to make police believe there was a sexual motive  even when one did not exist. Defendant argues that it is undisputed that Coco died  before her body was dumped in Winnie and that  someone had to bring her body there. Nevertheless, the  State had the burden of proving that Coco died as a  result of a homicide, which Defendant contends the  State failed to do. In response, the State notes that [*58]  the jury was  faced with two contradictory expert opinions. The State's  expert, Dr. Brown, and the defense expert, Dr. Norman,  disagreed as to whether Coco died of asphyxiation or  from an accidental overdose. Although Dr. Norman  disagreed with Dr. Brown's conclusion, the State  contends the jury could have reasonably and rationally  rejected the testimony of Dr. Norman and accepted the  testimony of Dr. Brown. Additionally, the jury was  informed that two forensic pathologists, Drs. Bonnell  and Shaker, reviewed the file and agreed with Dr.  Brown's conclusions. The State concludes the jury's  decision was not irrational; thus, it may not be disturbed  on appeal. Additionally, the State [Pg 40] argues the  jury's conclusion of murder is the only conclusion that  ""explains the constellation of evidence aligned against""  Defendant. Arguments on Defendant's Identification as Perpetrator Alternatively, Defendant argues that even if the State  proved a homicide occurred, the State failed to prove  Defendant committed the homicide or was a principal to  her murder. ""There was absolutely zero evidence or  testimony that placed Anthony Burns with or near  Courtney Coco before her death the weekend she  died."" [*59]  Notably, there were no eyewitnesses who  saw Defendant with Coco the weekend of her death, no  phone records indicating they were together, and no  forensic evidence in her home or in her car that put him  Page 17 of 27 with Coco. Defendant asserts the central question of  who killed Coco was speculative and inconclusive. Defendant contends the circumstantial evidence failed  to exclude the reasonable hypothesis that one of the  numerous other suspects, not Defendant, murdered  Coco. As previously indicated, there was a plethora of  persons of interest and suspects during the initial  investigation  and  subsequent  investigations.  Specifically, Defendant notes that Veal, who had been  identified as driving Coco's car in Alexandria on  Saturday, October 2, 2004, is currently imprisoned for  committing a homicide. In addition, Landry's DNA was  found on Coco's car trunk latch. Further, a call to  either Williams or Williams' girlfriend was the last phone  call Coco made before her disappearance; however,  according to Defendant, ""[t]here was no testimony  regarding Floyd Williams', Jitty's, propensity to commit  homicides."" [Pg 41] Analysis In the instant case, there was no witness with first-hand  knowledge of how Coco was [*60]  killed. Accordingly,  the State was required to prove Defendant was  responsible through other evidence. In particular, the  State presented evidence that Defendant was identified  as leaving the abandoned building where Coco's body  was found and further that he made incriminating  statements to several individuals years after Coco's  death. Defendant argues the identification of him leaving  the abandoned building was dubious at best, and he  argues  the  circumstances  of  each  incriminating  statement, in jail or drunk, and contradictory allegations  ""make each statement internally inconsistent with one  another and highly improbable. Evidence of cause of Coco's death/homicide Having discussed the basic principles, we will now  examine specific cases that guide this court's analysis of  the present case. Although Defendant claims the State  failed to establish that Coco was murdered, he does not  cite or discuss any cases supporting his argument. This court has previously considered cases in which the  victim's cause of death and manner of death are sharply       contested. In a fairly recent case, the defendant, Vail,  was convicted of second degree murder over fifty years  after his wife's body was found in [*61]  the Calcasieu  River. State v. Vail, 17-354 (La.App. 3 Cir. 12/28/17),  236 So.3d 644, writ denied, 18-202 (La. 11/20/18), 256  So.3d 998, cert. denied,     U.S.    , 139 S.Ct. 1232  (2019). Vail told the police that he and his wife had been  in a boat when she accidentally fell out of the boat and  drowned. Despite the coroner ruling it an accidental  drowning, Vail was arrested for her murder. However, a  grand jury pretermitted the matter and Vail was  released. On June 27, 2013, a grand jury indicted Vail  for second degree murder, and he was [Pg 42]  convicted as charged following a jury trial. On appeal,  Vail argued there was insufficient evidence to support  his conviction because the evidence was circumstantial,  the State failed to exclude every reasonable hypothesis  of innocence, and the State failed to disprove that the  victim's death was accidental. This court disagreed: In summary, the jury heard extensive testimony  from three expert witnesses regarding whether  Mary Horton Vail was dead before she entered the  water or died after she entered the water. The  experts also offered opinion testimony as to the  events surrounding her death, based on the reports  and evidence available to them as well as their  opinions pertaining to the cause of death. Two of  the experts concluded the manner of Mary Horton  Vail's death was [*62]  a homicide. One testified  that he concluded the death was an accidental  drowning. The jury heard the testimony of all three  experts in great detail, viewed the photographs, and  read the autopsy report. Faced with conflicting  expert opinions, the jury was entitled to accept  whichever one, in their opinion, better explained the  facts of the incident. La.Code Evid. art. 702. An  appellate court should ""not disturb the jury's choice  to accept one expert's opinion unless that opinion is  patently unsound."" State v. Ellis, 28,282, p. 5  (La.App. 2 Cir. 6/26/96), 677 So.2d 617, 623, writ  denied, 96-1991 (La. 2/21/97), 688 So.2d 521. After  reviewing the experts' testimony in their entirety, we  do not find the expert witnesses' opinions of the  cause and manner of death to be patently unsound. In great part, most of the witnesses in this case  presented evidence that was circumstantial in  nature. This evidence consisted of contradictory  statements made by the defendant, information  from officers and investigators regarding the  disappearance of two other women connected to  the defendant, information regarding life insurance  Page 18 of 27 policies, testimony . . . that contradicted the  defendant's statement that his wife accidentally fell  into the river, and testimony regarding the  relationship between the defendant and the victim  at the time [*63]  of her death. The testimony of three of the state's witnesses,  however, is not circumstantial in nature. Wesley  Turnage, Robert Fremont, and Bruce Biedebach all  testified regarding statements the defendant made  to each of them at different times wherein he stated  to them that he killed his wife. Wesley Turnage testified that after Mary Horton  Vail's death, while riding to work with the defendant  one day, the defendant stated [Pg 43] ""I didn't want  the youngin' I got, and I didn't want another one,  and fixed that damned bitch. She won't never have  another kid."" Robert Fremont testified that, as a teenager, he met  the defendant in California. He stated that on two  separate occasions, the defendant told him that he  killed his wife. On the second occasion, he testified  that the defendant talked about hitting his wife in  the head with an ore and some talk regarding a  boat, a disagreement, and then the defendant  feeling justified in taking her life. Bruce Biedebach, who also met the defendant in  California, also testified that the defendant, on more  than one occasion stated he killed his wife. Mr.  Biedebach was told it was ruled an accidental  drowning, so he believed perhaps the defendant  felt [*64]  guilty because he failed to save her. We find these admissions by the defendant, taken  together, are confessions and therefore are direct  evidence that he committed the offense. See State  v. Richardson, 16-107 (La.App. 3 Cir. 12/28/16),  210 So.3d 340. In the current case, the jury obviously concluded  the three witnesses to whom the defendant stated  he killed his wife were worthy of being believed.  The jury seemingly believed Dr. Welke's conclusion  that Mary Vail was dead when she went into the  river late that evening or Dr. Baden's theory that  she may have died in the water as a result of foul  play. They heard testimony that she was fearful of  being in ""dark water"" and never went out in the  defendant's boat during the daytime, yet she  allegedly went fishing with the defendant after dark.  The jury also had the opportunity to peruse the  Calcasieu Parish Sheriff's Office investigation report  compiled in 1962 describing the direction of the  investigation and the concerns being addressed to  determine what happened to Mary Vail. While the  report did not offer any conclusions or explanations,  it did reflect the defendant's attitudes and behavior  at the time of Mary Vail's death. . . . . Moreover, whatever was the cause of Mary Vail's  death, strangulation, suffocation, [*65]  or a blow to  the head, the fact that the defendant attempted to  cover up the offense by trying to convince the  police that she accidently fell overboard was  sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude he had  specific intent to kill her. ""[S]pecific intent is a state  of mind, and need not be proven as a fact, but may  be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the  transaction and the actions of the defendant."" State  v. Boyer, 406 So.2d 143, 150 (La.1981). ""Specific  intent is an ultimate legal conclusion to be resolved  by the fact finders."" State v. Graham, 420 So.2d  1126, 1128 (La.1982). [Pg 44] The evidence, in this matter both direct and  circumstantial, the testimonies, documents, and the  defendant's statements, viewed in a light most  favorable to the prosecution, contained enough  information to exclude the defendant's assertion of  innocence and supports the jury's finding that the  defendant killed his wife, Mary Vail. Id. at 668-69. In State v. Mayeux, 18-97 (La.App. 3 Cir. 2/6/19), 265  So.3d 1096, aff'd, 19-369 (La. 1/29/20), 347 So.3d 623  (per curiam), cert. granted,     U.S.    , 141 S.Ct. 225  (2020), rev'd, 19-369 (La. 3/9/21), 312 So.3d 250 (per  curiam), this court affirmed Mayeux's second degree  murder conviction. Mayeux, who was a chief of police  and an assistant fire chief, reported a fire at his home  where his wife's body was later found. Id. at 1100. An  autopsy could not determine the cause of his wife's  death, but it was undisputed [*66]  that she died before  the fire. Id. The cause of the fire was also undetermined;  however, the fire marshal concluded the fire was started  intentionally to cover up a homicide. Id. After hearing the  evidence and arguments at trial, the jury rejected  Mayeux's hypothesis of innocence that the victim died  from some type of natural cause and his hypothesis that  the victim died suddenly while holding a lit candle,  causing the house to catch on fire. Though there was no      Page 19 of 27 direct evidence that a homicide occurred, this court  found the circumstantial evidence was sufficient: On review, we note that the record does not contain  any direct evidence that Shelly was murdered, that  Defendant killed her, or that Defendant started the  fire at issue. However, various circumstantial  evidence apparently led experts to conclude Shelly  had died before the fire and the fire was  intentionally set to cover up a homicide. Both  conclusions were based on expert opinions  reached by scientific methods that excluded other  ways Shelly could have died and other ways the fire  could have been started. The jury was made aware  of [Pg 45] these expert opinions and heard defense  counsel challenge these opinions through its [*67]   cross-examination and testimony elicited from  Defendant's own witnesses and expert. The jury  seemingly chose to believe the State's experts that  Shelly was killed by some type of choking or  strangulation that left no injuries and that the fire  was intentionally set to cover up the homicide. Id. at 1118. In Mayeaux, this court compared that case to Vail,  noting ""the jury in the instant case did not have to rely  solely on the experts' opinions, but was able to draw its  own conclusions from the rest of the evidence  introduced."" Id. at 1120. The supreme court found the  totality of the circumstantial evidence supported the  jury's guilty verdict and affirmed Mayeux's conviction on  initial review: The State's case against defendant here is entirely  circumstantial, and the most significant piece of the  puzzle—the victim's cause of death—remains  unknown, but the circumstantial evidence as a  whole is quite incriminating. While it is more  thoroughly summarized by the court of appeal, we  highlight just some of the circumstantial evidence  here. First, we note that defendant was an assistant  fire chief who had firefighting equipment available  to him—both in his carport and at the fire station,  which was short distance [*68]  away. Nonetheless,  he made no effort to aid the victim or fight the fire  and simply called 911 and waited. Second,  defendant and the victim had a volatile relationship  marked by domestic abuse and his threats to kill  her, and he had also similarly abused and  threatened previous romantic partners. Third,  defendant  made  statements  that  were  demonstrably false, such as claiming his wife had  just  miscarried,  and  he  alleged  personal  movements that did not match the movements of  his cell phone. See [State v.] Captville, 448 So.2d  [676] at 680 n.4 [(La.1984)] (""[A] finding of  purposeful misrepresentation reasonably raises the  inference of a 'guilty mind,' just as in the case of . . .  a material misrepresentation of facts by a  defendant following an offense. 'Lying' has been  recognized as indicative of an awareness of  wrongdoing."") (internal citations omitted). Mayeux, 347 So.3d at 625 (first, second, and third  alterations added). Although Vail and Mayeux are both distinguishable  insomuch as the identities of the perpetrators of the  murders were not at issue—and thus there was no  hypothesis of innocence that an alternative perpetrator  committed the [Pg 46] murders—the cases provide this  court with a helpful discussion of the jury's verdict and  its deference to conclusions drawn by the [*69]  jury.  Likewise, Vail and Mayeux support the proposition that  this court considers the totality of the circumstantial  evidence presented at trial, including the corroborating  evidence tending to establish the cause of death, before  determining whether the State proved Coco was killed. However, courts have found insufficient evidence when  the State fails to prove the victim was murdered with  corroborating evidence and fails to exclude the  reasonable hypothesis that the victim died from another  mechanism. In State v. Quinn, 18-664 (La.App. 1 Cir.  3/27/19), 275 So.3d 360, aff'd, 19-647 (La. 9/9/20), 340  So.3d 829 (per curiam), cert. denied,     U.S.    , 141  S.Ct. 1406 (2021), Quinn was convicted of second  degree murder and obstruction of justice. It was not  disputed that the victim died of asphyxiation, but it could  not be determined whether the death was self-inflicted  or caused by another person. The State did not  introduce evidence showing that Quinn inflicted any  injury upon the victim which caused the victim's death.  Instead, the State established that Quinn had disposed  of the victim's body and lied to the police when  questioned. The jury was, however, presented with the  reasonable hypothesis that the victim had committed  suicide. There was evidence that Quinn was alone with  the victim for less than five minutes and that [*70]  the  victim was, in fact, suicidal. The first circuit reversed  Quinn's second degree murder conviction: After reviewing the entire record, we conclude that  any rational trier of fact, after viewing all of the  evidence as favorable to the prosecution as a  Page 20 of 27 rational fact finder can, necessarily must have had  a reasonable doubt as to the defendant's guilt on  the second degree murder charge. The State did  not prove that Coulon was in fact the victim of a  murder, and because the jury was presented with  the reasonable hypothesis that Coulon committed  suicide, the State failed [Pg 47] to meet its burden  of excluding every reasonable hypothesis of  innocence in this case. Thus, examining the  evidence in the light most favorable to the  prosecution, we find the alternative hypothesis that  Coulon  committed  suicide  to  be  sufficiently  reasonable that a rational juror could not have  found proof that the defendant was guilty of  murdering Coulon beyond a reasonable doubt  under the Jackson standard. Under the facts of this  case, we can only conclude that the jury engaged in  impermissible  speculation  in  determining  the  defendant's guilt. See State v. Mussall, 523 So.2d  at 1311. Id. at 372-73. The supreme court agreed with the first circuit's [*71]   finding that the evidence was insufficient: After reviewing the record, the briefs, and the  argument of the parties, we find the court of appeal  correctly found the State presented insufficient  evidence that defendant murdered the victim. . . . In addition, the Jackson standard of review does  not allow a jury to speculate on the probabilities of  guilt where rational jurors would necessarily  entertain a reasonable doubt. State v. Mussall, 523  So.2d 1305, 1311 (La. 1988) (citing 2 C. Wright,  Federal Practice & Procedure, Criminal 2d, § 467).  The requirement that jurors reasonably reject the  hypothesis  of  innocence  advanced  by  the  defendant in a case of circumstantial evidence  presupposes that a rational rejection of that  hypothesis is based on the evidence presented, not  mere speculation. See State v. Schwander, 345  So.2d 1173, 1175 (La. 1977). The evidence establishing that defendant moved  and tried to dispose of the victim's body is the most  incriminating evidence against him. It is also the  evidence proving the crime of obstruction. Despite  the overwhelming evidence of obstruction, there  was simply no evidence presented from which the  jury could reasonably determine whether defendant  killed the victim or found him already deceased.  Despite  defendant's  deceit,  shifting  stories,  and [*72]  strange behavior, a jury could only  speculate as to which of two scenarios occurred:  (1) the tension between defendant and the victim  erupted in a sudden murder, which defendant then  tried to conceal; or (2) the victim committed suicide  and defendant, fueled by methamphetamine and  fear of law enforcement, decided to conceal the  death rather than report it. While evidence of  concealment indicates consciousness of guilt, State  v. Davies, 350 So.2d 586, 588 (La. 1977), here it is  nearly the only evidence from which the jury could  infer defendant killed the victim, and standing  nearly alone it does not render the reasonable  hypothesis  of  innocence  unreasonable.  Accordingly, the court of [Pg 48] appeal did not err  in setting aside defendant's conviction for second  degree murder. Quinn, 340 So.3d at 834-85 (emphasis added) (footnote  omitted). In Quinn, the supreme court found Quinn's act of  concealing the victim's death was virtually the only  evidence for the jury to infer guilt from, and that  evidence by itself was not enough to render Quinn's  reasonable hypothesis of innocence unreasonable. Here, the present case is distinguishable in that the  State presented an expert who unequivocally testified  this was a homicide most likely caused by asphyxia due  to smothering. [*73]  Dr. Brown's autopsy did not reveal  external or internal trauma indicating how Coco died.  There were no gunshot wounds, no stab wounds, no  evidence of death by natural causes, and no evidence  of blunt force trauma such as fractures of the skull, ribs,  or pelvis. Additionally, there were no lacerations around  Coco's neck or fractures on the coracoid or hyoid bones  to indicate choking or strangulation. Dr. Brown could not  obtain a blood sample from one of the standard  locations due to the advanced stage of decomposition,  so he obtained blood from the spleen for the purpose of  determining if Coco had any drugs in her system. Dr.  Brown specified that his purpose for testing the blood  from the spleen was for qualitative analysis, not  quantitative analysis. According to Dr. Brown, it was  difficult to determine how much of the blood alcohol  concentration could be attributed to decomposition and  how much could be attributed to any amount of alcohol  Coco consumed prior to her death. After excluding all  other reasons for her death, Dr. Brown concluded Coco  was most likely asphyxiated but acknowledged there are  generally no identifying characteristics for asphyxia.  Thus, he ruled the cause of [*74]  death was homicide  Page 21 of 27 by undetermined means. At trial, Dr. Brown [Pg 49]  denounced the results of the 2015 toxicology report  after he emphasized the spleen was not an acceptable  means of determining blood alcohol concentration or  drug quantification. However, Dr. Brown did not think  the amount of alcohol and tramadol was enough to  indicate an overdose even if he found the results of the  2015 toxicology report were reliable. Dr. Brown did not  opine whether the level of tramadol would have  decreased over the eleven-year period that the blood  was stored. Though the State established through trial testimony  that Drs. Bonnell and Shaker agreed with Dr. Brown's  conclusion of homicide, the State did not elicit whether  the doctors reviewed the 2015 toxicology report before  reaching their decisions. In fact, testimony indicated Dr.  Bonnell reviewed the file in 2007, which was before the  second toxicology analysis was performed. The defense expert disagreed with Dr. Brown's  conclusion of homicide by asphyxiation. In 2016, Dr.  Norman reviewed the Coco file at the request of the  RPSO. Dr. Norman disagreed with Dr. Brown's findings,  instead opining Coco most likely died from an accidental  overdose. [*75]  This conclusion was founded on the  2015 toxicology report which showed the number of  drugs and quantitative amounts of drugs and alcohol in  Coco's system and after considering Coco's diminutive  size. However, Dr. Norman acknowledged that he did not  review any information other than what was contained in  the 2004 toxicology report, the 2015 toxicology report,  and a crime lab report from the Texas Department of  Public Safety Crime Laboratory. Dr. Brown disagreed  with Dr. Norman's conclusion that the death was [Pg 50]  accidental, finding that a homicide had occurred, and  further, Dr. Brown's opinion that Coco was asphyxiated  by smothering was strengthened predominately by the  testimony of Durison. It is well-settled that the testimony of a single witness is  sufficient to support a conviction ""[i]n the absence of  internal contradiction or irreconcilable conflicts with  physical evidence."" State v. Dixon, 04-1019, p. 12  (La.App. 5 Cir. 3/15/05), 900 So.2d 929, 936. An  appellate court should ""not disturb the jury's choice to  accept one expert's opinion unless that opinion is  patently unsound."" State v. Ellis, 28,282, p. 5 (La.App. 2  Cir. 6/26/96), 677 So.2d 617, 623, writ denied, 96-1991   (La. 2/21/97), 688 So.2d 521. See also Vail, 236 So.3d  644. Even though there were some inconsistencies between  Durison's testimony at trial and his earlier statements,  Durison  explained  the  inconsistencies. [*76]   His  testimony that Defendant admitted to smothering Coco  with a pillow is in line with Dr. Brown's expert opinion  that she was smothered to death. Goleman's testimony indicated that Defendant choked  Coco at some unknown time, though she stated it was a  different time from the alleged sex Defendant, Veal, and  Veal's cousin had with Coco. Goleman had no  knowledge of whether the act of choking was related to  Coco's death or whether the alleged sex was related to  Coco's death. Setliff's testimony was wholly contradictory to his prior  statements, and as the State argues in brief, it is  believed that Setliff played a part in Coco's death.  Setliff's testimony that Defendant admitted to him that  ""he'd done it"" was without any details, and he denied  telling Cedars any specifics about Coco's death. [Pg 51] In summary, and regarding the cause of Coco's  death, the jury was made aware of the conflicting expert  opinions, and defense counsel was permitted to cross- examine Dr. Brown's opinion. Faced with the conflicting  expert opinions, the jury was entitled to accept  whichever expert better explained the facts in their  opinion. Based on Ellis, 677 So.2d 617, we find that Dr.  Brown's opinion that Coco died as a result of [*77]  a  homicide is not unsound because circumstantial  evidence and testimony presented corroborates his  opinion that she was asphyxiated by smothering.  Though some of the witnesses gave contradictory  statements  regarding  Defendant's  allegedly  incriminating statements, Durison did testify that  Defendant admitted to smothering Coco with a pillow. Defendant's Identification as Perpetrator Having found the record contains sufficient evidence to  support the jury's finding of a homicide, we next address  Defendant's identification as the perpetrator. We will first address the State's reliance on Wilson's  identification testimony to place Defendant at the dump  site. In his brief, Defendant attempts to cast doubt upon  Wilson's identification of him as the person seen leaving  the abandoned building where Coco's body was  dumped. He states, ""Wilson's 'identification' must be  Page 22 of 27 kept in context: he claimed only to be able to see a man  in a car, after 10:00 PM on some undetermined night,  while driving at least 55 mph, and trying to avoid a  wreck."" Defendant concludes that Wilson's testimony  did  not  negate  the  reasonable  probability  of  misidentification, arguing that Wilson did not positively  identify Defendant; [*78]  but instead, Wilson claimed  Defendant's features as seen in the photographic lineup  exhibited features consistent with the profile of the  person he saw fifteen years earlier. Wilson never saw  the person's face, only their [Pg 52] profile, and he  stated he was able to ""turn"" the person's head to make  an identification. Defendant also points out there was a question as to the  date of the near wreck. The 2004, Rice Festival took  place from September 24 to October 3, 2004 with the  incident occurring during that period according to both  Wilson and Vayon. Coco's body was found on October  4, 2004, and Wilson made a statement at the CCSO on  October 8, 2004. Though Wilson claimed he did not  provide the CCSO with a date, Defendant observes  Wilson signed an affidavit under the penalty of perjury,  and his statement indicated the incident occurred on  September 27, 2004. When Wilson spoke with Det.  Dryden in 2019, he could not remember the date of the  incident, but he agreed it could have occurred on  October 3. Vayon was adamant the date was October 3,  because it was the day of the goat show at the Rice  Festival and the only day she should have been driving  a truck and trailer. In his brief, Defendant [*79]   acknowledges Vayon's testimony, if believed, tended to  establish the date of the incident as having occurred on  October 3, 2004. However, assuming Vayon's testimony  established the correct date, Defendant argues Wilson's  testimony was not a positive identification of him or of  Coco's car. On the other hand, the State contends Wilson's  identification is reliable, circumstantial evidence that  corroborates the direct evidence of Defendant's guilt,  that of the three incriminating statements. The State  recognizes the discovery of Wilson as a possible  identification witness was one of the most bizarre and  interesting twists in the case but argues Wilson's  testimony was bolstered by the testimony of Vayon and  Dr. Delzell. [Pg 53] As stated in State v. Hypolite, 04-1658, p. 5  (La.App. 3 Cir. 6/1/05), 903 So.2d 1275, 1279, writ  denied, 06-618 (La. 9/22/06), 937 So.2d 381, (citing  State v. Bourque, 94-291 (La.App. 3 Cir. 11/2/94), 649  So.2d 670), ""[t]his court will overturn a jury's credibility  assessment only when a witness's own testimony  demonstrates that the witness's ability to perceive  events was impaired in some way."" In Bourque, 649  So.2d at 670, this court overturned the jury's  assessment of witness credibility after considering that  one eyewitness admitted to consuming a large amount  of alcohol before the offense and the other eyewitness  was a child who believed all white men looked [*80]   alike, and the defendant was white. After considering  the eyewitness testimony in light of the contradictory  testimony of the other witnesses, and viewed in the light  most favorable to the prosecution, this court concluded  no rational trier of fact could have found Bourque guilty  beyond a reasonable doubt. In line with the principles discussed in Hypolite and  Bourque, we find Wilson's ability to perceive the identity  of the person leaving the abandoned building was  impaired, even assuming the incident occurred on  October 3, 2004. Perhaps most importantly, there was a  fifteen-year interval between when Wilson saw the  driver of the car in 2004 and when he drew the  silhouette for Det. Dryden and identified Defendant out  of a photographic lineup in 2019. Additionally, the  circumstances of when and how Wilson saw the person  were far less than perfect. Wilson claimed the incident  occurred between nine and ten o'clock at night while he  was driving at least fifty-five miles per hour and trying to  avoid a car wreck. It was dark outside, and there were  no dome lights to illuminate the person's face. Wilson  testified the driver appeared young, had short hair, and  did not have facial hair, but he said those were [*81]   the only features he could see. At trial, he said the [Pg  54]  person  had  Caucasian  features,  which  he  represented as regular lips and a regular nose.  Pertinently, Wilson did not see the person's face from  the front; he only saw the person's profile. His silhouette  drawing of the person's profile lacked considerable  details. Nonetheless, he was able to pick Defendant out  a six-person photographic lineup despite his skepticism.  Also, there were numerous inconsistencies between his  original statement at the CCSO and his trial testimony. Wilson's identification of Coco's car was equally  perplexing. It is undisputed that Coco drove a Pontiac  Bonneville  with  Louisiana  license  plate  number  JUW468. In his statement at the CCSO, Wilson  described the car he saw as a dark-colored older model  car with Louisiana plates containing the letters ""J"" and  ""W."" Wilson testified the license plate also contained the  number eight at trial. At first, Wilson's identification of  the partial plate number seems like concrete evidence  that Coco's car was at the site where her body was  Page 23 of 27 found. However, Wilson testified that he saw the  description of the car and the license plate number on  the news prior to his statement [*82]  at the CCSO,  which casts doubt upon his identification. Dr. Delzell  explicitly said his probability experiment would be  invalidated if the test subject knew the license plate  information, because his experiment assumed the test  subject did not know the license plate. Further, the  Louisiana State Police determined the only tire tracks  found near the abandoned building did not match  Coco's car, meaning there was no physical evidence of  her car being at the scene. While acknowledging that  the determination of witness credibility is left to the jury's  discretion, based on the foregoing, we find Wilson's  identification testimony was internally contradictory and  unreliable. [Pg 55] As discussed above, when a conviction is based  on circumstantial evidence, the State ""must exclude  every reasonable hypothesis of innocence"" to convict.  State v. Camp, 446 So.2d 1207, 1209 (La.1984). In  State v. Chism, 436 So.2d 464, 469 (La.1983), the  supreme court explained the hypothesis of innocence: Circumstantial evidence involves, in addition to the  assertion of witnesses as to what they have  observed, a process of reasoning, or inference by  which a conclusion is drawn. Like all other  evidence, it may be strong or weak; it may be so  unconvincing as to be quite worthless, or it may be  irresistible [*83]  and overwhelming. There is still no  man who would not accept dog tracks in the mud  against the sworn testimony of a hundred eye- witnesses that no dog passed by. The gist of  circumstantial evidence, and the key to it, is the  inference, or process of reasoning by which the  conclusion is reached. This must be based on the  evidence  given,  together  with  a  sufficient  background of human experience to justify the  conclusion. Prosser, [Law of Torts, p.] 212 [(4th ed.  1971)]. Consequently, before a trier of fact can decide the  ultimate  question  of  whether  a  reasonable  hypothesis of innocence exists in a criminal case  based crucially on circumstantial evidence, a  number of preliminary findings must be made. In  addition to assessing the circumstantial evidence in  light of the direct evidence, and vice versa, the trier  of fact must decide what reasonable inferences  may be drawn from the circumstantial evidence, the  manner in which competing inferences should be  resolved, reconciled or compromised; and the  weight and effect to be given to each permissible  inference. From facts found from direct evidence  and inferred from circumstantial evidence, the trier  of fact should proceed, keeping in mind [*84]  the  relative strength and weakness of each inference  and finding, to decide the ultimate question of  whether this body of preliminary facts excludes  every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. Therefore, the ultimate question is whether the evidence  is sufficient to support a determination that the  reasonable findings and inferences permitted by the  evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of  innocence. In the present case, Defendant's hypothesis of  innocence, as discussed below, is that someone else  killed Coco, which is the same argument presented to  the jury at trial. Considering Captville, 448 So.2d 676,  and Defendant's failure to [Pg 56] raise any new  hypotheses, Defendant's argument fails because we  find it was reasonable for the jury to reject his claim. Defendant's Incriminating Statements Defendant further argues that, even assuming the  State's case negated any reasonable probability of  misidentification based on Wilson's testimony, the State  failed to prove Defendant was the person who killed  Coco. There were three witnesses who testified that  Defendant made incriminating statements regarding his  role in Coco's death. Defendant argues the statements  he  allegedly  made  to  Durison,  Goleman,  and  Setliff, [*85]  even if believed, were not ""confessions.""  He relies on State v. Richardson, 16-107, pp. 26-27  (La.App. 3 Cir. 12/28/16), 210 So.3d 340, 358, where  this court described the difference between admissions  and confessions and the importance of their distinction  as follows: ""The term ""admission"" is applied to those matters of  fact which do not involve criminal intent; the term  ""confession"" is applied only to an admission of  inculpatory facts and a confession of guilt."" State v.  Marr, 626 So.2d 40, 45 (La.App. 1 Cir. 1993)  (quoting State v. Jones, 451 So.2d 35 (La.App. 2  Cir.), writ denied, 456 So.2d 171 (La.1984)), writ  denied, 93-2806 (La. 1/7/14), 631 So.2d 455. In  State v. Boothe, 532 So.2d 203, 206 (La.App. 3 Cir.  1988), a panel of this court explained that there are  three categories of incriminating statements: The first category is the confession which  admits the guilt of the crime charged. The  Page 24 of 27 second is the admission which involves the  existence of criminal intent. The third is the  admission or acknowledgment of facts which  tend to establish guilt, but which do not involve  the existence of criminal intent. The Court  concluded that remarks which were not  express admissions of guilt or facts showing  criminal intent can be introduced without the  foundation  necessary  for  admitting  a  confession, despite the fact that the statements  might be considered inculpatory. In this context, the distinction between a confession  and an admission is that a confession is considered  direct evidence [*86]  while an admission is  considered  circumstantial  evidence.  State  v.  Hunter, 39,664 [Pg 57] (La.App. 2 Cir. 6/29/05), 907  So.2d 200, writ denied, 05-2027 (La. 3/10/06), 925  So.2d 507. Thus, and as the State argues, if Defendant's  statements to Durison, Goleman, and Setliff are  confessions, then his statements are considered direct  evidence of his guilt, whereas if his statements are  admissions, then they are considered circumstantial  evidence. See also State v. Rabalais, 20-303 (La.App. 3  Cir. 4/7/21) (unpublished opinion) (2021 WL 1295020);  State v. Boothe, 532 So.2d 203 (La.App. 3 Cir. 1988). According to Durison's testimony, Defendant admitted to  killing Coco while they were sharing a jailcell in 2011.  Defendant told Durison that he had killed someone by  smothering them with a pillow and said he dumped the  body in Texas. Durison testified that Defendant said he  wrapped the body in a blanket, though the specifics of  whether the blanket belonged to ""her"" or ""him"" were  disputed. Defendant also told Durison that he was  worried about their mutual friend, Clark, providing  information to police. Durison's credibility was called into  question when the jury heard evidence of his prior  convictions for theft and when the jury was made aware  of inconsistencies in his testimony. Defense counsel  questioned Durison about his prior statement to police in  which he said Defendant and Evans killed Coco to get  Coco's money. In his brief, Defendant [*87]  asserts that Durison's story  was not ""taken very seriously,"" as evidenced by the fact  that it did not lead to his ""arrest or even questioning,     even if he was added to the growing list of suspects.""  Durison testified that he reported the conversation to  police in 2011, and Defendant was arrested in [Pg 58]  2019. Defendant argues Durison's memory was ""fuzzy  and faded"" on the details of the conversation, and  Durison had a history of drug use. In addressing Defendant's argument that the police did  not believe any of the witnesses to whom Defendant  confessed because the police did not immediately issue  an arrest warrant, the State contends the APD surmised  more  evidence  implicating  Defendant  would  be  discovered later. The State argues in its brief that  Durison's testimony was corroborated by the following: (1) Lace Evans, Courtney's sister, was dating Burns  at the time of the homicide and dated him for 6  years; (2) Burns was not home the weekend of the  homicide or the day the body was dumped; (3) Courtney had a leopard print comforter on her  bed which was missing when Lace and other family  members went to Courtney's house after her  murder to get her cats; (4) Several years later, Lace saw an [*88]  identical  comforter at the defendant's mother['s] house; (5) As previously noted, Dr. Brown opined that  Courtney was murdered by asphyxiation, or  ""smothering"" as Burns described to Durison; (6) As previously noted, the body was in fact found  dumped in Texas; (7) Chris Clark was Burns' former boss and had  been his friend for years, and was the father of a  child  with  another  person  to  whom  Burns  confessed—Charlene Goleman—in other words,  Clark was in a position to have information  damaging to Burns, something Durison could not  possibly know absent either Burns or Clark telling  him; (8) While he denied making the statement, Shamus  Setliff told his ex-wife that Burns killed Courtney  and Burns' mother washed the blanket. Under our  law, the jury was entitled to believe the statement  he gave to Tiffany Cedars, his ex-wife. (citations omitted) (footnotes omitted). [Pg 59] The State argues that ""[w]hile the court may  form its own opinion of the weight to be given Durison's  testimony, it can hardly be said based on the record that  the jury's acceptance of his testimony was irrational— even assuming it was accepted."" The State claims the  jury could have rejected Durison's testimony yet  reasonably accepted [*89]  the testimony of Goleman or  Setliff to find Defendant guilty. Page 25 of 27 According to Goleman's testimony, Defendant made  several statements regarding the Coco case in 2009 or  2010. Goleman testified these conversations occurred  over the span of a few months and happened after  Defendant had been drinking. Defendant did not say  what part he played in Coco's death. Defendant said he,  Veal, and Veal's cousin had sex with Coco at some  point, but they used condoms so there would be no  proof of it. Goleman also testified that Defendant  admitted to choking Coco, but she said the choking was  not during the alleged sex. Defendant told Goleman that  Coco's body was wrapped in plastic and put in a  warehouse in Winnie close to I-10. Goleman said a  silver Mustang played some part in the murder. In his brief, Defendant points out that Dr. Brown  excluded choking and strangulation as the mechanism  of death. Defendant argues there was no evidence  establishing that he was friends or acquaintances with  Veal or Veal's cousin which ""would need to be assumed  for this allegation to be true."" Then, Defendant paints  Veal as the possible perpetrator of Coco's murder.  Defendant notes that Veal is currently imprisoned  for [*90]  committing a homicide and was identified by a  witness as driving Coco's car on October 2, 2004 after  she was presumed to have been killed. Defendant  questions whether the police attempted to show  witnesses in Houston a photographic lineup of Veal and  his cousin to determine if they matched the descriptions  of ""Red"" and his cousin. [Pg 60] The State argues in brief that Goleman's  testimony was corroborated by the following: (1) As previously discussed, the body was found  near I-10; (2) As noted previously, the body was found in an  abandoned building; (3) As noted previously, Dr. Brown opined that the  victim was likely asphyxiated or could have been  choked; (4) Significantly, Clyde Griffin, who knew Courtney  through Jackie Hampton also knew Courtney's car.  Griffin spoke to Courtney at ""the club"" Friday,  October 1. He saw someone he knew from the  neighborhood during the day on Saturday, October  2nd, riding around in her car, and identified that  person in a line-up. That person was Earnest Veal; (5) Ina Laborde, Courtney's grandmother, noticed  when cleaning Courtney's house after the murder  that her shower curtain was missing; (6) Shamus Setliff, a nefarious figure the State is  convinced played [*91]  some part in Courtney's  murder and to whom Burns allegedly confessed,  was friends with Burns since childhood. While  Shamus will be dealt with later in this brief, his best  friend, Billy Ahart, owned a Silver Mustang in 2004. (citations omitted) (footnotes omitted). As with all three of the witnesses who testified about  Defendant's incriminating statements, the State argues  that ""[w]hile the court may form its own opinion of the  weight to be given [Goleman's] testimony, it can hardly  be said based on the record that the jury's acceptance  of her testimony was irrational—even assuming it was  accepted."" The State claims the jury could have rejected  Goleman's testimony yet reasonably accepted the  testimony of Durison or Setliff to find Defendant guilty. [Pg 61] Next, and according to Setliff's testimony,  Defendant called him on the phone the week after  Coco's death and told him that ""he'd done it."" Setliff  denied telling his ex-wife, Cedars, that Defendant told  him that he used Coco's blanket to wrap her body. He  denied telling Cedars that Defendant told him he and  Evans ""did it"" and that Defendant's mother washed the  blanket. Setliff said his work delivery route did not go as  far as Winnie, [*92]  despite his statement to the police  in which he stated his route went through Winnie. He  admitted to passing by the abandoned building where  Coco's body was found three times the weekend of her  disappearance. Setliff gave a different version every  time he talked to the police. In his last statement, Setliff  recanted his allegations against Defendant. Setliff's  testimony was further undermined by Cedars' testimony.  She indicated that she did not know where Setliff was  the weekend of Coco's disappearance. When he got  home, he smelled so bad that Cedars told him to wash  his clothes in bleach and to take a shower. Cedars  found a pair of panties that did not belong to her in the  van. Cedars testified that Setliff's work delivery route  went through Beaumont and Winnie. Cedars testified  that Setliff told her Defendant and Lace ""did it"" for the  money. Defendant's mother washed the blanket. In his brief, Defendant avers the State's use of Setliff as  a trial witness was ""odd,"" given that the prosecutor  referred to him as a ""sorry excuse for a human being[.]""  Defendant also observes that Setliff admitted to being in  Winnie and driving by the abandoned building at least  three times on the day Coco's [*93]  body was found.  Defendant claims Cedars' testimony indicating that  Setliff told her Defendant and Evans ""did it"" for the  money was improper impeachment and hearsay  because ""that specific allegation was not asked of or  denied by Setliff."" Page 26 of 27 [Pg 62] The State argues that if there was any witness  whose testimony was completely or partially rejected, it  was Setliff's. The State remains confident that Setliff  played some part in Coco's murder and details the trial  testimony that connects Setliff. However, the State  asserts it is not the appellate court's role to parse his  testimony to determine if it is believable; rather, this  court must view Setliff's testimony in the light most  favorable to the State. Though the State does not  address Defendant's claim that Cedars' testimony was  improper, we note defense counsel did not lodge a  contemporaneous objection to Cedars' testimony as  improper impeachment or as hearsay. Consequently,  defense counsel failed to preserve this issue for review.  La.Code Crim.P. art. 841. After addressing each witness, Defendant argues: The general details of each of the allegations,  including that Courtney was found in Texas, were  general knowledge by the time all of the statements  were given [*94]  to police. Additionally, Lace  Evans is the witness that initially told police  Courtney's comforter may be missing, which she  almost certainly would have mentioned to Anthony,  her fiancé. Thus, even if Anthony knew this fact and  told someone else, it is not necessarily a fact that  only the murderer would know. (citation omitted). Here,  the  evidence  presented  at  trial  was  overwhelmingly, if not entirely, circumstantial, due in  part to the advanced stage of decomposition of Coco's  body when it was examined. Louisiana Revised Statutes  15:438 does not establish a stricter standard of review  than the more general rational juror's reasonable doubt  formula enunciated by Jackson, Id., rather the  circumstantial evidence rule serves as a helpful  evidentiary guide for jurors. State v. Major, 03-3522 (La.  12/1/04), 888 So.2d 798. Importantly, the due process  standard in Jackson does not allow a jury to speculate  on the probabilities of guilt where rational jurors would  necessarily entertain reasonable doubt. Mussall, 523  So.2d at 1311. The requirement that [Pg 63] jurors  reasonably reject the hypothesis of innocence advanced  by the defendant in a case of circumstantial evidence  presupposes that a rational rejection of that hypothesis  is based on the evidence presented, not mere  speculation. State v. Quinn, 19-647 (La. 9/9/20), 340  So.3d  829,  (per  curiam) [*95]   (citing  State  v.  Schwander, 345 So.2d 1173, 1175 (La.1977)), cert.  denied,     U.S.    , 141 S.Ct. 1406 (2021). Hypothesis of Innocence/Motive Though Defendant acknowledges the State is not  required to prove motive, he disputes the State's theory  of motive, arguing there was no coherent theory which  explained why he would inexplicitly kill his fiancée's  sister. He raises issue with the State's speculation that  he and Coco were involved in a secret affair ""based only  on the unsubstantiated testimony of her sister, Lace  Evans."" According to Defendant, the State presented  every hypothetical situation imaginable, including that  Defendant was having an affair with Coco, that  Defendant wanted to have an affair with Coco but was  rejected, that Coco gave Defendant a sexually  transmitted disease, and that Defendant and two other  men had sex with Coco at the same time. He then  questions  the  reasonableness  of  each  theory,  concluding: ""None of the theories logically made sense  or matched the known evidence."" The State correctly argues that motive is not an element  of second degree murder to be proven beyond a  reasonable doubt. ""The state is not obligated to prove  that the accused had a cause or reason to commit the  crime of second degree murder; it is required to prove  that the accused [*96]  had the 'specific intent' to  commit the crime."" State v. Johnson, 324 So.2d 349,  353 (La.1975) (footnote omitted). [Pg 64] In State v. Mire, 14-435 (La.App. 3 Cir. 10/8/14),  149 So.3d 981, rev'd, 14-2295 (La. 1/27/16), 269 So.3d  698 (per curiam), this court reversed Mire's conviction  after finding the State failed to exclude every reasonable  doubt that Mire had the specific intent to kill the victim.  The supreme court reversed, reasoning: The lynchpin of the court of appeal's analysis was  its determination that the state failed to establish a  clear motive for the killing. See generally State v.  Mart, 352 So.2d 678, 681 (La.1977) (finding ""that a  lack of motive may properly be considered as a  circumstance mitigating against specific intent"").  The court of appeal erred here in two aspects. First,  the state, in fact, presented abundant evidence of  motive in the form of witnesses who described the  various disagreements and, at times, acrimonious  relationship between defendant and victim over the  years. As the dissent correctly noted, Mire, 14- 0435, pp. 1-2, 149 So.3d at 996-97 (Amy, J.,  dissenting), the jury was entitled to credit the state's  witnesses in this regard and reject the defendant's  disavowal of these potential motives within the  Page 27 of 27 confines of due process, which allows the trier of  fact to make credibility determinations, within the  bounds of rationality, and accept or reject the  testimony of any witness; [*97]  and thus, a  reviewing court may impinge on the ""fact finder's  discretion only to the extent necessary to guarantee  the fundamental due process of law."" State v.  Mussall, 523 So.2d 1305, 1310 (La.1988). The  court of appeal acknowledged and summarized the  abundant  evidence  pertaining  to  potential  motivations but then dismissed it all as providing  poor and inadequate justification to commit murder.  For example, the court of appeal opined: Witness testimony did not establish a motive  for Defendant to kill the victim. If Defendant  shot the victim over unpaid money, he would  not have left $527.00 in the victim's wallet. If  Defendant wanted the fishing contract to  himself, he would require significant help to  provide ten thousand pounds of fish per week.  The motives suggested by the witnesses  simply do not make sense. Mire, 14-0435, p. 17, 149 So.3d at 991. However,  the fact a defendant's motivations to commit murder  are not objectively reasonable does not render the  jury's determination he harbored these motivations  and acted on them irrational. The court of appeal  erred in substituting its appreciation of the evidence  regarding defendant's motive for that of the jury,  and thus failed to correctly apply the due [Pg 65]  process standard of Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S.  307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Mire, 269 So.3d at 700-01 (footnote omitted). See also  State v. Trahan, 11-1609 (La. 7/2/12), 97 So.3d 994  (per [*98]  curiam). Thus, the question of whether the  State's theory of his motivation to kill Coco was  reasonable is of no consequence as long as the State  proved that Defendant killed her with specific intent to  kill or to inflict great bodily harm. In the present case, Defendant's hypothesis of  innocence is that someone else killed Coco, which is the  same argument presented to the jury at trial.  Considering Captville, 448 So.2d 676, and Defendant's  failure to raise any new hypotheses, Defendant's  argument fails because we find it was reasonable for the  jury to reject his claim.",0
"State v. Chatman, 2023 La. App. LEXIS 2102","[Pg 1] PICKETT, Judge. On December 19, 2019, Vernell Arconze Chatman, Jr.,  was charged with second degree murder for the death  of Kayla Mackenzie Jones, in violation of La.R.S. 14:30,  and the first degree feticide of Ms. Jones's unborn child,  in violation of La.R.S. 14:32.6. He was convicted by a  unanimous  jury  of  the  responsive  verdict  of  manslaughter of Ms. Jones, a violation of La.R.S. 14:31,  and of the responsive verdict second degree feticide of  her unborn child, a violation of La.R.S. 14:32.7. He  subsequently filed a motion for a new trial contending  that the verdict was contrary to the law and evidence.  Following a hearing, the trial court denied the motion. The trial court sentenced the defendant to serve thirty- two years at hard labor for the manslaughter conviction  and eight years at hard labor for the second [*2]  degree  feticide conviction. The trial court determined that the  feticide represented 'a separate life . . . lost"" and  ordered that the sentences be run consecutively for a  total sentence of forty years at hard labor. The  defendant filed a ""Motion to Reconsider Sentence,"" in  which he asserted that his sentences were excessive  ""under the circumstances."" The trial court denied the  motion without a hearing. The defendant appeals his convictions and sentences,  raising four assignments of error: (l) the state's evidence  was insufficient to find him guilty of manslaughter, (2)  the state's evidence was insufficient to find him guilty of  second degree feticide, (3) his conviction for second  degree feticide was a violation of double jeopardy, and  (4) his sentences are both excessive individually and  should be run concurrently rather than consecutively. FACTS On the morning of November 16, 2019, Ms. Jones's  dead body was found in a park in Lake Charles. The  Lake Charles Police Department investigated her death.  [Pg 2] Charles Hunter, Jr., the chief investigator for the    Page 2 of 13 Calcasieu Parish Coroner's Office, testified that based  on the ""tremendous amount"" of dirt and leaves in Ms.  Jones's hair that did [*3]  not match the surrounding  area where her body was found, it was apparent to him  that Ms. Jones did not die where her body was lying and  opined that she ""may have been dropped off at that  location."" Mr. Hunter also noted that Ms. Jones was  lying stretched out with her legs straight and her hands  above her head. Mr. Hunter related that the clothes Ms. Jones was  wearing were insufficient for the cold temperature, which  was in the low thirties. He testified that the pajama pants  she was wearing were on backwards and not pulled all  the way to her waist. He further testified that her body  was very dirty and had ""numerous scrapes and  abrasions and bruises across most of the surfaces of  her body."" Despite the dirt on her skin and shirt, Mr.  Hunter noted that the pajama pants Ms. Jones was  wearing were rather clean. He explained that white foam  or froth coming from her mouth and nose as depicted in  crime scene photographs can be caused by an  overdose, suffocation, or death from asphyxiation.  Based upon cuts and scrapes to her arms, legs, and  face, Mr. Hunter concluded that Ms. Jones was in an  altercation. He did acknowledge, however, that the  injuries could have been caused by other means,  including [*4]  if she were hallucinating and thrashing  around on the ground. Sergeant Willie Fontenot, a violent crimes detective with  the Lake Charles Police Department, testified that on  November 16, 2019, he was dispatched to the corner of  Holmes Street and Kline Street at 7:45 a.m. After  observing the victim and speaking with officers on-site,  Sergeant Fontenot was informed that Mr. Brandon  Mentor, who lived near the park, had reported Ms.  Jones's location. [Pg 3] According to Sergeant Fontenot,  he and Sergeant William Loving went to Mr. Mentor's  apartment and learned that he lived with his cousin,  Bryan Love (Bryan), Bryan's wife, Lucia, and their  children. During the visit, Sergeant Fontenot learned  that Noah Love, a nine-year-old, was a witness. At that time, Sergeant Fontenot interviewed Mr. Mentor,  Bryan, Lucia Love, Larry Chatman, Jarred Chatman,  Jasmine Jack, and the defendant. He noted that, after  the interviews, both the defendant and Larry Chatman  were arrested.    The state played the defendant's videotaped statement  for the jury. According to the defendant, he lived with his  brother Jarred and Jarred's girlfriend, Jasmine Jack. He  noted his other brother, Larry, would come over but  lived [*5]  with his ""baby mama."" The defendant stated  he had seen Ms. Jones the day before, between 4 and 6  p.m., at Abraham's Tent, an organization in Lake  Charles that provides meals for the homeless. The  defendant stated he spoke with Ms. Jones at Abraham's  Tent before she left with someone else. According to the  defendant, he met up with Ms. Jones again after dark at  the convenience store near Abraham's Tent. He claimed  that Ms. Jones told him she was going somewhere else  and left the store with someone he did not know. The defendant stated that after Ms. Jones left the store,  he went to ""Sunlight Manor"" to speak with a lady named  ""Ms. Maddy."" Despite claiming that he last saw Ms.  Jones at the convenience store, the defendant admitted  he was at his house alone with Ms. Jones when pressed  by Sergeant Fontenot. He acknowledged smoking  ""mojo"" (synthetic marijuana) with Ms. Jones. At some  point, Ms. Jack came home and argued with Ms. Jones.  When asked if Ms. Jones ""wigged out"" after smoking,  the defendant denied that she had any troubles and said  she left [Pg 4] peacefully. He could not say where she  went. After being told that everyone else claimed she  was ""flipping out,"" the defendant maintained [*6]  that  Ms. Jones was verbal about leaving but was not having  any physical issues and that he did not have to  physically remove her from the apartment. Once law enforcement informed the defendant that  witnesses told them he carried Ms. Jones from his porch  to the park, the defendant countered that she was  holding onto his arm and that he helped her walk across  the street. When asked why Ms. Jones had to be  removed from the home, it took nearly three minutes  before the defendant finally answered, saying she had  gone a little crazy. The defendant repeatedly denied  hitting Ms. Jones in any way. He stated that when Ms.  Jones came to the house, she was dressed but not in  winter clothes, and he acknowledged putting pants on  her after helping her from the house. When asked if his  brother Larry helped him bring Ms. Jones across the  street, the defendant denied that Larry helped and  claimed he alone brought Ms. Jones to the back corner  of the park. According to the defendant, he realized Ms.  Jones was missing her shoes while helping her to the  park. He explained he found the shoes near the steps to  his apartment, brought them to her, put them on her   Page 3 of 13 feet, then left her on the grass at the back [*7]  of the  park. According to the defendant, at some point in the early  morning hours, he and his brothers went outside looking  for a dog that had gotten loose. The defendant denied  knowing Ms. Jones was still in the park at that time. He  also denied ever saying ""Die"" to the victim or laying his  hands on her. He repeatedly stated, ""I never hurt  Kayla!"" The defendant subsequently acknowledged that  it was a mistake to simply leave Ms. Jones out in the  cold. Eventually, the defendant stated that he attempted to  hold Ms. Jones ""to control or constrict, not to hurt or  harm."" He indicated that she was on the ground [Pg 5]  while he was trying to hold her down to prevent her from  injuring herself. The defendant acknowledged that his  actions may have looked like he was choking her. He  adamantly denied ever kicking Ms. Jones. The  defendant subsequently stated that he sometimes  hallucinated when he smoked ""mojo"" and that he  smoked some with Ms. Jones that day. He then stated  that he had numerous mental health problems and that  he was off his medication. On  cross-examination,  Sergeant  Fontenot  acknowledged that although he initially arrested the  defendant's brother, Larry, as a principal due to a  witness [*8]  saying Larry was at the park with the  defendant  and  Ms.  Jones,  the  investigation  subsequently confirmed that information was false.  Sergeant Fontenot also acknowledged that the same  witnesses told him the defendant had suffocated Ms.  Jones in front of the house, despite stating that she was  alive when she was brought to the park later. He  admitted that the witness statements were confusing. During the investigation, Noah Love was brought to the  Children's Advocacy Center to be interviewed. Mr. David  Duplechain of the Family & Youth Counseling Agency in  Lake Charles interviewed Noah. Mr. Duplechain testified  that he was a vice president within the agency and that  his work involved, among other things, doing ""forensic  interviews of children who are alleged to have been  sexually abused, physically abused, or are witnesses to  violent crime."" Mr. Duplechain interviewed Noah on  November 16, 2019. The recording of Noah's interview  was played for the jury. When Noah testified at trial, he was twelve years old.  According to Noah, on the night Ms. Jones died, his  father told him to go outside and see what was  happening because he heard a woman screaming.  Noah stated that, at that time, he, his [*9]  dad, and his  two brothers were in their apartment and that he was  watching cartoons in bed. He testified that he heard the  scream at 9:30 p.m., went outside, [Pg 6] and by the  light of the porch light saw ""[a] man beating on a  woman, kicking her in the side and slapping her in the  face."" Noah testified that the man was ""Pernell,"" his  neighbor, and identified the defendant as the person he  referred to as ""Pernell."" Noah stated that ""Pernell"" lived  with ""JD, Jaz, and LC,"" but he did not know the real  names of those three individuals. According to Noah,  the woman was on the ground close to the apartment,  and the defendant was slightly further from the  apartment, standing over her. Noah testified that he  went back inside, and about two minutes later, the  woman stopped screaming for help. He told his father  what he saw, then they locked the door and turned off  the porch light. On cross-examination, Noah then testified no one was  in his apartment except himself, his dad, and his two  brothers, and he specifically denied that Larry Chatman  or any women were there. While he acknowledged that  his dad ""used to do [drugs],"" he denied that his father  was doing drugs that night. Noah testified he [*10]   heard the defendant say ""Get away from her. She's  pregnant,"" after he stopped hitting and kicking Ms.  Jones. Noah then clarified that he heard the defendant  say this after he (Noah) had gone back inside and  closed the door. He also stated that he could not see  the defendant when he heard that statement. Sergeant William Loving testified that on November 16,  2019, he was dispatched in relation to a deceased  female on the side of the road. A pair of shoes was  found roughly fifteen feet from the woman. Sergeant  Loving testified that he and Sergeant Fontenot knocked  on doors at the small apartment complex located across  the street from the park where Ms. Jones was found. He  further testified that Ms. Jones was at the entrance to  the park very close to the front of the driveway to the  apartments. He recalled speaking with the occupants of  Apartment 8: Larry, Jarred, and Vernell Chatman.  Sergeant Loving testified that, despite officers not  mentioning the park and simply asking about a white  female, the Chatman brothers [Pg 7] ""kept looking  towards the park"" while he was speaking with them.  Sergeant Loving was not wearing a body camera during  the interaction, but another officer who was with [*11]   him had his body camera turned on. The video from the  body camera was introduced into evidence and played  for the jury. Page 4 of 13 Dr. Terry Welke, the Coroner and Forensic Pathologist  for Calcasieu Parish, was accepted without objection by  the trial court as an expert in the field of forensic  pathology. Dr. Welke testified that he listed Ms. Jones's  cause of death as ""blunt force injuries-asphyxia- hypothermia"" and identified her death as a homicide. He  did not believe, however, that the blunt force injuries  alone would have been sufficient to kill Ms. Jones. After  acknowledging there are numerous ways asphyxia can  occur, Dr. Welke testified that in the instant case, he  believed Ms. Jones suffered a ""smothering type of  asphyxia."" Dr. Welke explained that his conclusion was based  upon a superficial scrape on Ms. Jones's nose and a  bruised area on the inner portion of her lower lip, which  indicated to him that someone had cupped their hand  over her mouth. He did not observe petechiae, a  common sign of suffocation, in Ms. Jones's eyes but  noted he had also seen hangings where petechia were  not present. He stated that he was unconcerned about  the foam near Ms. Jones's nose and mouth, noting this  can [*12]  happen with drug overdoses or drowning but  can also occur any time there is an irregularity of the  heart, such as asphyxiation. Dr. Welke testified that Ms. Jones's blood contained  traces  of  cocaine,  benzolecgonine  (a  cocaine  byproduct),  methamphetamine,  amphetamine,  and  marijuana. Nonetheless, he felt that the levels of the  drugs in Ms. Jones's system would not have been  sufficient to result in an overdose death. Regarding  hypothermia, Dr. Welke noted that when the body's  internal temperature gets to around eighty-six degrees,  atrial fibrillation occurs, and a person's heart becomes  [Pg 8] inefficient. He further explained that at around  eighty-two degrees, ventricular fibrillation occurs, and  the heart stops functioning. Dr. Welke noted that  because Ms. Jones was woefully underdressed for the  low temperature, he would have expected her body to  be curled up in the fetal position in an attempt to stay  warm if she had died purely of hypothermia. Because  she was not in the fetal position, he believed Ms.  Jones's arms were outstretched because she was  positioned that way after her death. He testified Ms.  Jones's injuries were consistent with someone sitting or  lying on her chest and cupping [*13]  their hand over her  mouth and nose. Dr. Welke noted that if Ms. Jones had not died from  being smothered, she likely would have had brain  damage that would have prevented her from moving her  body while she subsequently died of hypothermia. He  testified Ms. Jones's knuckles were skinned and noted  that could be the result of someone fighting with her or  from her ""flailing around and causing those injuries to  herself."" Regarding the bruises on her body, he noted  that based on their coloration, they were not old, but he  could not say if they were half an hour old or three days  old. Dr. Welke did not do an autopsy on Ms. Jones's unborn  child, but he testified that the child was a male that  appeared to be approximately eight months and a week  developed with ""no evidence of significant natural  disease."" The child was sixteen and one-quarter inches  long and weighed a little over eight pounds. Despite not  doing an autopsy, Dr. Welke testified that he believed  the child would have been viable if born prior to Ms.  Jones's death and that he ""felt the baby died as a result  of the mother's death."" After explaining that it is  impossible to get an exact time of death unless  someone dies in the hospital, [*14]  Dr. Welke estimated  that Ms. Jones died around 4:00 a.m. on November 16,  2019. He then stated, however, it was possible that she  may have died at 10:30 p.m. the prior night. [Pg 9] On cross-examination, Dr. Welke reiterated that  he believed Ms. Jones's flailing around on the ground,  whether because someone was on top of her or she  was simply flailing, could have caused the injuries to her  legs and back. He also reiterated that he believed the  injury to her nose was from either a hand or pillow being  compressed around her nose and mouth. He could not  recall examining anyone who overdosed on ""mojo"" or  synthetic marijuana. Additionally, while he stated the  level of drugs in Ms. Jones's system was too low for an  overdose, he acknowledged that no tests were done  which would have shown the level of synthetic  marijuana in her system. Dr. Welke opined that Ms.  Jones was already dead when she was placed in the  park. He clarified that, even if she was not dead when  she was brought to the park, he felt the asphyxia that  occurred before she was brought there would have  rendered her unable to protect herself from hypothermia  and would have ultimately resulted in her death. The state's final witness [*15]  was Ms. Jasmine Jack,  who acknowledged having a felony conviction for  possession of a firearm with obliterated numbers,  misdemeanor convictions for criminal trespass, resisting  an officer, and drug paraphernalia. According to Ms.  Jack, in November of 2019, she was dating the  defendant's brother, Jarred Chatman, and living with  Jarred, the defendant, and their other brother, Larry  Chatman. Ms. Jack testified that she knew Ms. Jones  Page 5 of 13 because Ms. Jones would come to the apartment to get  high. Ms. Jack acknowledged telling Sergeant Fontenot  that her initial interview was a lie and that she did not  see anything because she ""was told if I take this stand  today I'm dead. Let the record reflect."" As to the night Ms. Jones died, Ms. Jack testified she  saw Ms. Jones outside the apartment ""on the ground  hollering and screaming in pain, and Vernell was right  there with her."" She further testified the defendant was  leaning over Ms. [Pg 10] Jones and it looked like he was  trying to calm Ms. Jones down, but she then heard the  defendant yell ""Die, bitch, die."" She explained she heard  this statement while she was inside the apartment and  returned outside where she saw the defendant holding  down Ms. Jones's [*16]  elbows ""so she can't swing at  him."" On cross-examination, Ms. Jack testified that she had  not done drugs in about seven and a half months at the  time of trial, noting she had been smoking mojo but quit.  She testified that she initially lied to law enforcement  because she felt ""the homicide detectives was [sic]  threatening."" She then claimed the defendant's mother  called her before she was interviewed by law  enforcement  and  threatened  her.  Although  she  acknowledged lying to law enforcement during her initial  interview, Ms. Jack claimed she did not remember what  she said to law enforcement because she was under the  influence. Ms. Jones testified Ms. Jones was still near the  apartment when Jarred Chatman returned home from  work, typically around 11 p.m. She then stated she was  positive that, at 11:00 p.m., Ms. Jones was on the  ground ""with her t-shirt and panties on hollering."" She  stated that neither she nor Jarred wanted Ms. Jones in  the apartment because ""when she gets high she flashes  out, and she was pregnant."" She testified that when she  returned to the apartment after being told Ms. Jones  was there, both Larry Chatman and the defendant were  present, and Ms. Jones was sitting next [*17]  to the  defendant. Ms. Jack stated she never told the defendant to get Ms.  Jones out of the house and claimed she never laid a  finger on Ms. Jones. According to Ms. Jack, she and her  friend, Shameka Smiley, were both at Bryan's apartment  getting high, and Ms. Smiley went back to Ms. Jack's  apartment and smoked with the defendant and Ms.  Jones before waking her (Ms. Jack) up to tell her Ms.  Jones was at the apartment. Ms. Jack stated that she  was passed out at Bryan's apartment before Ms. [Pg 11]  Smiley woke her up. Ms. Jack contested the notion that  she and Ms. Jones had a fight because Ms. Jones  would not leave. According to Ms. Jack, she told the  defendant that it was on him because Jarred did not  want Ms. Jones getting high at the apartment when she  was pregnant. Ms. Jack then returned to Bryan's, rolled  another blunt and passed out again. Ms. Jack explained that she did not want Ms. Jones at  the apartment because she did not approve of a  pregnant woman getting high and that Jarred did not  want her there ""because he was a registered sex  offender."" She testified that when Larry and the  defendant said Ms. Jones did not have to leave, she  returned next door and smoked more mojo. After [*18]   stating that she smoked ""a lot"" of mojo that day, Ms.  Jack testified she was also on PCP, claiming everyone  except the defendant was also doing PCP. According to Ms. Jack, Ms. Jones smoked some crack,  in addition to the mojo she had smoked, and then  started ""flashing out."" She defined ""flashing out"" as  ""[l]aying on the floor flipping like a little fish, hollering  and screaming."" She testified this would happen with  Ms. Jones kicking and tearing up the apartment, until  she came back around when the drugs wore off.  Despite previously saying that Ms. Jones was still  behaving when she left the apartment, Ms. Jack then  testified that Ms. Jones had begun flashing out before  she left and went back to Bryan's. Ms. Jack later heard Ms. Jones screaming in pain while  lying on the ground, which Ms. Jack attributed to her  pregnancy and being held down on the ground. She  testified that she saw the defendant had Ms. Jones's  elbows pinned down trying to calm her down, noting that  Ms. Jones had kicked off her pants while thrashing  around on the ground. She further testified that the  defendant put other pants on her afterwards. [Pg 12] Ms. Jack again testified it sounded like the  defendant was trying to [*19]  calm Ms. Jones down, yet  she also stated that was not what she saw. She  explained that the two of them were about ten to fifteen  feet away from her on the ground and that Ms. Jones  did not lose her clothing until she was outside the  apartment. When pressed that it makes no sense for  someone to scream ""die, bitch, die"" at a person they are  actively trying to calm down and keep from hurting  themselves, all she could say was ""[m]aybe that person  wasn't in their right state of mind."" According to Ms.  Jack, Ms. Jones was outside hollering and screaming  for about an hour and a half before Jarred Chatman got  Page 6 of 13 home and that the defendant was next to Ms. Jones the  entire time. Ms. Jack concluded her testimony by stating  that she was positive she heard the defendant tell Ms.  Jones to die, immediately after stating ""at the end of the  day everybody was full of drugs whether it was PCP,  mojo, meth or crack."" After allowing the jury to review the physical evidence  previously admitted, the state rested. The defendant's first witness was Mr. Larry Chatman,  his older brother. Larry testified that at the time of Ms.  Jones's death, he was living with the defendant, Jarred,  and Jasmine. He had four prior [*20]  convictions for  distribution of drugs as well as an obstruction of justice  conviction. Larry noted that because people initially told  law enforcement that he helped the defendant carry Ms.  Jones to the park, he spent roughly two years in jail  charged with second degree murder for Ms. Jones's  death before he pled guilty to a reduced charge of  obstruction of justice. Larry testified that he had known Kayla Jones at least  eight to ten years prior to her death and they were good  friends. He related that, at some point, his brother  Jarred had been ""messing around"" with Ms. Jones.  Larry was not sure whether Ms. [Pg 13] Jones was  homeless or not, stating that the only time he ever saw  her sleeping outside was when she ""was high on some  bubble."" He did not explain what ""bubble"" meant. Larry  stated that people often used the park across from his  old apartment to get high, including at all hours of the  night. Larry acknowledged previously smoking in the  park and testified that people used the park because it  was located on a dead-end road and it just seemed like  no one was going to investigate drug use there. Larry testified he knew Ms. Smiley from her being  around there a lot. He admitted that [*21]  he frequently  got high with her but testified that he did not recall if they  smoked together the day Ms. Jones died, explaining  that his memory was poor when he was high. Larry  stated he often went to Bryan's apartment to get high,  even when the Love children were home. On the night Ms. Jones died, Larry testified that he  arrived home between 8:00 and 9:00 p.m. At that time,  the defendant was lying on the couch with his eyes  closed; Larry was unsure if the defendant was high,  asleep, both, or just lying on the couch. He went to  Bryan's home to get high because Ms. Smiley and Ms.  Jack were in the apartment. Ms. Jack joined him at  Bryan's apartment, and the three of them got high while  Bryan's kids were there. Larry stated Ms. Smiley then  came to Bryan's and told them Ms. Jones was at Larry's  apartment, so he told Ms. Jack to ""go see what's going  on."" Larry testified that he then went home and that Ms.  Jack and Ms. Jones had had an altercation that morning  over the relationship between Ms. Jones and Jarred. Larry testified that when he returned to his apartment,  Ms. Jones was on the ground ""spinnin on her back"" and  kicking all over the place. He went back to Bryan's  because Ms. Jack and [*22]  Ms. Smiley were about to  change Ms. Jones's clothes. After talking to Bryan about  how Ms. Jones was behaving, Larry testified [Pg 14]  that he went back outside, and Ms. Jones was lying on  the ground by the steps and that he placed a blanket on  her due to the cold temperature. He further testified that  there were already a couple blankets outside with Ms.  Jones, but she had become uncovered. He stated that  he argued with the defendant and Ms. Jack about Ms.  Jones being outside. Larry was in Bryan's apartment when Noah heard Ms.  Jones and looked outside. According to Larry, the  apartments are all basically one large room and a  bathroom; therefore, he and Bryan were getting high in  the same room where Noah and his brothers were.  Acknowledging that he and Bryan were smoking mojo,  Larry claimed that he never saw Noah open the door to  the apartment or go outside, but he testified that he  heard Bryan tell Noah to ""close the door."" Larry further  testified that Bryan asked Noah, ""who is that"" and Noah  answered ""Vernell."" Yet, he denied hearing Noah say  anything about the defendant hitting or kicking Ms.  Jones. On cross-examination, Larry testified that he was  waking up, after getting high and [*23]  falling asleep,  when he heard Noah tell his father it was the defendant  who was outside. Although he admitted it was possible  that Bryan may have heard screaming outside, Larry  testified that he did not hear anything and Bryan never  mentioned anything to him about hearing screaming.  According to Larry, when he went outside to go home,  the defendant was outside trying to wake Ms. Jones up.  He stated Ms. Jones was still lying on her back, slightly  to the side, and the defendant was next to her. Although  he claimed he never heard anyone screaming, Larry  acknowledged it was possible that he simply did not  hear it because he was in and out of sleep while high.  Larry claimed that he never saw Ms. Jones at the park  across from his home and was unaware the defendant  had had a previous sexual relationship with Ms. Jones. [Pg 15] Ms. Smiley testified that in November of 2019,  Page 7 of 13 she was living with Ms. Jack, Larry, and the defendant.  She explained she had been homeless and was  spending some nights at their apartment and some  nights in a tent. Ms. Smiley testified she was good  friends with Ms. Jones, had known her for over ten  years, and believed Ms. Jones was also homeless in  November of 2019. Ms. [*24]  Smiley described the  defendant as her ""protector"" because he would step in  any time a man was being loud or violent with a woman  around him. Specifically, she testified that on multiple  occasions, the defendant prevented her ex-boyfriend  from hitting her. Ms. Smiley testified that Bryan was a drug dealer and  they all obtained their synthetic marijuana from him. She  smoked dope at Bryan's house at least 10 times.  According to Ms. Smiley, she and Larry were at Bryan's  apartment smoking synthetic marijuana the day Ms.  Jones died. She stated the defendant was at his  apartment passed out. She also testified that at one  point, everyone in Bryan's home could hear screaming,  which she described as two female voices ""arguing back  and forth."" She then testified that Noah stuck his head  out the door before saying ""Daddy, Kayla's laying on the  ground."" According to Ms. Smiley, Bryan told Noah to  close the door. She was adamant that Noah did not say  anything else. She further stated that Noah's testimony  that neither she nor Larry were present and that his dad  only smoked on the porch and never in front of the kids  were lies. Ms. Smiley testified that she initially smoked a blunt with  the defendant [*25]  and Larry, but then she and Larry  went to Bryan's apartment when the defendant passed  out. According to Ms. Smiley, she returned to the  defendant's apartment about an hour later, and they  smoked another blunt, at which point he passed out  again. Ms. Smiley heard a knock at the door; it was Ms.  Jones. She told Ms. Jones she could not come in  because Ms. Jack did not want her there, but Ms. Jones  [Pg 16] pushed her way into the apartment. Ms. Smiley  went to Bryan Love's apartment to get Ms. Jack. According to Ms. Smiley, when she and Ms. Jack  returned to the defendant's apartment, Ms. Jack and  Ms. Jones started screaming at each other and got into  a physical altercation which left Ms. Jones on the floor.  Ms. Smiley testified that Ms. Jack either punched or  pushed Ms. Jones, who ended up on the floor next to  the mattress. Ms. Smiley further testified that she left  while the altercation was ongoing and stated that the  defendant was still passed out at that time. She also  testified that Ms. Jones ""wigged out"" that night and that,  when she saw Ms. Jones outside later, her pants were  gone and her panties were wet. Ms. Smiley explained  that Ms. Jones sometimes flashed out and got ""butt  naked."" [*26]  Ms. Smiley returned to Bryan's house and smoked  another blunt while Ms. Jones was wigging out at the  defendant's apartment. She stated Ms. Jones was on  the ground outside when she returned to her tent.  According to Ms. Smiley, Ms. Jones was passed out,  snoring, in just her t-shirt and panties, so she took a  comforter and put it on Ms. Jones before leaving. Ms.  Smiley stated that, when she saw Ms. Jones's panties  were wet, she believed her water had broken and told  Bryan to call 9-1-1, but he refused because he had  drugs in his apartment. When she could not get anyone  to call 9-1-1, Ms. Smiley went back to her tent and fell  asleep until someone woke her the next day and asked  if she knew Ms. Jones was killed. On cross-examination, Ms. Smiley testified that when  she left Bryan's apartment and saw Ms. Jones on the  ground, the defendant was still asleep in his apartment,  and she got a comforter and put it on Ms. Jones. Ms.  Smiley testified she never told law enforcement she saw  the defendant near Ms. Jones outside and never saw  the defendant be aggressive or hostile towards a  female, claiming he [Pg 17] ""deserves wings and a  halo."" Ms. Smiley was adamant that she did not discuss  anyone's [*27]  trial testimony during the case, including  with the defendant. On rebuttal, the state recalled Sergeant Fontenot, who  testified Ms. Smiley told them during her initial interview  that after Noah came back into the Love's apartment,  Ms. Smiley left and saw the defendant standing over  Ms. Jones outside. The state also published to the jury a  portion of the state's recorded interview between  Sergeant Fontenot and Ms. Smiley. ASSIGNMENT OF ERRORS NUMBERS 1 & 2: In his first assignment of error, the defendant argues the  state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he  committed manslaughter of Kayla Jones, as required by  Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781 (1979).  Specifically, he contends ""the evidence was insufficient  to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Vernell  Chatman killed Kayla Jones or that he committed a  simple battery upon Kayla Jones that ultimately led to  her death."" In his second assignment of error, the defendant  Page 8 of 13 contends there was insufficient evidence to support his  conviction for second degree feticide, asserting: When viewed under the Jackson [Id.] standard, the  evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a  reasonable doubt that Vernell Chatman killed Kayla  Jones' unborn child. The [s]tate also failed to  prove [*28]  beyond a reasonable doubt the cause  of the unborn child's death which was necessary to  establish  that  the  unborn  child  was  killed.  Alternatively, the [s]tate failed to prove beyond a  reasonable doubt that Vernell Chatman committed  a battery upon Kayla Jones, and that this battery  was a proximate cause of the unborn child's death.  Thus, the [s]tate failed to prove that Vernell  Chatman committed second degree feticide of  Kayla Jones' unborn child. We address these assignments simultaneously. The  analysis for insufficient-evidence claims is well settled: When the issue of sufficiency of evidence is raised  on appeal, the critical inquiry of the reviewing court  is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light  most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier  of fact could have found the essential elements of  the crime [Pg 18] proven beyond a reasonable  doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct.  2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, rehearing denied, 444 U.S.  890, 100 S.Ct. 195, 62 L.Ed.2d 126 (1979), State  ex rel. Grafagnino v. King, 436 So.2d 559  (La.1983), State v. Duncan, 420 So.2d 1105  (La.1982), State v. Moody, 393 So.2d 1212 (La.  1981). It is the role of the fact finder to weigh the  respective  credibility  of  the  witnesses,  and  therefore, the appellate court should not second  guess the credibility determinations of the triers of  fact beyond the sufficiency evaluations under the  Jackson standard of review. See State ex rel.  Graffagnino, 436 So.2d 559 (citing State v.  Richardson, 425 So.2d 1228 (La. 1983)). In order  for [*29]  this Court to affirm a conviction, however,  the record must reflect that the state has satisfied  its burden of proving the elements of the crime  beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Kennerson, 96-1518, p. 5 (La.App. 3 Cir.  5/7/97), 695 So.2d 1367, 1371. The defendant was charged with second degree murder  but convicted of manslaughter, in violation of La.R.S.  14:31. Under La.R.S. 14:31: A. Manslaughter is: (l) A homicide which would be murder under either  Article 30 (first degree murder) or Article 30.1  (second degree murder), but the offense is  committed in sudden passion or heat of blood  immediately caused by provocation sufficient to  deprive an average person of his self-control and  cool reflection. Provocation shall not reduce a  homicide to manslaughter if the jury finds that the  offender's blood had actually cooled, or that an  average person's blood would have cooled, at the  time the offense was committed; or (2) A homicide committed, without any intent to  cause death or great bodily harm. (a) When the offender is engaged in the  perpetration or attempted perpetration of any felony  not enumerated in Article 30 or 30.1, or of any  intentional misdemeanor directly affecting the  person; or . . . . (3) When the offender commits or attempts to  commit any crime of violence as defined by R.S.  14:2(B),  which  is  part  of  a  continuous  sequence [*30]  of events resulting in the death of a  human being where it was foreseeable that the  offender's conduct during the commission of the  crime could result in death or great bodily harm to a  human being, even if the offender has no intent to  kill or to inflict great bodily harm. For purposes of  this Paragraph, it shall be immaterial whether or not  the person who performed the direct act resulting in  the death was acting in concert with the offender. [Pg 19] As noted by the state, the defendant's argument  addresses only a single theory of manslaughter, i.e., the  defendant killed Ms. Jones without intent to cause death  or great bodily harm but while committing the intentional  misdemeanor of simple battery. The state contends the  defendant addresses only one theory of misdemeanor  manslaughter, when the jury could have found him guilty  of manslaughter and second degree feticide based on  more than one theory, e.g., a specific intent killing  committed in sudden passion, a killing committed while  engaged in a simple battery, or a killing without specific  intent as a result of the defendant's intoxication. With regard to intoxication, the defendant filed a ""Notice  of Defense of Voluntary Intoxication"" [*31]  in which he  invoked La.R.S. 14:15(2), which provides that the  offender's intoxicated or drugged condition is immaterial  except ""[w]here the circumstances indicate that an  intoxicated or drugged condition has precluded the  presence of a specific criminal intent or of special  knowledge required in a particular crime, this fact  Page 9 of 13 constitutes a defense to a prosecution for that crime.""  As discussed above, the testimony from multiple  witnesses indicates the defendant was so high that he  passed out multiple times during the late night/early  morning hours that Ms. Jones died, as does his  statement to law enforcement. The defendant first argues that the state failed to  establish how Ms. Jones died. Dr. Welke testified,  however, that in his expert opinion, Ms. Jones died from  a combination of asphyxia and hypothermia, which he  opined was the result of someone sitting or pressing  down on her chest while cupping their hand over her  nose and mouth, which prevented her from breathing.  Dr. Welke explained that the unique injury around Ms.  Jones's nose was unlikely the result of a strike or punch  and that his belief was strengthened by the bruising on  the inside of her mouth. According to Dr. Welke, Ms.  Jones either [*32]  died from the asphyxia, or the  asphyxia [Pg 20] caused enough damage that her brain  could not tell her body to protect itself once hypothermia  set in during the freezing temperatures while she was  woefully underdressed. In addition to Dr. Welke's testimony as to the cause of  Ms. Jones's death, the evidence tying the defendant to  her death comes from eye-witness testimony. The  evidence establishes that every witness who claimed to  be present during the time prior to Ms. Jones's death,  except Noah, admitted to copious drug use on that day.  Consequently, it is unsurprising that the testimony of the  adults and Noah was inconsistent in many regards.  However, as the trier of fact, ""[a] jury may 'accept or  reject, in whole or in part,' any witness's testimony.""  State v. Hypolite, 04-1658, p. 5 (La.App. 3 Cir. 6/1/05),  903 So.2d 1275, 1279, writ denied, 06-618 (La.  9/22/06), 937 So.2d 381 (quoting State v. Silman, 95- 154, p. 12 (La.11/27/95), 663 So.2d 27, 28). Ms. Jack testified she heard the defendant tell the victim  ""Die, bitch, die!"" Noah Love testified he saw the  defendant physically attacking the victim. The jury also  heard the defendant tell law enforcement that he was  high on mojo and that when he was high on mojo, he  sometimes hallucinated. Ms. Jack, Ms. Smiley, and  Larry Chatman all testified that the day Ms. Jones died,  the defendant spent most of the [*33]  time high and  getting high. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the  prosecution, a rational juror could have found the  defendant suffocated Ms. Jones before leaving her in  extremely cold weather with very little clothing, resulting  in her death. Furthermore, a rational juror could have  found the defendant lacked any intent to cause death or  great bodily harm because he was highly intoxicated.  Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to  find the defendant guilty of manslaughter, and the  defendant's first assignment of error lacks merit. [Pg 21] As to the defendant's conviction of second  degree feticide for the death of Ms. Jones's unborn  child, Dr. Welke testified the child had a gestational age  of a little over eight months, weighed a little over eight  pounds, and in his opinion, was viable. Furthermore, Dr.  Welke testified that he believed the child died ""as a  result of the mother's death."" Under La.R.S. 14:32,5, Feticide is the killing of an unborn child by the act,  procurement, or culpable omission of a person  other than the mother of the unborn child. The  offense of feticide shall not include acts which  cause the death of an unborn child if those acts  were committed [*34]  during any abortion to which  the pregnant woman or her legal guardian has  consented  or  which  was  performed  in  an  emergency as defined in RSS. 40:1061.23. Nor  shall the offense of feticide include acts which are  committed pursuant to usual and customary  standards of medical practice during diagnostic  testing or therapeutic treatment. Second degree feticide is prohibited by La.R.S. 14:32.7,  which states in pertinent part: A. Second degree feticide is: . . . . (2) A feticide committed without any intent to cause  death or great bodily harm: (a) When the offender is engaged in the  perpetration or attempted perpetration of any felony  not enumerated in Article 32.6 (first degree  feticide), or of any intentional misdemeanor directly  affecting the person[.] In order to convict the defendant of second degree  feticide in the instant case, the state had to prove that  an unborn child died as a result of some act or omission  of the defendant not related to a legal abortion, and that  it occurred when the defendant was engaged in the  perpetration or attempted perpetration of any intentional  misdemeanor directly affecting the person. Here, based  on the trial court's jury instruction, that misdemeanor  would be simple battery. A battery is relevantly [*35]   defined in La.R.S. 14:33 as ""the intentional use of force  or violence upon the person of another,"" while La.R.S.  14:35(A) defines a simple battery as ""a [Pg 22] battery  Page 10 of 13 committed without the consent of the victim."" Based on  the evidence herein, the jury could have found that the  defendant committed a simple battery either by kicking  and hitting Ms. Jones as described by Noah Love or by  covering her nose and mouth while sitting on her chest  as described by Dr. Welke. Therefore, when viewed in  the light most favorable to the prosecution, Dr. Welke's  testimony that the child died because Ms. Jones died  supports a rational juror's finding the defendant guilty of  second degree feticide. The defendant contends the state failed to prove how  the child died, much less that it was the result of any act  or omission by him. He further argues that Dr. Welke's  ""feeling"" the child died because his mother died is  insufficient to satisfy the state's burden of proof.  Although Dr. Welke acknowledged he did not perform  any autopsy on the child and simply testified he felt the  death of Ms. Jones caused the death of the child, he  was accepted, without objection, as an expert in the  field of forensic pathology. Accordingly, we find  his [*36]  opinion as to the child's cause of death is  sufficient evidence to support the defendant's conviction  of second degree feticide. Finally, the defendant contends that under the literal  language of La.R.S. 14:32.7(A)(2)(a), the intentional  misdemeanor at issue had to be directed at the unborn  child, not Ms. Jones. To support this claim, he relies on  language in State v. Smith, 95-61 (La. 7/2/96), 676  So.2d 1068. A review of Smith shows his argument  lacks merit. In Smith, as here, the evidence established  that the death of the mother, who died by strangulation,  caused the death of her four-month-old unborn child.  The court determined: As an element of manslaughter (La.R.S. 14:31), the  legislature explicitly states that a homicide or killing  of an individual must take place. As an element of  second degree feticide or any other grade, the  legislature states that the killing of an unborn child  must take place. Therefore, it is abundantly clear  that the legislature intended that the [Pg 23] two  instant crimes are separate and distinct, and are  not lesser or included offenses of each other. Applying  the  principle  of  ""common  sense""  enunciated in State v. [v. Smith, 94-0621, 647  So.2d 1321 (La.App. 4th Cir.1994) on remand for  resentencing], had the legislature not intended that  a perpetrator be penalized separately for killing an  unborn child where [*37]  the mother is also killed, it  would not have made feticide a crime. The two  statutes were aimed at different evils which proves  that the court of appeal erred when the conviction  for second degree feticide was set aside based on  the ""same evidence"" test. Killing the mother was an  element of manslaughter, not second degree  feticide, whereas killing of the unborn child was an  element of second degree feticide and not  manslaughter. These two crimes involve different  elements and require different proof. Hence, the  jury did not violate the defendant's right against  double  jeopardy  when  it  imposed  separate  punishments. Smith, 676 So.2d at 1071-72 (footnotes omitted). In Smith, as here, the defendant's conviction of feticide  was predicated on the fact that the unborn child died as  a result of the mother being strangled to death. There  was no evidence that any misdemeanor was aimed at  the fetus. Nonetheless, the supreme court reinstated the  defendant's conviction for second degree feticide.  Consequently, the defendant's reliance on Smith is  misplaced.  Accordingly,  the  defendant's  second  assignment of error lacks merit, and both of his  convictions are affirmed. ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 3: In his third assignment of error, [*38]  the defendant  asserts that his conviction for second degree feticide  violated the double jeopardy clauses of the U.S. and  Louisiana constitutions, U.S. Const. Amend. V; La.  Const. art. I, § 15, because proof of the killing of Ms.  Jones, was the only possible cause of death offered in  evidence for the death of her unborn child died. He  argues there was ""no proof of a fact the state had to  prove for the misdemeanor manslaughter, even though  second degree feticide required the additional proof of  the death of the unborn child,"" and concludes the ""same  evidence"" was used to prove violations of both La.R.S.  14:31 [Pg 24] and La.R.S. 14:32.7. As the defendant  notes, the ""same evidence"" test is no longer used. State  v. Frank, 16-1160 (La. 10/18/17), 234 So.3d 27. Again, the defendant assumes the jury convicted him of  misdemeanor manslaughter, not one of the other  theories set forth in La.R.S. 14:31(A)(2)-(3), and  contends that because his act or omission that resulted  in the death of the unborn child caused the death of the  mother, his conviction for the lesser offense cannot  stand. He asserts the trial court failed to apply the test  for double jeopardy announced in Blockburger v. United  States, 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S. Ct. 180, 182 (1932),  which provides, ""where the same act or transaction  Page 11 of 13 constitutes  a  violation  of  two  distinct  statutory  provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether  there are two offenses or only one, is whether each  provision requires [*39]  proof of a fact which the other  does not."" The outcome here is no different under the standard set  forth in Blockburger. As discussed in Smith, second  degree feticide requires proof of the killing of an unborn  child whereas manslaughter requires proof of the killing  of an individual. Accordingly, the defendant's convictions  of second degree feticide and manslaughter do not  violate the constitution prohibitions against double  jeopardy, and both convictions are affirmed. ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 4: Lastly, the defendant contends that his consecutive  sentences of thirty-two years and eight years at hard  labor are unconstitutionally excessive. He filed a ""Motion  to Reconsider Sentence,"" asserting that his sentence is  excessive ""for the facts of this case"" and ""under the  circumstances."" Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure  Article 881.1(E) requires that the motion ""include a  specific ground upon which a motion to reconsider  sentence may be based."" His failure to satisfy this  requirement precludes him ""from urging any ground not  raised in the motion [Pg 25] on appeal or review.""  La.Code Crim.P. art. 881.1(E). Nonetheless, this court  has reviewed claims of sentences being excessive  where no objection was made and no motion to  reconsider sentence was filed. See State v. Johnlouis,  09-235 (La.App. 3 Cir. 11/4/09), 22 So.3d 1150, writ  denied, 10-97 (La. 6/25/10), 38 So.3d 336, cert. [*40]   denied, 562 U.S. 1150, 131 S.Ct. 932 (2011). In the  interest of justice, and given our discretion to do so, we  will review the defendant's claim as a bare claim of  unconstitutional excessiveness. Id. Louisiana courts have laid out the following guidelines  for excessive sentence review: Sentences within the statutory sentencing range  can be reviewed for constitutional excessiveness.  State v. Sepulvado, 367 So.2d 762 (La.1979). In  State v. Barling, 00-1241, 00-1591, p. 12 (La.App. 3  Cir. 1/31/01), 779 So.2d 1035, 1042-43, writ  denied, 01-838 (La.2/1/02), 808 So.2d 331, a panel  of this court discussed the review of excessive  sentence claims, stating: La. Const. art. I, 20 guarantees that, ""[n]o law  shall subject any person to cruel or unusual  punishment."" To constitute an excessive  sentence, the reviewing court must find the  penalty so grossly disproportionate to the  severity of the crime as to shock our sense of  justice or that the sentence makes no  measurable contribution to acceptable penal  goals and is, therefore, nothing more than a  needless imposition of pain and suffering.  State v. Campbell, 404 So.2d 1205 (La.1981).  The trial court has wide discretion in the  imposition of sentence within the statutory  limits and such sentence shall not be set aside  as excessive absent a manifest abuse of  discretion. State v. Etienne, 99-192 (La.App. 3  Cir. 10/13/99); 746 So.2d 124, writ denied, 00- 0165 (La. 6/30/00); 765 So.2d 1067. The  relevant question is whether the trial court  abused its broad sentencing discretion, not  whether another sentence might have [*41]   been more appropriate. State v. Cook, 95-2784  (La. 5/31/96); 674 So.2d 957, cert. denied, 519  U.S. 1043, 117 S.Ct. 615, 136 L.Ed.2d 539  (1996). Further, in reviewing the defendant's sentences, the  appellate court should consider the nature of the  crime, the nature and background of the offender,  and the sentences imposed for similar crimes. State  v. Lisotta, 98-648 (La.App. 5 Cir. 12/16/98), 726  So.2d 57 (citing State v. Telsee, 425 So.2d 1251  (La. 1983)), writ denied, 99-433 (La. 6/25/99), 745  So.2d 1183. In State v. Smith, 02-719, p. 4 [Pg 26]  (La.App. 3 Cir. 2/12/03), 846 So.2d 786, 789, writ  denied, 03-562 (La. 5/30/03), 845 So.2d 1061, a  panel of this court observed that: While a comparison of sentences imposed for  similar crimes may provide some insight, ""it is  well  settled  that  sentences  must  be  individualized to the particular offender and to  the particular offense committed."" State v.  Batiste, 594 So.2d I (La.App. I Cir. 1991).  Additionally, it is within the purview of the trial  court to particularize the sentence because the  trial judge ""remains in the best position to  assess  the  aggravating  and  mitigating  circumstances presented by each case."" State  v. Cook, 95-2784 (La. 5/31/96); 674 So.2d 957,  958[, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1043, 117 S.Ct.  615 (1996)]. State v. Soileau, 13-770, pp. 4-5 (La.App. 3 Cir.  2/12/14), 153 So.3d 1002, 1005-06, writ denied, 14-452  Page 12 of 13 (La. 9/26/14), 149 So.3d 261. In State v. Baker, 06-1218 (La.App. 3 Cir. 4/18/07), 956  So.2d 83, writs denied, 07-320 (La. 11/9/07), 967 So.2d  496 and 07-1116 (La. 12/7/07), 969 So.2d 626, this  court adopted the fifth circuit's three factor test from  State v. Lisotta, 726 So.2d 57. Under Baker, 956 So.2d  83, the first consideration is the nature of the crimes.  The defendant was convicted of manslaughter and  second degree feticide; both offenses necessarily  involve the death of either an individual or an unborn  child. While the defendant contends the jury ""concluded  a simple battery ultimately led to the deaths of [*42]   Kayla Jones and her unborn child,"" the jury could have  found the defendant guilty under other theories, such as  the defendant being so intoxicated that he lacked intent  when he suffocated Ms. Jones to death or to the point of  brain damage before leaving her to die of hypothermia. The defendant's argument against his sentencing  exposure primarily falls into the second Baker factor, the  nature and background of the offender. The defendant  contends that his history shows possible mental health  issues and a definite substance abuse problem,  claiming ""[m]ost of his arrests, which stretched decades,  were drug-related."" The defendant was a week shy of  his thirty-sixth [Pg 27] birthday when he was sentenced  and stated during trial that he completed the eleventh  grade and did not have a GED. At sentencing, the trial  court acknowledged that the defendant did not have a  significant criminal history and that his criminal history  consisted primarily of ""drug-related [charges] and  noncompliance with court appearances."" The trial court  further acknowledged that he appeared to have some  ""significant addiction issues"" and that he potentially had  some mental health issues that ""need to be addressed."" The final [*43]  Baker factor is sentences imposed for  similar crimes. The defendant received a thirty-two year  sentence for manslaughter and an eight year sentence  for second degree feticide, with the sentences ordered  to run consecutively. He faced maximum sentences of  forty years and ten years, respectively. Therefore, his  sentences both represent eighty percent of the possible  maximums. The trial court ordered that the sentences  run consecutively, so his sentences combine for forty  years total. There is very little case law on second degree feticide.  However, in Smith, 676 So.2d 1068, the defendant was  sentenced to thirty years for manslaughter and ten  years, the maximum, for second degree feticide. The  sentences were not ordered to run consecutively, but  the maximum ten-year sentence for second degree  feticide, when the evidence was that the child died  because the mother died, is particularly telling.  Additionally,  our  courts  have  previously  upheld  maximum sentences for manslaughter convictions, even  for first offenders. See State v. Herbert, 12-228 (La.App.  3 Cir. 6/13/12), 94 So.3d 916, writ denied, 12-1641 (La.  2/8/13), 108 So.3d 78; State v. Johnson, 38,415  (La.App. 2 Cir. 7/14/04), 878 So.2d 869, writ denied, 05- 589 (La. 1/13/06), 920 So.2d 222. In addition to his claim that his sentences are excessive  individually, the defendant also argues his sentences  are excessive because the trial court ran them [Pg  28] [*44]  consecutively rather than concurrently. In  La.Code Crim.P. art. 883, the legislature set forth the  following regarding sentencing: If the defendant is convicted of two or more  offenses based on the same act or transaction, or  constituting parts of a common scheme or plan, the  terms of imprisonment shall be served concurrently  unless the court expressly directs that some or all  be served consecutively. Other sentences of  imprisonment shall be served consecutively unless  the court expressly directs that some or all of them  be served concurrently. In the case of the  concurrent sentence, the judge shall specify, and  the court minutes shall reflect, the date from which  the sentences are to run concurrently. In State v. Bethley, 12-853, pp. 11-12 (La.App. 3 Cir.  2/6/13), 107 So.3d 841, 850, this court noted: The imposition of consecutive sentences, however,  requires particular justification beyond the standard  sentencing guidelines, justification which must be  articulated by the trial court at sentencing. State v.  Compton, 11-68 (La.App. 3 Cir. 6/1/11), 66 So.3d  619, writ denied, 11-1362 (La. 12/2/11), 76 So.3d  1177. ""The factors to consider when imposing  consecutive sentences include defendant's criminal  record, the severity or violent nature of the  offenses, or the danger the defendant poses to the  public."" State v. Wallace, 11-1258, p. 14 (La.App. 3  Cir. 5/30/12), 92 So.3d 592, 602. In addition to its normal discussion of the factors  considered in crafting the [*45]  defendant's sentence,  the trial court noted the following: I do find this to be a tragic case with families losing  on both sides. The Court is constantly involved with  the plague of drugs and their after-effects and  consequences in which people have placed  Page 13 of 13 themselves in such a situation these losses occur;  but the cruelty and disregard that the Court saw in  this trial, disturbs that, and hopefully that will haunt  you, Mr. Chatman[,] for some time. This court has previously noted that ""an order directing  that sentences arising from a single course of conduct  be served consecutively requires particular justification  from the evidence or record, and the trial court shall  state the factors considered and its reasons for the  consecutive terms."" State v. Urena, 13-1286, p. 21  (La.App. 3 Cir. 5/7/14), 161 So.3d 701, 715, writ denied,  14-1603 (La. 4/10/15), 164 So.3d 829. [Pg 29] When imposing consecutive sentences, the trial  court observed this is a tragic case that resulted from  the defendant's voluntary use and abuse of drugs to the  extent that use affected not only himself but other  individuals and their families as well. The court also  noted the defendant's cruelty and disregard for Ms.  Jones and her unborn child, who was sufficiently  developed to survive on his own with appropriate care.  Thus, [*46]  the defendant caused the death of two  individuals, Ms. Jones and her unborn child. For these reasons, the defendant's sentences of thirty- two years at hard labor for his manslaughter conviction  and eight years at hard labor for his second degree  feticide conviction are affirmed. The trial court's order  that his sentences be served consecutively sentences is  also affirmed. DISPOSITION As discussed above, the defendant's convictions and  sentences are affirmed. AFFIRMED.",0
"State v. Davis, 2023-Ohio-4389","B, Judge.  [*P1]  Before accepting defendant-appellant Gary Lee  Davis's guilty plea, the trial court mistakenly advised him  that he faced a discretionary two-year period of  postrelease control if convicted of robbery under R.C.  2911.02(A)(2). The trial court ultimately imposed a  mandatory one-to-three-year [**2]  period of postrelease  control as was required by R.C. 2967.28. We hold that  Davis entered a guilty plea without understanding the  maximum penalty. Therefore, we reverse the trial court's  judgment and vacate Davis's guilty plea. I. Facts and Procedure  [*P2]  Davis was charged with robbery in violation of  R.C. 2911.02(A)(2). He initially pleaded not guilty.  Following a series of unsuccessful pretrial motions,  Davis signed a written form withdrawing his not-guilty  plea and pleading guilty to an amended charge of third- degree felony robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(3).  [*P3]  At the plea hearing, the state explained that the  charge stemmed from an October 2020 robbery of a  Page 2 of 4 PNC bank branch, where Davis held up a note to bank  employees which read ""give me the money."" Davis's  counsel clarified, ""there was no weapon, or any actual  threat verbalized."" As the trial court proceeded through  its colloquy, it informed Davis that he faced ""from 9 to 36  months in prison,"" and following his release he ""could  be placed on up to two years of post-release control"" for  the offense. The trial court accepted his plea.  [*P4]  At the sentencing hearing, the state recounted  Davis's criminal record, explaining that the robbery in  this case occurred while Davis was on supervised [**3]   release. The trial court imposed a 36-month sentence  consecutive to the sentences in two cases from  Montgomery County, Ohio. The trial court found that  consecutive sentences were necessary because he was  under postrelease control when he committed the  offense and due to his criminal history. In addition, the  trial court imposed a mandatory one-to-three-year  period of postrelease control.  [*P5]  In two assignments of error, Davis challenges his  plea and sentence. II. Law and Analysis  [*P6]  Davis's first assignment of error argues that the  trial court erroneously informed him during its plea  colloquy that he faced a discretionary two-year period of  postrelease control. But R.C. 2967.28 required the trial  court  to  impose  a  one-to-three-year  period  of  postrelease control. Davis maintains that the trial court  breached its duty to advise him of the maximum penalty  under Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a). A. Trial courts must ensure defendants understand the  effect of their pleas.  [*P7]  A defendant's decision to enter a guilty plea is a  solemn and serious one, filled with promise and peril.  State v. Bishop, 156 Ohio St. 3d 156, 2018-Ohio-5132,  124 N.E.3d 766, ¶ 10. Because a guilty plea operates as  a waiver of several constitutional rights, the validity of a  guilty plea turns on whether that plea was ""done  voluntarily, knowingly, [**4]  and intelligently, 'with  sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and  likely consequences.'"" Bradshaw v. Stumpf, 545 U.S.  175, 183, 125 S.Ct. 2398, 162 L.Ed.2d 143 (2005),  quoting Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 748, 90  S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970).  [*P8]  For felony offenses like Davis's, a trial court  ""shall not accept a plea of guilty or no contest without * *  * [d]etermining that the defendant is making the plea  voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the  charges and of the maximum penalty involved."" Crim.R.  11(C)(2)(a). A trial court must ""'convey to the defendant  certain information so that he can make a voluntary and  intelligent decision whether to plead guilty.'"" State v.  Brinkman, 165 Ohio St. 3d 523, 2021-Ohio-2473, 180  N.E.3d 1074, ¶ 17, quoting State v. Veney, 120 Ohio St.  3d 176, 2008-Ohio-5200, 897 N.E.2d 621, ¶ 18.  [*P9]  Postrelease control is a sanction, ""an additional  term of supervision after an offender's release from  prison that imposes certain restrictions on the offender.""  State v. Bates, 167 Ohio St. 3d 197, 2022-Ohio-475,  190 N.E.3d 610, ¶ 21. It is ""part of the 'maximum penalty  involved' in instances where the trial court imposes a  prison term."" State v. Sullivan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos.  111621 and 111917, 2023-Ohio-1036, ¶ 13. Here, the  trial court accurately explained to Davis that he faced 9  to 36 months in prison. Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) required the  trial court to ensure that Davis understood the maximum  term of postrelease control that he would face.  [*P10]  The right to be informed of the maximum  penalty is nonconstitutional, requiring only substantial  compliance with the rule. State v. Morris, 1st Dist.  Hamilton  No.  C-180520,  2019-Ohio-3011,  ¶  16.  ""Substantial  compliance  'means  that  under  the  totality [**5]  of the circumstances the defendant  subjectively understands the implications of his plea and  the rights he is waiving.'"" Id., quoting State v. Nero, 56  Ohio St.3d 106, 108, 564 N.E.2d 474 (1990). But when  ""a trial court fails to substantially comply with Crim.R. 11  regarding a nonconstitutional provision, a reviewing  court must determine whether the trial court partially  complied or failed to comply with the rule."" State v.  Stumph, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-190318, 2021-Ohio- 723, ¶ 8, citing Morris at ¶ 18, and State v. Clark, 119  Ohio St. 3d 239, 2008-Ohio-3748, 893 N.E.2d 462, ¶ 32. B. The trial court failed to comply with Crim.R. 11.  [*P11]  Davis pleaded guilty to robbery in violation of  R.C. 2911.02(A)(3), a third-degree felony. Robbery is an  offense of violence. See R.C. 2901.01(A)(9)(a). The  duration of postrelease control for a third-degree felony  depends on the nature of the offense. See R.C.  2967.28. A defendant convicted of a third-degree felony  ""that is an offense of violence and is not a felony sex  offense [faces] up to three years, but not less than one  year"" of postrelease control. R.C. 2967.28(B)(4). In  Page 3 of 4 contrast, a defendant convicted of a third-degree felony  that is a sex offense faces up to five years of  postrelease control. R.C. 2967.28(B)(1). And if the third- degree felony is neither an offense of violence nor a sex  offense, a defendant faces ""up to two years"" of  postrelease control at the discretion of the parole board.  R.C. 2967.28(C).  [*P12]  The trial court informed Davis, ""[I]f I would send  you to prison, [**6]  upon your release from prison, you  could be placed on up to two years of post-release  control."" The state acknowledges that the trial court  mistakenly advised Davis that he was subject to a  discretionary two-year period of postrelease control but  argues that the plea form provided sufficient notice of  the maximum penalty. We disagree.  [*P13]  The plea form explained that Davis was  pleading guilty to ""Robbery/2911.02(A)(3),"" which is an  ""F3"" with a potential sentence of ""9-36 MOS"" and a  $10,000 maximum fine. While the form indicated that  Davis faced one to three years of postrelease control for  a third-degree felony offense of violence, it also  indicated that he faced ""up to two years as determined  by the parole board for * * * a felony of the third degree  (F3) which does not involve physical harm or threatened  physical harm to a person."" The form failed to specify  that Davis pleaded guilty to an offense involving actual  or threatened physical harm. Rather, it merely identified  robbery as a third-degree felony, while also describing  two potential terms of postrelease control.  [*P14]  At the plea hearing, the state explained the  factual basis for the offense—that Davis ""knowingly  inflicted, attempted to inflict, [**7]  or threatened to inflict  physical harm on another."" But Davis's counsel  emphasized that the robbery consisted of ""a note that  said give me the money, that there was no weapon or  actual threat verbalized."" Later, the trial court asked  Davis if he understood that ""upon your release from  prison, you could be placed on up to two years of post- release control?""  [*P15]  Considering the conflicting information provided  to Davis at the plea hearing, we cannot conclude that  the trial court ensured that Davis had a full  understanding of the consequences of his guilty plea.  We hold that the trial court did not substantially comply  with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a)'s mandate requiring it to  determine that Davis entered his plea with an  understanding of the maximum penalty involved.  [*P16]  Next, we ""must determine whether the trial court  partially complied or failed to comply with the rule.""  Morris, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-180520, 2019-Ohio- 3011, ¶ 17, citing State v. Clark, 119 Ohio St. 3d 239,  2008-Ohio-3748, 893 N.E.2d 462, ¶ 32. Absent a  complete failure to comply with Crim.R. 11(C), a guilty  ""plea  may  only  be  vacated  if  the  defendant  demonstrates prejudice."" Id., citing Clark at ¶ 32. Davis  has not argued that the trial court's incorrect statement  constituted a complete failure, so to demonstrate  prejudice he must show ""'that he would not have  otherwise pled had the court complied with Crim.R.  11(C) [**8] .'"" State v. Fleming, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C- 210297, 2022-Ohio-740, ¶ 6, quoting State v. Littleton,  1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-150056 and C-150057, 2015- Ohio-4143, ¶ 9, citing State v. Nero, 56 Ohio St.3d 106,  108, 564 N.E.2d 474 (1990).  [*P17]   Davis  maintains  that  the  trial  court's  misstatement was prejudicial because his sentence  factored into his decision to enter a plea. As we have  explained, ""[t]he potential sentence hanging over a  pleading defendant is one of the important matters on  his mind, if not the most important."" State v. Wilson, 55  Ohio App.2d 64, 66, 379 N.E.2d 273 (1st Dist.1978).  Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a)'s prescription reflects the principle  that knowledge of the maximum penalty affects a  defendant's ""ability to weigh the risks of taking the case  to trial and perhaps facing a maximum sentence, versus  entering a plea and perhaps receiving a more lenient  sentence."" State v. Allen, 2d Dist. Miami Nos. 2021-CA- 31 and 2021-CA-32, 2022-Ohio-1872, ¶ 9, citing State v.  Burnett, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2013-CA-98, 2016-Ohio- 2655, ¶ 11. ""When a defendant receives a sentence that  exceeds what the trial court previously informed the  defendant was the maximum penalty, the prejudice is  apparent on its face."" State v. Tackett, 8th Dist.  Cuyahoga No. 111998, 2023-Ohio-2298, ¶ 22, 221  N.E.3d 172, citing State v. Drake, 9th Dist. Medina No.  16CA0056-M, 2017-Ohio-4027, ¶ 12.  [*P18]  The record demonstrates that the length of his  potential sentence influenced Davis's decision to enter  into a plea agreement. The trial court apprised Davis of  a discretionary two-year period of postrelease control,  but he ultimately received a mandatory one-to-three- year period of postrelease control. In other words, Davis  received a more severe maximum penalty than the trial  court initially explained.  [*P19]  We find that the sentence imposed by the [**9]   trial court prejudiced Davis. We sustain Davis's first  assignment of error. Davis's second assignment of error  challenging his sentence is moot and we decline to  address it. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c). Page 4 of 4",0
"State v. Jose Y., 2023 N.J. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 2234","[*1] Argued November 6, 2023 - Decided December 7,  2023   Before Judges Sabatino, Marczyk, and Chase.   On appeal from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law  Division, Somerset County, Indictment No. 20-01-0028.    Samuel Clark Carrigan, Assistant Deputy Public   Defender, argued the cause for appellant (Joseph E.   Krakora, Public Defender, attorney; Samuel Clark   Carrigan, of counsel and on the briefs).       1  Under  Rule  1:38-3(c)(9),  records  of  criminal  proceedings relating to child victims of sexual assault  are anonymized and excluded from public access in  order to protect the identity of the victims. As there was  no actual child victim in this case, such anonymization is  not necessary here.      Emily M. M. Pirro, Assistant Prosecutor, argued the  cause for respondent (John P. McDonald, Somerset  County Prosecutor, attorney; Emily M. M. Pirro, of  counsel and on the brief).   The opinion of the court was delivered by CHASE,  J.S.C. (temporarily assigned).   The main issue in this criminal appeal is whether the  Luring , Enticing Child by Various Means statute,  N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a), requires the State to prove a  defendant lured or enticed a ""child,"" in this case an  undercover law enforcement officer posing as a fourteen  -year-old girl, into traveling or accompanying [*2]  the  defendant to some location other than the victim's own  home.   We reject defendant Jose Y. Martinez-Mejia's contention  that because he enticed the ""child"" to meet him alone,  and defendant traveled to the ""child's"" home, a  judgment of acquittal should have been entered. By its  plain language, the statute forbids an adult from ""luring  or enticing a child to meet or appear at any other place.""  We hold that the child's home can be the ""other place.""  Here, that location is a place ""other"" than where the  defendant was when he communicated with the child.   In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we address  unrelated arguments raised by defendant on appeal  alleging  evidentiary  issues.  Having  found  those  arguments do not demonstrate plain error, we affirm  defendant's convictions and sentence.   A-3472-21      2     Page 2 of 9 I.   The prosecution in this matter originated in October  2019 when a team of state, federal, and local law  enforcement agencies participated in an undercover  operation to investigate adults using the internet to lure  ch ildren into sexual activity. Teams of officers were  stationed  in  an  apartment  complex  in  Franklin  Township, Somerset County.   Special Agent Cedro Cruz from the [*3]  Department of  Homeland Security served as a ""chatter,"" posing as a  fourteen-year-old girl named ""Angela."" Agent Cruz  created a profile for Angela on SKOUT, a location - based  social  networking  and  dating  application  emphasizing generalized user location. Because of age  restrictions on SKOUT, Angela's profile was created  using a birthdate to reflect that she was eighteen-years  old. Angela's profile picture and other pictures  associated with her account were photographs of an  adult female border patrol officer. Agent Cruz used age- regression software to alter the photographs, making  Angela appear younger.   At a jury trial, Agent Cruz testified solely as a fact  witness that on the afternoon of October 25, 2019,  acting as Angela, he accepted a SKOUT chat request  from defendant, who went by the username ""James.""  Defendant was thirty-two years old at the time.  Defendant's first messages were ""Hi, sweetheart, how  are you?"" and ""Hi, sweetheart, what are you doing?""  When    A-3472-21      3      Angela replied with ""nothing,"" he immediately followed  up with, ""[y]our pictures turn me on, honey. Where are  you from?"" When Agent Cruz testified about this first  exchange with defendant, the following [*4]  ensued:   Q: On October 25[,] of 2019, why was the conversation  only minutes?   A: Because the defendant sent Angela a, I would say a  lewd image, and I basically said gross and that  discontinued the conversation.   Q: And by lewd image what do you mean?   A: So it was an image of a male in tight boxer shorts  and you could see the contour of his - his penis.   Defendant contacted Angela again via SKOUT the next  afternoon in an   interaction that lasted approximately two hours. When  defendant expressed a desire to meet Angela, the  following exchange ensued:   Angela: Yeah, but I'm mad young.   Defendant: How old are you now?   Angela: Fourteen. You?   Defendant: Oh, I see, 23.   Angela: Oh, okay, cool.   Defendant: Yes, love, I like your body.   Angela: Aw, thanks.   Defendant: I would like to see more pictures from you.   Angela: Why?   Defendant: I like you.    A-3472-21      4     During this exchange, and after Angela revealed her  age, defendant sent Angela   multiple photographs of himself, including a picture of  his erect penis.   Angela revealed she was home alone because her  grandmother had left   and would not be returning until the next day. Defendant  asked Angela explicit   questions about sex and [*5]  masturbation and said he  wanted ""more sexy pic tures""   of her. When Angela asked if he wanted only pictures,  he responded, ""I want to   know you in person, baby."" Defendant asked if Angela  wanted to touch his body   and told her he wanted to perform oral sex on her.   The prosecution admitted the photographs into evidence  and published   them for the jury. Agent Cruz was asked to ""describe to  the jury what they're   Page 3 of 9 seeing[.]"" He replied, ""The jury is seeing an image sent  to Angela through   SKOUT on October 26[,] of a hand holding an erect  penis.""   On re-direct, Agent Cruz testified as follows:   Q: During the course of those communications at any  point in time did you threaten the defendant that he had  to continue communicating with you?   A: No. I was trying to dissuade him from communicating  with me.   . . . .   Q: How did you do that?   A: Well, I asked if he was a pic collector, and if he would  have said yes, I am just a pic collector, then he would  have just been a pic collector. I said that I -I was  [fourteen] years old, I would hope after somebody    A-3472-21      5      hears that, that they are communicating with a  [fourteen]-year-old,  they  would  then  cease  communications with that person. [*6]  I said that I was  alone, a fourteen-year-old alone in her house to which  he asked me if there were any neighbors around and,  you know, I lived with my grandmother and my  grandmother was not home. That, any reasonable  person, that's going to dissuade you and you are not  going to travel. As a matter of fact, you might try to  either report this person, which has happened in the  past, but in this situation it didn't happen. And on top of  that he sent a picture of his erect penis to a [fourteen]- year-old.    When defendant offered to come to Angela at 4:00 p.m.  that day, she gave   him the address of the apartment in Franklin and a  phone number associated   with Agent Cruz's undercover phone.   The communication then proceeded outside of SKOUT  and directly   between defendant and the undercover phone, which  recorded every call and   text message. Agent Cruz continued to send and reply  to text messages; while   Detective Katie Feehan from the New Jersey State  Police Internet Crimes   Against Children Unit (""ICACU"") provided Angela's voice  for phone calls.   Detective Feehan testified to her role with the ICACU  and the training   that she received in acting as a child in an undercover  capacity; however, [*7]  she   was not tendered as an expert witness. She testified to  the details of her three   phone calls with defendant.         A-3472-21      6      During the first phone call, defendant asked Angela to  confirm that she was home alone. Angela told defendant  her grandmother was in Atlantic City and would not be  returning for a couple of days. Angela said her  grandmother could not take her on the trip because she  was not old enough to gamble. On a second phone call,  Angela confirmed no one else was in th e house by  saying, ""Just me and my grandma, and she isn't here.  So I mean, I'm completely alone."" On the third phone  call, the following exchange ensued:   [Angela]: . . . I'm just trying to figure out if you're coming  up. Because, if not, I'm probably just gonna go out.   [Defendant]: I mean, okay. So let me take a shower and  then go - go over there.   [Angela]: You gonna come? [Defendant]: Yes.   [Angela]: Okay. Awesome. I'm gonna clean up a little bit  then.   When Angela asked defendant what he wanted to do  when he arrived, he repeated his desire to perform oral  sex on her. She reaffirmed she was going to clean the  apartment to prepare for his arrival, and then she was  going to wait for him. [*8]    Defendant hired an Uber to take him to Franklin and  sent Angela a screen shot of his phone's Uber  application, showing that he was on his way to her  house. When defendant texted Angela that he had  Page 4 of 9 arrived, Agent Cruz could   A-3472-21      7      see him standing outside through the apartment  window. Defendant was arrested and was found to be in  possession of a cell phone, a receipt with Angela's  address written on it, $184 dollars, and two condoms.   At trial, Detective Feehan was asked on cross- examination about her training on the topic of  entrapment. Detective Feehan testified that she ha d  reviewed the relevant New Jersey law and that it closely  matched the national standard. She testified that she  had been trained to allow the subject of the investigation  ""to set the tone, pace, and subject matter of the  conversation[.]"" She was presented with a portion of the  investigative standards from the ICACU, which was  entered into evidence.   On re-direct, the following exchange took place:   Q: On cross-examination you were asked some  questions about your training with regard to the topic of  entrapment. Do you recall that?   A: Yes.   Q: And you testified that you received training about  the [*9]  federal and also State of New Jersey  entrapment laws. Is that correct?   A: Yes.   Q: Did you follow the entrapment laws in this case? A:  Yes.          A-3472-21      8      Defense counsel re-crossed Detective Feehan on those  points, asking whether ""[w]hat do you wanna do when  you get here?"" was a conversation topic that defendant  initiated, to which she replied in the negative.   During an extensive charge conference, defense  counsel raised no objections to the language of the  second-degree luring charge. The jury was instructed  that a guilty verdict on luring required the State to prove:   1. That ""Angela"" was a child. When I say Angela I have  that in quotes, or, that the defendant reasonably  believed that Angela was a child.   2. Defendant-that defendant attempted to lure or entice  Angela into a motor vehicle, structure or isolated area,  to meet or appear at any other place; and,   3. That defendant had a purpose to commit a criminal  offense with or against the child.   The jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of all  charges: second - degree luring, N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a);  second-degree attempted sexual assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:5- 1(a)(3) and 2C:14-2(c)(4); third-degree attempted  endangering the welfare of a child, N.J.S.A. 2C:24- 4(a)(1), 2C:5-1(a)(1) and (a)(3); and third-degree [*10]   attempted promoting obscene material to a minor,  N.J.S.A. 2C:34 - 3(b)(1), 2C:5-1(a)(1) and (a)(3).   After merging the attempted endangering the welfare of  a child count with the attempted sexual assault count,  the judge sentenced defendant concurrently to five  years of imprisonment on the attempted sexual assault  charge; five years   A-3472-21      9      on the luring charge; and three years on the attempted  obscene material charge. Defendant was also subjected  to Megan's Law registration requirements and parole  supervision for life.   On appeal, defendant raises the following claims for the  first time:   I. THE LURING CHARGE MUST BE VACATED  BECAUSE DEFENDANT DID NOT TRY TO LURE A  CHILD INTO GOING ANYWHERE.   II. THE DEFENDANT'S CONVICTIONS SHOULD BE  REVERSED BECAUSE INADMISSIBLE LAY OPINION  TESTIMONY  FROM  INVESTIGATING  OFFICERS  INTRODUCED UNFAIR PREJUDICE.   II.   When a party does not object to an alleged trial error, or  otherwise preserve the issue for the appellate record, it  is reviewed for plain error. Review for plain error  requires determining: ""(1) whether there was error; and  (2) whether that error was 'clearly capable of producing  an unjust result,' [under Rule] 2:10-2; that is, whether  there is 'a reasonable doubt . . . as to whether [*11]  the  error led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have  reached.'"" State v. Dunbrack, 245 N.J. 531, 544 (2021)  (quoting State v. Funderburg, 225 N.J. 66, 79 (2016)  Page 5 of 9 (omission in original)). ""To determine whether an alle  ged error rises to the level of plain error, it 'must be  evaluated in light of the overall strength of the State's  case.'"" State v. Clark, 251 N.J. 266, 287 (2022) (quoting  State v.     A-3472-21      10      Sanchez-Medina, 231 N.J. 452, 468 (2018)). ""The mere  possibility of an unjust result is not enough.""  Funderberg, 225 N.J. at 79. Where there is a failure to  object, reviewing courts presume the newly minted  objection on appeal is ""not error"" and ""unlikely to  prejudice the defendant's case."" State v. Singleton, 211  N.J. 157, 182 (2012) (citing State v. Macon, 57 N.J. 325,  333-34, (1971)).   Statutory  interpretations  are  legal  determinations  reviewed by an appellate court ""de novo, 'unconstrained  by deference to the decisions of the trial court[.]'"" State  v. Fuqua, 234 N.J. 583, 591 (2018) (quoting State v.  S.B., 230 N.J. 62, 67 (2017)). A trial court's evidentiary  rulings, by contrast, are reviewed for abuse of  discretion. State v. Garcia, 245 N.J. 412, 430 (2021)  (citing State v. Nantambu, 221 N.J. 390, 402 (2015)). An  appellate court ""will not substitute [its] judgment unless  the evidentiary ruling is 'so wide of the mark' that it  constitutes 'a clear error in judgment.'"" Ibid. (quoting  State v. Medina, 242 N.J. 397, 412 (2020)).     III.   Defendant does not claim the indictment should have  been dismissed, nor does he explicitly express that the  trial court, sua sponte, should have found that the State  had not met the elements of [*12]  the crime at the close  of its case. Rather, defendant's issue seems to be a  conceptual one, where h e believes we should hold: (1)  telling a child you want to meet for sex; (2) asking them  to meet you    A-3472-21      11      to fulfill that desire; and (3) making sure a child is alone  and vulnerable before meeting them, is not luring or  enticing the child into a sexual encount er so long as the  child makes the mistake of meeting the would -be  predator at the child's own house.   Defendant emphasizes that the forbidden conduct  element of the statute is ""to lure or entice"" a child to go  somewhere. Relying on the dictionary definitio n of  ""lure,"" defendant argues its aim is ""to lead someone into  a dangerous or difficult situation that they otherwise  would not have entered."" Merriam-Webster's Collegiate  Dictionary, (11th ed. 2020). Therefore, defendant  reasons, the statute does not criminalize traveling to the  child for the criminal purpose. Defendant concedes a  child may be ""lured"" into staying at a place that they  otherwise would have left, such as a school after -hours,  but argues if a child would be at home or school  anyway, even without the defendant's enticement, then  luring has not [*13]  taken place.   Defendant argues, in the alternative, that even if the  statutory language was not clear, the only provision that  could be considered ambiguous is the term ""to meet or  appear at any other place."" Defendant employs the  canon of ejusdem generis to argue that the phrase ""any  other place"" must also refer to places where a child  must be lured to travel towards for the statutory  elements to be met. Defendant points to the luring  statute's close relationship to the kidnapping    A-3472-21      12      statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(c), to support his theory.  Defendant argues even if the statutory language did not  support his position, the principle of lenity should apply  in favor of interpreting the statute to require the child to  be lured to travel.   The State responds that defendant is asking us to  create a ""convenient loophole"" in the statutory scheme  by finding that an adult traveling to a child's location for  the purpose of sex is not criminalized by the luring  statute. The State maintains that a complicated analysis  of the text under ejusdem generis is not required since  the clause ""to meet or appear at any other place"" is  unambiguous on its face.   The  ""ordinary  meaning  and  significance""  of  statutory [*14]  language is acknowledged as ""'the best  indicator of [the Legislature's] intent.'"" Tumpson v.  Farina, 218 N.J. 450, 467 (2014) (alteration in original)  (quoting DiProspero v. Penn, 183 N.J. 477, 492 (2005)).  Only where the statutory language at issue is  ambiguous should a court ""look to extrinsic evidence,  such as legislative history [and] committee reports"" to  determine legislative intent. Tumpson, 218 N.J. at 468.  Where the textual analysis and extrinsic aids both fail to  resolve ambiguity, the rule of lenity ""requires that the  ambiguity be resolved in favor of the defendant."" State  Page 6 of 9 v. Regis, 208 N.J. 439, 451 (2011). Courts should ""avoid  statutory interpretations that 'lead to absurd or  unreasonable results.'"" State v. Lewis, 185 N.J. 363,  369 (2005) (quoting State v. Gill, 47 N.J. 441, 444  (1966)).    A-3472-21      13     The plain language of the statutory text in question  provides in relevant   part:   A person commits a crime of the second degree if he  attempts, via electronic or any other means, to lure or  entice-a child or one who he reasonably believes to be a  child into a motor vehicle, structure or isolated area, or  to meet or appear at any other place, with a purpose to  commit a criminal offense with or against the child.   [N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a) (emphasis added).]   One must look at the wording of the entire phrase in its  context, which   prohibits to ""lure or entice,"" and the entire dictionary  definition of both words  [*15]   to  determine  the  statute's  ordinary  meaning.  Defendant's argument only focuses   on the dictionary definition of ""lure"" to conclude that ""to  lead someone into a   dangerous or difficult situation that they otherwise would  not have entered""   means to go to another location. The definition of ""lure""  includes ""to lead astray   from one's true course."" Merriam-Webster's College  Dictionary, (11th ed. 2020). And ""entice"" is defined as  ""to lure or induce; esp., to wrongfully solicit (a person) to  do something."" Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019).  The   prohibited conduct is thus defined by its aim to lead  someone into a dangerous   or difficult situation that they otherwise would not have  entered. The course of   action Angela was lured into was staying alone,  isolated, and vulnerable to meet   an adult male for an illegal sexual encounter.       A-3472-21      14      Here, the ordinary meaning of the phrase ""to meet or  appear at any other place"" also leads to the conclusion  defendant engaged in prohibited conduct when he  enticed Angela to stay at her home and not go out with  her friends. There is no reason to construe the phrase of  ""any other place"" as containing an unwritten exception  for places [*16]  where the child is already located.  Here, that location is a place ""other"" than where the  defendant was when he communicated with the child.  Defendant went through great pains to ensure Angela  would be alone before telling her he was coming over.  Indeed, by requesting the child to stay at her home, the  abuse is all the easier to commit; since it lulls the child  into a false sense of security; creating the dangerous  circumstance of isolation and vulnerability that this  statute is meant to punish. Neither the dictionary  definitions nor the language of the statute expresses a  requirement of the victim going to a different place.     Although there is no need to make any further inquiry,  our decision is also supported by the legislative history,  which suggests an intent to create an expansive  scheme to criminalize an increasing number of  dangerous behaviors. The original text, now thirty years  old, was limited to luring a child into a motor vehicle. By  contrast, the current statute criminalizes two actions  (luring and enticing), by unlimited means (electronic or  any other), with two categories of victims (children or  those reasonably believed to be children), a wide  number of    A-3472-21 [*17]       15      prohibited enticements (motor vehicles, structures,  isolated areas, and meetings or appearances at any  other place), and a broadly stated purpose element (to  commit a criminal offense with or against the child).   In addition, analyzing this statute in relation to our  kidnapping statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:13-1, also undermines  defendant's position. The kidnapping statute was meant  to address the kind of danger isolation poses to a child,  and such isolation and danger can certainly be present  at the child's own home, especially where, as here, the  child is confirmed to be home alone. See State v. Cruz- Pena, 243 N.J. 342, 354-61 (2020) (kidnapping occurs  Page 7 of 9 when the victim is confined to one place for a  substantial period, citing to a litany of cases where  kidnapping - by-confinement occurs in places where the  victim would still otherwise be); State v. LaFrance, 117  N.J. 583, 592-93 (1990) (confining a victim to his own  bedroom for a substantial period in order to isolate the  man's wife and sexually assault her constituted  kidnapping).   Defendant's request that the principle of lenity support  an interpretation in his favor is similarly unavailing, and  is not required, given the unambiguous text and  expansive legislative history. The fact that other statutes  such as the child endangerment statute, [*18]  N.J.S.A.  2C:24 -4, might also criminalize a defendant's behavior  does not compel us to adopt a crabbed interpretation of  N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a).    A-3472-21      16     IV.   The remaining arguments presented by defendant  warrant no more than a brief discussion.   A.   Lay witnesses may testify ""in the form of opinions or  inferences if [the testimony]: (a) is rationally based on  the witness's perception; and (b) will assist in  understanding the witness's testimony or determining a  fact in issue."" N.J.R.E. 701. Perception ""rests on the  acquisition of knowledge through use of one's sense of  touch, taste, sight, smell, or hearing."" State v. McLean,  205 N.J. 439, 457 (2011) (citations omitted). Lay opinion  testimony is impermissible when it constitutes ""an  expression of a belief in defendant's guilt"" or ""an opinion  on matters that were not beyond the understanding of  the jury."" Id. at 463. Lay witnesses may not opine on a  matter ""as to which the jury is as competent as [the  witness] to form a conclusion[.]"" Id. at 459 (second  alteration in original) (quoting Brindley v. Firemen's Ins.  Co., 35 N.J. Super. 1, 8 (App. Div. 1955)). So long as  the lay witness opinion is competent under N.J.R.E.  701, and is not otherwise inadmissible, it will not be  objectionable simply becau se it ""embraces an ultimate  issue to be decided by the trier of fact."" N.J.R.E. 704.  See Biunno, Weissbard & Zegas, Current [*19]  N.J.  Rules of Evidence, cmt. on N.J.R.E. 704 (2023)  (""[O]pinion testimony is not inadmissible solely because  it includes the    A-3472-21      17     ultimate issue in question. If lay or expert opinion  testimony is otherwise   competent under N.J.R.E. 701, 702 and 703, the fact  that it may embrace the   ultimate fact issue in dispute does not render it  incompetent."").   Fact testimony, by contrast, is ""ordinary fact-based  recitation by a witness   with first-hand knowledge."" McLean, 205 N.J. at 460.  For a police officer, in   the context of a narcotics trial, such fact testimony may  include:   a description of what the officer did and saw, . . . that  defendant stood on a corner, engaged in a brief  conversation, looked around, reached into a bag,  handed another person an item, accepted paper  currency in exchange, threw the bag aside as the officer  approached, and that the officer found drugs in the bag.   Ibid.   In McLean, our Supreme Court cautioned against  admitting lay opinion   testimony by a police officer where the opinion is based  on the officer's training   and experience, writing ""the analysis of admissibility has  been, as it must be,   firmly rooted in the personal observations and  perceptions of the lay witness in   the traditional meaning [*20]  of the Rule 701."" 205 N.J.  at 459. The McLean Court   considered the admissibility of a police officer's  testimony in which he first   recounted his observations of an interaction between  two individuals and then   testified as to his own belief, based on his experience,  that what he had observed   was a hand-to-hand drug transaction. Id. at 446.       Page 8 of 9 A-3472-21      18      The McLean Court found the second part of the officer's  testimony inadmissible because the police officer had  not been qualified as an expert and because the lay  opinion rule could not provide a basis for admissibility.  Id. at 463. The Court held such testimony ""was  impermissible both because it was an expression of a  belief in defendant's guilt and because it presumed to  give an opinion on matters that were not beyond the  understanding of the jury."" Ibid.   B.   Defendant argues testimony given by Detective Feehan  included inadmissible lay opinions with ""zero probative""  value, which introduced such an unfair prejudice that a  new trial is required. Specifically, defendant argues  Detective Feehan should not have been permitted to  testify that she followed the laws on entrapment.  Defendant argues the entrapment statute requires the  issue to be settled by [*21]  the factfinder. The State,  meanwhile, contends the testimony was proper.   This testimony from Detective Feehan was offered on re  -direct examination, after detailed cross-examination  squarely placed entrapment at issue. Here, Detective  Feehan's testimony was like that of the hypothetical  narcotics officer described in McLean. It was a factual  recitation of her own actions during the operation,  namely that she followed protocol, not an opinion about  anything defendant did or did not do. The jury was free  to find her    A-3472-21      19      statements credible or not. Detective Feehan was not  asked for, and did not offer, her thoughts or beliefs as to  defendant's guilt or innocence. She only recounted the  actions she took that day.   Even to the extent that Detective Feehan's testimony  could be considered a lay opinion on entrapment, such  an opinion is not inadmissible simply because it goes to  an issue to be decided by the factfinder. It must be  incompetent under N.J.R.E. 701 or inadmissible on  other grounds. The only argumen t defendant advances  on this point is that the statement had ""zero probative  value,"" possibly an attempt to disqualify the statements  under N.J.R.E. 701(b) or N.J.R.E. 401. This position is  untenable, [*22]  given that entrapment and Detective  Feehan's training on the same were extensively  explored in cross-examination by defense counsel.   Detective Feehan's one-word answer of ""yes"" to the  question, viewed in light of the overall evidence against  defendant, was not ""clearly capable"" of producing an  unjust result. R. 2:10-2. It was evidence to be weighed  by the jury under a preponderance standard if and only  if they found guilt had been established.   C.   Defendant maintains Agent Cruz's description of the  photograph sent on October 25 as ""a lewd image"" and  pointing out the contour of the penis was unnecessary  and impermissibly purported to usurp the role of the  jury. The State    A-3472-21      20     believes the testimony was proper because Agent  Cruz's description was   rationally based on his own perception, as required by  N.J.R.E. 70 1(a).   Agent Cruz's testimony that defendant ""sent a picture of  [an] erect penis   to a [fourteen-year-old],"" his characterization of the  photograph as a ""lewd   image,"" and his description of the displayed photograph  indicating the ""contour   of the penis"" are opinion testimony only to the extent  that they reflect Agent   Cruz's beliefs about the images displayed for the jury.  Our Court [*23]  recently took   up the admissibility of lay witness testimony providing  subjective   interpretations of a video recording in State v. Watson,  254 N.J. 558 (2023).   There, the Court held:   A fact witness who participated in an event can of  course testify about it and recount relevant evidence  without resort to Rule 701. Rule 701, in its purest form,  allows witnesses to offer lay opinion testimony based on  their firsthand observation of events in real time. Beyond  Page 9 of 9 that, they can offer lay opinion testimony about parts of  a recording that depict what they perceived in real time.  In those instances, they plainly have sufficient personal  knowledge within the meaning of Rules 602 and 701.    [Id. at 599.]   The Watson Court also addressed the helpfulness  prong of N.J.R.E.   701(b), holding the analysis is ""more straightforward and  depends on the facts   of the individual case."" Id. at 600. In contrast, in State v.  Higgs the Court   disallowed narration evidence by a police officer who  was not present on the    A-3472-21      21      scene because ""[t]he jury was as competent as the  detective to view the video and determine what the  image did or did not show."" 253 N.J. 333, 3 36 (2023).  Higgs is distinguishable from this case because Agent  Cruz personally participated in the chat to which he was  testifying.   Applying this [*24]  same analysis to the photos before  Agent Cruz, it is clear he was permitted to testify as to  his firsthand observations of the photographs. To the  extent  his  testimony  included  any  subjective  interpretation of the photographs, it would still be an  admissible lay opinion since he personally participated  in the chat and therefore, under Watson, ""plainly [has]  sufficient personal knowledge"" to satisfy N.J.R.E.  701(a). 254 N.J. at 599. And Agent Cruz's testimony  was helpful to the jury under N.J.R.E. 701(b) because  this testimony was offered to explain his interactions  with defendant.   Defendant  posits  Agent  Cruz's  testimony  was  inadmissible because by stating that ""any reasonable  person"" would not continue chatting with someone who  revealed themselves to be a fourteen-year-old, and by  stating ""you are not going to travel"" after learning of the  child's age, Cruz impermissibly opined on defendant's  guilt.  This  opinion,  according  to  defendant,  impermissibly invaded the province of the jury by  embracing an ultimate issue.   Agent Cruz's testimony constitutes opinion testimony in  that it is not a factual recitation of actions taken or  observations made during the operation,    A-3472-21      22      but rather a subjective characterization [*25]  of what  defendant or others in defendant's position might do.  Therefore, to be admissible, the statement must satisfy  both the perception and helpfulness prongs of N.J.R.E.  701, and it must not constitute expression of a belief  about defendant's guilt or innocence.   Here, Agent Cruz's testimony about the behavior of ""any  reasonable person"" and that such a person is ""not going  to travel"" after learning of Ange la's age is more like the  precluded evidence in McLean, in that it is a subjective  lay opinion of defendant's behavior, based on Agent  Cruz's training and experience in performing these types  of operations in the past. These statements were  inadmissible lay opinions, and it was error for them to be  admitted.   However, considering the brevity of these comments  compared to Agent Cruz's overall testimony, the error  does not rise to the level of being clearly capable of  producing an unjust result and was not plain error, given  the overall strength of the State's case and the clear  evidence of defendant's continued sexually explicit  conversation with Angela after being told her age.

"State v. Martinez-Mejia, 2023 N.J. Super. LEXIS 123","The opinion of the court was delivered by CHASE,  J.S.C. (temporarily assigned). The main issue in this criminal appeal is whether the  Luring, Enticing Child by Various Means statute,  N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a), requires the State to prove a  defendant lured or enticed a ""child,"" in this case an  undercover law enforcement officer posing as a  fourteen-year-old girl, into traveling or accompanying  the defendant to some location other than the victim's  own home. We reject defendant Jose Y. Martinez-Mejia's contention  that because he enticed the ""child"" to meet him alone,  and defendant traveled to the ""child's"" home, a  judgment of acquittal should have been entered. By its  plain language, [*2]  the statute forbids an adult from  ""luring or enticing a child to meet or appear at any other  place."" We hold that the child's home can be the ""other  place."" Here, that location is a place ""other"" than where  the defendant was when he communicated with the  child. In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we address  unrelated arguments raised by defendant on appeal  alleging  evidentiary  issues.  Having  found  those  arguments do not demonstrate plain error, we affirm  defendant's convictions and sentence. I. The prosecution in this matter originated in October  2019 when a team of state, federal, and local law  enforcement agencies participated in an undercover  operation to investigate adults using the internet to lure  children into sexual activity. Teams of officers were  stationed  in  an  apartment  complex  in  Franklin  Township, Somerset County. Special Agent Cedro Cruz from the Department of  Homeland Security served as a ""chatter,"" posing as a  fourteen-year-old girl named ""Angela."" Agent Cruz  created a profile for Angela on SKOUT, a location- Page 2 of 6 based  social  networking  and  dating  application  emphasizing generalized user location. Because of age  restrictions on SKOUT, Angela's profile was created  using [*3]  a birthdate to reflect that she was eighteen- years old. Angela's profile picture and other pictures  associated with her account were photographs of an  adult female border patrol officer. Agent Cruz used age- regression software to alter the photographs, making  Angela appear younger. At a jury trial, Agent Cruz testified solely as a fact  witness that on the afternoon of October 25, 2019,  acting as Angela, he accepted a SKOUT chat request  from defendant, who went by the username ""James.""  Defendant was thirty-two years old at the time.  Defendant's first messages were ""Hi, sweetheart, how  are you?"" and ""Hi, sweetheart, what are you doing?""  When Angela replied with ""nothing,"" he immediately  followed up with, ""[y]our pictures turn me on, honey.  Where are you from?"" When Agent Cruz testified about  this first exchange with defendant, the following ensued: Q: On October 25[,] of 2019, why was the  conversation only minutes? A: Because the defendant sent Angela a, I would  say a lewd image, and I basically said gross and  that discontinued the conversation. Q: And by lewd image what do you mean? A: So it was an image of a male in tight boxer  shorts and you could see the contour of his — his  penis. Defendant [*4]  contacted Angela again via SKOUT the  next  afternoon  in  an  interaction  that  lasted  approximately two hours. When defendant expressed a  desire to meet Angela, the following exchange ensued: Angela: Yeah, but I'm mad young. Defendant: How old are you now? Angela: Fourteen. You? Defendant: Oh, I see, 23. Angela: Oh, okay, cool. Defendant: Yes, love, I like your body. Angela: Aw, thanks. Defendant: I would like to see more pictures from  you. Angela: Why? Defendant: I like you. During this exchange, and after Angela revealed her  age, defendant sent Angela multiple photographs of  himself, including a picture of his erect penis. Angela revealed she was home alone because her  grandmother had left and would not be returning until  the next day. Defendant asked Angela explicit questions  about sex and masturbation and said he wanted ""more  sexy pictures"" of her. When Angela asked if he wanted  only pictures, he responded, ""I want to know you in  person, baby."" Defendant asked if Angela wanted to  touch his body and told her he wanted to perform oral  sex on her. The prosecution admitted the photographs into evidence  and published them for the jury. Agent Cruz was asked  to ""describe to the jury what they're seeing[.]"" [*5]  He  replied, ""The jury is seeing an image sent to Angela  through SKOUT on October 26[,] of a hand holding an  erect penis."" On re-direct, Agent Cruz testified as follows: Q: During the course of those communications at  any point in time did you threaten the defendant  that he had to continue communicating with you? A: No. I was trying to dissuade him from  communicating with me. . . . . Q: How did you do that? A: Well, I asked if he was a pic collector, and if he  would have said yes, I am just a pic collector, then  he would have just been a pic collector. I said that  I—I was [fourteen] years old, I would hope after  somebody hears that, that they are communicating  with a [fourteen]-year-old, they would then cease  communications with that person. I said that I was  alone, a fourteen-year-old alone in her house to  which he asked me if there were any neighbors  around and, you know, I lived with my grandmother  and my grandmother was not home. That, any  reasonable person, that's going to dissuade you  and you are not going to travel. As a matter of fact,  you might try to either report this person, which has  happened in the past, but in this situation it didn't  happen. And on top of that he sent a picture [*6]  of  his erect penis to a [fourteen]-year-old. When defendant offered to come to Angela at 4:00 p.m.  that day, she gave him the address of the apartment in  Franklin and a phone number associated with Agent  Cruz's undercover phone. The communication then proceeded outside of SKOUT  and directly between defendant and the undercover  phone, which recorded every call and text message.  Agent Cruz continued to send and reply to text  messages; while Detective Katie Feehan from the New  Jersey State Police Internet Crimes Against Children  Unit (""ICACU"") provided Angela's voice for phone calls. Page 3 of 6 Detective Feehan testified to her role with the ICACU  and the training that she received in acting as a child in  an undercover capacity; however, she was not tendered  as an expert witness. She testified to the details of her  three phone calls with defendant. During the first phone call, defendant asked Angela to  confirm that she was home alone. Angela told defendant  her grandmother was in Atlantic City and would not be  returning for a couple of days. Angela said her  grandmother could not take her on the trip because she  was not old enough to gamble. On a second phone call,  Angela confirmed no one else was in [*7]  the house by  saying, ""Just me and my grandma, and she isn't here.  So I mean, I'm completely alone."" On the third phone  call, the following exchange ensued: [Angela]: . . . I'm just trying to figure out if you're  coming up. Because, if not, I'm probably just gonna  go out. [Defendant]: I mean, okay. So let me take a shower  and then go — go over there. [Angela]: You gonna come? [Defendant]: Yes. [Angela]: Okay. Awesome. I'm gonna clean up a  little bit then. When Angela asked defendant what he wanted to do  when he arrived, he repeated his desire to perform oral  sex on her. She reaffirmed she was going to clean the  apartment to prepare for his arrival, and then she was  going to wait for him. Defendant hired an Uber to take him to Franklin and  sent Angela a screen shot of his phone's Uber  application, showing that he was on his way to her  house. When defendant texted Angela that he had  arrived, Agent Cruz could see him standing outside  through the apartment window. Defendant was arrested  and was found to be in possession of a cell phone, a  receipt with Angela's address written on it, $184 dollars,  and two condoms. At trial, Detective Feehan was asked on cross- examination about her training on the [*8]  topic of  entrapment. Detective Feehan testified that she had  reviewed the relevant New Jersey law and that it closely  matched the national standard. She testified that she  had been trained to allow the subject of the investigation  ""to set the tone, pace, and subject matter of the  conversation[.]"" She was presented with a portion of the  investigative standards from the ICACU, which was  entered into evidence. On re-direct, the following exchange took place: Q: On cross-examination you were asked some  questions about your training with regard to the  topic of entrapment. Do you recall that? A: Yes. Q: And you testified that you received training about  the federal and also State of New Jersey  entrapment laws. Is that correct? A: Yes. Q: Did you follow the entrapment laws in this case? A: Yes. Defense counsel re-crossed Detective Feehan on those  points, asking whether ""[w]hat do you wanna do when  you get here?"" was a conversation topic that defendant  initiated, to which she replied in the negative. During an extensive charge conference, defense  counsel raised no objections to the language of the  second-degree luring charge. The jury was instructed  that a guilty verdict on luring required the State [*9]  to  prove: 1. That ""Angela"" was a child. When I say Angela I  have that in quotes, or, that the defendant  reasonably believed that Angela was a child. 2. Defendant—that defendant attempted to lure or  entice Angela into a motor vehicle, structure or  isolated area, to meet or appear at any other place;  and, 3. That defendant had a purpose to commit a  criminal offense with or against the child. The jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of all  charges: second-degree luring, N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a);  second-degree attempted sexual assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:5- 1(a)(3) and 2C:14-2(c)(4); third-degree attempted  endangering the welfare of a child, N.J.S.A. 2C:24- 4(a)(1), 2C:5-1(a)(1) and (a)(3); and third-degree  attempted promoting obscene material to a minor,  N.J.S.A. 2C:34-3(b)(1), 2C:5-1(a)(1) and (a)(3). After merging the attempted endangering the welfare of  a child count with the attempted sexual assault count,  the judge sentenced defendant concurrently to five  years of imprisonment on the attempted sexual assault  charge; five years on the luring charge; and three years  on the attempted obscene material charge. Defendant  was also subjected to Megan's Law registration  requirements and parole supervision for life. On appeal, defendant raises the following claims for the  first time: I. THE LURING CHARGE MUST BE VACATED  BECAUSE [*10]  DEFENDANT DID NOT TRY TO  Page 4 of 6 LURE A CHILD INTO GOING ANYWHERE. II. THE DEFENDANT'S CONVICTIONS SHOULD  BE REVERSED BECAUSE INADMISSIBLE LAY  OPINION TESTIMONY FROM INVESTIGATING  OFFICERS INTRODUCED UNFAIR PREJUDICE. II. When a party does not object to an alleged trial error, or  otherwise preserve the issue for the appellate record, it  is reviewed for plain error. Review for plain error  requires determining: ""(1) whether there was error; and  (2) whether that error was 'clearly capable of producing  an unjust result,' [under Rule] 2:10-2; that is, whether  there is 'a reasonable doubt . . . as to whether the error  led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have  reached.'"" State v. Dunbrack, 245 N.J. 531, 544 (2021)  (quoting State v. Funderburg, 225 N.J. 66, 79 (2016)  (omission in original)). ""To determine whether an  alleged error rises to the level of plain error, it 'must be  evaluated in light of the overall strength of the State's  case.'"" State v. Clark, 251 N.J. 266, 287 (2022) (quoting  State v. Sanchez-Medina, 231 N.J. 452, 468 (2018)).  ""The mere possibility of an unjust result is not enough.""  Funderberg, 225 N.J. at 79. Where there is a failure to  object, reviewing courts presume the newly minted  objection on appeal is ""not error"" and ""unlikely to  prejudice the defendant's case."" State v. Singleton, 211  N.J. 157, 182 (2012) (citing State v. Macon, 57 N.J. 325,  333-34, (1971)). Statutory  interpretations  are  legal  determinations  reviewed  by  an  appellate  court  ""de  novo,  'unconstrained [*11]  by deference to the decisions of  the trial court[.]'"" State v. Fuqua, 234 N.J. 583, 591  (2018) (quoting State v. S.B., 230 N.J. 62, 67 (2017)). A  trial court's evidentiary rulings, by contrast, are reviewed  for abuse of discretion. State v. Garcia, 245 N.J. 412,  430 (2021) (citing State v. Nantambu, 221 N.J. 390, 402  (2015)). An appellate court ""will not substitute [its]  judgment unless the evidentiary ruling is 'so wide of the  mark' that it constitutes 'a clear error in judgment.'"" Ibid.  (quoting State v. Medina, 242 N.J. 397, 412 (2020)). III. Defendant does not claim the indictment should have  been dismissed, nor does he explicitly express that the  trial court, sua sponte, should have found that the State  had not met the elements of the crime at the close of its  case. Rather, defendant's issue seems to be a  conceptual one, where he believes we should hold: (1)  telling a child you want to meet for sex; (2) asking them  to meet you to fulfill that desire; and (3) making sure a  child is alone and vulnerable before meeting them, is  not luring or enticing the child into a sexual encounter so  long as the child makes the mistake of meeting the  would-be predator at the child's own house. Defendant emphasizes that the forbidden conduct  element of the statute is ""to lure or entice"" a child to go  somewhere. Relying on the dictionary definition of  ""lure,"" defendant argues its aim is ""to lead [*12]   someone into a dangerous or difficult situation that they  otherwise would not have entered."" Merriam- Webster's  Collegiate Dictionary, (11th ed. 2020). Therefore,  defendant reasons, the statute does not criminalize  traveling to the child for the criminal purpose. Defendant  concedes a child may be ""lured"" into staying at a place  that they otherwise would have left, such as a school  after-hours, but argues if a child would be at home or  school  anyway,  even  without  the  defendant's  enticement, then luring has not taken place. Defendant argues, in the alternative, that even if the  statutory language was not clear, the only provision that  could be considered ambiguous is the term ""to meet or  appear at any other place."" Defendant employs the  canon of ejusdem generis to argue that the phrase ""any  other place"" must also refer to places where a child  must be lured to travel towards for the statutory  elements to be met. Defendant points to the luring  statute's close relationship to the kidnapping statute,  N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(c), to support his theory. Defendant  argues even if the statutory language did not support his  position, the principle of lenity should apply in favor of  interpreting the statute to require the [*13]  child to be  lured to travel. The State responds that defendant is asking us to  create a ""convenient loophole"" in the statutory scheme  by finding that an adult traveling to a child's location for  the purpose of sex is not criminalized by the luring  statute. The State maintains that a complicated analysis  of the text under ejusdem generis is not required since  the clause ""to meet or appear at any other place"" is  unambiguous on its face. The ""ordinary meaning and significance"" of statutory  language is acknowledged as ""'the best indicator of [the  Legislature's] intent.'"" Tumpson v. Farina, 218 N.J. 450,  467 (2014) (alteration in original) (quoting DiProspero v.  Penn, 183 N.J. 477, 492 (2005)). Only where the  statutory language at issue is ambiguous should a court  ""look to extrinsic evidence, such as legislative history  [and] committee reports"" to determine legislative intent.  Tumpson, 218 N.J. at 468. Where the textual analysis  Page 5 of 6 and extrinsic aids both fail to resolve ambiguity, the rule  of lenity ""requires that the ambiguity be resolved in favor  of the defendant."" State v. Regis, 208 N.J. 439, 451  (2011). Courts should ""avoid statutory interpretations  that 'lead to absurd or unreasonable results.'"" State v.  Lewis, 185 N.J. 363, 369 (2005) (quoting State v. Gill,  47 N.J. 441, 444 (1966)). The plain language of the statutory text in question  provides in relevant part: A person commits a crime of the second degree  if [*14]  he attempts, via electronic or any other  means, to lure or entice-a child or one who he  reasonably believes to be a child into a motor  vehicle, structure or isolated area, or to meet or  appear at any other place, with a purpose to  commit a criminal offense with or against the child. [N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a) (emphasis added).] One must look at the wording of the entire phrase in its  context, which prohibits to ""lure or entice,"" and the entire  dictionary definition of both words to determine the  statute's ordinary meaning. Defendant's argument only  focuses on the dictionary definition of ""lure"" to conclude  that ""to lead someone into a dangerous or difficult  situation that they otherwise would not have entered""  means to go to another location. The definition of ""lure""  includes ""to lead astray from one's true course.""  Merriam-Webster's College Dictionary, (11th ed. 2020).  And ""entice"" is defined as ""to lure or induce; esp., to  wrongfully solicit (a person) to do something."" Black's  Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). The prohibited conduct  is thus defined by its aim to lead someone into a  dangerous or difficult situation that they otherwise would  not have entered. The course of action Angela was  lured into was staying [*15]  alone, isolated, and  vulnerable to meet an adult male for an illegal sexual  encounter. Here, the ordinary meaning of the phrase ""to meet or  appear at any other place"" also leads to the conclusion  defendant engaged in prohibited conduct when he  enticed Angela to stay at her home and not go out with  her friends. There is no reason to construe the phrase of  ""any other place"" as containing an unwritten exception  for places where the child is already located. Here, that  location is a place ""other"" than where the defendant was  when he communicated with the child. Defendant went  through great pains to ensure Angela would be alone  before telling her he was coming over. Indeed, by  requesting the child to stay at her home, the abuse is all  the easier to commit; since it lulls the child into a false  sense of security; creating the dangerous circumstance  of isolation and vulnerability that this statute is meant to  punish. Neither the dictionary definitions nor the  language of the statute expresses a requirement of the  victim going to a different place. Although there is no need to make any further inquiry,  our decision is also supported by the legislative history,  which suggests an intent to create [*16]  an expansive  scheme to criminalize an increasing number of  dangerous behaviors. The original text, now thirty years  old, was limited to luring a child into a motor vehicle. By  contrast, the current statute criminalizes two actions  (luring and enticing), by unlimited means (electronic or  any other), with two categories of victims (children or  those reasonably believed to be children), a wide  number of prohibited enticements (motor vehicles,  structures, isolated areas, and meetings or appearances  at any other place), and a broadly stated purpose  element (to commit a criminal offense with or against  the child). In addition, analyzing this statute in relation to our  kidnapping statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:13-1, also undermines  defendant's position. The kidnapping statute was meant  to address the kind of danger isolation poses to a child,  and such isolation and danger can certainly be present  at the child's own home, especially where, as here, the  child is confirmed to be home alone. See State v. Cruz- Pena, 243 N.J. 342, 354-61 (2020) (kidnapping occurs  when the victim is confined to one place for a  substantial period, citing to a litany of cases where  kidnapping-by-confinement occurs in places where the  victim would still otherwise be); State v. LaFrance, 117  N.J. 583, 592-93 (1990) (confining a victim [*17]  to his  own bedroom for a substantial period in order to isolate  the man's wife and sexually assault her constituted  kidnapping). Defendant's request that the principle of lenity support  an interpretation in his favor is similarly unavailing, and  is not required, given the unambiguous text and  expansive legislative history. The fact that other statutes  such as the child endangerment statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:24- 4, might also criminalize a defendant's behavior does  not compel us to adopt a crabbed interpretation of  N.J.S.A. 2C:13-6(a).

"State v. Nelson, 2023 Iowa App. LEXIS 941","TABOR, Presiding Judge. A jury found Brandon Nelson guilty of second-degree  theft for taking a motor vehicle. Nelson appeals his  conviction, contending that he did not intend to  permanently deprive the owner of the vehicle. Because  the State did not prove that element beyond a  reasonable doubt, we reverse Nelson's theft conviction  and remand for entry of judgment of acquittal. I. Facts and Prior Proceedings After working an overnight hospital shift in August 2021,  P.K. found his 2017 Chevy Sonic missing from the  parking lot. Within fifteen minutes of calling the police,  P.K. located the vehicle using his OnStar service. It was  six blocks from the hospital. The hospital pulled  surveillance footage of the parking lot; that video  showed that [*2]  the vehicle went missing ""sometime  between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m."" The car was covered in dust because P.K. lived on a  gravel road. But in the dust were ""smudge marks and  handprints"" that weren't there when he arrived at work.  Sheldon Police Officer Todd Wood believed that the  Chevy, which had a manual transmission, had been  placed into neutral and pushed to the new location.  Checking inside, P.K. discovered his cash and clothing  were gone. He also noticed a ""wadded up soaking wet""  plaid shirt that did not belong to him. Later that morning, police received calls that ""a white,  tall male subject"" was seen ""wandering about""  barefooted near a downtown restaurant. Officer Wood  spotted a man matching that description in the  convenience store parking lot. The officer observed that  the man, later identified as Nelson, was ""lost or  confused"" and ""not walking in a straight line."" Officer  Wood asked Nelson if he was okay and noticed a price  tag hanging from the shirt Nelson was wearing. After  Page 2 of 3 more questioning, Officer Wood arrested Nelson. At  the jail, O'Brien County Deputy Keven Van Meeteren  interviewed Nelson, who is a registered sex offender.  The deputy asked Nelson about his failure to  update [*3]  his address for the sex offender registry  when he moved to South Dakota. Nelson said he was  homeless there and did not have a residence to list. The State charged Nelson with theft of a motor vehicle,  a class ""D"" felony, in violation of Iowa Code sections  714.1(1) and 714.2(2) (2021). At trial, Nelson testified  that when he returned to Sheldon from South Dakota,  he was ""just trying to blend in"" and ""needed a rest."" He  admitted pushing the Chevy all six blocks from the  hospital parking lot. But he denied any intent to  permanently deprive P.K. of the car. As a homeless  man, Nelson said he was trying to avoid ""harassment""  from police, so he took the car for shelter. The jury found Nelson guilty of second-degree theft,  among other offenses. The court imposed a prison  sentence not to exceed five years. And the court  ordered that sentence to be served consecutively with  an indeterminate five-year term for Nelson's assault  conviction. Nelson appeals only his theft conviction. II. Scope and Standard of Review We review sufficiency of the evidence claims for  correction of errors at law. State v. Nall, 894 N.W.2d  514, 517 (Iowa 2017). We view the evidence in the light  most favorable to the State, but we consider all  evidence, not just the inculpatory facts. State v.  Keopasaeuth, 645 N.W.2d 637, 640 (Iowa 2002). We  uphold a verdict when [*4]  it is supported by substantial                  evidence in the record. State v. Mong, 988 N.W.2d 305,  312 (Iowa 2023). Evidence is substantial if it ""would  have convinced a rational fact finder that the defendant  is guilty of the crime charged beyond a reasonable  doubt."" State v. Constable, 505 N.W.2d 473, 478 (Iowa  1993). ""Evidence is not substantial if it raises only  suspicion, speculation or conjecture."" State v. Speicher,  625 N.W.2d 738, 741 (Iowa 2001). III. Analysis To find Nelson guilty of theft in the second degree, the  jury had to find these elements: 1. On or about the 10th day of August, 2021, [he]  knowingly took possession or control of an  automobile. 2. [He] did so with the specific intent to permanently  deprive [P.K.] of the automobile. 3. At the time of the taking, the automobile  belonged to [P.K.]. Nelson contests only the element of specific intent. The  instructions defined specific intent as ""not only being  aware of doing an act and doing it voluntarily, but in  addition, doing it with a specific purpose in mind."" From  there, the State had to prove that Nelson acted with the  specific purpose to ""permanently deprive"" P.K. of his  car. See State v. Morris, 677 N.W.2d 787, 788 (Iowa  2004) (defining intent to deprive in Iowa Code section  714.1(1) as intent to permanently deprive); State v.  Schminkey, 597 N.W.2d 785, 789 (Iowa 1999) (same). The jury instructions did not define ""permanently  deprive."" But our case law says it requires ""more than a  temporary dispossessing [*5]  of another's property.""  State v. Berger, 438 N.W.2d 29, 31 (Iowa Ct. App.  1989). Rather, to prove theft, the State had to show that  Nelson intended to withhold the property ""for an  extended period of time, or under such circumstances,  that its benefit or value is lost; or, the property is  disposed of in such a manner or under such  circumstances, as to render it unlikely that the owner will  recover the property."" Id. Nelson notes that his taking of the Chevy without the  owner's consent did not give rise to an inference that he  intended to permanently deprive P.K. of the vehicle. See  Morris, 677 N.W.2d at 788; Schminkey, 597 N.W.2d at  791. He compares his case to Morris and Schminkey. In  Schminkey, our supreme court vacated a guilty plea for  vehicle theft because the record did not support a  factual basis for the defendant's intent to permanently  deprive. 597 N.W.2d at 787. Schminkey had been  Page 3 of 3 drinking, took a truck owned by a man he did not know,  drove erratically, crashed the truck, and killed another  driver before colliding with a fence. Id. at 787. The court  found that none of those facts revealed Schminkey's  intent ""to do anything more than temporarily use the  vehicle to go home or to another bar."" Id. at 791. The  supreme court reaffirmed Schminkey in Morris. 677  N.W.2d at 788. The court reversed a theft conviction  where police stopped Morris about five miles from the  owner's residence [*6]  after he possessed the truck for  about  thirty  minutes;  Morris  fled  on  foot.  Id.  (""Abandoning the vehicle and fleeing upon observing  the presence of police was an act that would ordinarily  assure that the truck would be returned to its owner.""). In defense of this verdict, the State points to Nelson's  admission that he pushed the vehicle away from the  hospital parking lot so he could ""rest"" in it away from the  police. The State contends that the jury could  reasonably infer from that evidence that Nelson took  possession with the intent to permanently deprive P.K.  of the vehicle. For that proposition, the State relies on  State v. Rosewall, 239 N.W.2d 171, 173 (Iowa 1976)  (noting ""unexplained possession of recently stolen  property  justifies  an  inference  of  guilt  of  the  possessor""). Trouble is, the charge in Rosewall was  larceny of a motor vehicle under the 1975 criminal code.  See Iowa Code § 321.82 (1975) (imposing punishment  ""if any person steal, take and carry away, irrespective of  value, any motor vehicle""). Rosewall was convicted of  operating without the owner's consent. 239 N.W.2d at  172 (citing Iowa Code § 321.76). Neither statute  required the State to prove an intent to permanently  deprive. Id. As Nelson argues, under Schminkey and  Morris, the jurors could not infer from Larson's act of  taking the car without [*7]  P.K.'s permission that Larson  had the requisite intent. The State also argues that Nelson ""had no car . . . no  money, and was trying to leave Iowa."" Those  circumstances, according to the State, supported a  finding  that  Nelson  had  the  specific  intent  to  permanently deprive P.K. of his vehicle at the time of  the taking. The State reasons that the fact that Nelson         abandoned the vehicle does not negate the intent he  had at the time of the taking. That may be true, but  neither is abandonment ""indicative of the requisite  intent."" Morris, 677 N.W.2d at 788. The State next ventures that P.K. ""lost the value or  benefit of the property because he did not have his car  when he needed it to leave work."" But that clipped  reading of the definition of permanent deprivation  ignores the references to ""an extended period of time""  and disposal of property ""under such circumstances as  to render it unlikely that the owner will recover the  property."" Using a GPS tracking device, P.K. found his  car just six blocks from the hospital. True, the car was  taken from the parking lot between four and six hours  before P.K. noticed it missing. But the record does not  show how long Nelson possessed it. Nelson testified  that he stopped pushing [*8]  when he realized he  ""couldn't get to a comfortable spot where [he] felt like  [he] would be safe."" His testimony, like his acts and the  attending circumstances, fail to show an intent to  permanently deprive. See State v. Fuentes, No. 03- 0426, 2004 WL 1854103, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App. July 28,  2004) (finding Fuentes's testimony that he did not intend  to keep another man's van, combined with the fact that it  was not driven far and was found the same night it was  taken, undermined the State's proof of an intent). But the State emphasizes that the jury was free to reject  Nelson's testimony. See State v. Shanahan, 712  N.W.2d 121, 135 (Iowa 2006). Indeed, the jury had that  freedom. Yet, even without Nelson's testimony, the  evidence did not support the State's theory that he took  the car to leave Iowa. Nelson had no key nor other  means to operate the vehicle. The jury could not  reasonably infer that Nelson planned to push the car out  of state from Sheldon. Even viewing the evidence in the  light most favorable to the State, these facts do not  allow a reasonable factfinder to infer that Nelson had  the specific intent to permanently deprive P.K. of his  vehicle. Under these circumstances, we reverse  Nelson's theft conviction and remand for entry of  judgment of acquittal. REVERSED AND REMANDED.",0
"State v. Taylor-Hollingsworth, 2023 Ohio App. LEXIS 4249","[*1] DECISION APPEAL from the Franklin County Court of Common  Pleas MENTEL, J. {¶  1}  Defendant-appellant,  Richard  J.  Taylor- Hollingsworth, appeals from the August 10, 2022  judgment entry of the Franklin County Court of Common  Pleas sentencing him to an aggregate term of 16 years  in prison for committing the offenses of aggravated  robbery and felonious assault. For the following  reasons, we affirm. I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY {¶ 2} On September 28, 2018, appellant was indicted by  a Franklin County Grand Jury for aggravated robbery in  violation of R.C. 2911.01, a felony of the first degree  (Count One); felonious assault in violation of R.C.  2903.11, a felony of the second degree (Count Two);  and having weapons under disability in violation of R.C.  2923.13, a felony of the third degree (Count Three).  Counts One and Two also included firearm and repeat  violent offender specifications in violation of R.C.  2941.145(A) and 2941.149(A), respectively.  No. 22AP-527 2  {¶ 3} On October 10, 2018, appellant pleaded guilty,  pursuant to a plea agreement, to aggravated robbery  and felonious assault with firearm specifications, in  exchange for dismissal of the having weapons while  under disability count and the repeat violent offender  specifications. The trial court accepted [*2]  appellant's  plea and immediately moved to a sentencing hearing. At  the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court sentenced  appellant to serve an aggregate term of 16 years in  prison. Specifically, the trial court ordered appellant to  serve ten years of incarceration for aggravated robbery,  with a consecutive three-year sentence for the firearm  specification, and seven years for felonious assault, with  a consecutive three-year sentence for the firearm  specification. The trial court ordered the felonious  assault and aggravated robbery sentences to be run  concurrent  with  each  other,  and  the  firearm  specifications to run consecutive to the primary  convictions. Appellant appealed the trial court's sentence arguing  that the plea was not made knowingly, intelligently, and  voluntarily because the trial court did not give any  advisement concerning the mandatory imposition of  post-release control. On January 30, 2020, this court  found the trial court plainly erred during the plea  colloquy by failing to advise appellant that the sentence  included a mandatory term of post-release control. State  v. Taylor-Hollingsworth, 10th Dist. No. 18AP-873, 2020- Ohio-278,discretionary appeal not allowed, 2020-Ohio- Page 2 of 6 3018. Accordingly, we vacated appellant's plea and  remanded the matter back [*3]  to the trial court. {¶ 4} On August 10, 2022, the trial court held a second  sentencing hearing in this matter. Appellant, after being  advised of his rights pursuant to Crim.R. 11, entered a  plea of guilty to the aggravated robbery and felonious  assault offenses with firearm specifications. The having  weapons while under disability charge and repeat  violent offender specifications were dismissed nolle  prosequi. {¶ 5} The parties proceeded to a sentencing hearing  pursuant to R.C. 2929.19. During the hearing, the state  delivered an oral summary of the case. Counsel for the  appellant raised no objection to the state's recitation of  the underlying facts. (Aug. 10, 2022 Tr. at 6-7.) {¶ 6} According to the state, on August 27, 2017, at  approximately 1:32 a.m., the victims in this case, M.B.  and G.T., stopped at the Sunoco gas station located at  2281 Sullivant Avenue in Columbus, Ohio. As M.B.- wearing a large gold chain-exited his  No. 22AP-527 3  vehicle, he observed G.T. speaking with two individuals,  one of which was later identified as appellant. G.T.  heard the two individuals state that they could rob M.B.  Appellant then proceeded to brandish a firearm. To  avoid an altercation, M.B. continued into the Sunoco  gas [*4]  station store. Surveillance video showed that  appellant followed M.B. and chased him around the  inside of the store. Appellant pursued M.B out of the  store and down a nearby alleyway. Appellant then shot  M.B. in the back. While on the ground, appellant ripped  the chain off M.B.'s neck. While the unidentified  individual told appellant to kill M.B, appellant declined  and fled the scene. {¶ 7} At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court  imposed an aggregate term of 16 years in prison.  Specifically, the trial court sentenced appellant to ten  years of incarceration for aggravated robbery with an  additional  three-year  sentence  for  the  firearm  specification. The trial court also imposed seven years  of incarceration for the felonious assault with an  additional  three-year  sentence  for  the  firearm  specification. While trial court determined that the  aggravated robbery and felonious assault convictions  did not merge, it ordered the convictions to run  concurrent with each other but consecutive to the  firearms specifications. The trial court found appellant  was entitled to 225 days of jail-time credit. {¶ 8}  Appellant filed a timely appeal in this matter. II. ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR {¶ 9}  Appellant [*5]  assigns the following as trial court  error: The trial court erred in failing to merge Mr. Taylor  Hollingsworth's convictions in counts one and two at  sentencing in violation of R.C. 2941.25, the Fifth and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United  States  Constitution, and Article I, Section 10 and 16 of the Ohio  Constitution. III. STANDARD OF REVIEW {¶ 10} A trial court's decision as to whether multiple  offenses merge, pursuant to R.C. 2941.25, is a judicial  determination, which we review de novo. State v. Bailey,  __ Ohio St. __, 2022-Ohio-4407, ¶ 6, citing State v.  Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 482, 2012-Ohio-5699, ¶ 1;  State v. McKnight, 10th Dist. No. 20AP-595, 2022-Ohio- 591, ¶ 34, citing State v.Flood, 10th Dist. No. 18AP-206,  2019-Ohio-2524, ¶ 25.  No. 22AP-527 4  IV. LEGAL ANALYSIS A. Appellant's Sole Assignment of Error {¶ 11} In appellant's sole assignment of error, he argues  that the trial court erred by failing to merge the  aggravated robbery and felonious assault convictions. {¶ 12} The legal doctrine of merger is rooted in the  Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the  United States Constitution as made applicable to the  states through the Fourteenth Amendment. State v.  Pendleton, 163 Ohio St.3d 114, 2020-Ohio-6833, ¶ 8.  The Ohio Constitution similarly provides, ""[n]o person  shall be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense.""  Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 10. Among the  protections afforded under the Double Jeopardy Clause,  is the protection against multiple punishments for the  same offense. State v. Ruff, 143 Ohio St.3d 114, 2015- Ohio-995, ¶ 10. {¶ 13} The General Assembly codified the judicial  doctrine of merger in R.C. 2941.25. The statute  precludes the ""cumulative punishment of a defendant for  the same criminal act where his conduct can be  construed to constitute two statutory offenses, when in  substance and [*6]  effect, only one offense has been  committed."" State v. Roberts, 62 Ohio St.2d 170, 172-73  Page 3 of 6 (1980). R.C. 2941.25 directs: (A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be  construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of  similar import, the indictment or information may contain  counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be  convicted of only one. (B) Where the defendant's conduct constitutes two or  more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct  results in two or more offenses of the same or similar  kind committed separately or with a separate animus as  to each, the indictment or information may contain  counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be  convicted of all of them. {¶ 14} Ohio's felonious assault statute, R.C. 2903.11(A),  provides: ""(A) No person shall knowingly do either of the  following: (1) Cause serious physical harm to another or  to another's unborn; (2) Cause or attempt to cause  physical harm to another or to another's unborn by  means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance.""  Additionally, the offense of aggravated robbery, as set  forth under R.C. 2911.01, is defined as: (A) No person, in attempting or committing a theft  offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised  Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or  offense, shall do any of the following: [*7]   No. 22AP-527 5  (1) Have a deadly weapon on or about the offender's  person or under the offender's control and either display  the weapon, brandish it, indicate that the offender  possesses it, or use it; (2) Have a dangerous ordnance on or about the  offender's person or under the offender's control; (3) Inflict, or attempt to inflict, serious physical harm on  another. {¶ 15} The Supreme Court of Ohio has shaped the  nature of our allied-offenses analysis under R.C.  2941.25 through its evolving interpretations of the  statute. See, e.g.,State v. Logan, 60 Ohio St.2d 126  (1979); State v. Roberts, 62 Ohio St.2d 170 (1980);  State v. Thomas, 61 Ohio St.2d 254 (1980);State v.  Donald, 57 Ohio St.2d 73 (1979); State v. Blankenship,  38 Ohio St.3d 116 (1988); State v. Rance, 85 Ohio  St.3d 632 (1999);State v. Cabrales, 118 Ohio St.3d 54,  2008-Ohio-1625; State v. Johnson, 128 Ohio St.3d 153,  2010-Ohio-6314. {¶ 16} In Ruff, the Supreme Court revisited its decision  in Johnson to resolve when two or more offenses are  allied offenses of a similar import as contemplated  under R.C. 2941.25. State v. Ruff, 143 Ohio St.3d 114,  2015-Ohio-995, ¶ 1. The Ruff court found that when  engaging in R.C. 2941.25 analysis, ""courts must  evaluate three separate factors- the conduct, the  animus, and the import."" Id. at paragraph one of the  syllabus; State v.Harris, 10th Dist. No. 15AP-683, 2016- Ohio-3424, ¶ 42. The Supreme Court explained that  when determining whether two or more offenses are  allied offenses of a similar import as contemplated  under R.C. 2941.25, courts must ask three questions: (1)  Were  the  offenses  dissimilar  in  import  or  significance? (2) Were they committed separately? and  (3) Were they committed with separate animus [*8]  or  motivation? Ruff at ¶ 31. {¶ 17} An answer in the affirmative to any of the above  questions will permit separate convictions. State v.  Bailey, __Ohio St.3d __, 2022-Ohio-4407, ¶ 10, citing  Statev. Earley, 145 Ohio St.3d 281, 2015-Ohio-4615, ¶  12, citing Ruff at ¶ 31. ""At its heart, the allied-offense  analysis is dependent upon the facts of a case because  R.C. 2941.25 focuses on the defendant's conduct."" Ruff  at ¶ 26. When determining whether multiple offenses  merge pursuant to R.C. 2941.25, a court must review  the entire record. State v. Junod, 3d  No. 22AP-527 6  Dist. No. 10-18-08, 2019-Ohio-743, ¶ 60, citing State v.  Washington, 137 Ohio St.3d 427, 2013-Ohio-4982, ¶ 24. {¶ 18} Since Ruff, the Supreme Court has rejected ""a  bright-line rule for analyzing the issue of multiple  punishments because a one-size-fits-all rule will not  work in every situation. [Ruff] at ¶ 30. Rather, an allied- offenses analysis must be driven by the facts of each  case."" State v. Ramunas, __Ohio St.3d__, 2022-Ohio- 4199, ¶ 22 (Fischer, J., dissenting). ""[B]ecause an  offense may be committed in a variety of ways[,] and the  offenses committed may have different import,"" the Ruff  analysis must focus on the appellant's conduct to  resolve whether one or more convictions may result.  Ramunas at ¶ 22 (Fischer, J., dissenting). While a  court's R.C. 2941.25 analysis has been properly applied  as a legal question, ""it necessarily turns on an analysis  of the facts, which can lead to exceedingly fine  distinctions."" Bailey, 2022-Ohio-4407, at ¶ 11. Page 4 of 6 {¶ 19} Whether two offenses merge is a sentencing  question [*9]  and not an additional burden of proof  shouldered by the state. Washington at ¶ 18. The  defendant holds the burden to establish their entitlement  to the protections under R.C. 2941.25 against multiple  punishments for a single criminal act. Id.; see also State  v. Morris, 12th Dist. No. CA2019-12-205, 2020-Ohio- 4103, ¶ 15, citing State v. Conrad, 12th Dist. No.  CA2018-01-016,  2018-Ohio-5291,  ¶  44  (finding  defendant failed to meet their burden to demonstrate  that his convictions for aggravated robbery, aggravated  burglary, and kidnapping were allied offenses as the  facts indicated that the crimes were each committed  separately and with a separate animus).1 1 There is no dispute regarding the underlying facts that  form the basis for the felonious assault conviction, i.e.,  appellant shooting M.B. in the back causing him serious  physical harm. However, the state contends there are  three  separate  incidents  that  could  constitute  aggravated robbery: (1) when M.B. saw appellant  outside the Sunoco and overheard, ""we can rob this  guy"" before appellant pulled out a gun, which resulted in  M.B. fleeing into the store; (2) when appellant chased  M.B. around the interior of the store while brandishing a  firearm; and (3) when appellant, while holding a gun and  having just shot M.B, ripped the chain from the victim's  neck. While appellant solely discusses [*10]  the third  theory in its brief, the state argues the first two theories  are equally available as a basis to find that the felonious  assault and aggravated robbery convictions were  separate offenses. The state reasons that because  appellant pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery in  violation of R.C. 2911.01, felony of the first degree, the  nature of the aggravated robbery was never narrowed to  a single theory. The state also points to the language in  the indictment and bill of particulars that support both  R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) and (A)(2) analysis. Concerning the  first two theories, the state posits that because the  aggravated robbery was completed before the felonious  assault, the offenses were committed separately and do  not merge. ""[I]f one offense is completed before the  other begins, the offenses are considered separately for  sentencing purposes even though the two offenses may  have been committed in close proximity in time."" State  v. Fields, 12th Dist. No. CA2014-3-025, 2015-Ohio- 1345, ¶ 18. However, because we find that the  No. 22AP-527 7  1. Offenses dissimilar in import or significance {¶ 20} Our analysis begins and ends with the first prong  of the Ruff analysis- whether the offenses were  dissimilar in import and significance. There are two  circumstances  in  which  offenses  will  be  considered [*11]  dissimilar in import making sentences  of multiple counts permissible. The first is "" '[w]hen a  defendant's conduct victimizes more than one person  [because] the harm for each person is separate and  distinct.' * * * The second circumstance is when a  defendant's conduct against a single victim constitutes  two or more offenses and 'the harm that results from  each offense is separate and identifiable from the harm  of the other offense.' "" Ramunas at ¶ 23 (Fischer, J.,  dissenting), quoting Ruff at ¶ 26. As this case concerns  a single victim, we will focus our analysis on whether the  harm from the offenses of felonious assault and  aggravated robbery was separate and identifiable. {¶ 21} Offenses are"" 'not allied offenses of similar import  if neither [offense] is incident to the other.' "" State v.  Bishop, 1st Dist. No. C-220231, 2023-Ohio-947, ¶ 18,  quoting Ruff at ¶ 23. In conducting an analysis of  whether two offenses are allied offenses of similar  import, we must look beyond the statutory elements and  focus on the defendant's conduct. Flood, 2019-Ohio- 2524, at ¶ 29. The evidence at trial, or during a plea and  sentencing hearing, will determine whether the offenses  are of a similar import. Ruff at ¶ 26. {¶ 22} In the present case, first harm occurred when  appellant  committed  the  felonious  assault  by  shooting [*12]  M.B. in the back as he fled down an  alleyway. This harm would have occurred had appellant  elected not to steal the victim's chain. The second harm,  derived from the aggravated robbery, occurred when  appellant stole M.B.'s chain resulting in the loss of  property. These are two, separate and identifiable  harms that preclude merger under R.C. 2941.25(B). {¶ 23} Likewise, the resulting harms are fundamentally  distinct in their import. The word ""import"" in the context  of allied offenses means "" 'offenses of similar  importance,  consequence  and  signification.'  ""  Thundercloud v. Ross Corr. Inst., S.D.Ohio No. 2:20-cv- 4747, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48869, *21 (Mar. 16,  2021), quoting State v. Baer, 67 Ohio felonious assault and aggravated robbery do not merge  under the third theory, which is the basis for appellant's  argument, we decline to resolve the state's alternative  arguments.  No. 22AP-527 8  St.2d 220, 226 (1981). ""[O]ffenses are not allied  Page 5 of 6 offenses of similar import if they are not alike in their  significance and their resulting harm."" Ruff at ¶ 21.  Here, the harm from the felonious assault was a serious  bodily injury, i.e., a bullet wound to M.B.'s back, while  the harm suffered from the aggravated robbery was the  loss of a gold chain. Due to the disparity in the resulting  harm caused by a bullet wound as compared to [*13]   the loss of property, we cannot find that these offenses  are of a similar import. {¶ 24} Our resolution of the first prong in the Ruff  analysis aligns with numerous Ohio courts that have  found the offenses of felonious assault and aggravated  robbery were dissimilar in import and significance. See,  e.g., State v. Gambino, 11th Dist. No. 2021-T-0018,  2022-Ohio-1554, ¶ 49 (finding the ""grave injuries""  inflicted upon the victim during the felonious assault and  the subsequent harm from the aggregated robbery-the  loss of a wallet, keys, and cellphone after appellant shot  the victim-were separate, identifiable harms); State v.  Gillespie, 12th Dist. No. CA2021-01-004, 2021-Ohio- 3650, ¶ 46-47 (finding merger did not apply to  appellant's aggravated robbery and felonious assault  convictions as the harm from depriving the victim of $18  cash was separate and identifiable from the harm of  repeatedly hitting the victim with a revolver); State v.  Martin, 6th Dist. No. L-19-1133, 2021-Ohio-1615, ¶ 37  (concluding the harm from the felonious assault-  physical injury to the victim caused by several strikes to  his head and body-and the harm from the aggravated  robbery-loss of property-were separate and identifiable);  State v.Shannon, 5th Dist. No. 2020 CA 51, 2021-Ohio- 1396, ¶ 18-19 (concluding the offenses of aiding and  abetting felonious assault and aiding and abetting  aggravated robbery resulted in separate, identifiable  harms); State v. Tellis, 6th Dist. No. WD-19-050, 2020- Ohio-6982, ¶ 80 (finding the harm and injuries  from [*14]  the felonious assault-striking the victim with  a pistol and causing her to hit the concrete floor-prior to  the harm caused by the aggravated robbery-the loss of  her cellphone and $1,200-were separate and identifiable  harms); State v. Evans, 8th Dist. No. 108648, 2020- Ohio-3968, ¶ 123 (finding the offenses offelonious  assault and aggravated robbery were dissimilar in  import, and therefore did not merge, as they caused  separate, identifiable harms); State v. McLaughlin, 5th  Dist. No. CT2017-0104, 2018-Ohio-2333, ¶ 30 (finding  the felonious assault did not merge with the aggravated  robbery, kidnapping, or theft offenses as the harm to the  victim was separate and distinct); State v. Harmon, 2d  Dist. No. 26883, 2017-Ohio-8106, ¶ 65 (concluding the  No. 22AP-527 9  offense of felonious assault-brandishing the firearm and  shooting the victim in the face- prior to the robbery- taking a t-shirt from the victim's bedroom-resulted in  separate and identifiable harms); State v. Knight, 12th  Dist. No. CA2016-02-028, 2016-Ohio-7991, ¶ 19 (finding  merger did not apply to appellant's felonious assault and  aggravated robbery convictions when the harm of  robbing the victim at gunpoint while stealing money from  a vault was separate from the harm of striking the victim  in the head with a gun); State v.Napier, 5th Dist. No.  CT2015-0044, 2016-Ohio-2967, ¶ 32 (finding the  commission of the felonious assault offense-striking the  victim in the mouth knocking out his tooth-prior to the  aggravated robbery offense-using [*15]  a firearm to  take the victim's money-caused separate, identifiable  harms). {¶ 25} Appellant alleges that the ""felonious assault was  incidental to and in furtherance of the aggravated  robbery."" (Appellant's Brief at 9.) Appellant cites the  Eighth District Court of Appeals decision in State v.  Sutton, 8th Dist. No. 102300, 2015-Ohio-4074 as  instructive. Appellant acknowledges that while Sutton  did not find the felonious assault and aggravated  robbery merged, the facts of this case fill in the gaps  that were fatal to the analysis in Sutton. A brief review is  instructive. {¶ 26} In Sutton, the defendant lured the victim to her  home for the alleged purpose to have sex for hire but  with the true intention of robbing him by force. Once the  victim entered the home and undressed in the bedroom,  the defendant's boyfriend entered the room. Upon the  boyfriend entering the bedroom, Swanson reached for  his firearm, which was located in his discarded pants.  An altercation ensued over control of a firearm. Id. at ¶  4. During the altercation, the boyfriend obtained control  of the gun and shot the victim from a distance of ten  feet. Sutton then threw the victim's car keys outside and  left the residence with the boyfriend, who was carrying  the victim's firearm. Id. at ¶ 6. Sutton [*16]  was later  found guilty of, among other offenses, aggravated  robbery and felonious assault. The trial court concluded  that the offenses did not merge as they were not allied  offenses. While the Eighth District Court of Appeals  agreed with the trial court that the felonious assault and  aggravated robbery did not merge as the offenses were  committed with a separate animus, it did find that  because the serious physical harm element in both  counts reference the same gun-related injuries suffered  by the victim, the offenses were of a similar import. Id. at  ¶ 60. Page 6 of 6  No. 22AP-527 10  {¶ 27} Upon review, Sutton is distinct from the instant  case in several ways. In Sutton, the shot occurred after  an altercation over control of the gun. Here, the  feloniousassault and resulting harm, i.e., gunshot  wound, occurred after M.B. attempted to evade  appellant by fleeing down an alleyway. Moreover, unlike  Sutton, the indictment in this case was not specific as to  the serious physical harm element in the aggravated  robbery charge. As such, even under appellant's theory  of the case, the possession or brandishing of the firearm  while taking the chain could just as easily form the basis  for an aggravated robbery conviction as [*17]  utilizing  the serious physical harm element, i.e., the gunshot  wound. Finally, Sutton was charged with setting up the  victim while her boyfriend committed the aggravated  robbery. Here, appellant acted alone in shooting M.B.  before stealing his gold chain. As often is the case when  resolving whether offenses are of a similar import, the  R.C. 2941.25 analysis turns on the particular facts,  ""which can lead to exceedingly fine distinctions."" Bailey,  2022-Ohio-4407, at ¶ 11. Given the differing fact  patterns, as well as the abundance of caselaw that has  found felonious assault and aggravated robbery  offenses resulted in separate, identifiable harms,  appellant's reliance on Sutton is misplaced. {¶ 28} Accordingly, we find that the offenses of felonious  assault and aggravated robbery were dissimilar in their  import and significance. Because appellant has failed to  demonstrate all the elements under the Ruff analysis,  we decline to examine the remaining factors. McKnight,  2022-Ohio-591, at ¶ 35 (""We note again that Ruff  directed that if any one of the three prongs is met, the  counts do not merge.""). {¶ 29} Appellant's sole assignment of error is overruled.",0

Wanninger would come  into B.S.'s bedroom late at night or early in the morning  and touch her genitals over her clothes until he [*2]   ejaculated. Initially, the abuse occurred once a week.  Wanninger also showed B.S. pornography. Once B.S. turned ten years old, Wanninger began  touching her genitals underneath her clothes. Like  before, he would continue doing so until he ejaculated.  B.S.'s siblings were often asleep in the room when the  abuse occurred. The abuse usually occurred twice a  week. When B.S. was between the ages of eleven and thirteen  years old, Wanninger started performing oral sex on  B.S. and encouraged her to perform oral sex on him. He  also began touching her genitals with his penis. This  abuse initially occurred three times a week but  increased in frequency as B.S. aged, eventually  occurring upwards of six times a week. When B.S.  began to menstruate, Wanninger made a sudden  decision to get a vasectomy, to K.L.'s surprise as the  two had discussed having another child together. At  trial, testimony by both K.L. and B.S. established  Wanninger wore a rubber ring around his penis and  testes during sexual acts. This abuse continued until  Page 2 of 3 Wanninger and K.L. split up in 2018. At trial B.S. testified she did not inform her mother or the  authorities about the abuse because she was afraid.  Indeed, Wanninger often [*3]  threatened to take away  ""her freedom"" and access to her phone. B.S. was  unaware of the gravity of the abuse until several years  later. Witness Alex Rosen heard allegations regarding  Wanninger's sexual abuse and contacted B.S. to verify  the allegations. After confirming, in November 2021 he  and two others confronted Wanninger in Wanninger's  home. Rosen recorded his interaction with Wanninger.  Rosen asked Wanninger if he had had oral sex with  B.S. when she was thirteen years old. Wanninger  confessed he had. This was not the only time Wanninger confessed to  abusing B.S. He also confessed the abuse to K.L., his  sister, and Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation  Special Agent Don Schnitker, each on separate  occasions. Even after the abuse stopped, Wanninger sent B.S.  Facebook messages bragging about the abuse. He  referenced ejaculating in B.S.'s mouth and stated, ""If I  disgust you why did you have it in your mouth[?]"" When confronted with this evidence at trial, Wanninger  uniformly denied guilt, citing drug abuse and mental  illness. Wanninger was convicted of four counts of sexual  abuse in the second degree and four counts of sexual  abuse in the third degree. He was sentenced to a period  of [*4]  incarceration not to exceed thirty-five years, with  a seventeen-and-one-half-year mandatory minimum. He  also received a special life sentence pursuant to section  903B.1 and was also placed on the sex offender registry  and made subject to additional restrictions under section  692A.113. Wanninger appeals, claiming his convictions are not  supported by substantial evidence. II. Standard of Review We review sufficiency of the evidence claims for  correction of errors at law. State v. Jones, 967 N.W.2d  336, 339 (Iowa 2021). The jury's verdict binds us if it is  supported by substantial evidence. State v. Mathis, 971  N.W.2d 514, 516 (Iowa 2022). ""Substantial evidence is  evidence sufficient to convince a rational trier of fact the  defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt."" Id. at  516-17. In determining whether substantial evidence  exists to support a verdict, ""we view the evidence in the  light most favorable to the State, including all 'legitimate  inferences and presumptions that that may fairly and  reasonably be deduced from the record evidence.'"" Id.  at 517 (citations omitted). III. Analysis To sustain a conviction for sexual abuse in the second  degree, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable  doubt that (i) Wanninger performed a sex act against  B.S. (ii) while she was under the age of twelve years  old. To sustain a conviction for sexual [*5]  abuse in the  third degree, the State had to prove beyond a  reasonable doubt (i) Wanninger performed a sex act  against B.S. (ii) while she was between the ages of  twelve and fifteen years old. Wanninger argues there is no evidence to corroborate  B.S.'s allegations he sexually abused her. He argues he  cannot be convicted because B.S.: (i) shared a room  with her siblings, so she could not have been abused  because her siblings would have heard; (ii) did not make  the allegations known until age nineteen; and (iii) did not  report the abuse to police, but rather ""some guy."" He  also  argues  B.S.'s  testimony  was  vague  and  contradictory to some of her statements in her  deposition. ""A sexual abuse victim's testimony alone may be  sufficient evidence for conviction."" State v. Donahue,  957 N.W.2d 1, 10-11 (Iowa 2021) (citing State v.  Hildreth, 582 N.W.2d 167, 170 (Iowa 1998); State v.  Knox,  536  N.W.2d  735,  742  (Iowa  1995)).  ""Inconsistencies and lack of detail are common in  sexual abuse cases and do not compel a jury to  conclude the victim is not credible or that there is  insufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict."" Id.  (citing State v. Walker, 935 N.W.2d 874, 881-82 (Iowa  2019); Hildreth, 582 N.W.2d at 170; State v. Rankin,  181 N.W.2d 169, 172 (Iowa 1970)). B.S.'s testimony alone provides sufficient evidence to  support  Wanninger's  convictions.  B.S.  testified  Wanninger touched her genitals over her clothes  starting when she was eight, then progressed to  touching [*6]  her genitals under her clothes, then  progressed to performing oral sex until she was fifteen.  She described how the abuse increased in frequency as  she aged. The State's expert witness testified about how  Page 3 of 3 child sex abuse victims may have difficulty recalling  specifics, such as time and place, especially when there  are multiple instances of abuse. Even if corroboration were required, other evidence  supports  Wanninger's  convictions.  B.S.  knew  Wanninger wore a penis ring when engaging in sexual  activities.  Wanninger  unexpectedly  scheduled  a  vasectomy  once  he  learned  B.S.  had  started  menstruating, despite his and K.L.'s plan to have  another child. K.L. testified she once saw Wanninger  lingering in B.S.'s bedroom doorway in the middle of the  night. Wanninger himself confessed on four separate  occasions to sexually abusing B.S. After reviewing the record, we determine sufficient  evidence supports Wanninger's convictions, irrespective  of Wanninger's contention more weight should have  been given to the defense expert's statements regarding  false confessions given under duress. Wanninger is  asking us to overturn the jury's credibility findings. That  is not our role on a challenge to the sufficiency [*7]  of  the evidence. See, e.g., State v. Lampman, 342 N.W.2d  77, 81 (Iowa Ct. App. 1983) (""The credibility of the  witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony is a  function of the factfinder.""). A reasonable juror could find  Wanninger  committed  these  crimes  beyond  a  reasonable doubt. AFFIRMED.",0
"Subh v. Sec. Guard, Inc., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216817","RENÉE MARIE BUMB, Chief United States District  Judge This matter comes before the Court upon a Motion to  Dismiss filed by Defendants. [Docket No. 14.] For the  reasons expressed herein the Court DENIES in part  and GRANTS in part Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND Plaintiff Majed Subh is a Palestinian man and a  practicing Muslim. [Compl. ¶ 1.] For nearly fifteen years,  he worked as a part-time security guard for Defendants,  which provide private on-site and road patrol security  guard services to several companies and organizations  throughout Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey.  [Id. ¶¶ 2, 6.] In February 2017, Defendants promoted  Plaintiff to a ""Road Patrol"" position. Road Patrol involves  travelling and checking in on security guard officers and  supervisors at various locations or posts. [Id. ¶ 10-11.]  Road Patrol pays more than other security guard  positions. In Plaintiff's prior role as a security guard [*2]   supervisor, he earned $11.00 an hour. On Road Patrol,  he would earn $12.00 an hour or, if he used his own car  for the patrols, $13.00 an hour. [Id. ¶¶ 11, 15.] Plaintiff's supervisor on Road Patrol was Mance Revell.  [Id. ¶ 12.] Shortly following Defendants' promotion of Mr.  Revell to Road Patrol manager in August 2017, Plaintiff  started experiencing problems in the workplace which  he alleges were directly attributable to discriminatory  motivations by Mr. Revell. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges  that Mr. Revell would routinely remove Plaintiff from  Road Patrol and instead assign him to non-Road Patrol  posts where he would earn less money. [Id. ¶ 21.]  Sometimes, Mr. Revell would reduce Plaintiff's hours at  work altogether. [Id.] Even when Plaintiff did perform Road Patrol duties,  Plaintiff had issues with Mr. Revell and Mr. Revell's             Page 2 of 7 assistant manager, Oriel Garcia. Plaintiff alleges that  Mr. Revell would often not pay him the extra $1.00 per  hour he was entitled to for using his own vehicle on  Road Patrol and that, on one occasion, Mr. Revell and  Mr. Garcia did not pay Plaintiff for time Plaintiff spent  getting Defendants' Road Patrol vehicle serviced and  repaired. [Id. ¶¶ 15, 25.] Mr. [*3]  Revell also once  allegedly reduced Plaintiff's Road Patrol pay because  Plaintiff failed to wear his armed duty belt, a charge  Plaintiff disputes. [Id. ¶ 16.] When Plaintiff complained to  Mr. Revell about these pay issues, Mr. Revell would  ""yell[], belittle[] and forcefully demand[]"" Plaintiff to get  out of his office. [Id. ¶ 13.] Plaintiff alleges that the  payment issues would usually get resolved, but only  weeks later in a deliberate effort to cause Plaintiff to  quit. [Id. ¶ 14.] Plaintiff also alleges that Mr. Revell failed to give  Plaintiff enough notice regarding whether Road Patrol  would (or would not) be canceled when there was  inclement weather. [Id. ¶ 17.] Plaintiff would be left  guessing on those days whether Road Patrol was on or  off until the last minute. If Road Patrol was still on  despite the inclement weather, Plaintiff alleges that he  would not have enough notice to arrive to work on time  and would then be subjected to discipline by Mr. Revell.  [Id.] In January 2018, when Plaintiff asked Mr. Revell to  give  him  more  notice  regarding  Road  Patrol  cancelations, Mr. Revell became angry and threatened  to remove Plaintiff from Road Patrol altogether. [Id.] Two  weeks after Plaintiff [*4]  requested more advanced  notice if Road Patrol would be cancelled, Mr. Revell  failed to relieve Plaintiff from his night-time shift, forcing  Plaintiff to work another eight hours. [Id. ¶ 20.] Plaintiff  alleges this was deliberatively punitive. [Id.] The height of Plaintiff's difficult relationship with Mr.  Revell took place on December 14, 2020. While at work,  Mr. Revell told Plaintiff ""I hate Moslems [sic] and middle  eastern people"" and then yelled at Plaintiff to ""go back  to where [he] came from."" [Id. ¶ 26.] Plaintiff was upset  by Mr. Revell's comments and, on February 1, 2021,  made a complaint to Defendants' management that Mr.  Revell and Garcia were unfairly discriminating against  Plaintiff, citing his denials of pay, reduced hours, and  the discriminatory comments. [Id. ¶ 28.] Defendants  offered Plaintiff a work transfer to Imperial Security in  Pennsylvania. [Id. ¶¶ 32-33.] The transfer took two  months to complete, and Plaintiff did not begin work at  Imperial Security until April 2021. [Id. ¶ 33.] Following    the transfer, Plaintiff was demoted to the position of  security guard officer and his new supervisor, Kameron  Shannon, told Plaintiff that Defendants' President, Lisa  Spatafore, [*5]  specifically instructed Mr. Shannon to  not place Plaintiff on Road Patrol. [Id. ¶ 34.] From April 2021 to October 2022 Plaintiff carried out  security guard officer duties for Durham School Buses  (""Durham"") on behalf of Imperial Security. [Id. ¶ 35.]  Plaintiff's work with Durham ended in October 2022  because Defendants' contract with Durham expired and  was not renewed. [Id. ¶ 36.] Plaintiff alleges that his  placement with Durham was intentional, and that  Defendants knew the Durham contract would be ending  and that, after it did, Defendants could terminate Plaintiff  for good. [Id. ¶ 40.] Nonetheless, Plaintiff concedes that  following expiration of the Durham contract, Defendants  offered him a few hours and shifts of work over the next  several months. [Id. ¶¶ 38-39.] Plaintiff did not act on  these offers. [Id.] Plaintiff alleges that Defendants  promised him more permanent work following expiration  of the Durham contract but never placed him on another  permanent assignment. [Id. ¶ 38.] Plaintiff has not  worked for Defendants since the expiration of the  Durham contract in October 2022. [Id. ¶ 39.] II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND Plaintiff filed a timely Charge of Discrimination with the  Equal Employment [*6]  Opportunity Commission and  received a Notice of Right to Sue. [Id. ¶ 5; see also  Defs,' Mtn., Exs. A—B, Docket Nos. 14-3, 14-4.] Having  exhausted his administrative remedies, Plaintiff filed this  lawsuit on March 15, 2023, alleging discrimination and  disparate  treatment,  hostile  work  environment/harassment, and retaliation claims on the  basis of his race, color, religion and national origin  under both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42  U.S.C. §§ 2000e et. seq., and the New Jersey Law  Against Discrimination. (""NJLAD""). Defendants moved  to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  12(b)(6). [Docket No. 14.] Plaintiff opposed. [Docket No.  15.] Defendants did not submit a reply. III. LEGAL STANDARD When considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state  a claim upon which relief can be granted, pursuant to    Page 3 of 7 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a district court  must ""accept as true all allegations in the complaint and  all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom,  and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.""  Evancho v. Fisher, 423 F.3d 347, 351 (3d Cir. 2005). It  is well-settled that a pleading is sufficient if it contains ""a  short and plain statement of the claim showing that the  pleader is entitled to relief."" FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2). ""While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion  to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a  plaintiff's obligation to provide [*7]  the 'grounds' of his  'entitle[ment] to relief' requires more than labels and  conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements  of a cause of action will not do."" Bell Atl. Corp. v.  Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L.  Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (first citing Conley v. Gibson, 355  U.S. 41, 47, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957); then  citing Sanjuan v. Am. Bd. of Psychiatry & Neurology,  Inc., 40 F.3d 247, 251 (7th Cir. 1994); and then citing  Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S. Ct. 2932,  92 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1986)) (alterations in original).  Further, ""to determine the sufficiency of a complaint,""  the Court must follow a three-step process: First, the court must ""tak[e] note of the elements a  plaintiff must plead to state a claim."" Second, the  court should identify allegations that, ""because they  are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to  the assumption of truth."" Third, ""whe[n] there are  well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should  assume their veracity and then determine whether  they plausibly give rise to an entitlement for relief."" Malleus v. George, 641 F.3d 560, 563 (3d Cir. 2011)  (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 664, 675, 679,  129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (alterations in  original)). A district court may ""generally consider only  the allegations contained in the complaint, exhibits  attached to the complaint and matters of public record.""  Schmidt v. Skolas, 770 F.3d 241, 249 (3d Cir. 2014)  (citing Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. White Consol.  Indus., Inc., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993)). A district court, in weighing a motion to dismiss, asks  ""not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether  the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the  claim."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 563 n.8 (quoting Scheuer  v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S. Ct. 1683, 40 L. Ed.  2d 90 (1974)); see also Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 684 (""Our  decision in Twombly expounded the [*8]  pleading  standard for 'all civil actions' . . . .""); Fowler v. UPMC  Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009) (""Iqbal . . .  provides the final nail in the coffin for the 'no set of facts'  standard that applied to federal complaints before  Twombly.""). Thus, ""[a] motion to dismiss should be  granted if the plaintiff is unable to plead 'enough facts to  state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'""  Malleus, 641 F.3d at 563 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at  570). IV. ANALYSIS A. Discrimination and Disparate Treatment Title  VII  and  the  NJLAD  prohibit  employment  discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or  national  origin.  Courts  review  employment  discrimination cases under both Title VII and the NJLAD  using  the  burden-shifting  framework  outlined  in  McDonnell Douglas Corp. v Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.  Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). To state a prima  facie case of employment discrimination, a plaintiff must  show (1) membership in a protected class; (2)  qualification for the position in question; (3) an adverse  employment  action;  and  (4)  that  the  adverse  employment action gives rise to an inference of unlawful  discrimination. Castleberry v. STI Grp., 863 F.3d 259,  263 (3d Cir. 2017). At the motion to dismiss stage, ""a  plaintiff must plead facts that would make his prima  facia case under the McDonnell Douglas framework  plausible."" Caviness v. Aramark Corr. Servs., LLC, 2015  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49421, 2015 WL 1888246, at *2  (D.N.J. Apr. 15, 2015). 1. Adverse Employment Actions Plaintiff alleges that he is a member of a protected  class, [Compl. [*9]  ¶ 1] and was trained, promoted and               Page 4 of 7 qualified to serve on Road Patrol, [Compl. ¶ 10]. He also  properly alleges several adverse employment actions  including (i) improper wage loss, including failing to  compensate Plaintiff for using his own Road Patrol  vehicle, [Compl. ¶ 15]; and (ii) his reduced hours,  demotions, and removals from Road Patrol, [id. ¶¶ 21- 22, 34]. See Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524  U.S. 742, 749, 118 S. Ct. 2257, 141 L. Ed. 2d 633  (1998) (adverse employment action must result in  ""significant change in employment status"" including  ""hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment, or a  decision causing a significant change in benefits,"" such  as reduced hours and wages); see also Moody v. Atl.  City Bd. of Educ., 870 F.3d 206, 217 (3d Cir. 2017). The Court is not convinced, however, that Plaintiff has  properly alleged a termination. Plaintiff concedes that  following the expiration of the Durham contract, he was  offered ""a few hours or a shift"" by Defendants over the  course of the next several months. [Compl. ¶ 38.]  Defendants' offer might have resulted in further reduced  hours and pay for Plaintiff, which would be an adverse  employment action. See Moody, 870 F.3d at 217  (reduction of hours and pay may qualify as an adverse  employment action). But reduced hours and pay are  different from termination. It appears Plaintiff simply  did [*10]  not accept Defendants' offer because he  wanted (and alleges he was promised) more permanent  work from Defendants. 2. Inference of Unlawful Discrimination Defendants also argue that Plaintiff has failed to                     establish the fourth McDonald Douglas prima facie  element that any adverse employment action Plaintiff  has suffered must give rise to an inference of unlawful  discrimination. An inference of unlawful discrimination  can be established in a number of ways including  discriminatory comments by a supervisor with decision- making authority, see Johnson v. City of Philadelphia,  2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82888, 2009 WL 2914364, at *6  (E.D. Pa. Sept. 10, 2009) (citing Sarullo v. U.S. Postal  Serv., 352 F.3d 789, 798 (3d Cir. 2003), or through a  showing of disparate treatment—that is, that similarly  situated employees outside of Plaintiff's protected class  were treated more favorably, Jones v. Sch. Dist. of  Phila., 198 F.3d 403, 410-11 (3d Cir. 1999). Plaintiff's allegations regarding his supervisor's facially  discriminatory comments regarding Muslims and Middle  Easterners are sufficient to establish an inference of  discrimination at this stage. Defendants argue that Mr.  Revell did not have authority to terminate Plaintiff.  [Defs.' Br. at 7.] Maybe so, but that is irrelevant. See  Moody, 870 F.3d at 217 n.14 (fact that individual is  unable to fire or hire employees does not mean that  they are not a supervisor through whom liability may  flow from). As alleged, [*11]  Mr. Revell plainly had  authority to, and did, take adverse actions against  Plaintiff related to his wages, hours, and duties and he  had authority to assign or not assign Plaintiff work.  Properly considered in context with Mr. Revell's  comments directed at Plaintiff regarding his hatred of  Muslims and Middle Easterners, Plaintiff can plausibly  allege  an  inference  of  discrimination  against  Defendants. See Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524  U.S. 775, 790, 118 S. Ct. 2275, 141 L. Ed. 2d 662  (1998) (explaining that ""claims against employers for  discriminatory employment actions with tangible results,  like hiring, firing, promotion, compensation, and work  assignment"" can result in vicarious employer liability  under Title VII). Plaintiff has thus plausibly pleaded the  prima facie McDonnell Douglas elements to state a  claim of discrimination. The Court finds, however, that Plaintiff cannot plausibly  allege disparate treatment discrimination. Plaintiff offers  only conclusory allegations that he was consistently  treated less favorably than employees outside his  protected class. [See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 19, 21-22, 44.]  Such generalized and bare allegations are insufficient to  support a theory of disparate treatment discrimination.  See Doe v. Sizewise Rentals, LLC, 2010 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 124623, 2010 WL 4861138, at *6 (D.N.J. Nov.  22, 2010), aff'd, 530 F. App'x 171 (3d Cir. 2013)  (rejecting  disparate  treatment  discrimination [*12]   Page 5 of 7 theory where allegations amounted to generalized and  conclusory accusations that plaintiffs were treated  differently than similarly situated persons outside their  protected class). Accordingly, the Court will dismiss  Plaintiff's discrimination claim insofar as it is based upon  a disparate treatment theory. B. Retaliation To establish a prima facia retaliation claim under Title  VII or the NJLAD, a plaintiff must show that (1) that he  engaged in protected activity, such as making informal  complaints of discrimination to company management;  (2) the employer took an adverse employment action  against him; and (3) there was a causal connection  between the plaintiff's protected activity and the adverse  employment action taken. See Moore v. City of  Philadelphia, 461 F.3d 331, 339 (3d Cir. 2006), as  amended (Sept. 13, 2006). Defendants do not dispute  that Plaintiff engaged in protected activity in making a  complaint to management about Mr. Revell's conduct.  They argue, instead, that Plaintiff failed to show that he  suffered an adverse employment action because  management transferred Plaintiff to another patrol  where he would not be supervised by Mr. Revell. [Defs.'  Br. at 10.] And even if Plaintiff could show an adverse  employment action, Defendants argue [*13]  that there  was no causal connection between Plaintiff's protected  activity (lodging a complaint against Mr. Revell) and any  adverse action because Plaintiff was ultimately not  terminated; Defendants' contract with Durham simply  ended and, when it did, Defendants offered additional  hour/shifts to Plaintiff which he did not act upon. [Id. at  10-11.] Defendants' characterization of the adverse employment  action is too narrow. Plaintiff sufficiently alleges an  adverse employment action through his transfer and  demotion from Road Patrol following his complaints to  Defendants. [Compl. ¶ 34; see also id. ¶¶ 6-12  (explaining that Plaintiff was hired as a security guard  officer in 2006, promoted to security guard supervisor in  2016 (paying $11.00 per hour), and again promoted to  Road Patrol in 2017 (paying up to $13.00 per hour)).] An  unfavorable transfer and demotion leading to less pay is  an obvious adverse employment action. The harder question—as usual with retaliation claims— is whether Plaintiff can plausibly show that his protected  activity caused the adverse employment action. A  plaintiff can establish a causal inference of retaliatory  discrimination  through  (i)  an  unduly  suggestive  temporal [*14]  proximity between the protected activity  and the adverse action, see Cardenas v. Massey, 269  F.3d 251, 264 (3d Cir. 2001); (ii) evidence of  ""antagonism or retaliatory animus"" towards the plaintiff  in the intervening period between the protected activity  and the adverse employment action, see LeBoon v.  Lancaster Jewish Cmty. Ctr. Ass'n, 503 F.3d 217, 233  (3d Cir. 2007); or (iii) where the ""evidence, looked at as  a whole, may suffice to raise the [causal] inference,"" id.  (quoting Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., 206 F.3d  271, 279-81 (3d Cir. 2000)). The Court finds that Plaintiff can establish a causal  inference of retaliation considering the allegations as a  whole. See Farrell, 206 F.3d at 271. Most relevantly,  Plaintiff alleges that following his transfer, Mr. Shannon,  his new supervisor, told him that the company president  Ms. Spatafore instructed Mr. Shannon ""not [to] place  Plaintiff [on] Road Patrol."" [Compl. ¶ 34.] Plaintiff does  not allege so specifically, but the inference the Court  must draw in his favor on a motion to dismiss is that Ms.  Spatafore instructed Mr. Shannon not to place Plaintiff  on Road Patrol because Plaintiff made complaints to  management.  That  may  ultimately  be  untrue.  Defendants could show that Plaintiff was demoted from  Road Patrol for legitimate reasons unrelated to his  making complaints about Mr. Revell or that there were  no Road Patrol positions which Defendants could  place [*15]  Plaintiff on. But the Court cannot assume so  at this stage of the proceedings. Thus, Plaintiff's  retaliation claims may proceed. C. Hostile Work Environment To establish a hostile work environment claim against  an employer, a plaintiff must show that: (1) the  employee suffered intentional discrimination because of  his or her protected class; (2) the discrimination was               Page 6 of 7 pervasive or severe; (3) the discrimination detrimentally  affected the plaintiff; (4) the discrimination would  detrimentally affect a reasonable person in like  circumstances; and (5) the existence of respondeat  superior liability. Mandel v. M & Q Packaging Corp., 706  F.3d 157, 167 (3d Cir. 2013). Courts evaluate the  ""overall  scenario""  in  deciding  whether  a  work  environment was hostile considering both ""facially  neutral mistreatment and overt ethnic discrimination,  which in sum constitute the hostile work environment.""  Cardenas v. Massey, 269 F.3d 251, 261 (3d Cir. 2001)  (cleaned up). Factors to evaluate include ""the frequency  of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is  physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive  utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with  an employee's work performance.'"" Id. at 167 (quoting  Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S. Ct.  367, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993)). Defendants argue that Plaintiff can point to only one  offensive, but not severe or pervasive, [*16]  comment,  that Mr. Revell ""hat[ed]"" Muslims and Middle Eastern  people. [Defs.' Br. at 9.] Plaintiff responds that the Court  must consider Mr. Revell's facially discriminatory  comments about his protected status—which he argues  was plausibly severe—together with facially neutral  mistreatment by Mr. Revell related to Plaintiff's pay,  shift, and job duties. [Pl.'s Br. at 5.] Viewed as a whole,  Plaintiff argues that the alleged discrimination was  plausibly pervasive. [Id.] Considering the totality of the circumstances, the Court  finds that Plaintiff can state a claim for a hostile work  environment at this stage. As alleged, Mr. Revell's  comments that he ""hates [Muslims] and Middle Eastern  people"" and that Plaintiff should ""go back to where he  came from"" (presumably, Palestine or the Middle East)  were sufficiently severe to state a claim for a hostile  work environment. The comments reflect ""disgust for an  employee based on a protected status"" which is  sufficiently severe to alter the conditions of employment  and create an abusive working environment. See  Durand v. FedEx, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3066, 2015 WL  140215, at *8 (D.N.J. Jan. 12, 2015). Durand involved  similar comments. In that case, the court denied  reconsideration from a denial of summary judgment and  held that a supervisor's [*17]  isolated comments to the  plaintiff, a Peruvian man, that she ""hates Peruvians, all  Peruvians"" and that all Peruvians are comemierda— ""shitheads""—were ""sufficiently severe or pervasive to  alter the conditions of the plaintiff's employment and  create an abusive working environment."" Id. So too  here. Mr. Revell's alleged comments, even alone, are  plausibly severe to allege a hostile work environment at  the motion to dismiss stage. Mr. Revell's facially discriminatory comments must also  be set within the context of his facially neutral conduct  against Plaintiff over the course of three years. That  conduct includes allegedly (i) arbitrarily reducing  Plaintiff's pay, [Compl. ¶ 15-16]; (ii) reducing Plaintiff's  hours on Road Patrol, [id. ¶ 22]; (iii) demoting Plaintiff  from Road Patrol on occasion, [id. ¶ 21]; (iv) threatening  to remove Plaintiff from Road Patrol altogether [id. ¶ 17];  (v) lowering Plaintiff's pay based on allegedly false  assertions that Plaintiff failed to wear proper equipment,  [id. ¶ 16]. Taken together, Plaintiff can plausibly allege  that Defendants also created a pervasively hostile work  environment.",0
"Tawakkol v. Vasquez, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 32247","H, Circuit Judge: The petition for rehearing is denied. We substitute this  opinion for our prior opinion. Sammy Tawakkol sued two Texas state officials,  asserting that they violated his right to procedural due  process when they notified him that he was required to  register as a sex offender under Texas law. After [*2]  a  bench trial, the district court entered judgment in  Tawakkol's favor. Because we conclude that Tawakkol's  suit is barred by sovereign immunity, we VACATE and  REMAND with instructions to dismiss for lack of  jurisdiction. I. Background This case implicates both the federal and Texas sex  offender registration systems, so we begin with a brief  overview of each. At the federal level, the Sex Offender  Registry and Notification Act (""SORNA"") sets out a  ""comprehensive national system"" for sex offender  registration. 34 U.S.C. § 20901. SORNA requires any  individual convicted of a qualifying ""sex offense"" to  register as a ""sex offender."" Id. §§ 20913(a), 20914.  Qualifying ""sex offenses"" include, inter alia, certain  ""military offense[s] specified by the [United States]  Secretary of Defense."" Id. § 20911(5)(A)(iv). Although SORNA applies only at the federal level,  Congress grants federal funds to state jurisdictions that  agree to maintain their own parallel sex-offender  registration and community-notification laws. See id. §§  20912(a), 20927. Relevant here is Texas's SORNA- compliant sex offender registration system, Texas Code  Page 2 of 4 of Criminal Procedure article 62. Under that system, an  individual must register as an ""extrajurisdictional""  registrant in Texas if he would be ""required to register  as a sex offender [*3]  under . . . federal law or the  Uniform Code of Military Justice."" T.CC. P. art. 62.001(10)(A)(ii). We turn now to the facts of this case, which are  straightforward and undisputed. When he was a cadet  at the United States Air Force Academy, Tawakkol was  caught sneaking into women's restrooms and recording  videos of female cadets while they were using the toilet.  Tawakkol pleaded guilty to violating Article 120c(a)(2) of  the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Secretary of  Defense has designated Article 120c(a)(2) as a  SORNA-qualifying ""sex offense."" So, as a result of this  conviction, Tawakkol was required to register as a sex  offender under SORNA. Tawakkol later disenrolled from the Academy and  moved to Houston, Texas. Once there, state officials  determined that Tawakkol would be required to register  as a sex offender under Texas's system as well. They  concluded that Tawakkol's status as a ""sex offender""  under federal law rendered him an extrajurisdictional  sex offender under state law—in other words, his duty to  register in Texas hinged solely on his duty to register  under SORNA. When  state  officials  notified  Tawakkol  of  their  determination, Tawakkol filed this suit against two Texas  Department of Public Safety employees (the ""State  Defendants"") under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988. In his  complaint, Tawakkol asserted [*4]  that he had not  committed a registrable sex offense—therefore, he  alleged  that  the  State  Defendants'  registration  determination violated his procedural due process rights  under the Fourteenth Amendment. After a bench trial, the district court issued findings of  fact and conclusions of law determining that Tawakkol  was entitled to injunctive relief. Rather than address the  procedural due process arguments as pleaded in  Tawakkol's complaint, the district court's conclusions  instead hinged on its interpretation of federal law. The  district court first analyzed the language of Congress's  delegation of authority to the Secretary of Defense to  designate certain crimes as SORNA-qualifying ""sex      offenses."" It then concluded that the Secretary of  Defense had exceeded the scope of that authority in  designating Article 120c(a)(2) as a ""sex offense."" The  court thus reasoned that Tawakkol had no duty to  register  under  federal  law—therefore  the  State  Defendants lacked any basis to classify him as an  extrajurisdictional offender under state law. Based on these conclusions, the district court issued a  final judgment (1) declaring that Tawakkol was ""not  required to register as a sex offender under federal or  military law,"" and, accordingly, [*5]  (2) permanently  enjoining the State Defendants from requiring Tawakkol  to register in Texas. The State Defendants appealed,  and Tawakkol cross-appealed. II. Discussion Tawakkol invoked federal question jurisdiction under 28  U.S.C. § 1331 and jurisdiction over the claims for  declaratory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. §§  2201 and 1343(a), respectively. On appeal, however,  the State Defendants contend that the district court  lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Tawakkol's  claims are barred by sovereign immunity. Accordingly,  our analysis begins and ends with that threshold issue. We examine jurisdictional issues, such as sovereign  immunity, de novo. City of Austin v. Paxton, 943 F.3d  993, 997 (5th Cir. 2019). Sovereign immunity under the  Eleventh Amendment precludes suits by private citizens  against states in federal court. Id. This bar extends not  only to the state itself, but also to claims against ""state  officials"" in their official capacity when the state is the  real party in interest. Id. Here, Tawakkol is suing state  officials who have not waived sovereign immunity.  Accordingly, his claims are barred in federal court  unless an exception to sovereign immunity applies.              Page 3 of 4 Tawakkol asks the court to apply the exception to  sovereign immunity carved out by the Supreme Court in  Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed.  714 (1908). [*6]  This exception permits a plaintiff to  seek an injunction ""in federal court [to] prevent[] state  executive officials from enforcing state laws that are  contrary to federal law."" Whole Woman's Health v.  Jackson, 595 U.S. 30, 142 S. Ct. 522, 532, 211 L. Ed.  2d 316 (2021) (citing Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. at 159- 60). In Green Valley, we made clear that ""[f]or Young to  apply, three criteria must be satisfied: (1) A plaintiff must  name individual state officials as defendants in their  official capacities; (2) the plaintiff must allege an  ongoing violation of federal law; and (3) the relief sought  must be properly characterized as prospective."" 969  F.3d at 471 (alterations accepted) (internal citations and  quotation marks omitted). Tawakkol argues that his suit  satisfies these requirements because he is seeking  injunctive and declaratory relief against the individuals  tasked with enforcing Texas's sex offender registration  requirements. Before we address the merits of Tawakkol's argument,  we begin by explaining Ex parte Young's legal  foundations. Ex parte Young is an exception to  sovereign immunity that comes into play when private  litigants seek to prevent state officials from enforcing an  unconstitutional state law. See 209 U.S. at 159-68. It is  rooted in the legal fiction that, in such circumstances,  the defendant-official is ""stripped of his official or  representative [*7]  character and is subjected in his  person to the consequences of his individual conduct.""  Id. at 160; see also Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of  Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 272-73, 117 S. Ct. 2028, 138 L.  Ed. 2d 438 (1997) (citing Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. at  159-60). In other words, the official ""is 'not the State for  sovereign-immunity purposes' when 'a federal court  commands [him or her] to do nothing more than refrain  from violating federal law.'"" Williams ex rel. J.E. v.  Reeves, 954 F.3d 729, 736 (5th Cir. 2020) (alteration in  original) (quoting Va. Off. for Prot. & Advoc. v. Stewart,  563 U.S. 247, 255, 131 S. Ct. 1632, 179 L. Ed. 2d 675  (2011)). This fiction, the Supreme Court has said, is  ""necessary to permit the federal courts to vindicate  federal rights and hold state officials responsible to 'the  supreme authority of the United States.'"" Pennhurst  State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 105, 104  S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1984) (quoting Ex parte  Young, 209 U.S. at 160); see also Green v. Mansour,  474 U.S. 64, 68, 106 S. Ct. 423, 88 L. Ed. 2d 371  (1985). But the Supreme Court has also instructed that  the exception must be ""narrowly construed"" to serve  only that original purpose. See, e.g., Pennhurst, 465  U.S. at 114 n.25 (observing that ""it is a very narrow  exception that will allow suit only under the[se]  standards""); Va. Off. for Prot. & Advoc., 563 U.S. at 255  (noting that ""[t]he doctrine is limited to that precise  situation""); Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 277, 106 S.  Ct. 2932, 92 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1986) (stating that the  exception is ""tailored to conform as precisely as  possible to those specific situations""). Accordingly, the  Court has repeatedly declined to interpret the exception  ""expansive[ly]."" See, e.g., Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 106  (declining to extend where violation was based on state  law); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 678, 94 S. Ct.  1347, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1974) (declining to extend  where plaintiff sought retroactive [*8]  relief); Green, 474  U.S. at 71 (declining to extend where the federal law  violation was no longer ""ongoing""). Ex parte Young's foundations and the Supreme Court's  subsequent precedent lead us to conclude that it is  inapplicable in this case—the relief requested (1) falls  outside the exception's narrow confines, (2) does not  serve the purpose of the exception, and (3) is  unsupported by any caselaw. To start, unlike Ex parte  Young, the injunctive relief that the district court ordered  did not enjoin the State Defendants from enforcing a  state law that violated federal law. To be sure, the  district court ultimately did conclude that the State  Defendants could not require Tawakkol to register as a  sex offender under Texas law—but that conclusion was  not based on a determination that the state registration  system  was  unconstitutional.  Rather,  recall  that  Tawakkol was only required to register under Texas law  because he was required to register under a federal law,  SORNA. Accordingly, the relief issued by the district  court (1) invalidated only federal law and (2) prohibited  the State Defendants from enforcing a state law merely  because it was consistent with that federal law. Such  novel  relief  falls  squarely  outside  the  narrow  parameters [*9]  articulated by Ex parte Young and its  progeny. See, e.g., 209 U.S. at 159-68; Pennhurst, 465  U.S. at 114 n.25; Va. Off. for Prot. & Advoc., 563 U.S. at  255. What's more, applying the exception to Tawakkol's suit          Page 4 of 4 would not serve Ex parte Young's purpose. Because the  district court's order invalidated a federal statute— instead of affirming it—invoking the exception here  would not advance Ex parte Young's aim of ""promot[ing]  the vindication of federal rights."" Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at  105. Rather, applying the exception here would ""stretch  [Ex parte Young] too far"" and ""upset the balance of  federal and state interests that [the exception]  embodies."" Papasan, 478 U.S. at 277. Tawakkol contends that he has met our standard  addressed in Green Valley Special Utility District v. City  of Schertz, 969 F.3d 460 (5th Cir. 2020) (en banc). As  stated above, we held in Green Valley that ""[f]or Young  to apply, three criteria must be satisfied: (1) A plaintiff  must name individual state officials as defendants in  their official capacities; (2) the plaintiff must allege an  ongoing violation of federal law; and (3) the relief sought  must be properly characterized as prospective."" 969  F.3d at 471 (internal citations and quotation marks  omitted) (alterations accepted). But Green Valley did not  purport to expand Ex parte Young's narrow parameters  to cover the claims at issue here. Green Valley turned  on whether the plaintiff satisfied Ex parte Young's  requirement that the relief sought must be prospective— an issue that we need not [*10]  reach here—and  concluded that the plaintiff satisfied that requirement for  at least one, but not all, forms of relief that it sought. Id.  at 473. Our analysis does not deviate from Green  Valley, which makes clear that our analysis is correct by  echoing the Supreme Court's statement that ""we look to  the substance rather than to the form of the relief sought  and will be guided by the policies underlying . . .  Young."" Green Valley, 969 F.3d at 471 (quoting  Papasan, 478 U.S. at 279). Green Valley involved an  attack on state law, not federal law. While Tawakkol  contends he meets these standards, the reality is quite  the opposite: the state is not performing an ongoing  violation of federal law, instead, he is contesting that  federal law, as applied by the Secretary of Defense, is  itself incorrect. That is the whole point we are making  here: Ex parte Young is not about stopping states from  following federal law and determinations of same by         federal officers. Indeed, it is telling that Tawakkol fails to direct us to any  authority—from this court or elsewhere—applying Ex  parte Young in a similar way. Given the Supreme  Court's repeated insistence on the exception's narrow  application and admonishments against broadening its  reach, [*11]  we decline to extend Ex parte Young here.  Accordingly, in the absence of any other applicable  exception, we conclude that sovereign immunity bars  Tawakkol's claims against the State Defendants.",0
"United States v. Adams, 578 F. Supp. 3d 692","[*692]  MEMORANDUM Defendant John Adams stands charged with sex trafficking of minors in violation of the Trafficking Victims  Protection Act (TVPA), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591 et seq., He moves to dismiss two counts brought under the TVPA  pursuant to a theory that the application of the TVPA to local prostitution is beyond the scope of the statute.             Page 2 of 6  [*693]  Defendant thus moves under Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(B)(v) for failure to state an offense. Although I am  sensitive to Defendant's arguments that federal criminal statutes should be interpreted narrowly and with an eye to  the constitutional structure of federalism, an analysis of both the TVPA's language and its legislative history lead me  to conclude that Congress intended for the TVPA to be applicable to the conduct alleged here. Defendant's motion  will therefore be denied. I. Legal Standard ""An indictment fails to state an offense if the specific facts alleged in it fall beyond the scope of the relevant criminal  statute, as a [**2]  matter of statutory interpretation."" U.S. v. Vitillo, 490 F.3d 314, 321 (3d Cir. 2007), as amended  (Aug. 10, 2007) (cleaned up). II. Discussion At the outset, I note that Defendant does not bring this challenge under the Commerce Clause to suggest that the  TVPA as applied represents an unconstitutional overreach of Congress's powers to regulate interstate commerce.  Instead, Defendant relies upon Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Bond, 572 U.S. 844, 134 S. Ct. 2077,  189 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2014), arguing that the TVPA should not apply to purely in-state conduct as a matter of criminal  statutory interpretation, when viewed through the lens of federalism. In Bond, the Supreme Court held that a federal  statute passed to control the production, distribution, and use of chemical weapons could not be used to prosecute  a local assault using chemical agents to give the victim a rash. Id. at 866. Although under a plain reading of the  statutory language the conduct appeared to meet the elements of the crime, the Supreme Court found that such an  interpretation ""would dramatically intrude upon traditional state criminal jurisdiction, and we avoid reading statutes  to have such reach in the absence of a clear indication that they do."" Id. at 856-57. The dispositive question here  then is whether the TVPA contains a clear indication that Congress meant it to be [**3]  applied to local conduct that  intrudes upon ""areas of traditional state responsibility."" Id. at 858. Given its language, the statute on its face would appear to apply applies to the conduct charged in Counts I and II  of the indictment. Counts I and II set forth allegations with respect to two minor individuals who Defendant allegedly  recruited, enticed, harbored and maintained so as to cause them to engage in commercial sex acts, while knowing  or in reckless disregard of their minor status. 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1) imposes criminal liability upon anyone who  ""knowingly in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of  the United States, recruits. entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains, advertises, maintains, patronizes, or   [*694]  solicits by any means a person ... knowing, or ... in reckless disregard of the fact ... that the person has not  attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act."" The statute does not make  international trafficking an element of the crime. Instead, it applies to any conduct ""in or affecting interstate or  foreign commerce."" Numerous courts have held that this is a constitutionally valid application [**4]  of the statute  under the Commerce Clause. See, e.g., United States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir. 2007) (""Congress  found that trafficking of persons has an aggregate economic impact on interstate and foreign commerce . . . and we  cannot say that this finding is irrational.""); U.S. v. Walls, 784 F.3d 543, 548-49 (9th Cir. 2015); see also United  States v. Victor Clayton, Cr. No. 18-254, ECF 154, at 1 n.1 (Nov. 9, 2021) (Surrick, J.) (""Every court that has          578 F. Supp. 3d 692, *692; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2532, **1 Page 3 of 6 considered whether the TVPA and specifically whether § 1591's prohibition of interstate (as opposed to  international) trafficking is a valid exercise of Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause, has concluded that  it is.""). Ultimately, Defendant's motion does not challenge application of the plain language of the statute to Defendant's  alleged conduct, or the power of Congress to regulate such conduct, both of which are clearly established. Rather,  under Bond, Defendant argues that regardless of its wording the statute should be construed to exclude purely local  prostitution offenses in light of the states' traditional police power over such offenses. Defendant argues that ""[t]he facts presented by the government in the instant case—which (if true) make out a  wholly-local prostitution offense—do not establish the type of conduct Congress intended to target in enacting [**5]   18 U.S.C. § 1591."" Def. Br. at 2. To support his argument, Defendant draws upon a common sense understanding  of the word ""trafficking"" to emphasize the movement of persons across borders by deceptive or coercive means to  effectively enslave victims to perform sexual acts or uncompensated labor. In particular, based upon the legislative  history of the TVPA, Defendant argues that this movement across borders in the international context was the  principal problem Congress sought to address. The defense cites extensively from the ""Purposes and Findings""  section of the TVPA, which includes, among other things, references to the ""international sex trade,"" 22 U.S.C. §  7101(b)(2), a ""growing transnational crime,"" § 7101(b)(3), the transportation of victims ""from their home  communities to unfamiliar destinations, including foreign countries ... ,"" § 7101(b)(5), ""organized criminal enterprises  worldwide,"" § 7101(b)(8), that ""[t]rafficking in persons is a transnational crime,"" § 7101(b)(24), and numerous  references to the victims of trafficking often being immigrants illegally brought to the country where they are  exploited, §§ 7101(b)(5), (17), (20). Defendant then points to statements in the legislative record by the law's original co-sponsors, Senators Brownback  and Wellstone. Sen. Brownback, for [**6]  instance, defines ""trafficking"" as ""the coercive transportation of persons  into slavery-like conditions, primarily involving forced prostitution."" 146 Cong. Rec. S10,167 (Oct. 11, 2000). Sen.  Wellstone similarly details a number of examples of women and girls from foreign countries brought to the United  States, whether by coercion or deceit, and subjected to a life of prostitution or forced labor, without any  consequences for the perpetrators of the trafficking. Id. at S10,167-68. Finally, Defendant argues that one attempt  to reauthorize the TVPA in 2007, which would have included the express federalization of crimes involving  pandering, pimping, and prostitution failed ""because it represented unwarranted federalization [*695]  of state  crimes,"" citing objections made by various entities opposed to those aspects of the bill. Def. Br. at 4. Defendant's reference to the legislative record around the original bill carries some weight. After reviewing the  record of the original passage of the TVPA myself, I agree that there were myriad references to trafficking across  international borders, but none to domestic or purely local conduct. The House Judiciary's report on the bill,  interestingly, viewed [**7]  its jurisdiction over the bill as limited to the immigration provisions and the criminal  penalty provisions. H.R. Rep. 106-487, pt. II, at 17 (Apr. 13, 2000). The international focus of the law is further  reflected in the original Act's structure, where eight out of thirteen sections were expressly focused on combatting  international trafficking. 114 Stat. 1464, Pub. L. 106-386, §§ 104-111 (Oct. 28, 2000). And were Mr. Adams to have  been accused of a prostitution offense that did not involve coercion or a minor, his citation to Section 221 of H.R.  3887, which was an earlier draft of the eventual reauthorization act of 2008, and included a provision that made it a  federal crime to ""persuade[], induce[], or entice[] any individual to engage in prostitution,"" would be strong evidence  that Congress did not intend to regulate his conduct and instead desired to leave such regulation for the states. But Mr. Adams is accused of trafficking related to a victim under the age of 18 which Congress has clearly indicated  it views as a more severe crime than prostitution generally and which it has found is under-prosecuted by the  states. A fuller view of both the congressional record and the statute itself shows this. Notably, the statute expressly  defines [**8]  ""severe forms of trafficking in persons"" as ""sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act ... in which  the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age."" § 7102(11)(A). In light of this definition,  the TVPA's ""Purposes and Findings"" section includes provisions reflecting Congress's intent to regulate certain  severe forms of sex trafficking that it understood to be inadequately punished by states. Most notably, Congress  found that ""[e]xisting legislation and law enforcement in the United States and other countries are inadequate to  deter trafficking and bring traffickers to justice, failing to reflect the gravity of the offenses involved."" § 7101(b)(14).  578 F. Supp. 3d 692, *694; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2532, **4 Page 4 of 6 Congress further lamented that ""even the most brutal instances of trafficking the sex industry are often punished  under laws that also apply to lesser offenses, so that traffickers typically escape deserved punishment."" §  7101(b)(14). Looking more deeply, the legislative history of the TVPA's reauthorizations and amendments clearly reflects an  understanding by Congress that the law and its penalties should apply against local violations that do not involve  international components. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005, in [**9]  particular,  reflects an intent that the TVPA have domestic application to minor victims who are enticed into the commercial sex  trade. Sen. Leahy, who took over co-sponsorship of the legislation with the passing of Sen. Wellstone, spoke to the  very factual situation at issue here when introducing the reauthorization act in the Senate: I am especially pleased that this reauthorization package has been improved significantly. For the first time, the  bill focuses not only on the important goal of preventing international human trafficking, but also on preventing  the human trafficking that occurs within our own borders. Children here in the United States are at tremendous  risk, especially those who are homeless or runaways, and they are particularly susceptible to being  domestically trafficked for purposes of commercial sexual exploitation.  [*696]  I will not rest until this alarming  trend is stopped. 151 Cong. Rec. S14,417. Sen. Leahy's focus on the risk that domestically based children who are homeless or  runaways may be susceptible to trafficking falls squarely within the facts alleged in this case. Over the course of the next decade and a half, Congress reauthorized or otherwise amended the provisions [**10]   of the TVPA several times. On many occasions, these amendments were made to § 1591 itself or § 1591 was  cross-referenced in related provisions of the code. At no point did Congress manifest an intent to limit the  application of § 1591, which on its face applies to any minor trafficked into commercial sex acts. Perhaps the  clearest indication of Congress's intent to apply the TVPA to domestic minors for local offenses can be found in the  Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, Pub. L. 114-22, 129 Stat. 227 (May 29, 2015). There, Congress  amended § 1591 to add the words ""solicits or patronizes"" to the list of prohibited conduct in order to clarify that both  purveyors and purchasers of sex from minors were liable under the TVPA. § 109(4). In doing so, Congress explicitly  endorsed the Eighth Circuit's decision in United States vs. Jungers, 702 F.3d 1066 (8th Cir. 2013), for its  interpretation of ""obtain"" as applying to purchasers of sex from minors. § 109(3). Jungers involved entirely local  child sex trafficking where state and federal officers conducting a sting operation in South Dakota ""pretended to be  a man offering his girlfriend's underage daughters for sex while his girlfriend was out of town."" Jungers, 702 F.3d at  1067. Although domestic applicability was not at issue in Jungers, Congress's ratification of that opinion reinforces  its implied understanding—without need to further clarify—that [**11]  § 1591 broadly applies to local sex trafficking  of minors. More recently, Congress ordered  [*697]  the Attorney General to issue guidance to all DOJ offices                  578 F. Supp. 3d 692, *695; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2532, **8 Page 5 of 6 ""emphasizing that an individual who knowingly solicits or patronizes a commercial sex act from a person who was a  minor (consistent with [18 U.S.C. § 1591(c)]) ... is guilty of an offense under chapter 77 of title 18, United States  Code, and is a party to a severe form of trafficking in persons, as that term is defined in [the TVPA at 22 U.S.C. §  7102(9)])."" Abolish Human Trafficking Act of 2017, Pub. L. 115-392, 132 Stat 5250. This again reaffirmed  Congress's broad interpretation of the statutory language to apply to all sex trafficking of minors and not just that  involving international transportation. Federal courts that have considered arguments against the application of the TVPA to purely local conduct have  similarly found that Congress provided sufficiently clear indication under the Bond standard that it intended the  TVPA to apply to conduct traditionally regulated by the state. Notably in U.S. v. Walls, the Ninth Circuit held, solely  on the basis of the ""Purpose and Findings"" section of the TVPA, §§ 7101(b)(12) and 7101(b)(14), that Congress  indicated an interest in regulating purely local conduct that fell within the definition of § 1591. 784 F.3d 543, 546-47  (9th Cir. 2015). In U.S. v. Callahan, the Sixth Circuit [**12]  addressed Bond in analyzing § 1589, which prohibits  forced labor under the TVPA. It held that the TVPA's implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment made forced  labor a special matter of federal concern that reduced any need for the court to consider traditional state policing  prerogatives. 801 F.3d 606, 619-20 (6th Cir. 2015); see also U.S. v. McMillian, 777 F.3d 444 (7th Cir. 2015)  (Posner, J.) (summarily dismissing a challenge to § 1591 as applied to purely local conduct under Bond because  ""there is no basis for so limited an interpretation""). I see no reason to reach a different conclusion. Following a wider view of the legislative history, consideration of the language of the TVPA itself, and existing  precedent, I am persuaded that § 1591 was intended by Congress to intrude upon traditional state policing  prerogatives related to prostitution in order to more robustly prosecute crimes of coercion and exploitation of  minors. Congress did so pursuant to its powers under the Commerce Clause and the Thirteenth Amendment in  order to realize the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition on slavery. Counts I and II of government's indictment  therefore charge offenses for which Defendant may be prosecuted. Defendant's motion to strike those counts of the  indictment will be denied. An appropriate order follows. /s/ Gerald Austin McHugh United States District Judge ORDER This 6th [**13]  of January 2022, upon consideration of Defendant John Adams's Motion to Dismiss Counts I and II  of the Indictment, it is hereby ORDERED that Defendant's motion is DENIED. /s/ Gerald Austin McHugh United States District Judge              578 F.

"United States v. Bell, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74783","OPINION & ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT  DARRICK BELL'S MOTION IN LIMINE TO ALLOW  EVIDENCE OF GOVERNMENT WITNESSES'  PARTICIPATION IN COMMERCIAL SEX WORK WITH  INDIVIDUALS NOT NAMED IN THE FIRST  SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT (Dkt. 825) Defendants Darrick Dernard Bell and Harold Lashawn  Nero are [*2]  currently on trial for crimes relating to their  alleged roles in sex and drug trafficking conspiracies at  the Victory Inn in Detroit, Michigan. This matter is before  the Court on Bell's motion in limine to allow evidence of  the Government's witnesses' participation in commercial  sex work with individuals who are not named in the first  superseding indictment (Dkt. 825). The Government  filed a response (Dkt. 838), and Bell filed a reply (Dkt.  839). As explained below, Bell's motion calls only for  relief that is derivative of the Court's earlier opinion  addressing the same subject. It is granted as set forth  below. I. BACKGROUND For criminal proceedings involving ""alleged sexual  misconduct,"" like prosecutions of sex trafficking, Federal  Rule of Evidence 412 establishes a general prohibition  against the admission of evidence offered to prove (i)  ""that a victim engaged in other sexual behavior"" or (ii) ""a  victim's sexual predisposition."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(a).  There are limited exceptions to this prohibition. See  Fed. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(A)-(C). In accordance with Rule 412(c)(1), Bell previously  moved the Court to cross-examine the alleged sex  trafficking victims about their participation in other  commercial sex work activities. 3/24/20 Mot. (Dkt. 419).  In his March 2020 motion, Bell [*3]  stated that, based  on his own team's investigation as well as the discovery                  Page 2 of 4 that the Government had provided at that point, ""[t]here  is a strong likelihood that evidence exists that at least  some of these witnesses were employed with other  potential sex traffickers prior to, during the conspiracy,  and after the conspiracy."" (Id. at 5. As for cross- examination of witnesses regarding their commercial  sex activities during the conspiracy, Bell represented  that ""the gist of this cross examination will revolve  around issues pertaining to the witnesses engaging in  prostitution activities with souteneurs who are not . . .  Bell during the time of the alleged conspiracy."" (Id. at 3.  According to Bell, ""[t]his evidence would directly counter  claims that these witnesses had worked with or for . . .  Bell during the conspiracy."" (Id. This evidence would  also give the alleged victims a motive to ""make[] a claim  against . . . Bell with the purpose to protect their actual  souteneur."" 5/18/20 Reply at 3 (Dkt. 468). The  Government opposed Bell's motion (Dkt. 458). The Court determined that ""while evidence regarding  the victims' pre-and post-indictment prostitution is  inadmissible, Bell is permitted to [*4]  question the  victims regarding the extent of their involvement in the  prostitution that is the subject of the indictment."" 5/26/21  Op. at 9 (Dkt. 630) (citing United States v. Haines, 918  F.3d 694, 698 (9th Cir. 2019)). ""Additionally, Bell may  impeach the victims through other permissible means,  such as by questioning the victims about 'their prior drug  use, their possible bias against [Bell], whether they  consented to prostitute for [Bell] during the timeframe  alleged in the indictment, and whether they were  coerced into prostitution or motivated by money.'"" (Id.  (quoting United States v. Lockhart, 844 F.3d 501, 510  (5th Cir. 2016)). Regarding impeachment, the Court  rejected Bell's theory that ""a victim's prior association  with another pimp will demonstrate that she is shielding  that pimp from prosecution by falsely accusing Bell"" as  an ""untenable stretch of logic."" (Id. at 9 (referencing  United States v. Jackson, 627 F. App'x 460, 464 (6th  Cir. 2015)). In his present motion, Bell asks the Court to ""allow the  defense to cross-examine the Government's witnesses  on the issues of whether the complaining witnesses  were actively involved in commercial sex work with  other individuals,"" i.e., individuals other than Bell and his  Co-Defendants  (namely,  the  alleged  victims'  boyfriends), ""during the time periods involved in the  alleged sex trafficking conspiracy."" Mot. [*5]  at 1  (emphasis added). Bell also appears to ask the Court to  permit defense counsel to question one alleged victim,  S.F., about her purported motives to blame Bell: (i) to  protect D.M., her true trafficker, and (ii) because D.M.  was S.F.'s alleged boyfriend and father of her child, and  he ""had issues with Bell"" (the two ""did not like each  other""). (Id. at 4. II. ANALYSIS As a threshold matter, the Government puts forth the  following two theories as to why Bell's motion should be  denied as untimely. First, Bell's motion is really a motion  for reconsideration of the Court's May 26, 2021 opinion.  Resp. at 2. Motions for reconsideration of an opinion  must be filed within 14 days of the opinion. E.D. Mich.  LR 7.1(h). Because Bell filed the motion nearly 11  months after the May 26, 2021 opinion, it is an untimely  motion for reconsideration. Resp. at 2. Second, even if  the motion is not treated as one for reconsideration,  Defendants' motions deadline has long passed, and Bell  has not made the requisite ""good cause"" showing to  consider untimely motions. (Id.; see also Fed. R. Crim.  P. 12(c)(3) (explaining that a court may consider an  untimely motion only if the movant establishes ""good  cause"" for the untimeliness). Bell appears to argue [*6]  that his delay is justified  because he was unaware of evidence suggesting that  the alleged victims of the Victory Inn operation were  trafficked  by  their  own  boyfriends  during  the  conspiracy—rather than Bell or his Co-Defendants— until law enforcement agents testified at trial, and ""it  became clear that these drug dealer boyfriends were  well known to the agents investigating the case."" Mot. at  2. But this argument is belied by Bell's own admission  that he had in his possession before trial discovery  reflecting that a boyfriend of one of the alleged victims  ""was running some sort of commercial sex worker  operation at the Victory Inn"" during the conspiracy. (Id.  at 2-3; see also Reply at 1-2 (arguing that Bell did not  have all Jencks Act material when he filed his March  2020 motion, but acknowledging that he received this  material before trial). Bell's argument is also undercut by  his statement in his March 2020 motion that, based on  his team's investigation and discovery produced by the  Government, he believed there was a ""strong likelihood  that evidence exists that at least some of these  witnesses were employed with other potential sex  traffickers . . . during the conspiracy . . . ."" 3/24/20  Mot. [*7]  at 5.    2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74783, *3 Page 3 of 4 However, the Government's timeliness argument is  misplaced, given that Bell is seeking permission to ask  questions  that  the  Court  has  already  deemed  permissible. Specifically, Bell is seeking a subset of the  relief that he previously sought in March 2020— permission to ""introduce evidence of sex work activities  that took place during the conspiracy."" Mot. at 5  (emphasis added). The Court previously held that ""Bell  is permitted to question the victims regarding the extent  of their involvement in the prostitution that is the subject  of the indictment."" 5/26/21 Op. at 9 (citing Haines, 918  F.3d at 698). Such questions clearly include questions  about whether someone other than Bell committed the  charged sex trafficking crime—i.e., whether someone  like D.M. trafficked the alleged victims at the Victory Inn  during the conspiracy. Just as the Court's May 26, 2021 opinion did, the case  law draws a line between (i) pre-and post-indictment  commercial sex activities and (ii) sex trafficking that is  the subject of the prosecution. See, e.g., Haines, 918  F.3d at 698 (excluding evidence of pre-and post- indictment prostitution but allowing defendant ""to  explore whether the Victims engaged in the prostitution  activities at issue in this case [*8]  . . . with[out] his  assistance"") (punctuation modified); Lockhart, 844 F.3d  at 510 (holding that ""evidence of the victims' pre-and  post-indictment prostitution [was] not relevant to prove  an element necessary to convict [defendants]"" but  permitting cross-examination regarding the alleged sex  trafficking that was the subject of the prosecution). This  distinction derives from the language of Rule 412, which  prohibits evidence offered to prove that a victim  engaged in ""other sexual behavior"" or has a sexual  ""predisposition,"" meaning a tendency to act in a certain  way. Fed. R. Evid. 412(a) (emphasis added); see also  Haines, 918 F.3d at 697 (holding that ""[c]onsistent with  this construction of the Rule, courts have routinely  barred evidence of a sex trafficking victim's other  prostitution activities,"" and citing as support cases in  which courts excluded evidence of pre-and post- indictment prostitution) (emphasis added). Evidence of victims' other sexual behavior or sexual  predisposition, i.e., ""the victims' pre-and post-indictment  acts of prostitution"" would ""be irrelevant to this case as it  does not make more or less probable the fact that      [Defendants] caused their victims to engage in a  commercial sex act during the time period alleged in the  indictment."" Lockhart, 844 F.3d at 510 (punctuation [*9]   modified); see also United States v. Cephus, 684 F.3d  703, 708 (7th Cir. 2012) (finding that prior prostitution  evidence is irrelevant, as ""the fact that [the victim had]  been a prostitute before does not suggest that [the  defendant] didn't beat and threaten her""); United States  v. Elbert, 561 F.3d 771, 777 (8th Cir. 2009) (finding  evidence of the victims' prior prostitution ""would only  prove other people may be guilty of similar offenses of .  . . causing the[] victims to engage in a commercial sex  act""). By contrast, evidence that someone other than  Bell caused the alleged victims to engage in commercial  sex acts at the Victory Inn during the time period alleged  in the second superseding indictment would make it less  probable that Bell committed the charged sex trafficking  acts. Such evidence is not evidence of ""other"" behavior  or a ""predisposition."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(a). Rather, it is  evidence of the exact behavior that is the subject of the  sex trafficking prosecution. The Court's May 26, 2021 opinion and the cases cited  therein also provide an answer to Bell's present request  for permission to expose through cross-examination of  S.F. her alleged motives to inculpate Bell: (i) to protect  D.M., as her true trafficker, or (ii) because D.M., her  purported boyfriend and the father of her child, did not  like Bell. [*10]  Mot. at 4. While Bell cannot question a  victim about her ""prior association with another pimp"" to  ""demonstrate that she is shielding that pimp from  prosecution by falsely accusing Bell,"" 5/26/21 Op. at 9  (referencing Jackson, 627 F. App'x at 464), Bell ""may  impeach the victims through other permissible means,                   2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74783, *7 Page 4 of 4 such as by questioning the victims about 'their possible  bias against [Bell] . . .,'"" id. (quoting Lockhart, 844 F.3d  at 510). The bias theories Bell seeks to advance are  within the scope of cross-examination that the Court  previously authorized. Jackson does not counsel a different result. Jackson  addressed the propriety of barring evidence that victims  had prostituted themselves to pimps other than the  defendant. The defendant asserted that this line of  inquiry was justified because, during the investigation,  the victims had initially denied that the defendant was  their pimp, but then did an ""about-face"" and accused the  defendant of being their pimp. Jackson, 627 F. App'x at  463. The court of appeals rejected the defense  justification that the evidence tended to show that the  victims were trying to protect their real pimp by falsely  accusing the defendant. The court of appeals reasoned  that the ""prototypical loyalty"" of sex workers to their  pimps would explain the ""about-face,"" [*11]  but that  protection of another pimp would not be the ""natural  inference"" from an initial denial that the defendant was  the actual pimp. (Id. Here, there is no victim denial that Bell engaged in the  charged conduct followed by an ""about-face"" that would  be inconsistent with protecting another pimp. Moreover,  there is some basis to believe that alleged victim S.F.  had reason to protect D.M., further distinguishing this  case from Jackson: ""S.F. wanting to protect the father of  her child/boyfriend/roommate from getting in trouble . . .  is run-of-the-mill bias and motive evidence."" Reply at 4.  The Court agrees that D.M.'s alleged status as S.F.'s  boyfriend or the father of her child and the alleged bad  blood between D.M. and Bell come within the rubric of  the ""usual form of bias."" See Jackson, 627 F. App'x at  463. Bell may cross-examine along these lines.",1
"United States v. Bixler, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646","BERNICE BOUIE DONALD, Circuit Judge. Following a seven-day trial, a jury found Defendant Appellant Prince  Bixler guilty of sex trafficking, drug trafficking, witness tampering, and possessing firearms as a felon. On appeal,  2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *1 Page 9 of 18 Bixler raises a plethora of challenges to his sex trafficking and witness tampering convictions, sentencing  enhancements, and order of restitution. For the following reasons, we affirm. I. From 2013 to 2018, Bixler operated a prostitution ring in Lexington, Kentucky. Bixler found and recruited destitute  women with pre-existing drug addictions to prostitute themselves for his financial benefit. He lured them in with  promises of free shelter, [*2]  food, and drugs, and once they became entirely dependent on him, Bixler demanded  they work as prostitutes to pay off their ""accumulated debts."" Bixler manipulated their drug addictions, controlled  their drug supply, and used intimidation and violence to ensure that the women complied. Following a lengthy investigation, Bixler was arrested on March 28, 2018. The government subpoenaed several  women, including Adrienne Ratliff and Amie Payton, to appear before a grand jury. Bixler's history with Ratliff and  Payton was representative of how he treated his other victims: he initially provided them with ""free"" shelter and  drugs, but quickly turned violent and abusive. Bixler incessantly called Ratliff and Payton in the days leading up to  their testimony. He guilted Ratliff for betraying him and hurting him, stating ""Oh, but you told them you'd testify  against me[.] . . . Do you know how bad that fucking hurt me?""; ""You know, I have kids too.""; and ""[Y]ou don't even  have a conscience, do you? . . . [I]t's just so fucked up that you don't even have a conscience man. . . . Because I  keep sitting here thinking about, you know, God damn, does she even have a conscience about the shit that  she [*3]  just done."" Ratliff repeatedly lied to Bixler and said she would not testify for fear that he would ""yell at [her]  and just go off until he got what he wanted out of [her]."" Despite Bixler's pleas, Ratliff testified against him before  the grand jury. In addition, Bixler instructed Payton not to talk to a court-appointed attorney and ""just tell the truth."" Bixler also  called Payton over thirty times the day before her scheduled grand jury appearance. The next morning, Payton  injected heroin before arriving at the courthouse and refused to testify. Payton stated, ""I was afraid to [talk]"" and ""I  didn't want Prince to be mad at me either."" She also stated that she would rather go to jail for six months than testify  against Bixler. The court subsequently appointed her counsel, and she returned the following month to testify  against Bixler before the grand jury. On September 19, 2019, the grand jury charged Bixler with four counts of sex trafficking, two counts of witness  tampering, one count of using facilities in interstate commerce to manage the trafficking scheme, six counts of drug  distribution, and three related firearms offenses. The matter proceeded to a jury trial in September 2020. [*4]  At  trial, the government presented testimony from three sex trafficking victims. The first victim to testify, Kaitlyn Moore, recalled meeting Bixler while homeless and unemployed. Moore had been  living with her boyfriend until he overdosed and went to jail. She then moved into a rehabilitation facility but  subsequently relapsed and absconded from the facility. Moore eventually found herself homeless, without any  personal belongings, and shoplifting to afford her drug habit. Shortly thereafter, Moore met Bixler at a hotel and received free heroin from him. That same night, Bixler suggested  Moore could make money through Backpage.com—a website commonly used for prostitution. Bixler told her how to  set up an account, paid for the user fees, and helped her solicit clients. Bixler also purchased a hotel room for her  dates. Moore testified that, in the beginning, she made ""easily a thousand dollars"" a day and continued receiving  free heroin from Bixler. Eventually, however, Bixler told Moore that she owed a significant debt for her living expenses, the hotel, and the  drugs. Moore testified that she felt obligated to repay the debt by prostituting herself. She stated, ""Over time, I  started to [*5]  feel like it really wasn't, like, so much a choice as where kind of I had to do it for fear. But I didn't     2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *1 Page 10 of 18 want to struggle, and I didn't want to have nothing, and it was no longer an option at one point in time. Like, I  didn't—I had to do it."" She also stated that ""once [she] started to do more dope, [she] would need more dope to not  be sick, and that cost money too."" Moore further testified that Bixler regularly carried guns and was prone to  violence. According to Moore, she once ""got smacked"" for letting one of the other women into her hotel room.  Moore testified that she feared Bixler and felt like she could not leave. The second victim to testify, Savannah Godown, recalled having a romantic relationship with Bixler. For the first few  months, Bixler was ""great"" to Godown. He supplied her with free crack cocaine daily and provided her with several  free apartments. Eventually, however, Bixler turned violent. Godown testified that Bixler hit her ""weekly,"" and that  he once ""beat [her] with an air mattress pump,"" and kicked a door in and chipped her tooth. Shortly thereafter, Bixler moved Godown into a hotel room and she became involved with Backpage.com. Bixler  imposed a strict set of [*6]  rules for Godown; he controlled the information she posted in her ads, the nature of her  clientele, and when she could leave the hotel rooms. If Godown disobeyed the rules, Bixler would ""beat [her] up for  it."" Bixler also deputized Godown to help run the operation. Bixler would instruct Godown to ""work the phone,"" pay  for the other women's hotel rooms, and collect their profits to give to Bixler. If Godown did not comply, Bixler would  again ""put his hands on [her]."" After approximately four years, Godown grew ""tired of being beat on"" and left. The third victim to testify, Savannah Evans, told a similar story to Moore. Like Moore, Evans met Bixler while  homeless and addicted to heroin. Evans testified that Bixler moved her into his house and began fronting her  heroin. Eventually, she began prostituting herself through Backpage.com to repay her debt. Bixler and his girlfriend,  Crystal Rowe, controlled Evans' account; they took photographs of her, posted ads for her services, and paid for  the advertisement fees. Bixler even drove Evans to outcalls, or calls at the client's location instead of at the hotel.  After she finished a date, Evans gave all the money she earned to Bixler, who provided [*7]  her with food, shelter,  and drugs. Evans stayed at Bixler's house full time, leaving only for calls. Evans testified that she feared Bixler and felt like she  could not leave. Bixler controlled not only her Backpage.com account, but also her heroin supply. He initially  provided her heroin on a daily basis, but Evans eventually had to beg Bixler for heroin. Evans testified that the  erratic intake caused withdrawal symptoms. According to Evans, heroin withdraw is ""like the flu. . . . Diarrhea, and  your body hurts, it aches. You feel really anxious and scared and worried about where you're going to get more  from."" Evans stated that those symptoms would subside immediately after using heroin. Evans also testified that  Bixler hit her on three separate occasions when she tried to leave, and that she saw Bixler hit at least four other  women as well. After hearing this and other evidence, the jury found Bixler guilty of sex trafficking, drug trafficking, witness  tampering, and the related offenses. The district court subsequently sentenced him to 432 months' imprisonment  and ordered him to pay $333,270 in restitution to Moore, Godown, and Evans. This appeal followed. II. Bixler first challenges [*8]  the district court's grant of the government's pre-trial motion to preclude evidence of his  alleged victims engaging in prostitution both before and after their involvement with him. HN1[ ] In ""criminal proceeding[s] involving alleged sexual misconduct,"" Federal Rule of Evidence 412 bars any  evidence ""offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual behavior."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(a)(1). However, ""not  all evidence implicating a victim's past sexual activity falls within Rule 412(a)."" United States v. Kettles, 970 F.3d  637, 642 (6th Cir. 2020). Rule 412 does not prohibit ""evidence whose exclusion would violate the defendant's  constitutional rights."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C). Bixler seizes upon this exception and argues that prohibiting  evidence of his alleged victims' past sexual behavior violated his Sixth and Fifth Amendment rights. First, Bixler contends that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment confrontation rights by curtailing relevant  cross-examination testimony from which the jury could have assessed the women's biases or motives to testify.  2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *5 Page 11 of 18 Bixler asserts that the women may have testified against Bixler in exchange for not being prosecuted for prior acts  of prostitution. This argument lacks merit. HN2[ ] The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right ""to be confronted with the witnesses  against him."" U.S. Const. amend. VI; Boggs v. Collins, 226 F.3d 728, 736 (6th Cir. 2000). ""The main and essential  purpose of confrontation is to secure [*9]  for the opponent the opportunity of cross-examination."" Davis v. Alaska,  415 U.S. 308, 315-16, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974). However, the Confrontation Clause requires only  ""an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to  whatever extent, the defense might wish."" Boggs, 226 F.3d at 736. Thus, trial judges retain broad discretion to  impose reasonable limits on cross-examination. Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89 L.  Ed. 2d 674 (1986). When a trial court limits cross-examination pertaining to a witness's motive, bias, or prejudice,  we must decide ""whether the jury was otherwise in possession of sufficient information concerning formative events  to make a discriminating appraisal of a witness' motives and bias."" United States v. Fields, 763 F.3d 443, 464 (6th  Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). The district court here permitted Bixler to elicit evidence of the women's criminal histories and their involvement with  the underlying investigation. For example, Moore testified that she twice avoided arrest on outstanding warrants— once at the time of Bixler's arrest and once a year later with the help of the same investigating detective. Godown  similarly testified that the government reduced a felony robbery charge to a misdemeanor shoplifting charge after  she spoke with the investigating detective on the underlying case. In addition, all of the women [*10]  admitted to  purchasing, possessing, and using illicit drugs. Therefore, the jury possessed sufficient information concerning the  women's motives to testify, which arose from the prospect of potential punishment and not from the nature of their  conduct. Bixler next argues that the district court violated his Fifth Amendment due process rights by precluding evidence  that bore directly on the essential element of force or coercion. Bixler asserts that evidence of prior prostitution  suggested the women participated in commercial sex acts on their own volition, and not at his behest. This  argument is likewise unavailing. HN3[ ] Although ""the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a complete  defense . . . [it] does not require the admission of irrelevant evidence (or other types of evidence whose relevance is  outweighed by other important considerations)."" United States v. Beavers, 756 F.3d 1044, 1052 (7th Cir. 2014)  (internal citations omitted). We agree with the great weight of authority from our sister circuits that prior acts of  prostitution are irrelevant to sex trafficking charges under § 1591(a). See, e.g., United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d  584, 595-96 (7th Cir. 2017); United States v. Gemma, 818 F.3d 23, 34 (1st Cir. 2016); United States v. Lockhart,  844 F.3d 501, 510 (5th Cir. 2016); United States v. Roy, 781 F.3d 416, 420 (8th Cir. 2015); United States v. Rivera,  799 F.3d 180, 186 (2d Cir. 2015); United States v. Valenzuela, 495 F. App'x 817, 819-20 (9th Cir. 2012). HN4[ ] Prior acts of prostitution lead only to improper character inferences and are not relevant to proving sex  trafficking [*11]  charges under 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a). This evidence had no bearing on whether Bixler forced or  coerced them into prostitution on the particular occasions alleged in the indictment. Bixler argues that evidence of  prior prostitution would demonstrate the women's propensity to engage in prostitution, which, in turn, would negate  their testimony that Bixler forced them into a life of prostitution. However, this is exactly the type of evidence  proscribed by Federal Rules of Evidence 412 and 404(b). See United States v. Givhan, 740 F. App'x 458, 464 (6th  Cir. 2018) (citing United States v. Mack, 808 F.3d 1074, 1084 (6th Cir. 2015)) (holding that evidence of prior  prostitution is not admissible to prove consensual prostitution on a different occasion). Furthermore, Bixler cannot show prejudicial error because the parties did, in fact, elicit evidence of prior acts of  prostitution, notwithstanding the district court's order. Bixler testified that he met Moore through Backpage.com,  where he responded to her advertisement for sex. Godown likewise testified that she worked on Backpage.com  before meeting Bixler. In addition, Evans testified that she occasionally posted advertisements for sex independent  of Bixler. 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *8 Page 12 of 18 Accordingly, Bixler cannot demonstrate that the district court committed any error, let alone prejudicial error, in  granting the government's motion in limine. [*12]  III. Second, Bixler challenges the district court's denial of his pre-trial motion to preclude the testimony of addiction  specialist Dr. Kelly Clark. HN5[ ] Federal Rule of Evidence 702 requires expert testimony to be both reliable and helpful for ""the trier of fact  to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue."" Fed. R. Evid. 702(a)-(d). Bixler challenges both  requirements. He argues that Clark could not provide reliable testimony because she never examined the victims in  this case. He also argues that Clark did not testify on matters ""beyond the ken of the average juror,"" and thus  ""invaded the province of the jury"" in determining the ultimate issue at trial—whether Bixler coerced the victims to  engage in commercial sex acts. Appellant Br. 21-22. HN6[ ] We review the district court's admission of expert  testimony for an abuse of discretion. United States v. Amawi, 695 F.3d 457, 478 (6th Cir. 2012). At trial, Clark testified about the physical and psychological impacts of drug dependency, addiction, and withdrawal.  Clark differentiated between physical dependency as the body's adjustment to the presence of drugs, and drug  addiction as a ""chronic brain disease"" that affects the user's impulse control and judgment. Trial R. 216, Page ID#:  2940, 2943. She explained that withdrawal results from the [*13]  body's readjustment to the absence of drugs. She  described withdrawal as ""very, very painful,"" and listed common symptoms as nausea, diarrhea, sweating, shaking,  and drooling. Id. at Page ID#: 2943. She stated that ""people can't function when their bodies"" go through  withdrawal. Id. Clark noted that anyone can become dependent on drugs and experience withdrawal, but only those  addicted to drugs lose control when the drugs are withheld. According to Clark, those struggling with addiction  initially reuse drugs to ""chas[e] feeling good,"" but, as the addiction cycle continues, they reuse drugs to escape the  sickness that comes from withdrawal. Id. at Page ID#: 2950. This kind of testimony does not require review of case-specific facts. See Fed. R. Evid. 702 advisory committee's  note (""[I]t might . . . be important in some cases for an expert to educate the factfinder about general principles,  without ever attempting to apply these principles to the specific facts of the case.""). Instead, Clark's testimony  helped the jury contextualize the women's vulnerabilities and understand the power Bixler held over them—subjects  that likely are beyond an ordinary juror's knowledge or experience. See Patrick Eoghan [*14]  Murray, In Need of a  Fix: Reforming Criminal Law in Light of a Contemporary Understanding of Drug Addiction, 60 UCLA L. Rev. 1006,  1025 (2013) (""For a judge or jury to get inside the mind of a drug addict requires understanding th[e] mysterious  and self-destructive compulsion [to consume drugs] that has no analog for nonaddicts.""). Accordingly, the district  court did not abuse its discretion by allowing Dr. Clark to testify as an expert regarding drug dependency and  addiction. IV. Third, Bixler contends that the government violated his equal protection rights by using a peremptory challenge to  strike the only black member of the venire. HN7[ ] The Equal Protection Clause prohibits a party from using peremptory challenges to exclude members of  the venire on account of their race. See Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986).  In evaluating a Batson challenge, the district court must follow a three-step process. Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765,  768, 115 S. Ct. 1769, 131 L. Ed. 2d 834 (1995). First, the court must determine if the opponent of the peremptory  challenge has made out a prima facie case of racial discrimination (step 1). Second, if the opponent establishes a  prima facie case, the court must then determine if the proponent has presented a race-neutral explanation (step 2).  Third, if the proponent tenders a race-neutral explanation, the court must ultimately decide [*15]  whether the  opponent has proved purposeful discrimination (step 3). Id. Notably, ""the ultimate burden of persuasion . . . rests  with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike."" Id. 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *11 Page 13 of 18 HN8[ ] Step 1. A party's use of a peremptory challenge to strike the only prospective black juror is ""more than  sufficient to establish a prima facie case of intentional discrimination."" United States v. Mahan, 190 F.3d 416, 425  (6th Cir. 1999). Bixler averred, and the government did not dispute, that the stricken juror, Juror 23, was the sole  black juror on the panel. Thus, we must move to step 2. HN9[ ] Step 2. The proponent's explanation ""need not be particularly persuasive, or even plausible, so long as it is  neutral."" United States v. Harris, 192 F.3d 580, 586 (6th Cir. 1999). An explanation is ""neutral"" if it is based on  something other than the race of the juror. Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 360, 111 S. Ct. 1859, 114 L. Ed.  2d 395 (1991). Here, the government argues that the peremptory strike was based on Juror 23's acquaintance with  Bixler, namely, that her family or friends knew Bixler. Finding that the government met its burden, we turn now to  step 3. See United States v. Lawrence, 735 F.3d 385, 444 (6th Cir. 2013) (finding that a juror's familial connection  to the defendant ""is facially reasonable and does not suggest discriminatory intent""). HN10[ ] Step 3. When the proponent presents a neutral explanation, ""the question . . . boils down to whether  [the [*16]  opponent] established by a preponderance of the evidence that the peremptory strikes were intentionally  discriminatory."" United States v. Tucker, 90 F.3d 1135, 1142 (6th Cir. 1996). The district court's decision on the  ultimate question of discriminatory intent is a finding of fact entitled to ""great deference on appeal."" Hernandez, 500  U.S. at 364. We accordingly review for clear error. Tucker, 90 F.3d at 1142. In this case, the district court found no discriminatory intent. The court noted that Juror 23 was the only juror who  ""had heard of Prince Bixler,"" and that she gave conflicting information ""on how she heard."" Juror 23 initially  indicated that, three or four years prior, she heard a family member mention ""Prince Bixler"" in passing. Juror 23  later indicated that she heard his name through a mutual family friend, not a family member, and named the specific  friend on the record. In addition, Juror 23 was the only juror with prior knowledge of Backpage.com. Under these  circumstances, we cannot find that the district court clearly erred in overruling Bixler's Batson challenge. V. Fourth, Bixler argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a continuance based on news coverage  of a local rally against sex trafficking to occur later that same day. HN11[ ] Trial courts retain broad discretion [*17]  on matters of continuances. Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S. 1, 11-12,  103 S. Ct. 1610, 75 L. Ed. 2d 610 (1982). An abuse of discretion occurs only when the court unreasonably and  arbitrarily ""'insist[s] upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay.'"" Id. (quoting Ungar v.  Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575, 589, 84 S. Ct. 841, 11 L. Ed. 2d 921 (1964)). ""There are no mechanical tests for deciding  when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process. The answer must be found in the  circumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request  is denied."" United States v. Wirsing, 719 F.2d 859, 866 (6th Cir. 1983) (citation omitted). We also look to whether  the defendant suffered any prejudice as a result of the denial. Id.; United States v. Martin, 740 F.2d 1352, 1360 (6th  Cir. 1984). Minutes before the start of voir dire, Bixler moved to continue his trial for an unspecified period of time to avoid any  potential prejudice from a local rally against ""either human trafficking or sex trafficking"" scheduled for later that  same day. Trial R. 213, Page ID#: 1904. Bixler worried that prospective jurors ""may have heard reports"" on the  news that morning, and selected jurors could hear about it on the news that night. Id. He argued that the rally  attendees would be protesting the same conduct of which he was accused, and thus, publicity of the rally could  prejudicially pervade the [*18]  courtroom and impact his ability to have a fair trial. The district court denied the  motion, assuring the parties that it would ""carefully voir dire"" the jury pool of any predispositions and warn the  selected jury ""to avoid any news concerning th[e] case, and . . . the subject matter of the case."" During voir dire, the court inquired whether the prospective jurors had any knowledge of the case or any  preconceived opinions as to Bixler's guilt. None of the jurors indicted any knowledge of the case. Instead, all the  jurors expressed their willingness to decide the charges against Bixler solely on the evidence presented at trial and  2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *15 Page 14 of 18 to presume Bixler's innocence unless proven guilty. Defense counsel specifically inquired whether the prospective  jurors had seen any news stories or accounts about commercial sex trafficking. None of the jurors answered  affirmatively, and neither party challenged any juror for cause on that basis. Throughout the trial, the district court  properly admonished the jury to avoid reading, watching, or listening to any coverage of the case, and required any  juror inadvertently exposed to such information to convey that fact to the court. Under these circumstances, [*19]   we cannot find that the unbeknownst sex trafficking rally prejudicially affected the juror pool. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Bixler's motion for a continuance. VI. Fifth, Bixler challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions for sex trafficking and witness  tampering. HN12[ ] Where, as here, a defendant properly preserves his claims of insufficient evidence, we review  those claims de novo. United States v. Mack, 808 F.3d 1074, 1080 (6th Cir. 2015). In evaluating the claims, we  must ask ""whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact  could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt."" Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S.  307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979). We must ""draw all available inferences and resolve all issues of  credibility in favor of the jury's verdict."" United States v. Conatser, 514 F.3d 508, 519 (6th Cir. 2008) (citation  omitted). A. HN13[ ] To support a conviction for sex trafficking under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1), the government must prove that  Bixler (1) recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, or maintained a person; (2) knowing that  force, threats of force, coercion, or any combination of such means would be used; (3) to cause the person to  engage in a commercial sex act. Bixler challenges only the second element, arguing [*20]  that the government  failed to present sufficient evidence of ""force"" or ""coercion."" HN14[ ] ""Coercion"" includes ""threats of serious harm"" and a ""scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person  to believe that failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any person."" 18  U.S.C. § 1591(e)(2)(A)-(B). ""Serious harm"" means any harm, whether physical or nonphysical, including psychological, financial, or reputational harm, that is  sufficiently serious, under all the surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable person of the same  background and in the same circumstances to perform or to continue performing commercial sexual activity in  order to avoid incurring that harm. 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(5). It can include physical and psychological harm incurred from severe drug withdrawal. See  Mack, 808 F.3d at 1081-83. In Mack, the defendant targeted women with pre-existing drug addictions and used those addictions to coerce them  into prostitution. Id. at 1082. The defendant initially supplied ""free"" drugs to the women, which in turn exacerbated  their addictions and resulted in a high, fictitious drug debt. Id. at 1081-82. When he abruptly cut them off and  demanded payment, the women felt compelled to engage in commercial sex acts ""to avoid the physical and  psychological [*21]  harm of heroin and cocaine withdrawal."" Id. at 1082. One woman testified that ""when she did  not prostitute herself, she would get sick from lack of heroin. Without it, she would sweat, vomit, shake, and kick her  legs uncontrollably."" Id. Under these circumstances, this court found sufficient evidence of a ""coercive and, at times,  physically abusive atmosphere in which the victims felt compelled to prostitute themselves."" Id. at 1081. Mack is controlling here. Bixler similarly exploited his victims' drug addictions and withdrawal symptoms by carefully  controlling their access to drugs. Bixler gave the women presumptively free drugs and enticed them into  codependent relationships. Once he gained their complete obedience and loyalty, Bixler demanded the women  engage in prostitution for his financial benefit. Bixler took salacious photos of them, posted advertisements on  Backpage.com, and set the prices for their services. Bixler psychologically manipulated the women by withholding  drugs until after their dates. He also used intimidation and violence to ensure the women met their daily quotas. He  2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *18 Page 15 of 18 then kept all the money earned; using the profits to repay their fictious debts. Viewing this evidence in the light  most [*22]  favorable to the government, a reasonable jury could have found that Bixler forced, threatened, or  coerced the women to engage in prostitution. Bixler also argues that the district court should have found Evans incompetent to testify and stricken her testimony  after she admitted to using heroin on the morning of trial. HN15[ ] However, ""[a] witness under the influence of  drugs is competent to testify unless he or she is so impaired that he or she cannot coherently respond to  questioning."" United States v. Frezzell, 793 F. App'x 133, 136 (3rd Cir. 2019) (quoting 98 C.J.S. Witnesses § 115  (2019)). That was not the case here. The district court determined that Evans ""had recollection, she's had narration,  she seems to understand the oath, she says she doesn't remember when she doesn't remember."" Trial R. 214,  Page ID#: 2460-61. The court accordingly concluded that Evans was competent to testify. Thus, Bixler's argument  goes to the weight and credibility of her testimony—a question ""particularly suited to the jury,"" not this court. Fed. R.  Evid. 601, Advisory Committee Notes; see United States v. Moreno, 899 F.2d 465, 469 (6th Cir. 1990). B. HN16[ ] To support a conviction for witness tampering under 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(1), the government must prove  that Bixler (1) knowingly intimidated, threatened, or corruptly persuaded; (2) with the intent to influence, delay, [*23]   or prevent; (3) the testimony of any person in an official proceeding. Bixler challenges only the first element, arguing  that the government failed to present sufficient proof of intimidation, threats, or corrupt persuasion where he told the  women to ""tell the truth."" HN17[ ] We have consistently upheld convictions for witness tampering in the absence of directly threatening  language. See United States v. Carnes, 309 F.3d 950, 956 (6th Cir. 2002); United States v. Carson, 796 F. App'x  238, 251 (6th Cir. 2019). The key inquiry is whether the evidence could have been interpreted as ""threatening in  nature or intent."" Carnes, 309 F.3d at 956 (internal quotations and citation omitted). This inquiry recognizes that  ""otherwise encouraging language can become a threat . . . when issued by a long-time abuser."" Id. at 957 (internal  quotations omitted). The evidence produced at trial demonstrated that Bixler had a long-standing pattern of threatening and abusing  Ratliff and Payton. In the days leading up to their grand jury appearances, Bixler incessantly called and delivered  messages to deter them from testifying. For example, Bixler confronted Ratliff and guilted her for betraying him.  Bixler also conveyed that, if the roles were reversed, he would ""fight with"" her rather than testify against her. In  particular, Bixler threatened: ""No, when I get the [*24]  fuck in front of you, I'm going to cuss your ass out, I might  even slap your God damn brains out. But at the end of the day - I wouldn't tell the motherfucker nothing."" Gov't Ex.  12G, 01:43-3:26. Ratliff understood these messages as attempts to pressure or intimidate her into lying to protect  him. Bixler similarly confronted Payton, telling her that the government wanted to ""conquer and destroy"" him by ""fucking  [him] with all [his] loved ones [and the people he] takes care of . . . or the people that [he would] do anything for, so  once they turn on [him], [he's] sitting in jail with nothing."" Gov't Ex. 13A, 00:28-01:07. Based on Bixler's tone and  conduct, Payton believed Bixler ""was mad at [her]"" and did not want her to testify before the grand jury. To avoid  angering Bixler, Payton used heroin on her way to the courthouse and refused to talk at the first grand jury. Payton  stated that she would rather go to jail for six months than testify against him. Under these circumstances, the jury could reasonably infer that Bixler attempted to corruptly persuade the women  and prevent them from testifying before the grand jury. This is especially true ""given the long history of [Bixler's]  abusive [*25]  behavior toward [Ratliff and Payton]."" United States v. Iu, 917 F.3d 1026, 1032 (8th Cir. 2019). VII. Finally, Bixler challenges the application of seven sentencing enhancements and the district court's calculation of  restitution. HN18[ ] When evaluating the district court's application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review factual  findings for clear error and mixed questions of law and fact de novo. United States v. Tolbert, 668 F.3d 798, 800  2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *21 Page 16 of 18 (6th Cir. 2012). ""A finding is clearly erroneous where, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court  on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed."" Id. A. We will first address Bixler's argument that the record did not adequately support six different sentencing  enhancements. First, Bixler objects to the district court's application of a four-level enhancement for ""knowingly caus[ing] another  person to engage in a sexual act—by using force against that other person; or by threatening or placing that other  person in fear [of] death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping."" 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a); see U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1(b)(1).  Several women testified at trial that Bixler frequently used violence to ensure they met call quotas. Bixler even  admitted that he ""put [his] hands on women""; in particular, he testified that he hit Godown and ""struck"" [*26]  Evans  for stealing money. Therefore, the district court did not err in applying the use of force enhancement. Second, Bixler objects to the district court's application of U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a). HN19[ ] Under section 3B1.1(a),  the district court must apply a four-level enhancement if the defendant organized or led any criminal activity that  involved five or more participants. A review of the record shows that Bixler headed an extensive criminal enterprise  that spanned several years and involved at least eight participants whom he deputized to recruit women, create  advertisements, arrange hotel rooms, collect profits, and deliver drugs. Therefore, the record amply supported  application of the leadership enhancement. Third, Bixler objects to the district court's application of a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. See  U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1. The district court determined that Bixler's convictions for witness tampering supported an  enhancement for obstructing justice. The court found that Bixler ""specifically talked about trafficking with respect to  Adrianne Ratliff."" These findings were supported by the record. Fourth, Bixler objects to the district court's application of an eight-level enhancement for threatening to cause  physical injury [*27]  to a person. See U.S.S.G. § 2J1.2(b)(1)(B). However, Bixler's argument is belied by a  recorded phone call between himself and Ratliff, in which he threatened to ""slap [her] God damn brains out."" Gov't  Ex. 12G, 01:43-3:26. Fifth, Bixler objects to the district court's drug quantity calculation under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(5). HN20[ ] Section  2D1.1(c)(5) provides that drug trafficking offenses involving at least one kilogram of heroin require a base offense  level of 30. A review of the record shows that Bixler distributed heroin to at least nine people over the course of two  years. For instance, Bixler sold Holly Falls thirty grams of heroin; Jessica Martin ten grams of heroin; and Amy  Bailey sixty grams of heroin. In addition, Bixler supplied Evans with heroin daily for two and a half years, an  approximate total of seven hundred fifty grams, and Caudill with two grams of heroin daily for a couple months.  Accordingly, the record sufficiently supported the district court's drug quantity calculation. Finally, Bixler objects to the district court's application of a two-level enhancement for an offense involving three to  seven firearms. See U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(1)(A). However, Bixler admitted that he owned three firearms recovered  from his residence and garage. Therefore, the district court [*28]  did not err in applying the firearm enhancement. B. Bixler next argues that the district court impermissibly ""double counted"" in applying multiple Sentencing Guidelines  provisions for the same conduct. HN21[ ] Double counting occurs only ""when precisely the same aspect of a defendant's conduct factors into his  sentence in two separate ways."" United States v. Farrow, 198 F.3d 179, 193 (6th Cir. 1999). ""[N]o double counting  occurs if the defendant is punished for distinct aspects of his conduct."" United States v. Battaglia, 624 F.3d 348,    2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *25 Page 17 of 18 351 (6th Cir. 2010). Even where double counting occurs, it is not necessarily impermissible. Farrow, 198 F.3d at  194. For instance, ""we allow double counting where it appears that Congress or the Sentencing Commission  intended to attach multiple penalties to the same conduct."" Id. (citing United States v. Johnson, 22 F.3d 106, 108  (6th Cir. 1994)). Bixler identifies three alleged instances of double counting. First, he asserts that the district court improperly  considered his use of force to determine his base offense level and to apply a four-level enhancement under §  2A3.1(b)(1). HN22[ ] U.S.S.G. § 2G1.1(a) provides the base offense level for sex trafficking convictions. However,  when the offense involves aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse, the cross-reference in U.S.S.G. § 2G1.1(c)(1)  provides that the district court should instead apply U.S.S.G. § 2A3.1. Section 2A3.1(b)(1) provides for a four-level  enhancement if the offense involved the former—aggravated [*29]  sexual abuse under section 2241(a) or (b). Id. at  § 2A3.1(b)(1). Based on the plain language of the Guidelines, the Sentencing Commission intended for the entirety  of § 2A3.1, including any enhancements, to apply following the application of the cross reference. See U.S.S.G. §  1B1.5(a); United States v. Kizer, 517 F. App'x 415, 420 (6th Cir. 2013) (finding that ""the Sentencing Commission  must have intended to punish defendants in this way using both the cross reference and the enhancement."").  Therefore, the district court's application of the use of force enhancement did not constitute impermissible double  counting. Second, Bixler asserts that the district court improperly considered the victims' drug addictions both as an element  of the offense and to increase the offense level under § 3A1.1(b)(1). HN23[ ] Under section 3A1.1(b)(1), the  district court must apply a two-level enhancement ""if the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the  offense was a vulnerable victim."" A ""vulnerable victim"" means one ""who is unusually vulnerable due to age, physical  or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct."" Id. at § 3A1.1 cmt. n.2.  The application notes caution that the vulnerable victim enhancement cannot be applied ""if the factor that makes a  person a vulnerable victim is incorporated in the offense guideline."" [*30]  Id. However, the district court recognized  this at sentencing and imposed the enhancement based on factors other than the women's drug addictions. For  example, the court also considered their criminal histories and economic dependency on Bixler. Therefore, the  district court's application of the vulnerable victim enhancement did not constitute impermissible double counting. Third, Bixler asserts that the district court improperly considered his attempts to influence grand jury testimony both  as an element of the offenses and to increase the offense level under § 3C1.1. However, this argument is expressly  foreclosed by the application notes. HN24[ ] The application notes allow the obstruction of justice enhancement to  apply ""where there is a separate count of conviction for such conduct."" U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 cmt. n.4; see United  States v. Pego, 567 F. App'x 323, 330 (6th Cir. 2014). Therefore, the district court's application of the obstruction of  justice enhancement also did not constitute impermissible double counting. C. Finally, Bixler contends that the district court erred in calculating the amount of restitution owed to Moore, Godown,  and Evans. HN25[ ] The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (""TVPA"") directs district courts to order restitution for  any sex trafficking offense. See 18 U.S.C. § 1593(a). Section 1593(b) requires the defendant to pay the victim ""the  full [*31]  amount of the victim's losses,"" including ""the gross income or value to the defendant of the victim's  services or labor."" Bixler argues that the government did not present sufficiently reliable proof of the women's incomes, and that the  court merely estimated the amount. HN26[ ] However, the amount of restitution need not ""be proven with  exactitude."" In re Sealed Case, 702 F.3d 59, 66, 403 U.S. App. D.C. 194 (D.C. Cir. 2012). Determining the dollar  amount of a victim's losses ""will often be difficult"" and ""such a determination will inevitably involve some degree of  approximation[.]"" Id. (citation omitted). Thus, estimates are permitted as long as there exists some reasonable and  reliable evidence of the victims' losses. United States v. Williams, 5 F.4th 1295, 1305 (11th Cir. 2021).   2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *28 Page 18 of 18 Relying on the women's trial testimony, the district court multiplied their self-reported daily earnings by the  approximate number of days worked. The court found that Moore earned approximately $1,000 per day for four  days, totaling a gross income of $4,000. It also estimated that Godown earned approximately $300 per day for 782  days, totaling a gross income of $234,642. It further determined that Evans earned approximately $160 per day for  591 days, totaling a gross income of $94,628. During its calculations, the court reduced the number of days [*32]   worked to account for sick days and ensure a conservative estimate. We find these estimates sufficiently  reasonable and reliable for purposes of the TVPA. Bixler next asserts that the court should have offset the claimed amount by the value of the items supplied to the  women, including food and lodging. However, this argument disregards the plain language of the TVPA. HN27[ ]  Section 1593(b) provides that trafficking victims shall recover ""the gross income or value [of their services]."" ""Gross  income"" is the ""[t]otal income from all sources before deductions, exemptions, or other tax reductions."" Black's Law  Dictionary 710, 767 (7th ed. 1999) (emphasis added). Therefore, ""the court was not required—or even permitted— to offset the restitution . . . by the amount [Bixler] expended on his victims' living expenses."" Williams, 5 F.4th at  1305. Accordingly, the district court did not err in calculating the amount of restitution owed under the TVPA. VIII. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Bixler's convictions, sentence, and restitution owed.  2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2646, *31",1
"United States v. Connelly, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 32176","[*1] _____________________________________ For Appellee: Katherine A. Gregory, Assistant United  States Attorney, on behalf of, Trini E. Ross, United States Attorney for the Western District of New York, Buffalo, NY. For Defendant-Appellant: Robert J. Boyle, Robert J.  Boyle, Attorney at Law, New York, NY. Appeal from a final order of the United States District  Court for the Western District of New York (William M. Skretny, J.). UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY  ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the order of the district court is  AFFIRMED. Defendant-Appellant Kenneth White (""White"") was  sentenced in 2016 to 156 months' imprisonment after  pleading guilty to one count of sex trafficking by force,  fraud, or coercion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§  1591(a)(1) and (b)(1). White challenged his sentence on  direct appeal before this Court and then before the  district court on collateral review under 28 U.S.C. §  2255. Both challenges were rejected. 1 In July 2022,  White filed a pro se motion for compassionate release  pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). The district court  denied his § 3582 motion, concluding, inter alia, that  even assuming White ""had demonstrated extraordinary  and compelling reasons for a sentence reduction (which  he has not),"" any such reasons were ""greatly  outweighed [*2]  by consideration of the [18 U.S.C. ]§  3553 (a) factors."" White v. United States, No. 13-CR- 255S (1), 2022 WL 4244219, at *6 (W.D.N.Y. Sept. 15,  2022). For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the district  court's denial of White's motion for compassionate  release. We assume the parties' familiarity with the  underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and  the issues on appeal. * * * White's direct appeal and habeas petition were rejected  on the basis of White's decision to enter into a plea  agreement and attest to his knowing, voluntary, and  competent waiver of the right to appeal and collaterally  Page 2 of 3 attack his sentence. See White v. United States, No. 16- 1736 (2d Cir. July 16, 2018) (direct appeal); White v.  United States, Nos. 18-CV-1315S, 13-CR-255S (1),  2022 WL 170607 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 19, 2022) (habeas  petition); White v. United States, Nos. 18-CV-1315S, 13- CR-255S, 2022 WL 2948974 (W.D.N.Y. July 26, 2022)  (subsequent motion for reconsideration of habeas  petition). We review the denial of a motion for compassionate  release for abuse of discretion. SeeUnited States v.  Holloway, 956 F.3d 660, 664 (2d Cir. 2020). ""A district  court has abused its discretion if it has (1) based its  ruling on an erroneous view of the law, (2) made a  clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or (3)  rendered a decision that cannot be located within the  range of permissible decisions."" United States v. Keitt,  21 F.4th 67, 71 (2d Cir. 2021) (quoting UnitedStates v.  Saladino, 7 F.4th 120, 122 (2d Cir. 2021)). White argues that the sentencing court applied the  wrong version of the Sentencing Guidelines to his crime  of conviction and erroneously assessed two Criminal  History points to his Guidelines calculation. He further  contends that [*3]  these two errors resulted in a  significant increase in his prison sentence and therefore  constitute extraordinary and compelling reasons to  reduce his sentence. See 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i).  Setting aside the merits of this claim, the district court  declined to consider whether the alleged sentencing  errors warranted § 3582 relief because White knowingly,  voluntarily, and competently agreed not to directly  appeal or collaterally attack any component of his  sentence in his 2015 plea agreement. On appeal, White  asserts that the district court abused its discretion by  refusing to consider the merits of his claim, citing  UnitedStates v. Brooker, 976 F.3d 228 (2d Cir. 2020),  which confirmed that when imprisoned persons move  for § 3582 relief, district courts may consider ""the full  slate of extraordinary and compelling reasons"" that are  ""br[ought] before them."" 2 Id. at 237. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j),  White submitted a letter dated September 22, 2023  informing this Court of a recent amendment to Section  4A1.1 of the Sentencing Guideline (""Amendment 821"").  Amendment 821 struck subsection (d) of Section 4A1.1,  which previously accorded two Criminal History points to  a guidelines calculation if a defendant committed the  instant offense while under any criminal justice  sentence. White notes that he was accorded two  Criminal History points pursuant to this subsection at  sentencing, which placed [*4]  him in Criminal History  Category III. White asserts that had he not been placed  in Category III, it is reasonably possible that the court  may have departed to Category I in light of its decision  to depart from Category III to Category II. We disagree.  Although the sentencing court granted White's request  to reduce his Criminal History Category ""on the basis  that [Category III] We need not decide whether claims that were knowingly  and validly waived in a plea agreement fall under  Brooker's ""full slate"" pronouncement. Here, the district  court's evaluation of the § 3553(a) factors offers an  independent and fully adequate basis for denial of relief  under § 3582(c)(1)(A). See 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A);  United States v. Jones, 17 F.4th 371, 374 (2d Cir. 2021)  (explaining that ""extraordinary and compelling reasons  are necessary-but not sufficient- for a defendant to  obtain relief under § 3582(c)(1)(A)""). The district court  validly considered the nature and circumstances of  White's offense, his personal history and characteristics,  and the need for the sentence imposed to provide a just  punishment, afford adequate deterrence, and protect  the public from future crimes. As to the nature and  circumstances of his offense, the district court  reasonably concluded that White's operation of an  interstate commercial sex business [*5]  was, as he  admitted in his motion for compassionate release,  nothing short of brutal in nature. As to his personal  characteristics, the district court reasonably concluded  that White did not have an abnormal upbringing or a  record of significant mental-health diagnoses or issues.  Lastly, as to the purpose behind sentencing White to  156 months' imprisonment, the district court noted that  White was already serving a sentence below the 15- year statutory minimum, and that further reducing his  sentence  would  not  properly  account  for  the  seriousness of the offense or advance any of the goals  of sentencing enumerated in § 3553(a)(2). The district court's assessment of the § 3553(a) factors  and its resulting sentence determination was well ""within  the range of permissible decisions,"" Keitt, 21 F.4th at 71  (internal overstate[d] the nature of [White's] criminal history and  the likelihood that [he] will recidivate,"" the court further  determined that ""[g]iven the two countable violation level  offenses,"" Criminal History Category II more aptly suited  White's conduct. United States v. White, No. 13-CR-255  Page 3 of 3 (1), ECF No. 98 (W.D.N.Y. May 20, 2016). For this  reason, we are not convinced that the sentencing court  would have departed further to Category I based on the  Guidelines amendment. quotation marks and citation omitted), [*6]  as was its  conclusion that ""consideration of the [18 U.S.C. §]  3553(a) factors outweigh[ed] any extraordinary and  compelling reasons for a sentence reduction."" 2022 WL  4244219, at *7. We can discern no basis to vacate the  district court's well-reasoned order. We have considered White's remaining arguments and  find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM  the order of the district court. FOR THE COURT: Catherine O'Hagan Wolfe, Clerk",1
"United States v. Crim. Frederik Barbieri, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217647","[*1] Order Denying Motion for Sentence Reduction This matter is before the Court on the Defendant  Frederik Barbieri's motion for reduction of sentence  pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). (Mot., ECF No.  120.) The Government has responded opposing  Barbieri's motion. (Resp., ECF No. 122.) Barbieri has  not replied, and the time to do so has passed. After  careful consideration of the parties' written submissions,  the record, and the legal authorities, the Court denies  Barbieri's motion for reduction of sentence. (Mot., ECF  No. 120.) 1. Background On March 13, 2018, a federal grand jury indicted  Barbieri with conspiracy to commit offenses against the  United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 (Count  One), delivery of firearms to a contract carrier without  written notification in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(e)  (Count Two), smuggling goods outside the United  States in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 554 (Count Three),  exporting  firearms,  firearms  accessories,  and  ammunition in violation of 22 U.S.C. § 2778 (Count  Four), and possession of firearms with obliterated serial  numbers in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(k)) (Count Five).  (ECF No. 14.) On May 15, 2018, pursuant to a plea  agreement (ECF No. 28) and factual proffer (ECF No.  27), Barbieri pled guilty to Counts One and Four of the  indictment-specifically, [*2]  to conspiracy to commit  offenses against the United States in violation of 18  U.S.C. § 371 and unlicensed exportation of firearms and  firearm accessories from the United States to Brazil in  violation of 22 U.S.C. § 2778(b)(2) and (c). Ahead of Barbieri's sentencing, the United States  Probation Office prepared a Presentence Investigation  Report (""PSI""). After considering Barbieri's objections to  the PSI, the Court ultimately determined that Barbieri  had a total offense level of 35, a criminal history  category of I, and an advisory guideline range of 168- 210 months. (See Sentencing Tr. 28-29, ECF No. 74.)  On July 19, 2018, the Court sentenced Barbieri to 152  months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. (J. 2-3, ECF No. 40.) As of  the filing of his motion, Barbieri had an anticipated  release date of December 10, 2027. SeeFind aninmate,  FEDERAL  BUREAU  OF  PRISONS,  https://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/ (last visited Dec. 6,  2023). Since Barbieri was sentenced, the United States  Sentencing  Commission  issued  a  sentencing  adjustment for certain zero-point offenders, which  provides, in relevant part, for ""a decrease of two levels  from the offense level . . . for offenders who did not  receive any criminal history points . [*3]  . . and whose  instant offense did not involve specified aggravating  factors"" (""Amendment 821""). Barbieri now seeks  retroactive application of Amendment 821 to the Court's  judgment sentencing him to 152 months in prison and  three years of supervised release. 2. Legal Standard ""[A] motion to modify an otherwise final judgment  Page 2 of 3 pursuant to § 3582(c)(2) is a limited and narrow  exception to the rule that final judgments are not to be  modified."" United States v. Armstrong, 347 F.3d 905,  909 (11th Cir. 2003) (cleaned up). Specifically, §  3582(c)(2) provides: [I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to  a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range  that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing  Commission . . . , the court may reduce the term of  imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in  section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if  such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy  statements issued bythe Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. § 3582 (emphasis added). Thus, under §  3582(c)(2), the Court must undertake a two-step  process to determine whether a final sentence should  be modified based on a sentencing range that has been  lowered by the Sentencing Commission. First, the Court must determine if a retroactive  amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines indeed  lowered a defendant's guidelines range [*4]  and  whether a reduction is consistent with the applicable  policy statements. Second, the Court must consider the  § 3553(a) factors to determine if it will exercise its  discretion to reduce that defendant's sentence. Among other things, the Sentencing Commission policy  statement applicable here provides that a court ""shall  not reduce the defendant's term of imprisonment under  18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) . . . to a term that is less than the  minimum of the amended guideline range[.]"" U.S.S.G. §  1B1.10(b)(2)(A). In addition, although Amendment 821  went into effect on November 1, 2023, the policy  statement ""delays the effective date of orders reducing a  defendant's term of imprisonment to a date no earlier than February 1,  2024."" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10 cmt. n. 7. In other words, if a  defendant is scheduled for release before February 1,  2024, he is not entitled to relief under Amendment 821. Finally, the § 3553(a) factors are: (1) the nature and  circumstances of the offense and the history and  characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the  sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the  offense, promote respect for the law, provide just  punishment for the offense, afford adequate deterrence  to criminal conduct, protect the public from further  crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with  needed [*5]  educational or vocational training, medical  care, or other correctional treatment in the most  effective manner; (3) the kinds of sentences available;  (4) the applicable sentencing guidelines range; (5) any  pertinent policy statement; (6) the need to avoid  unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants  with similar records who have been found guilty of  similar conduct; and (7) the need to provide restitution to  any victims of the offense. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). 3. Analysis A. Barbieri is not eligible for a sentence reduction. As noted, the retroactive amendment that Barbieri  invokes here is Amendment 821-the adjustment for  certain zero-point offenders. See U.S.S.G. § 4C1.1.  Pursuant to Amendment 821, a defendant is eligible for  a two-level reduction in his offense level, if he meets all  the following criteria: (1) the defendant did not receive any criminal history  points from Chapter Four, Part A; (2) the defendant did not receive an adjustment under  §3A1.4 (Terrorism); (3) the defendant did not use violence or credible  threats of violence in connection with the offense; (4) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily  injury; (5) the instant offense of conviction is not a sex offense; (6) the defendant did not personally cause substantial  financial [*6]  hardship; (7) the defendant did not possess, receive, purchase,  transport, transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of a  firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another  participant to do so) in connection with the offense; (8) the instant offense of conviction is not covered by  §2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights); (9) the defendant did not receive an adjustment under  §3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable Victim) or  §3A1.5 (Serious Human Rights Offense); and (10) the defendant did not receive an adjustment under  §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) and was not engaged in a  continuing criminal enterprise, as defined in 21 U.S.C. §  848[.] See id. Here, Barbieri plainly fails to meet requirements seven  Page 3 of 3 and ten-i.e., that he ""did not possess, receive, purchase,  transport, transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of a  firearm or other dangerous weapon . . . in connection  with the offense[.]"" and that he ""did not receive an  adjustment under §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) and was  not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise, as  defined in 21 U.S.C. § 848."" See id. Among other things,  Barbieri's factual proffer establishes that: From in or around May 2013 through in or around  February 2018, [Barbieri] conspired with others: (1) to  possess firearms with obliterated [*7]  serial numbers;  (2) to deliver firearms to a common and contract carrier  for shipment in interstate commerce without providing  written notice to the carrier that such firearms were  being transported; (3) to smuggle firearms, firearm  accessories, and ammunition from the United States to  Brazil; and (4) to illegally export firearms, firearm  accessories, and ammunition designated as defense  articles from the United States to Brazil without first  obtaining a license or written approval from the United  States Department of State, Directorate of Defense  Trade Control. (Factual Proffer 1, ECF No. 27.) It is therefore  indisputable that Barbieri does not meet requirement  number seven, as the possession and disposition of  firearms played an integral role in the offenses for which  Barbieri was convicted. In addition, Barbieri received  sentencing enhancements as a leader and organizer of  his trafficking organization, making him also ineligible for  the two-level decrease under requirement number ten.  Thus, because Barbieri plainly does not satisfy all the  requisite criteria for a two-level reduction in his offense  level, his motion must be denied. Moreover, because Barbieri does not qualify for a [*8]   reduction pursuant to Amendment 821, the Court  declines to reach the second step of the analysis to  consider the § 3553(a) factors.",0
"United States v. Crow, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 32380","[*1] Appeal from the United States District Court for the  Southern District of Florida D.C. Docket No. 2:22-cr- 14035-JEM-1 ____________________ USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 2 of 10 2 Opinion of the Court 22-14267 Before ROSENBAUM, JILL PRYOR, and BLACK,  Circuit Judges. PER CURIAM: Daniel Crow appeals his sentence of 360 months'  imprison-ment for enticement of a minor to engage in  sexual activity and production of child pornography.  Crow asserts several issues on appeal, which we  address in turn. After review, 1 we affirm in part, and  vacate and remand for resentencing in part. I. DISCUSSION A. Grouping of Counts Crow contends the district court erred in failing to group  his counts together when calculating his guideline  range, because his counts involved substantially the  same harm under U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2. The Government  concedes error on this issue. Oﬀenses ""shall be grouped"" for guideline oﬀense level  calcu-lation purposes when they ""involve substantially  the same harm."" U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2. The Guidelines list  four circumstances where counts involve ""substantially  the same harm"": 1 When reviewing the district court's findings with  respect to Guidelines is-sues, we consider legal issues  de novo [*2] , factual findings for clear error, and the  court's application of the Guidelines to the facts with due  deference, which is akin to clear error review. United  States v. Rothenberg, 610 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir.  2010). In order to be clearly erroneous, the finding of the  district court must leave us with a ""definite and firm  conviction that a mistake has been committed."" Id.  (quotation marks omitted). USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 3 of 10 22-14267 Opinion of the Court 3 (a) When counts involve the same victim and the same  act or transaction. (b) When counts involve the same victim and two or  more acts or transactions connected by a common  criminal objective or constituting part of a common  scheme or plan. (c) When one of the counts embodies conduct that is  treated as a specific oﬀense characteristic in, or other  adjustment to, the guideline applicable to another of the  Page 2 of 4 counts. (d) When the oﬀense level is determined largely on the  basis of the total amount of harm or loss, the quantity of  a substance involved, or some other meas-ure of  aggregate harm, or if the oﬀense behavior is ongoing or  continuous in nature and the oﬀense guideline is written  to cover such behavior. Id. Subsection (d) specifically precludes the grouping of  a ""produc-tion of child pornography"" offense under that  subsection. Id. However, offenses need only meet the  criteria of one subsection of § 3D1.2 to qualify for  grouping [*3]  as ""substantially the same harm."" See id.  § 3D1.2(d) (""Exclusion of an offense from grouping  under this subsection does not necessarily preclude  grouping under an-other subsection""). The district court erred in failing to group Crow's counts.  See United States v. Nagel, 835 F.3d 1371, 1374 (11th  Cir. 2016) (re-viewing the district court's decisions  regarding grouping de novo). The conduct embodying  Crow's enticement offense was used to apply a specific  offense characteristic enhancement to his USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 4 of 10 4 Opinion of the Court 22-14267 production offense. Namely, Crow's production of child  pornog-raphy ""involved the use of a computer [to]  persuade, induce, en-tice, coerce, or facilitate the travel  of, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct, or to  otherwise solicit participation by a minor in such  conduct."" This enhancement placed Crow's counts  squarely within § 3D1.2(c), which requires grouping  ""[w]hen one of the counts embodies conduct that is  treated as a specific offense char-acteristic in . . .  another of the counts."" U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2(c). Thus, the  court erred in failing to group Crow's offenses, and we  vacate and remand for resentencing as to this issue. B. Pattern of Activity Enhancement Crow asserts the court [*4]  erred in applying a five-level  enhance-ment for a ""pattern of activity involving  prohibited sexual con-duct"" under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.5,  because the court sustained the pat-tern enhancement  on facts that were not suﬃciently proven at the  sentencing hearing. Under § 4B1.5, the district court applies a five-level  enhance-ment when the defendant engaged in a  ""pattern of activity involv-ing prohibited sexual conduct.""  U.S.S.G. § 4B1.5(b)(1). For pur-poses of § 4B1.5,  ""prohibited sexual conduct"" includes, among other  things, ""any oﬀense described in 18 U.S.C. §  2426(b)(1)(A) or (B)"" and ""the production of child  pornography."" U.S.S.G. § 4B1.5, comment. (n.4(A)). 2 It  does not include receipt or possession of 2Deferral to the Guidelines commentary is necessary  only if the text of the Guidelines is ambiguous. United  States v. Dupree, 57 F.4th 1269, 1275-77 (11th Cir.  2023) (en banc). USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 5 of 10 22-14267 Opinion of the Court 5 child pornography. Id. Section 2426(b)(1)(A) cross- references to oﬀenses contained in chapter 117, which  includes enticement of a minor under 18 U.S.C. §  2422(b). 18 U.S.C. § 2426(b)(1)(A). A defendant engaged in a ""pattern"" under § 4B1.5 if he  en-gaged in such conduct ""on at least two separate  occasions.""  Id.  §  4B1.5,  comment.  (n.4(B)(i)).  ""[R]epeated prohibited sexual con-duct with a single  victim may qualify as a 'pattern of activity' for purposes  of § 4B1.5(b)(1)."" United States v. Fox, 926 F.3d 1275,  1279 (11th Cir. 2019). But ""separate occasions""  requires [*5]   events  that  are  ""independent  and  distinguishable"" from one another. Id. at 1280.  Noncontinuous instances of prohibited sexual conduct  that occur on different days constitute ""separate  occasions."" United States v.Isaac, 987 F.3d 980, 994  (11th Cir. 2021). The Government did not put forth ""sufficient and  reliable"" evidence at the sentencing hearing in support  of any facts sustain-ing the pattern enhancement. See  United States v. Washington, 714 F.3d 1358, 1361 (11th  Cir. 2013) (""When the government seeks to apply an  enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines over a  de-fendant's factual objection, it has the burden of  introducing 'suffi-cient and reliable' evidence to prove  the necessary facts by a pre-ponderance of the  evidence.""). Because Crow made a factual ob-jection to  the enhancement, the record to be considered was lim- ited to Crow's factual proffer, which admitted to only a  single sex-ual encounter involving oral sex with Victim 1  on May 22, 2020. The Government's assertion of facts  at the sentencing hearing be-yond those contained in  the factual proffer, absent additional USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  Page 3 of 4 12/07/2023 Page: 6 of 10 6 Opinion of the Court 22-14267 supporting evidence, could not be relied upon by the  district court. See id. (""[A]bsent a stipulation or  agreement between the parties, [*6]  an attorney's  factual assertions at a sentencing hearing do not con- stitute evidence that a district court can rely on.""). The  district court stated the support for the enhancement  was provided ""based on what [Victim 1] said,""  suggesting that it relied upon every state-ment by or  about Victim 1 contained in the PSI when imposing the  enhancement, despite Crow's factual objections. The  court relied upon insufficiently proven evidence when it  sustained Crow's pat-tern enhancement based upon the  ""separation in time of the vari-ous relationships with  Victim 1."" However, the facts contained in Crow's factual proffer  are sufficient to sustain his pattern enhancement. See  United States v.Gill, 864 F.3d 1279, 1280 (11th Cir.  2017) (explaining we may affirm on any ground  supported by the record, regardless of whether the  district court considered or relied upon that ground  below). Crow concedes in his factual proffer that he  engaged in oral sex with Vic-tim 1 on May 22, 2020, and  that he produced child pornography when he filmed that  sexual encounter. He further concedes that at  unidentified points prior to his May 22 meeting with  Victim 1, Crow requested naked photos and videos from  Victim 1 and made plans with Victim 1 to meet and  engage in sexual [*7]  acts. Between his requests for  illicit images from Victim 1 and his formulation of plans  to meet up with Victim 1 for sex, Crow engaged in  entice-ment prohibited by 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), which  qualifies as ""prohib-ited sexual conduct"" under the  commentary to § 4B1.5. This con-duct occurred on a  different day than his production of child USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 7 of 10 22-14267 Opinion of the Court 7 pornography on May 22, constituting distinct, ""separate  occasions"" sufficient to establish a pattern under §  4B1.5. See Fox, 926 F.3d at 1279; Isaac, 987 F.3d at  994. Thus, while the district court sustained Crow's  enhancement  on  insufficiently  proven  factual  allegations, the existing and undisputed record supports  the enhancement on alternative grounds. Thus, we  affirm as to this issue. C. Distribution Enhancement Crow also argues the court erred in applying a two-level  en-hancement for ""distribution"" of child pornography  under U.S.S.G. § 2G2.1(b)(3), because his sending of a  video from his phone to Victim 1's phone did not  constitute ""distribution."" The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a two-level  enhance-ment when a defendant ""knowingly engaged in  distribution""  of  child  pornography.  U.S.S.G.  §  2G2.1(b)(3). The commentary to the Guidelines  provides that: ""Distribution"" [*8]  means any act, including possession  with intent to distribute, production, transmission,  advertisement, and transportation, related to the transfer  of material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor.  Accordingly, distribution includes posting material  involving the sexual exploitation of a minor on a website  for public viewing but does not include the mere  solicitation of such material by a defendant. Id. § 2G2.1, comment. (n.1(A)). We have stated  ""distribute"" ordi-narily means ""to deliver, give out,  dispense, or disperse to others."" United States v.  Grzybowicz, 747 F.3d 1296, 1307 (11th Cir. 2014)  (holding a defendant did not engage in a ""distribution"" of  child USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 8 of 10 8 Opinion of the Court 22-14267 pornography under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a) when he sent  four images of child pornography from his cellphone to  his personal email ac-count, because the images were  not transferred ""to others""). More-over, distribution  impliedly involves ""deliver[y] to someone other than the  person who does the delivering."" Id. at 1307-08. The district court did not clearly err in imposing the  distri-bution  enhancement  under  §  2G2.1.  By  airdropping a video from his cell phone to Victim 1's cell  phone, Crow delivered, gave out, dispersed, or  dispensed that video to another. [*9]  See id. at 1307.  While Crow asserts Victim 1, presumably by virtue of  her inclusion in the video, does not constitute another  person to whom Crow could ""distribute"" the video, Crow  provides no argument or legal author-ity as to why  Victim 1 should not constitute an ""other"" for purposes of  determining whether he engaged in a distribution. Thus,  be-cause airdropping a video to another's cell phone is  Page 4 of 4 a ""deliver[y]"" to another, the court did not clearly err in  applying  a  two-level  en-hancement  for  Crow's  distribution. Accordingly, we aﬃrm as to this issue. D. Use of Computer Enhancement Crow asserts the court erred in applying a two-level en- hancement for ""use of a computer"" pursuant to U.S.S.G.  § 2G2.1(b)(6)(B), because an iPhone is not a  ""computer"" as in-tended in the Guidelines. Section 2G2.1 provides for a two-level enhancement  when, as part of a defendant's production of child  pornography, the of-fense involved: USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 9 of 10 22-14267 Opinion of the Court 9 the use of a computer or an interactive computer ser- vice to (i) persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facili-tate  the travel of, a minor to engage in sexually ex-plicit  conduct, or to otherwise solicit participation by [*10]  a  minor in such conduct; or (ii) solicit participation with a  minor in sexually explicit conduct . . . . U.S.S.G. § 2G2.1(b)(6). The Guidelines Commentary  cross-refer-ences to 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(1), which  defines ""computer"" as ""an electronic, magnetic, optical,  electrochemical, or other high speed data processing  device performing logical, arithmetic, or storage  functions."" 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(1) (cited in U.S.S.G. §  2G2.1, com-ment. (n.1)). We have previously held a  defendant's use of a cell phone constitutes the use of a  computer as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(1). United  States v. Mathis, 767 F.3d 1264, 1283 (11th Cir. 2014),  abrogated on other grounds by Lockhart v. United  States, 577 U.S. 347 (2016)). The court did not clearly err in applying a two-level  enhance-ment for ""use of a computer."" Crow's iPhone  possessed much of the functionality of a typical  computer, and he used it as such: send-ing and  receiving messages over the internet, booking a hotel  room, and filming and distributing a video. Thus, Crow's  use of an iPhone falls within the unambiguous, plain  reading of ""use of a computer"" as it appears in §  2G2.1(b)(6). Accordingly, we aﬃrm as to this issue. E. Downward variance Crow lastly argues the court abused its discretion in  denying a downward variance, because the facts and  circumstances of his USCA11 Case: 22-14267 Document: 31-1 Date Filed:  12/07/2023 Page: 10 of 10 10 Opinion of the Court 22-14267 case place [*11]  it outside the heartland of cases for  which the Sentencing Guidelines were intended to  apply. Because our vacatur and re-mand of Crow's  sentence under Issue I will result in a new sentenc-ing  hearing under a new Guidelines range, we do not  address the merits of the district court's denial of a  downward variance.",0
"United States v. Cutler, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 32169","KOBES, Circuit Judge. Jordan Cutler pleaded guilty to distributing child  pornography, 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2). The district court  varied up from a Guidelines range of 108 to 135 months  and sentenced him to 180 months in prison. Cutler  argues that the court procedurally erred in calculating  the Guidelines range and that his sentence is  substantively unreasonable. We affirm. I. Cutler says that the district court erred by assessing one  criminal history point under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(c) for a set  of uncounseled Arkansas misdemeanors from 2010.  See United States v. Luscombe, 950 F.3d 1021, 1031  (8th Cir. 2020) (HN1[ ] ""[Significant procedural] errors  include . . . incorrectly calculating[] the Guidelines range  . . . .""). ""In reviewing a sentence for significant  procedural error, we review the district court's factual  findings for clear error and application of the [*2]   Guidelines de novo."" Id. (cleaned up) (citation omitted).  And ""we may affirm on any ground supported by the  record."" United States v. Garrido, 995 F.2d 808, 813  (8th Cir. 1993). The 2010 misdemeanors included one count of criminal  trespass, two counts of criminal mischief, and one count  of theft of property. Cutler was ordered to pay fines and  costs for each count, and he received a 30-day    Page 3 of 4 suspended prison sentence. Cutler testified that he  never received counsel and never waived his right to it.  Though the district court believed him, it still gave him  the point. That point made the difference between a  criminal history category of I and II, raising his  Guidelines range from 97-121 months to 108-135  months. HN2[ ]  The  Sixth  Amendment  guarantees  a  misdemeanor defendant's right to counsel where he  receives a suspended prison sentence. Alabama v.  Shelton, 535 U.S. 654, 662, 674, 122 S. Ct. 1764, 152  L. Ed. 2d 888 (2002). All agree on appeal that Cutler  had this right, did not waive it, and was not represented.  But the parties disagree about the consequences of the  constitutional deprivation. Cutler says that it tainted the  convictions, so the court could not use any of them to  assess a criminal history point. The Government argues  that it only invalidated the unconstitutional sentence; the  convictions with associated fines survive and support a  criminal [*3]  history point. Our precedent is clear: the constitutional deprivation  invalidates only Cutler's suspended prison sentence.  United States v. White, 529 F.2d 1390, 1394 (8th Cir.  1976) (vacating invalid suspended prison sentence for  an  uncounseled  misdemeanor  but  affirming  the  conviction  with  associated  fines).  The  2010  misdemeanor convictions remain intact with the  associated fines. Cf. Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367, 373- 74, 99 S. Ct. 1158, 59 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1979) (holding a  penalty of fines with no prison term imposed for an  uncounseled misdemeanor does not implicate the Sixth  Amendment right to counsel). HN3[ ] And uncounseled  misdemeanor convictions with fines, ""valid under Scott  because no prison term was imposed, [are] also valid  when used to enhance punishment at a subsequent  conviction."" Nichols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738, 748- 49, 114 S. Ct. 1921, 128 L. Ed. 2d 745 (1994). Although the district court could not consider Cutler's  invalid suspended prison sentence in its criminal history  calculation, it could consider the constitutionally valid  fines that he received for his criminal mischief and theft         of property convictions. See United States v. Long, No.  97-1440, 1997 WL 375191, at *1 (8th Cir. July 9, 1997)  (per  curiam)  (assuming  without  deciding  that  misdemeanor defendant's conviction resulting in a  suspended prison sentence was uncounseled and  concluding  that  his  ""probationary  sentence  and  monetary fine provided a basis for assessing the  criminal history point""); United States v. Acuna-Reyna,  677 F.3d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir. 2012) (affirming use of  ""constitutionally [*4]  valid portion of a sentence"" in  calculating criminal history); United States v. Jackson,  493 F.3d 1179, 1183 (10th Cir. 2007) (Gorsuch, J.)  (same); United States v. Ortega, 94 F.3d 764, 769 (2d  Cir. 1996) (same). These sentences support the district  court's  one-point  assessment  for  Cutler's  2010  misdemeanors, so we find no procedural error. II. HN4[ ]  Cutler  also  challenges  the  substantive  reasonableness of his above-Guidelines sentence,  which we review under a ""deferential abuse-of- discretion standard."" United States v. Feemster, 572  F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir. 2009) (en banc) (citation  omitted). A district court abuses its discretion if it ""fails to  consider a relevant factor that should have received  significant weight, gives significant weight to an  improper or irrelevant factor, or considers only  appropriate factors but nevertheless commits a clear  error of judgment by arriving at a sentence that lies  outside the limited range of choice dictated by the facts  of the case."" United States v. Fiorito, 640 F.3d 338, 352  (8th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). It is ""the unusual case  when we reverse a district court sentence—whether  within, above, or below the applicable Guidelines  range—as substantively unreasonable."" Feemster, 572  F.3d at 464. Cutler argues that the district court abused its discretion  by focusing on offense conduct that the Guidelines  already  captured  in  his  offense  characteristic  enhancements. See U.S.S.G. § 2G2.1(b). But the court  found that the Guidelines [*5]  did not reflect the           Page 4 of 4 ""heinous"" nature of Cutler's offense. They did not  capture Cutler's threats to kidnap, rape, torture, and kill  young girls—including a five-year-old. Nor did they show  that he conditioned those threats on his victims  documenting sex acts on themselves and other minors.  Cutler's sentencing enhancements told a story, just not  the whole one. The court was free to consider the whole  story in weighing the § 3553(a) factors and varying up.  See Fiorito, 640 F.3d at 352 (HN5[ ] ""[A] district court  may impose an upward variance based on facts already  included in the advisory sentencing guidelines where  the advisory guidelines do not fully account for those  facts.""). Cutler also says that the district court abused its  discretion by considering its reputation and public  perception, which he says is an improper factor. The  court posed a hypothetical: ""If I'm sitting in the barber  shop talking to the fellows, and I tell them somebody  went into Court and here's all of the stuff he did and he  got ten years, what would the average guy sitting on the  park bench in the barbershop say? They would say,  there is no justice in this world."" Cutler claims that this  comment shows that the court succumbed to ""peer  pressure"" when [*6]  it varied up. We don't think so. The  court was wrestling with ""the need for the sentence  imposed . . . to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to  promote respect for the law, and to provide just  punishment for the offense."" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A).  It found that no one—not the court, the public (that  ""average guy"" in the barbershop), nor even Cutler— would find the Guidelines reasonable in this case. This  was not an abuse of discretion. III. The district court's judgment is affirmed.",0
"United States v. Dexter, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111","ORDER SUSAN RICHARD NELSON, United States District  Judge This matter is before the Court on Defendant Charles  William Dexter, III's Objection [Doc. No. 98] to United  States Magistrate Judge Becky Thorson's June 6, 2022  Report and Recommendation (""R&R"") [Doc. No. 96]. In  the R&R, Magistrate Judge Thorson recommends that  Dexter's Motion to Dismiss for Selective, Discriminatory,  Vindictive Prosecution [Doc. No. 44], Second Motion to  Dismiss for Vindictive Prosecution [Doc. No. 65], and  Motion to Suppress Evidence Obtained as a Result of  Searches and Seizure and for a Franks Hearing [Doc.  No. 39] be denied. For the reasons set forth below, the  Court overrules Dexter's Objection, adopts the R&R in  full, and DENIES Dexter's motions. I. BACKGROUND The factual background of this case is more fully set  forth in the R&R, which the Court incorporates by  reference. (R&R [Doc. No 96] at 2-15.) Dexter is  charged with Sex Trafficking of a Minor, Sex Trafficking  by Force, [*2]  Fraud, and Coercion, and Use of  Interstate Facility To Promote Unlawful Activity in  violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 1594(a), and 1952(a)(3).  (Superseding Indictment [Doc. No. 58] at 1-4.) Dexter moves for a hearing pursuant to Franks v.  Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d  667 (1978), arguing that five search warrant affidavits  for search warrants executed by the Government  contained deliberate falsehoods or averments in  reckless disregard for the truth. (Def.'s Mot to Suppress  [Doc. No. 39] at 2-3.) Dexter further contends that  evidence obtained during the execution of all five  Page 2 of 9 warrants should be suppressed because the affidavits  supporting the warrants failed to establish probable  cause. (Id.; Def.'s Supp. Mem. Mot. to Suppress [Doc.  No 88] at 1.) Finally, Dexter moves for dismissal of his  case based on selective and vindictive prosecution.  (Mot. Dismiss for Selective, Discriminatory, Vindictive  Prosecution [Doc. No 44] at 5; Mot. Dismiss for  Vindictive Prosecution [Doc. No. 65] at 1-2.) A. The Warrant for the Cadillac On August 14, 2020, Bloomington Police Department  Detective Kristin Boomer obtained a search warrant to  search a 2009 Cadillac. (USA Decl. [Doc. No. 73], Ex. 2  (""Cadillac Warrant"") [Doc. No 74-1].) In the warrant  affidavit, Detective Boomer averred that the [*3]   department received a tip from the United States  Marshal Service that ""an adult male who was a  Registered Predatory Offender was possibly staying at a  Bloomington hotel with a juvenile female."" (Id. at 2.)  Detective  Boomer  summarized  the  department's  investigative efforts to find the juvenile female, including  locating two online advertisements soliciting prostitution,  searching the phone number listed in one of the  advertisements, and responding to that advertisement.  (Id. at 2-3.) While responding to the advertisement,  Detective Boomer averred that officers were told, via  text message, to go to a specific room at a Courtyard  Marriott Hotel in Bloomington, Minnesota. (Id.) Upon  arriving at the hotel, officers found that the room was  unoccupied, but officers observed condoms lying in  plain view. (Id. at 2.) Officers then located two  individuals near the hotel: a 14-year-old girl, MMV, and  a 21-year-old woman, TLRB. (Id. at 3.) Detective Boomer then summarizes a discussion  officers had with MMV in which she explained that she  was ""going to have sex in exchange for money""  because ""Dexter wanted her to."" (Id. at 3.) She also  described her relationship with Dexter, including the fact  that [*4]  she ""had sex with Dexter earlier in the day,""  that Dexter coached her on how to interact with  ""clients,"" and that he drove her to the hotel in a silver  Cadillac. (Id.) MMV also mentioned that a woman  named ""Shonda"" may have created the advertisement  to which the officers responded. (Id.) The warrant  affidavit indicates that MMV was then transported to the  hospital to complete a sexual assault exam. (Id. at 4.) The warrant affidavit also describes a conversation  between officers and TLRB in which TLRB explained  that she was driven to the hotel by a man matching  Dexter's description, and a second woman nicknamed  ""Honey,"" for purposes of having sex for money. (Id. at 3- 4.) Detective Boomer than averred that officers located and  impounded an unoccupied Cadillac registered to Dexter  in the Marriott parking lot. (Id.) The warrant affidavit  notes that officers observed two boxes of condoms in  the car. (Id.) After Dexter was identified, officers put a ""probable  cause pick up alert for [him.]"" (Id. at 4.) Detective  Boomer explained that officers used Dexter's phone and  officer surveillance to locate Dexter and a woman  named L.G. (Id.) Detective Boomer averred that Dexter  then called the police [*5]  department to locate the  impounded Cadillac, went to retrieve the vehicle at the  police department, and was arrested upon his arrival.  (Id. at 4-5.) B. The Warrant for a DNA Sample On the same day, August 14, 2020, Detective Boomer  obtained a second search warrant to obtain a DNA  Sample from Dexter. (Id., Ex. 1 (""DNA Warrant"") [Doc.  No 74] at 6-7.) In the warrant affidavit, Detective  Boomer restated much of the content contained in the  warrant affidavit to search the Cadillac, but included  some additional observations. Detective Boomer averred that she went to the hospital  to speak with MMV, and that she spoke to a social  worker who confirmed that MMV had a Sexual Assault  Evidence (SAE) Kit completed during a SAE exam. (Id.)  Detective Boomer reviewed hospital paperwork, and  learned that MMV admitted to having sexual relations  with Dexter. (Id.) The warrant affidavit then requests a  DNA sample, so officers could compare it to DNA  evidence and other evidence from the SAE kit collected  from MMV. (Id.) C. Warrant for LG Smartphone On August 15, 2020, Officer Jacob Lucas of the  Bloomington Police Department obtained a third warrant  to search an LG Smartphone found in Dexter's  possession at the [*6]  time of his arrest. (Id., Ex. 3  (""Phone Warrant"") [Doc. No. 74-2] at 1.) The warrant  affidavit for the LG Smartphone contained many of the  same facts recited in the warrant affidavit for the  Cadillac. 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111, *2 Page 3 of 9 Officer Lucas also stated that he knew from his ""training  and experience, [that]electronic devices such as smart  phones are often used by sex traffickers and those  involved in prostitution to set up 'dates' and discuss  other illegal matters."" He averred that the phone may  contain ""information about the sex trafficking and  prostitution along with information about Dexter's  relationship with minor victim MMV."" (Id. at 5.) D. Warrant for Dexter's Residence and Other  Vehicles On August 19, 2020, Detective Boomer obtained a  fourth search warrant for Dexter's residence, and for two  more vehicles. (Id., Ex. 4 (""Vehicle and Residence  Warrant"") [Doc. No. 74-3].) The warrant affidavit for this  fourth search warrant contained many of the same facts  recited in warrant affidavit for the LG Smartphone. Detective Boomer also included details about the arrest  of L.G. and Dexter, and a forensic interview with MMV in  which she detailed multiple sexual assaults that  occurred in various parts of Dexter's home. [*7]  (Id. at  5-6.) Detective Boomer also described evidence  indicating the presence of guns in Dexter's home,  including information provided by Hennepin County  Child  Protection  Investigator  Jodie  Glaspie  who  interviewed Dexter's child, and photos of guns  recovered from Dexter's phone. (Id. at 6.) Additionally,  the warrant affidavit describes a phone call Dexter made  from jail asking another person to go to his home and  retrieve money. (Id. at 7.) Detective Boomer averred that ""[a]n unannounced entry  [wa]s necessary []to prevent the loss, destruction or  removal of the objects of the search and to protect the  safety of the peace officers[]."" (Id.) She knew from  previous investigations that ""individuals who are  engaged in the promotion of prostitution and sexual  assault crimes maintain methods to destroy evidence in  a rapid and expedient manner and they will sometimes  maintain weapons for their protection and the protection  of the women engaged in the prostitution."" (Id.) Further,  she averred that an unannounced entry would allow  officers to maintain an ""element of surprise"" that would  ""preserve officer safety but also the safety of other  citizens in the neighborhood and any suspects in  the [*8]  residence."" (Id.) E. Warrant for Cell Phone Records On August 24, 2020, Detective Boomer obtained a fifth  search warrant for records and data connected to two T- Mobile phone numbers associated with L.G. and  Defendant. (Id., Ex. 5, (""T-Mobile Phones Warrant"")  [Doc. No. 74-4].) The warrant affidavit for this fifth  warrant contained many of the same facts recited in the  warrant affidavit for the Cadillac. Detective Boomer also  noted that Dexter denied ever being at the Courtyard  Marriott. Detective Boomer further noted that the cell  phone data stored by T-Mobile would ""assist in  determining the location and activities of"" Dexter. (Id. at  5.) F. Indictment and Superseding Indictment On February 18, 2021, Dexter, was indicted on one  count of sex trafficking a minor. On March 20, 2022, a  Superseding Indictment charged two additional counts:  (1) sex trafficking by force, fraud, and coercion and (2)  use of an interstate facility to promote unlawful activity.  (Indictment [Doc. No. 3] at 1; Superseding Indictment at  1-4.) Dexter was offered a plea deal prior to the  Government obtaining the Superseding Indictment. (See  Gov. Mot. Frye/Lafler Hr'g [Doc. No. 51] at 2.) G. Magistrate Judge Thorson's Report [*9]  and  Recommendation The magistrate judge first found that a Franks hearing is  not warranted, as Dexter failed to make ""a substantial  preliminary showing that the affiants made intentional or  reckless false statements or that the warrant affidavit,  with  the  at-issue  statement  omitted,  would  be  insufficient to support a finding of probable cause.""  (R&R at 21.) Second, she found that the warrants at  issue were all supported by probable cause, and that,  even if not, the Leon good faith exception would apply.  (R&R at 22-29.) Finally, she found that Dexter's  allegations of selective and vindictive prosecution are  not supported by the record. (Id. at 31-36.) H. Dexter's Objection Dexter raises specific objections to: (1) the magistrate  judge's reference to TLRB as a victim; (2) her  recommendation that a Franks hearing be denied; and  (3) her finding that the warrants for the Cadillac and his  residence were supported by probable cause. (Obj.  [Doc. No. 98] at 1-4.) He also raises objections to her  denial of his motions to dismiss his claims for vindictive  and selective prosecution. (Obj. at 4-9.) 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111, *6 Page 4 of 9 II. DISCUSSION A. Standard of Review The district court reviews de novo those portions of the  R&R to which a specific [*10]  objection is made and  ""may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the  findings or recommendations made by the magistrate  judge."" 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1); accord D. Minn. L.R.  72.2(b). B. Magistrate Judge's Reference to TLRB as a  Victim Dexter takes issue with the magistrate judge's reference  to TLRB as a victim, arguing that the indictment does  not identify her as such. (Obj. at 1.) The Government  responds that victims need not be specifically identified  in an indictment to be referred to as such in a court  order. (Gov. Resp. to Obj. [Doc. No 100] at 2-3, n. 1.)  This reference is neither inappropriate, nor does it  impact the Court's analysis of the Defendant's motions. C. Defendant's Motion for a Franks Hearing Dexter is entitled to a Franks hearing only if he makes  ""a substantial preliminary showing that 'the probable  cause determination relied on an affidavit containing  false statements or omissions made knowingly and  intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth."" '  U.S. v. El-Alamin, 574 F.3d 915, 924-25 (8th Cir. 2009)  (citing United States v. Snyder, 511 F.3d 813, 816 (8th  Cir.)). ""This substantiality requirement is not met lightly  and requires a defendant to offer specific allegations  along with supporting affidavits or similarly reliable  statements."" U.S. v. Mayweather, 993 F.3d 1035, 1043  (8th Cir. 2021), reh'g denied (May 19, 2021) (citing  Snyder, 511 F.3d at 816). Additionally, Dexter  must [*11]  ""show that the alleged false statement or  omission was necessary to the finding of probable  cause."" United States v. Engler, 521 F.3d 965, 969 (8th  Cir. 2008). Each of the warrant affidavits that Dexter challenges  contained information about a tip officers received from  the US Marshal Service ""that an adult male who was a  Registered Predatory Offender was possibly staying at  the Bloomington hotel with a juvenile female."" (See e.g.,  USA Decl., Ex. 2 (""Cadillac Warrant"") at 2.) Dexter does  not suggest that the Bloomington Police Department did  not receive this tip. Instead, Defendant argues that  because the Bloomington Police Department had  access to Dexter's criminal history and could have  confirmed that he was not a predatory offender, this  detail was recklessly or intentionally included in the  warrant affidavit. (Obj. at 2-3.) In response, the  Government argues that Dexter has failed to meet his  substantial burden to warrant a Franks hearing. (Gov.  Resp. to Obj. at 4.) The Court agrees that Dexter has failed to make the  requisite  preliminary  showing  that  the  officers  intentionally or recklessly included a false statement in  the warrant affidavit because Dexter fails to submit any  evidence that the agent acted deliberately or recklessly.  U.S. v. Carpenter, 422 F.3d 738, 745 (8th Cir. 2005)  (finding [*12]   no  evidence  officers  recklessly  or  intentionally omitted from a warrant affidavit the fact that  a state court had suppressed an earlier search, as  Defendant did not demonstrate the omission was  intentional as opposed to negligent). Dexter suggests  Detective Boomer ""had actual knowledge"" that Dexter  was not a registered sexual offender because she had  access to his criminal record. (Def.'s Supp. Mem. Mot.  to Suppress at 3.) However, he provides no evidence ""to  establish that [Detective Boomer] deliberately or  recklessly omitted [this] information in an attempt to  mislead the issuing judicial officer."" Engler, 521 F.3d at  970 (affirming denial of Franks hearing when defendant  had no proof officers acted recklessly or intentionally in  drafting affidavit). At most, the record suggests this  could have been a negligent mistake, ""and unintentional  errors like those involved here are not the type of errors  that require suppression under Franks."" U.S. v. Juneau,  No. 19-cr-274-WMW-KMM, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  251041, 2020 WL 9170452, at *11 n. 12 (D. Minn. Dec.  21, 2020), R&R adopted, No. 19-cr-0274 (WMW/KMM),  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39805, 2021 WL 806368 (D.  Minn. Mar. 3, 2021) (finding no evidence of reckless or  intentional misconduct when an officer erroneously  overstated the criminal history of two individuals in a  warrant affidavit). Even if the Court were to assume that Dexter met his  substantial burden of [*13]  establishing that the agent  intentionally or recklessly included a false statement in  the warrant affidavit, his argument would still fail  because the affidavits established probable cause even  absent the challenged information. Engler, 521 F.3d at  970. The affidavits describe evidence that Dexter drove  an underaged girl to a hotel, that he sexually assaulted  the girl, and that he was involved in the sex trafficking of  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111, *9 Page 5 of 9 a minor. After an independent de novo review of the  files, records and proceedings in the above-entitled  matter, the Court finds that the affidavits at issue fully  support probable cause, even without the challenged  information. In light of the above, the Court denies Defendant's  motion for a Franks hearing. D. Probable Cause: Four-Corner Review of the  Search Warrant Affidavits The Fourth Amendment requires probable cause to be  shown before a search warrant is authorized. U.S.  Const. amend. IV; United States v. Williams, 477 F.3d  554, 557 (8th Cir. 2007). Probable cause exists where  there is a ""fair probability that contraband or evidence of  a crime will be found in a particular place given the  circumstances set forth in the affidavit."" United States. v.  Tellez, 217 F.3d 547, 549 (8th Cir. 2000). When the issuing judge relies solely upon a supporting  affidavit to issue the search warrant, ""only that  information which is found within the four corners  of [*14]  the affidavit may be considered in determining  the existence of probable cause."" United States v.  O'Dell, 766 F.3d 870, 874 (8th Cir. 2014). Judges  issuing  search  warrants  may  ""draw  reasonable  inferences from the totality of the circumstances"" when  reading a warrant application to determine whether  probable cause exists. United States v. Keele, 589 F.3d  940, 944 (8th Cir. 2009). Reviewing courts afford ""great  deference"" to the issuing judge's ""initial, on-the-scene  determination  that  probable  cause  has  been  established."" United States v. Colbert, 605 F.3d 573,  576 (8th Cir. 2010). As long as the issuing judge had a  ""substantial basis"" for determining that the search would  ""uncover evidence of wrongdoing,"" the Court must  uphold the probable cause determination. United States  v. Horn, 187 F.3d 781, 785 (8th Cir. 1999). Probable  cause ""does not require evidence sufficient to support a  conviction, nor even evidence demonstrating that it is  more likely than not that the suspect committed a  crime."" U.S. v. Miller, 11 F.4th 944, 953 (8th Cir. 2021),  cert. denied, 21-7753, 142 S. Ct. 2796, 2022 WL  1914258 (June 6, 2022) (citing United States v.  Donnelly, 475 F.3d 946, 954 (8th Cir. 2007)). 1. Probable Cause for Search of 2009 Cadillac Dexter contends that there was no nexus established  between the alleged crime and the Cadillac, and he  argues that the magistrate judge's probable cause  determination erroneously relied on the tip from the  informant, and the two boxes of condoms located in  plain sight in the Cadillac. (Obj. at 5.) The Court finds that the search warrant affidavit  established [*15]  a sufficient nexus between the place  to be searched and the evidence of a crime. The  affidavit linked Dexter to suspected sex-trafficking and  sexual assault through officer observations, text  messages, and interviews with MMV and TLRB, (USA  Decl., Ex. 2 (""Cadillac Warrant"") at 3-4), and linked  Dexter to the Cadillac through the same interviews, as  well as through a public record search and a phone call  from Dexter asking after the vehicle. (Id. at 3-5.) Officers  were able to link the Cadillac to the alleged crimes  through the interviews with MMV and TLRB, as both  victims explained that they were driven to the hotel by a  man matching Dexter's description, in a Cadillac  matching the description of the vehicle that was subject  to the warrant. (Id. at 3.) Further, Officers were able to  see two boxes of condoms in plain sight in the vehicle.  (Id. at 4.) The Court notes that ""[w]hether probable cause exists to  issue a search warrant is a commonsense, practical  question  to  be  judged  from  the  totality-of-the- circumstances."" Donnelly, 475 F.3d at 954 (cleaned up)  (citation omitted). When considered together, the facts  set forth in the warrant affidavit demonstrate a ""fair  probability"" that evidence of Defendant's criminal [*16]   activity would be found in the Cadillac. Tellez, 217 F.3d  at 549. Thus, the information in the affidavit established  the requisite nexus between the Cadillac and the  alleged crime. 2. Probable Cause Existed for Search of Dexter's  Residence and Two Vehicles Dexter contends that any link between his residence  and the alleged sexual assault and sex trafficking was  highly attenuated, and that the search warrant affidavit  failed to state with any specificity ""why any of the items  sought would be in the residence at the time the warrant  was sought."" (Obj. at 6.) The Court agrees with the magistrate judge that the  affidavit in question contained sufficient detail to  establish a nexus between Dexter's residence and the  alleged crime. In the affidavit, Detective Boomer averred  that MMV described multiple sexual assaults in the  residence, and the use of multiple cars to drive her to  meet clients. (USA Decl., Ex. 4 (""Vehicle and Residence  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111, *13 Page 6 of 9 Warrant"") at 6.) These facts indicate a ""fair probability""  that evidence of Defendant's alleged criminal activity  would be found in his home and other vehicles. Tellez,  217 F.3d at 549. Additionally, the officer explained that guns are  frequently kept by individuals involved in sex trafficking  as a form of [*17]  protection for themselves and the  women they are trafficking. (Id. at 7.) The affidavit  described pictures of guns found on Dexter's phone,  and an interview with his daughter in which she  described finding a gun in a pillowcase. (Id. at 6-7.)  Because the warrant established probable cause that  Nelson unlawfully possessed firearms, probable cause  existed to search his residence for firearms, as people  ""generally keep [firearms] at home or on their persons.""  United States v. Cowling, 648 F.3d 690, 696 (8th Cir.  2011). 3. Probable Cause for Warrants for DNA, Cell  Phones, and Cell Phone Data Dexter does not assert any specific objection to the  magistrate judge's analysis of probable cause for the  warrant affidavit for Dexter's DNA. After an independent  de novo review of the files, records and proceedings in  the above-entitled matter, the Court finds that the  search warrant for Dexter's DNA was supported by  probable cause. Dexter also did not assert any specific objections to the  magistrate judge's analysis of probable cause for the  warrant affidavits for the searches of Dexter's cell phone  and for the cell data stored by T-Mobile. After an  independent de novo review of the files, records and  proceedings in the above-entitled matter, the Court  finds [*18]  that there was probable cause for those  searches. E. Good-Faith Exception Moreover, even if probable cause did not exist, the  good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule would  apply here. Although evidence obtained in violation of  the Fourth Amendment must generally be excluded, if  officers obtained the evidence pursuant to a warrant and  reasonably relied on the issuing judge's probable cause  determination, the disputed evidence will be admitted.  United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 906, 104 S. Ct.  3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984); United States v.  Hudspeth, 525 F.3d 667, 676 (8th Cir. 2008). ""[T]he fact that a neutral [judge] has issued a warrant is  the clearest indication that the officers acted in an  objectively reasonable manner, or in objective good  faith."" Messerschmidt v. Millender, 565 U.S. 535, 546,  132 S. Ct. 1235, 182 L. Ed. 2d 47 (2012) (internal  quotation omitted). There is no evidence here to  suggest that the officers' reliance on the warrants was  unreasonable or not in good faith. Accordingly, even if  probable cause was lacking with respect to the search  warrant affidavits, the evidence is admissible under the  good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule. F. No-Knock Warrant Dexter maintains that the no-knock warrant executed at  his residence violated his Fourth Amendment rights.  (Obj. at 6.) The Eighth Circuit has held that the  requirements for a valid search warrant under the  Fourth  Amendment  incorporate  the  common-law  requirement that police [*19]  officers entering a dwelling  must ""knock and announce"" their presence and purpose  before attempting forcible entry. Doran v. Eckold, 409  F.3d 958, 962-63 (8th Cir. 2005) (citing Wilson v.  Arkansas, 514 U.S. 927, 929, 115 S. Ct. 1914, 131 L.  Ed. 2d 976 (1995)); Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U.S.  385, 387, 117 S. Ct. 1416, 137 L. Ed. 2d 615 (1997).  However, the Fourth Amendment does not forbid all no- knock searches, ""[r]ather, it requires that searching  officers justify dispensing with the knock-and-announce  requirement."" U.S. v. Scroggins, 361 F.3d 1075, 1081  (8th Cir. 2004) (analyzing whether a no-knock warrant  was properly issued and executed). The showing that officers must make to obtain a no- knock warrant ""is the same showing they must make to  justify their own decision to dispense with the knock- and-announce requirement. Only the timing differs."" Id.  at 1082. A no-knock entry is justified if officers ""show  they had a reasonable suspicion that knocking and  announcing  their  presence  under  the  particular  circumstances would threaten officer safety, be futile, or  inhibit the investigation of the crime."" Id. Thus, when ""a  warrant applicant gives reasonable grounds to expect  futility or to suspect that one or another such exigency  already exists or will arise instantly upon knocking, a  magistrate judge is acting within the Constitution to  authorize a 'no-knock' entry."" U.S. v. Banks, 540 U.S.  31, 36 (2003), 124 S. Ct. 521, 157 L. Ed. 2d 343. First, to the extent that Dexter asks the Court to find that  the magistrate judge misapplied Hudson v. Michigan,  547 U.S. 586, 126 S. Ct. 2159, 165 L. Ed. 2d 56 (2006),  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111, *16 Page 7 of 9 his objection [*20]  is overruled. As the magistrate judge  explained, the proper remedy for an improper no-knock  warrant is not to exclude evidence retrieved during the  search. (R&R at 30-31.) Thus, this Court will not  suppress evidence retrieved during the execution of the  no-knock warrant. See also United States v. Gaver, 452  F.3d 1007, 1008 (8th Cir. 2006) (citing Hudson, 547  U.S. at 589-90) (""The exclusionary rule does not apply  to violations of the knock-and-announce requirement of  the Fourth Amendment.""). The Court also notes that the unannounced entry  authorized by the search warrant was appropriate given  information in the affidavit suggesting that there were  likely firearms in Dexter's residence and that others had  access to his residence, and thus those firearms. See  United States v. Stevens, 439 F.3d 983, 988-989 (8th  Cir. 2006) (finding that a no-knock search warrant was  justified based on the presence of a firearm in a  common area of the house as reported by a confidential  informant). Additionally, the affidavit contained sufficient  averments that officers were concerned that evidence  would be destroyed during the execution of the warrant.  (USA Decl., Ex. 4 (""Vehicle and Residence Warrant"") at  9 (""Your affiant knows from previous investigations that  individuals who are engaged in the promotion of  prostitution  and  sexual  assault  crimes  maintain  methods [*21]  to destroy evidence in a rapid and  expedient manner. . . . An unannounced entry presents  a higher likelihood to allow police to gain entry and  control any suspects prior to them having the  opportunity to arm themselves or destroy evidence."").)  See U.S. v. Tyler, 238 F.3d 1036, 1040 (8th Cir. 2001)  (holding a no-knock warrant was appropriate when  officers attested that a defendant was likely to destroy  evidence of his drug crimes). Accordingly, the no-knock  warrant did not violate Dexter's Fourth Amendment  rights. G. There is No Evidence of Vindictive or Selective  Prosecution Dexter objects to the magistrate judge's finding that  there is no evidence of selective or vindictive  prosecution. He alleges that he has established he is  the victim of selective prosecution based on the  disparate treatment of his co-conspirator, L.G. (Obj. at  8-9.) He further contends that the Government sought a  superseding indictment because he refused to sign a  plea agreement, which he argues establishes a  presumption of vindictive prosecution. (Id. at 9.) 1. There is No Evidence to Support a Claim Of  Selective Prosecution A defendant asserting a claim of selective prosecution  must demonstrate: ""[(1)] that he has been singled out for  prosecution while others similarly situated [*22]  have  not been prosecuted for similar conduct and [(2)] that  the government's action in thus singling him out was  based on an impermissible motive such as race,  religion, or the exercise of constitutional rights."" United  States v. Leathers, 354 F.3d 955, 963 (8th Cir. 2004)  (citation omitted). A defendant bears the burden of  proving that the government engaged in selective  prosecution. United States v. Hirsch, 360 F.3d 860, 864  (8th Cir. 2004). This ""evidentiary burden is a heavy  one."" U.S. v. Peterson, 652 F.3d 979, 981 (8th Cir.  2011) (citing Leathers, 354 F.3d at 961). Dexter has failed to show that persons similarly situated  to him were not prosecuted for similar conduct.  ""Defendants  are  similarly  situated  when  their  circumstances present no distinguishable legitimate  prosecutorial factors that might justify making different  prosecutorial decisions with respect to them."" United  States v. Heying, No. 14-cr-30 (JRT/SER), 2014 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 147499, 2014 WL 5286153, at *12 (D. Minn.  Aug. 15, 2014), report and recommendation adopted,  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147799, 2014 WL 5286155, at  *1, 7 (D. Minn. Oct. 15, 2014); see also United States v.  Smith, 231 F.3d 800, 810 (11th Cir. 2000) (holding that  individuals are similarly situated for purposes of a  selective  prosecution  claim  when,  among  other  requirements, they ""committed the same basic crime in  substantially the same manner as the defendant—so  that any prosecution of that individual would have the  same deterrence value and would be related in the  same way to the Government's enforcement priorities  and enforcement plan""). Moreover, the evidence [*23]   against the unprosecuted person must be ""as strong, or  stronger, than that against the defendant."" Smith, 231  F.3d at 810. As the magistrate judge discussed, there are marked  differences between Dexter's conduct here and L.G.'s  involvement. (R&R  at 33 (""[T]here are several  distinguishable legitimate prosecutorial factors that  justify the Government's decision to federally prosecute  Defendant and not L.G., including that, unlike the  Defendant, L.G. did not recruit the victim to perform  commercial sex acts, sexually assault the victim, or  arrange for sexual buyers from which he took half the  proceeds."").) The Court concludes that these issues are  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133111, *19 Page 8 of 9 clearly ""distinguishable legitimate prosecutorial factors""  that preclude a finding that L.G. was similarly situated to  Dexter. Heying, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147499, 2014  WL 5286153, at *12. Nor has Dexter demonstrated that prosecutors acted  with discriminatory purpose. A defendant may not  simply assert that gender was a factor in a prosecutor's  decision, instead he must offer ""credible evidence"" of  impermissible motive. See Hirsch, 360 F.3d at 864.  Here, Dexter offers ""no credible evidence"" that gender  played a role in the Government's charging decisions,  Peterson, 652 F.3d at 981, and instead he offers  unsupported speculation and conjecture. Thus, Dexter  has failed to meet [*24]  the second prong. Because  Defendant has not met his burden with respect to either  element of his selective prosecution claim, his claim  fails, and his motion to dismiss based on selective  prosecution is denied. 2. There is No Evidence to Support a Claim Of  Vindictive Prosecution After offering Dexter a plea deal, which he refused, the  government sought a Superseding Indictment, charging  Dexter with two additional Counts: (1) sex trafficking by  force, fraud, and coercion and (2) use of an interstate  facility to promote unlawful activity. (Superseding  Indictment at 1-4.) Dexter contends that the decision to  seek a superseding indictment from the grand jury was  intended to punish him for refusing the plea deal. (Obj.  at 9.) ""Vindictive prosecution occurs when a prosecutor seeks  to punish a defendant solely for exercising a valid legal  right."" United States v. Williams, 793 F.3d 957, 963 (8th  Cir. 2015) (citing Leathers, 354 F.3d at 961). As the  Magistrate Judge noted, the Supreme Court has found  that due process is not violated when a prosecutor  carries out a threat made during plea negotiations to  have the accused reindicted on more serious charges if  he does not plead guilty. Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434  U.S. 357, 365, 98 S. Ct. 663, 54 L. Ed. 2d 604 (1978);  see also United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 102  S. Ct. 2485, 73 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1982) (finding no  presumption of vindictiveness where a defendant faced  additional charges [*25]  after he decided not to plead  guilty). A defendant bears a heavy burden ""to show that the  prosecution was vindictive, in light of the discretion  prosecutors are given in performing their duties."" United  States v. Robinson, 809 F.3d 991, 1000 (8th Cir. 2016).  The Court must remain ""mindful of the broad discretion  given to prosecutors in carrying out their duty to enforce  criminal statutes."" Leathers, 354 F.3d at 961 (citing  United States v. Kelley, 152 F.3d 881, 885-86 (8th Cir.  1998)). In the R&R, the magistrate judge properly observed that  charging a defendant with a more serious charge after  he declines to plead guilty to a lesser charge, without  more, does not violate due process. Bordenkircher, 434  U.S. at 363 (""[I]n the ""give-and-take"" of plea bargaining,  there is no such element of punishment or retaliation so  long as the accused is free to accept or reject the  prosecution's offer.""); Goodwin, 457 U.S. at 380 (""[J]ust  as a prosecutor may forgo legitimate charges already  brought in an effort to save the time and expense of  trial, a prosecutor may file additional charges if an initial  expectation that a defendant would plead guilty to lesser  charges proves unfounded."")). Thus, Dexter's claim for  vindictive prosecution fails. In sum, the Court fully agrees with the magistrate judge  that there is no basis to dismiss the Superseding  Indictment on grounds of vindictive prosecution. [*26]   Dexter's motion to dismiss on this basis is therefore  denied.",1
"United States v. Friend, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 32368","[*1] Appeal from the United States District Court for the  Eastern District of Virginia, at Norfolk. John A. Gibney,  Jr., Senior District Judge. (2:22-cr-00042-JAG-RJK-1) Submitted: November 30, 2023 Decided: December 7,  2023 Before WILKINSON and HARRIS, Circuit Judges, and  TRAXLER, Senior Circuit Judge. Vacated and remanded by unpublished per curiam  opinion. ON BRIEF: Geremy C. Kamens, Federal Public  Defender, Frances H. Pratt, Assistant Federal Public  Defender, Keith Loren Kimball, Assistant Federal Public  Defender, OFFICE OF THE FEDERAL PUBLIC  DEFENDER,  Alexandria,  Virginia,  for  Appellant.  Jacqueline Romy Bechara, Alexandria, Virginia, Emily  Rebecca Gantt, OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES  ATTORNEY, Norfolk, Virginia, for Appellee. Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this  circuit. PER CURIAM: Christafer Douglas Friend seeks to appeal the life  sentence imposed following his guilty plea, pursuant to  a written plea agreement, to attempted sex trafficking of  a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 1591(a)(1),  (b)(1). The district court additionally imposed a lifetime  term  of  supervised  release.  Friend  raises  two  challenges on appeal. First, he contends that his life  sentence  is  substantively  and  procedurally  unreasonable. [*2]  Second, he argues that the district  court reversibly erred by including a discretionary  condition of supervised release (the ""special computer  condition"") * in the written judgment that it did not orally  pronounce at sentencing. Friend contends that this error  requires us to vacate his sentence and remand for  resentencing. Invoking the waiver of appeal rights contained in the  plea agreement, the Government has moved to dismiss  the appeal to the extent Friend challenges the  reasonableness of his sentence. The Government also  moves to vacate, in part. It acknowledges the district  court's error in failing to pronounce the special computer  condition and concedes that this argument is not barred  by the appeal waiver. However, the Government argues  that, for various reasons, a full resentencing is  inappropriate. * This condition mandates that Friend shall not own or have a computer in his residence or  place of employment. Also, the defendant shall not use  a computer to access any online computer services in  any location, including employment, without the prior  approval of the probation officer. This includes any  Page 2 of 2 internet service provider bulletin board systems, or any  other public or private [*3]  computer network. (J.A. 154). ""J.A."" refers to the joint appendix filed by the  parties in this appeal. 2 A district court is required to orally pronounce at  sentencing all discretionary conditions of supervised  release. United States v. Rogers, 961 F.3d 291, 296  (4th Cir. 2020); see also United States v. Singletary  (Singletary I), 984 F.3d 341, 345 (4th Cir. 2021). This  requirement ""is a critical part of the defendant's right to  be present at sentencing,"" Rogers, 961 F.3d at 300 (internal quotation marks  omitted), and ensures the defendant has an opportunity  to challenge unwarranted conditions before they are  imposed, id. at 298. The usual remedy for a  Rogers/Singletary error is to vacate the sentence and  remand for a full resentencing. See Singletary I, 984  F.3d at 346 & n.4. The Government argues that, in light of Friend's life  sentence, a full resentencing is unwarranted because  Friend ""likely will never be subject to the challenged  condition."" The Government therefore suggests that the  appropriate remedy is either simply to vacate the special  computer condition, or to vacate the condition and  remand for resentencing on that condition only.  However, ""defendants with valid Singletary claims are  entitled to a full vacatur of their sentences and remand  for resentencing."" United States v. Singletary (Singletary II), 75 F.4th 416, 427 n.7 (4th Cir. 2023)  (noting, however, that defendants raising such claims  can ""elect to request a narrower [*4]  remedy, in the  form of a limited remand on only the challenged  conditions""). Friend does not request a narrower  remedy. Although the Government attempts to distinguish these  cases, we find the Government's arguments for  departing from our established precedent unpersuasive.  We have recognized that ""custodial and supervised  release terms [are] components of one unified  sentence."" United States v. Ketter, 908 F.3d 61, 65 (4th  Cir. 2018); see SingletaryI, 984 F.3d at 346 & n.4  (rejecting suggestion to ""simply . . . strike"" challenged  conditions 3 from written judgment and reiterating that ""Rogers drew  no distinction between the defendant's supervised  release  sentence  and  his  custodial  sentence"").  Accordingly, we find that the usual remedy for a Rogers  error is appropriate in this case. Because this ""leaves us  with no occasion to reach [Friend's] other arguments,""  Singletary I, 984 F.3d at 346, we deny the Government's  motion. We therefore vacate Friend's sentence and remand for  resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because  the facts and legal contentions are adequately  presented in the materials before this court and  argument would not aid the decisional process. VACATED AND REMANDED 4",1
"United States v. Gil, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217887","[*1] Jason M. Frierson, United States Attorney and  Thomas W. Flynn, Trial Attorney, Tax  Division, as counsel for the United States of America,  and George P. Kelesis and Sunethra Muralidhara, as counsel for the defendant, Raul Gil, hereby stipulate  that the Plea Agreement for Defendant Raul Gil Pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(A) and (B) [ECF 7]  (""Plea Agreement"") filed in the above-entitled action on August 2, 2022, be amended to incorporate an  amendment to the federal sentencing guidelines that became effective November 1, 2023 and which will  be in effect at the time set for sentencing in this matter. This Stipulation is entered into for the following reasons:  1. On August 2, 2022 Defendant Raul Gil appeared  before the court and entered a plea  of guilty to a single count of tax evasion pursuant to 26  U.S.C. § 7201 as more fully set forth in the Criminal Information filed that same date [ECF 5] and  the contemporaneously filed Plea Agreement [ECF 7]. 2. The Plea Agreement including a number of stipulated  sentencing factors for the   court's consideration, including an acknowledgment  that ""[t]he District Court will determine   defendant's  criminal  history  category  under  the  sentencing guidelines.""  3. In April 2023, the U.S. Sentencing Commission [*2]   promulgated amendments,  including Amendment 821 to the federal sentencing  guidelines, which became effective November 1, 2023. 4. Part B of Amendment 821 creates a new section to  the guideline manual which  reads in pertinent part:  §4C1.1. Adjustment for Certain Zero-Point Offenders (a)Adjustment.- If the defendant meets all of the  following criteria: (1) the defendant did not receive any criminal history  Page 2 of 4 points from Chapter Four, Part A; (2) the defendant did not receive an adjustment under  §3A1.4 (Terrorism); (3) the defendant did not use violence or credible  threats of violence in connection with the offense; (4) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily  injury; (5) the instant offense of conviction is not a sex offense; (6) the defendant did not personally cause substantial  financial hardship; (7) the defendant did not possess, receive, purchase,  transport, transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of a firearm or other dangerous  weapon (or induce another participant to do so) in connection with the offense; (8) the instant offense of conviction is not covered by  §2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights); (9) the defendant did not receive an adjustment under  §3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable  Victim)  or  §3A1.5  (Serious  Human  Rights [*3]  Offense); and (10) the defendant did not receive an adjustment under  §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise, as  defined in 21 U.S.C. § 848; decrease the offense level determined under Chapters  Two and Three by 2 levels. 4. Defendant Gil has no prior criminal history and meets  all criteria for application of  the  2-level  adjustment  under  the  foregoing  recommended amendment.  5. Accordingly, the parties stipulate that Section VII  (Sentencing Factors), paragraphs  15 and 16, and Section VIII (Positions Regarding  Sentencing), paragraph 18, be amended to incorporate the provisions of the Amendment 821 to the Guidelines  Manual that will be effective at the time of sentencing as follows: VII. SENTENCING FACTORS   * * *  15. Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility: Under  USSG § 3E1.1(a), the United   States will recommend that defendant receive a two- level downward adjustment for   acceptance of responsibility unless defendant (a) fails  to truthfully admit facts  establishing a factual basis for the guilty plea when  defendant enters the plea; (b) fails  to truthfully admit facts establishing the amount of  restitution owed when defendant   enters the guilty plea; (c) provides false or misleading  information to [*4]  the United  States, the Court, Pretrial Services, or the Probation  Office; (d) denies involvement  in the offense or provides conflicting statements  regarding defendant's involvement   or falsely denies or frivolously contests conduct  relevant to the offense; (e) attempts  to withdraw defendant's guilty plea; (f) commits or  attempts to commit any crime;  (g) fails to appear in court; or (h) violates the conditions  of pretrial release.  Under USSG § 3E1.1(b), if the District Court determines  that defendant's total  offense level before operation of § 3E1.1(a) is 16 or  Page 3 of 4 higher, and if the United States   recommends  a  two-level  downward  adjustment  pursuant to the preceding paragraph,   the United States will move for an additional one-level  downward adjustment for  acceptance of responsibility before sentencing because  defendant communicated  defendant's decision to plead guilty in a timely manner  that enabled the United States   to avoid preparing for trial and to efficiently allocate its  resources. The United States  anticipates recommending a three-level reduction  pursuant to USSG §§3E1.1(a) and  (b).  16. Criminal History Category. Defendant acknowledges  that the District  Court may base defendant's sentence in part on  defendant's criminal [*5]  record or   criminal history. Assuming that Defendant has zero  points for his criminal history  category and is a ""zero-point offender"" under the criteria  established by section  §4C1.1. in Amendment 821, the total applicable offense  level in this matter is 21. A   total offense level of 21 results in a guideline range of  37-46 months.  VIII. POSITIONS REGARDING SENTENCING  18. The parties will jointly recommend that the District  Court impose a sentence   of 37 months' imprisonment. The parties agree that a  sentence of 37 months is  sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with  the purposes of 18 U.S.C. §  3553. The parties also agree that a term of supervised  release of three years is   appropriate, and that given the amount of mandatory  restitution to be paid by  Defendant, a fine is not necessary.  The parties acknowledge and agree that all other terms,  conditions, obligations, rights and  responsibilities set forth in the August 2, 2022 Plea  Agreement [ECF 7] shall remain in effect.   The parties represent this stipulation is made in good  faith for the purpose of promoting the   ends of justice.   DATED this 6th day of December 2023.  COOK & KELESIS, LTD.

"United States v. Mahee, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216654","OPINION AND ORDER The Court issues this written opinion and order to further  explain its oral ruling made during Richard Mahee's  sentencing on November 28, 2023, which concluded  that Mahee was not entitled to a ""zero point offender""  downward adjustment under § 4C1.1 of the United  States Sentencing Guidelines. I. Legal Issue Section 4C1.1 of the United States Sentencing  Guidelines (USSG or Guidelines) became effective on  November 1, 2023. It provides in relevant part: (a) ADJUSTMENT.—If the defendant meets all of  the following criteria: . . . . (10) the defendant did not receive an  adjustment under § 3B1.1 (Aggravating Role)  and was not engaged in a continuing criminal  enterprise, as defined in 21 U.S.C. § 848; decrease the offense level determined under  Chapters Two and Three by 2 levels. USSG § 4C1.1 (emphasis added) (the Zero-Point  Offender Adjustment). The parties disagreed on whether  Mahee was entitled to the Zero-Point Offender  Adjustment. [*2]  The Court concluded that he was not. II. Background Mahee and nine others were indicted in December 2021  on various charges related to a scheme to improperly  obtain loans through the federal Paycheck Protection  Program (PPP). On February 8, 2023, Mahee pleaded  guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud as charged in  Count 1 of the indictment. At sentencing, the Court  determined, without any objection from the parties, that  Mahee was subject to a 4-level aggravating role  enhancement under § 3B1.1 of the Guidelines. That  Guideline provides for an increase in the offense level if  the defendant served as an organizer or leader of  criminal activity involving at least five participants (the  Aggravating Role Adjustment).             Page 2 of 4 In its sentencing memorandum and during the  sentencing hearing, the Government objected to the  application of the Zero-Point Offender Adjustment on  the basis that Mahee was ineligible for it given the  Court's application of the Aggravating Role Adjustment.  Specifically, the Government argued that a defendant  could not be eligible for the Zero-Point Offender  Adjustment unless he satisfied both elements in §  4C1.1(a)(10)—meaning a defendant who received  either an Aggravating Role Adjustment or was engaged  in a continuing [*3]  criminal enterprise was disqualified. Mahee advocated for application of the Zero-Point  Offender Adjustment notwithstanding the aggravating  role finding, contending that the word ""and"" in USSG §  4C1.1(a)(10) ""should be taken literally as it reads,"" and  relying on United States v. Garcon, 54 F.4th 1274 (11th  Cir. 2022) (en banc). In short, Mahee's argument was  that because he was only subject to the Aggravating  Role Adjustment and was not engaged in a continuing  criminal enterprise (CCE), he was eligible for the  reduction. III. Discussion The Court begins and ends its analysis with the text of §  4C1.1(a), which is unambiguous. A defendant is only  entitled to the Zero-Point Offender Adjustment in §  4C1.1(a) if he meets every criterion listed in  subsections (1) through (10): ""If the defendant meets all  of the following . . . ."" USSG § 4C1.1(a) (emphasis  added). Those criteria are described in the negative— identifying things that the defendant cannot have done  and that the offense cannot have involved in order for  the downward adjustment to apply: (1) the defendant did not receive any criminal  history points from Chapter Four, Part A; (2)  the  defendant  did  not  receive  an  adjustment under §3A1.4 (Terrorism); (3) the defendant did not use violence or  credible threats of violence in connection with  the offense;     (4) the offense did not [*4]  result in death or  serious bodily injury; (5) the instant offense of conviction is not a  sex offense; (6) the defendant did not personally cause  substantial financial hardship; (7) the defendant did not possess, receive,  purchase, transport, transfer, sell, or otherwise  dispose of a firearm or other dangerous  weapon (or induce another participant to do so)  in connection with the offense; (8) the instant offense of conviction is not  covered  by  §2H1.1  (Offenses  Involving  Individual Rights); (9)  the  defendant  did  not  receive  an  adjustment  under  §3A1.1  (Hate  Crime  Motivation or Vulnerable Victim) or §3A1.5  (Serious Human Rights Offense); and (10) the defendant did not receive an  adjustment under §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role)  and was not engaged in a continuing criminal  enterprise, as defined in 21 U.S.C. § 848; decrease the offense level determined under  Chapters Two and Three by 2 levels. Id. (emphasis added). Reading the full context makes clear that the Zero-Point  Offender Adjustment can only apply when the defendant  has not done any of the things listed. If a defendant (or  the crime) meets just one of the listed factors, the  adjustment is not available. To be eligible, then, Mahee  cannot  have  received  an  Aggravating  Role  Adjustment. [*5]  He cannot have been engaged in a  CCE. The crime of which he was convicted cannot have  been a sex offense. He cannot have used violence in  the commission of the crime. And so on. Since he  conceded he was subject to the Aggravating Role  Adjustment and the Court applied it, Mahee is not  eligible for the Zero-Point Offender Adjustment. Mahee's read of § 4C1.1(a) would treat ""and"" in  subsection (10) to mean ""but."" His argument was that  he is entitled to the downward adjustment because he  did not both (1) receive an Aggravating Role Adjustment  and (2) engage in a CCE. As two appellate courts have  concluded in interpreting a very similar restriction,  however, Mahee's argument would only be correct if the  provision ""were phrased in terms of what the  Page 3 of 4 government would have to prove was true of the  defendant, but . . . the statute is phrased in terms of  what the defendant must show was not true of him.""  United States v. Draheim, 958 F.3d 651, 657 (7th Cir.  2020) (emphasis in original) (quoting United States v.  Bazel, 80 F.3d 1140, 1143 (6th Cir. 1996)). In Bazel, the Sixth Circuit interpreted use of the word  ""and"" in the safety-valve provision of the First Step Act,  18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(4), and corresponding Guideline, §  5C1.2. 80 F.3d 1140. The relevant language in Bazel is  effectively the same as that at issue here. Specifically, §  3553(f) provides: [T]he court shall impose a sentence . . . without  regard [*6]  to any statutory minimum sentence, if  the court finds at sentencing . . . that— . . . (4) the defendant was not an organizer, leader,  manager, or supervisor of others in the offense,  as determined under the sentencing guidelines  and was not engaged in a continuing criminal  enterprise, as defined in section 408 of the  Controlled Substances Act . . . . (Emphasis added.) Similar to the situation here, Bazel had not been found  to have participated in a CCE but did have an  aggravating role. Id. at 1141. Bazel made the same  argument that Mahee did—asserting the safety valve  should be applied because he was not both (1) a leader  in the offense and (2) engaged in a CCE. Id. at 1142.  The appellate court rejected that argument: Section 3553(f) and § 5C1.2 thus require the court  to make a finding both that the defendant was not  an ""organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor"" and  that the defendant was not engaged in a CCE in  order to open the ""safety valve."" Once the district  court determined that Bazel was an ""organizer,  leader, manager, or supervisor,"" it could not make  one of the findings necessary to opening the ""safety  valve."" Id. (emphasis in original). In rejecting the same type of  argument by the defendant in Draheim, the Seventh  Circuit adopted Bazel's reasoning. 958 F.3d 651. Mahee nevertheless contended [*7]  that the Court  should rely on the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in Garcon.    There, the court addressed the meaning of the word  ""and"" in a different subsection of the safety-valve  provision—§ 3553(f)(1). That section provides that the  defendant is eligible for the safety valve if he does not  have ""(A) more than 4 criminal history points . . .; (B) a  prior 3-point offense . . .; and (C) a prior 2-point violent  offense."" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1)(C) (emphasis added).  The Eleventh Circuit held that ""and"" really means  ""and""—i.e., the safety valve can be applied to the  defendant unless he meets (A), (B), and (C). This  makes sense given the structure of the provision. As  Garcon concluded, ""when 'and' is used to connect a list  of requirements, the word ordinarily has a 'conjunctive'  sense, meaning that all the requirements must be met.""  54 F.4th at 1278 (citing United States v. Palomar- Santiago,     U.S.    , 141 S. Ct. 1615, 1620-21, 209 L.  Ed. 2d 703 (2021)). Mahee argued that the Court should apply the same  logic to its interpretation of subsection (10) of the Zero- Point Offender Adjustment. But this ignores the  difference in structure between § 3553(f)(1) and USSG  § 4C1.1(a)(10). Subsections (A), (B), and (C) in §  3553(f)(1) list one set of factors, only the full set of  which will disqualify the defendant from safety-valve  consideration. By contrast, subsection (10) of § 4C1.1  (as does § 3553(f)(4)) identifies two separate role  adjustments the defendant must avoid to be eligible [*8]   for the Zero-Point Offender Adjustment. Section  4C1.1(a)(10) can only be properly read as allowing  application of that adjustment if the defendant ""did not  receive"" an Aggravating Role Adjustment and the  defendant ""was not engaged in"" a CCE. As the Bazel court explained, a defendant cannot  successfully argue that he must meet all of the  requirements in each subsection of § 3553(f)(1) through  (5), but that he need not meet ""the separate  requirements of the two portions of § 3553(f)(4)  separated by the word 'and.'"" 80 F.3d at 1144. Similarly  here, Mahee could not demonstrate entitlement to the  Zero-Point Offender Adjustment by arguing that he met  all of the requirements of subsections (1) through (9) but  only one of two parts contained in § 4C1.1(a)(10) that  are separated by the word ""and.""",0
"United States v. Munne, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216877","Order Denying Motion for Sentence Reduction This matter is before the Court on the Defendant  Thomas Munne's motion for reduction of sentence  pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). (Mot., ECF No. 97.)  The Government has responded opposing Munne's  motion. (Resp., ECF No. 99.) Munne has not replied,  and the time to do so has passed. After careful  consideration of the parties' written submissions, the  record, and the legal authorities, the Court denies  Munne's motion for reduction of sentence. (Mot., ECF  No. 97.) 1. Background On May 3, 2022, a federal grand jury indicted Munne  with conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery (Count  One), aiding and abetting Hobbs Act robbery (Count  Two), and carjacking (Count Three). (ECF No. 1.) In  October 2022, Munne proceeded to trial. On October  13, 2022, the jury convicted Munne of conspiracy to  commit [*2]  Hobbs Act robbery (Count One) and aiding  and abetting Hobbs Act robbery (Count Two), and  acquitted Munne of carjacking (Count Three). (ECF No.  58.) Ahead of Munne's sentencing, the United States  Probation Office prepared a Presentence Investigation  Report (""PSI""). After considering Munne's objections to  the PSI, the Court ultimately determined that Munne had  a total offense level of 35, a criminal history category of  I, and an advisory guideline range of 168-210 months.  (See Sentencing Tr. 8-9, ECF No. 85.) On January 3,  2023, the Court sentenced Munne to 168 months in  prison, followed by three years of supervised release.  (J. 2-3, ECF No. 75.) As of the filing of his motion,  Munne had served about 13% of his sentence. Since Munne was sentenced, the United States  Sentencing  Commission  issued  a  sentencing  adjustment for certain zero-point offenders, which  provides, in relevant part, for ""a decrease of two levels  from the offense level . . . for offenders who did not  receive any criminal history points . . . and whose  instant offense did not involve specified aggravating  factors""  (""Amendment  821"").  Munne  now  seeks  retroactive application of Amendment 821 to the Court's  judgment sentencing him to 168 months in prison [*3]   and three years of supervised release. 2. Legal Standard ""[A] motion to modify an otherwise final judgment  pursuant to § 3582(c)(2) is a limited and narrow  exception to the rule that final judgments are not to be  modified."" United States v. Armstrong, 347 F.3d 905,  Page 2 of 3 909 (11th Cir. 2003) (cleaned up). Specifically, §  3582(c)(2) provides: [I]n the case of a defendant who has been  sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a  sentencing range that has subsequently been  lowered by the Sentencing Commission . . ., the  court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after  considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a)  to the extent that they are applicable, if such a  reduction is consistent with applicable policy  statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. § 3582 (emphasis added). Thus, under §  3582(c)(2), the Court must undertake a two-step  process to determine whether a final sentence should  be modified based on a sentencing range that has been  lowered by the Sentencing Commission. First, the Court must determine if a retroactive  amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines indeed  lowered a defendant's guidelines range and whether a  reduction is consistent with the applicable policy  statements. Second, the Court must consider the §  3553(a) factors to determine if it will exercise its  discretion to reduce that defendant's [*4]  sentence. Among other things, the Sentencing Commission policy  statement applicable here provides that a court ""shall  not reduce the defendant's term of imprisonment under  18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) . . . to a term that is less than the  minimum of the amended guideline range[.]"" U.S.S.G. §  1B1.10(b)(2)(A). In addition, although Amendment 821  went into effect on November 1, 2023, the policy  statement ""delays the effective date of orders reducing a  defendant's term of imprisonment to a date no earlier  than February 1, 2024."" U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10 cmt. n. 7. In  other words, if a defendant is scheduled for release  before February 1, 2024, he is not entitled to relief under  Amendment 821. Finally, the § 3553(a) factors are: (1) the nature and  circumstances of the offense and the history and  characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the  sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the  offense, promote respect for the law, provide just  punishment for the offense, afford adequate deterrence  to criminal conduct, protect the public from further  crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with  needed educational or vocational training, medical care,  or other correctional treatment in the most effective  manner; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the  applicable sentencing guidelines range; [*5]  (5) any  pertinent policy statement; (6) the need to avoid  unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants  with similar records who have been found guilty of  similar conduct; and (7) the need to provide restitution to  any victims of the offense. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). 3. Analysis A. The Court lacks jurisdiction to rule on Munne's  motion. On January 13, 2023, Munne filed a notice of appeal to  the Eleventh Circuit from the jury's October 13, 2022,  verdict and the Court's January 3, 2023, judgment. (ECF  No. 76.) Munne's appeal, which involves various  aspects of his case, including his sentence generally, is  currently  pending.  Accordingly,  the  Court  lacks  jurisdiction to rule on Munne's motion. As the Eleventh  Circuit has unequivocally explained, ""the filing of an  appeal of virtually any sort acts to freeze all proceedings  in the district court pending resolution of the appeal.""  Shewchun v. United States, 797 F.2d 941, 942 (11th  Cir. 1986). Notably, Munne admits that the Court lacks  jurisdiction to grant him a sentence reduction at this  time, clarifying in his motion that ""due to the Court's lack  of jurisdiction in this matter due to the pending appeal,  th[e] [m]otion is being filed to preserve th[e] issue[.]""  (See Mot. 3, ECF No. 97.) Thus, the Court denies  Munne's [*6]  motion because it does not have  jurisdiction to grant Munne's requested relief or  otherwise modify his sentence while the appeal is  pending. B. Munne is not eligible for a sentence reduction. Even if the Court had jurisdiction to grant Munne's  request for a sentence reduction, however, it would not  do so, as Munne does not meet all the necessary  criteria. As noted, the retroactive amendment that  Munne  invokes  here  is  Amendment  821—the  adjustment for certain zero-point offenders. See  U.S.S.G. § 4C1.1. Pursuant to Amendment 821, a  defendant is eligible for a two-level reduction in his  offense level, if he meets all the following criteria: (1) the defendant did not receive any criminal  history points from Chapter Four, Part A; (2) the defendant did not receive an adjustment  under §3A1.4 (Terrorism); (3) the defendant did not use violence or credible  threats of violence in connection with the offense; (4) the offense did not result in death or serious  Page 3 of 3 bodily injury; (5) the instant offense of conviction is not a sex  offense; (6) the defendant did not personally cause  substantial financial hardship; (7) the defendant did not possess, receive,  purchase, transport, transfer, sell, or otherwise  dispose of a firearm or other dangerous weapon  (or [*7]  induce another participant to do so) in  connection with the offense; (8) the instant offense of conviction is not covered  by §2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights); (9) the defendant did not receive an adjustment  under §3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable  Victim) or §3A1.5 (Serious Human Rights Offense);  and (10) the defendant did not receive an adjustment  under §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) and was not  engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise, as  defined in 21 U.S.C. § 848[.] See id. Here, Munne plainly fails to meet requirement number  seven—i.e., that he ""did not possess, receive, purchase,  transport, transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of a  firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another  participant to do so) in connection with the offense[.]""  See  id.  The  evidence  developed  at  trial,  as  acknowledged by the Court at sentencing, establishes  that Munne clearly planned for and induced his co- conspirator to obtain a gun to carry out the armed  abduction and robbery which forms that factual basis for  Munne's criminal case. (See Trial Trs., ECF Nos. 81,  82.) Indeed, Munne's co-conspirator specifically testified  at trial that they ""discussed the fact that [he] w[as] going  to bring a gun"" to commit the crime and [*8]  that Munne  ""told [him] to get a gun from somebody else."" (See Oct.  12, 2023, Trial Tr. 46, ECF No. 82.) In addition, at  sentencing, the Court specifically noted that Munne's  ""coconspirator possessed a firearm, and the trial  testimony showed that [Munne] was aware of the  firearm."" (See Sentencing Tr. 8, ECF No. 85.) Thus,  because Munne plainly does not satisfy all the requisite  criteria for a two-level reduction in his offense level, his  motion must be denied. Moreover, because Munne does not qualify for a  reduction pursuant to Amendment 821, the Court  declines to reach the second step of the analysis to  consider the § 3553(a) factors.",0
"United States v. Nichols, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081","MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER Defendant Samuel Nichols was charged by Superseding Indictment with conspiring to engage in sex trafficking by  force, threats of force, fraud, and coercion in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1594(c) (Count 1) and six counts of sex  trafficking force, threats of force, and coercion in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a) and (b)(1) (Counts 2-4, 6-8).  (Dkt. 51). Following a two-week trial, a jury convicted Nichols of Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8; he was acquitted on  Count 7. (Dkt. 267). [*2]  Nichols has filed a Motion for Judgment of Acquittal Notwithstanding the Verdict, or  Alternatively, Motion for New Trial. (Dkt. 279); see also (Dkt. 294). For the reasons explained below, Nichols's  Motion is denied. The jury's verdict stands. BACKGROUND Page 2 of 38 On December 29, 2015, the government filed a two-count Complaint against Nichols, who is also known by the  nickname ""Buck"" and ""Kash."" (Dkt. 1). Nichols was taken into federal custody in Tennessee (where he was being  held on unrelated state charges) on January 5, 2016 and transferred to Illinois. (Dkts. 7, 40). On February 3, 2016,  the grand jury returned a four-count Indictment (Dkt. 21), and on April 6, 2016, the grand jury returned an eight- count Superseding Indictment against Nichols and Fears. (Dkt. 51). At the outset of the proceedings, Nichols was  appointed counsel: James Graham. After the Superseding Indictment was filed, and based upon appointed  counsel's concerns about the volume of evidence and the sensitive nature of the evidence which included the  victimization of minors, the Court appointed a second attorney: Heather Winslow. (Dkts. 83, 86). Counsel litigated  several pretrial motions, including a motion to dismiss the Superseding [*3]  Indictment for violations of the Speedy  Trial Act, which they presented at Nichols's insistence. (Dkt. 91). Recognizing their ethical duty not to present  invalid legal arguments to the Court, the attorneys sought leave to file the motion, in which they provided the cases  correctly stating the law. See id. at 1. The Court denied the motion in a written order. (Dkt. 123). As a result of this episode, Nichols demanded appointment of new counsel, arguing that his appointed attorneys  were working against his interests and he could not work with them. See, e.g., (Dkt. 129) (Nichols's ex parte motion  alleging that his attorneys were not effectively representing him because they were not further challenging the  indictment); (Dkt. 142); (Dkt. 211); (Dkt. 213). Finding that there was no direct conflict of interest in that the  attorneys presented Nichols' motion to the Court and correctly cited the law as they must, the Court denied Nichols  request for a third attorney. Eventually, Nichols began to refuse to work with his attorneys and the Court granted  counsel leave to withdraw due to irreconcilable differences but required that they stay on as stand-by counsel (Dkts.  137, 297); the Court denied Nichols's [*4]  repeated demands for a third appointed attorney. See, e.g., (Dkt. 226).  The Court gave Nichols numerous warnings about proceeding pro se at trial, but he adamantly refused to work with  stand-by counsel. Due to these and other issues, the Court extended the trial date by more than five months to  allow Nichols adequate time for trial preparation. (Dkt. 165). Leading up to trial, Nichols's in-court behavior  deteriorated and at times the Court had to order the U.S. Marshals to bring Nichols to court using whatever force  necessary. See (Dkt. 242). As relevant to the arguments below, the proceedings continued and on March 1, 2018,  the Court conducted a competency hearing, which involved the testimony of two evaluating psychologists and other  evidence. See (Dkt. 310) (Competency Hearing Tr.). At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court found Nichols  competent to stand trial. Id.; (Dkt. 242). Two weeks prior to the trial date, Fears pled guilty to one count of conspiring with Nichols and Brandon Wright to  engage in sex trafficking by force, threats of force, fraud, and coercion and one count of sex trafficking of Minor B  (Ciara). (Dkts. 233, 236). Unlike Fears, Nichols proceeded to trial on [*5]  March 12, 2018 and represented himself  against the seven charges against him. During the first two trial days, Nichols participated in the proceedings until  the afternoon when, after receiving numerous warnings, he was removed on account of outbursts and other  improper behavior. See, e.g., (Dkt. 289) (3/12/18 to 3/26/18 Trial Transcript excluding Voir Dire, hereinafter ""Tr."") at  191. After he was removed, he was placed in a satellite courtroom with a live video and audio feed of the  proceedings with one stand-by counsel; the other stand-by counsel assumed representation. After these first two  days, however, Nichols controlled his behavior enough to remain in the courtroom and participate fully in trial until it  concluded on March 26, 2018. Notably, Nichols repeatedly conferred with stand-by counsel throughout and they  stepped up as regular counsel only when he was removed from the courtroom or at other critical junctures, such as  moving to dismiss, participating in the jury instruction conference, and questioning Nichols when he testified in his  defense at Nichols' request. See id. at 1457-74, 1478-1539, 1657-1714. At trial, although Nichols admitted that he managed escorts, he argued [*6]  that he did not force the women and  girls to do anything—they choose to prostitute and they always had the option to leave him. Regarding the ability of  the women and girls to pick up and leave, the government presented evidence that they lacked money, housing,  and support and that they were in a relationship with Nichols which was both abusive and controlling. The     2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *2 Page 3 of 38 government presented the testimony of an expert witness that victims of sex trafficking often choose to stay with  their traffickers because they do not have anywhere else to go and the psychological control of the trafficker keeps  them compliant. In addition, this expert witness testified as to the various restraints that sex traffickers use to keep  victims from leaving, including psychological restraints, like intimidation, threats, and manipulation. The  manipulation can include romance and false promises of a better future for the victims. Here, the government also  presented evidence that Nichols made various promises to the women involved (for example, to help them get an  apartment or regain custody of children) and that he fostered intimate relationships with the women as a way to  control them. In addition, the government [*7]  presented evidence that Nichols maintained a culture of fear in his business as  another means of control. Nichols admitted to physically abusing various women and girls, but he argued that all of  the violence was related to personal matters, not business—that is, prostitution. Here, the government introduced  evidence that Nichols had certain rules for the women and girls who worked for him—rules related to prostituting.  When those rules were broken, such as when one of the women texted another pimp or when the women slept  through calls from potential customers, Nichols beat them. In addition, the government presented testimony from  each victim-witness that Nichols frequently physically abused other women and girls in their presence. Regardless  of the reason for the abuse, the victims testified that it made them fearful and compliant with his business rules so  that they might avoid physical abuse directed towards them or towards others—who were oftentimes their friends. As to the conspiracy, Nichols argued that he did not have an agreement with anyone—not Fears and not Wright—to  commit sex trafficking. If anything, he and Fears engaged in similar, but separate, businesses. The  government, [*8]  however, introduced evidence that Nichols and Fears together recruited women and girls to join  their violent sex-trafficking enterprise, some of the woman and girls worked for Nichols and then Fears (or vice  versa) especially when one of the two was incarcerated or otherwise unable to ""manage,"" they traveled around the  Chicagoland area and the country (often times driven by Wright) with these women and girls and usually one if not  both men stayed at the hotels with the women, and they shared the money the women made from engaging in  commercial sex acts. Further, the government presented evidence about how Wright drove the women and girls to  hotels, strip clubs, and outcalls (or trips to engage in commercial sex acts at a customer's house) at Nichols's  direction and also to purchase supplies and food for the women and girls as well as the Visa gift cards that Nichols  used to purchase the ads he ran on Backpage.com—a website used for advertising commercial sex acts that is  hosted on servers maintained outside of Illinois. For these tasks, Nichols paid Wright at a daily or weekly rate,  depending on how much money Nichols was making from the women and girls at that time. After deliberating, [*9]  the jury convicted Nichols of one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking and five  substantive counts of sex trafficking under 18 U.S.C. § 1591. He was acquitted of one count of sex trafficking. After  trial, Nichols agreed to work with counsel and they were reappointed. (Dkts. 271, 273). Through counsel, Nichols  now moves for judgment of acquittal, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 29, or alternatively, for a new trial, see Fed. R. Crim. P.  33. Nichols raises multiple (at times duplicative) grounds in support of a judgment of acquittal or a new trial, which  amount to the following 18 objections, listed in chronological order: 1. the Court erred in denying Nichols's motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds, (Dkt. 279) at (1)(b); 2. the Court erred in denying Nichols's motions for appointment of new counsel, id. at (1)(a); 3. the Court erred in finding Nichols competent to stand trial and in allowing Nichols to proceed pro se because  he was incapable of representing himself, id. at (1)(c), (d) & (Dkt. 294) at (1); 4. the jury was not fair and impartial because Nichols knew one of the jurors, (Dkt. 279) at (1)(e); 5. the government committed outrageous conduct by presenting false evidence at trial that misled the jury, id.  at (2)(a), (b), (c);   2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *6 Page 4 of 38 6. the [*10]  Court improperly limited the cross examination of one victim witness and generally erred in  sustaining objections to Nichols's cross examination of all government witnesses, id. at (3), (4), (5); 7. the Court erred in admitting testimony of other crimes, wrongs, or acts of Fears, id. at (10); 8. the Court generally erred in admitting hearsay evidence, id. at (11); 9. the Court erred in admitting physical evidence, id. at (18); 10. the government's closing argument was improper and was unduly prejudicial and the Court erred in  overruling Nichols's objections to the government's closing argument, id. at (7), (8), (12), (20); 11. the Court erred in preventing Nichols from arguing the inconsistencies between the allegations in the  Superseding Indictment and the evidence adduced at trial, id. at (21); 12. the jury instructions improperly constructively amended the Superseding Indictment and altered the level of  proof necessary for the government to prove the elements for conviction, id. at (6) & (Dkt. 294) at (2); 13. the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction of Nichols on any count, (Dkt. 279) at (9); 14. the government failed to prove every essential element of the offenses charged, [*11]  id. at (13); 15. the verdicts were against the manifest weight of the evidence and were not supported by substantial  evidence, id. at (14), (15); 16. the cumulative errors denied Nichols due process of law, id. at (16), (17); 17. the indictment and proceedings were fundamentally and manifestly unfair; the defendant was denied his  right to due process of law, to confront the evidence and witnesses against him, and to the assistance of  counsel according to the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the United States Constitution; due process and  fundamental fairness required the setting aside of the guilty verdicts, id. at (19), (22); and 18. ""The defendant hereby raises and alleges all error that may appear from the entire record in the instant  cause."" id. at (23). DISCUSSION I. Rule 29 Motion for Judgment of Acquittal To begin, Nichols raises a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence against him, arguing that (1) there is  insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, (2) the government failed to prove every  element of the offenses charged, and (3) the verdicts were against the manifest weight of the evidence. See (Dkt.  279) at (9), (13)-(15). Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(a) provides that, ""[a]fter the government closes its  evidence or after the close of all [*12]  the evidence, the court on the defendant's motion must enter a judgment of  acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction."" See United States v. Kohli,  847 F.3d 483, 489 (7th Cir. 2017). A court will overturn the jury's verdict only if, ""after viewing the evidence in the  light most favorable to the government, the record is devoid of evidence from which a reasonable jury could find  guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."" United States v. Wrobel, 841 F.3d 450, 454 (7th Cir. 2016) (quoting United States  v. Campbell, 770 F.3d 556, 571-72 (7th Cir. 2014)); see also United States v. Wilson, 879 F.3d 795, 802 (7th Cir.  2018) (noting that, for this inquiry, the court examines the evidence as a whole, including that presented by the  defendant); United States v. Presbitero, 569 F.3d 691, 704 (7th Cir. 2009). In other words, a court will ""set aside a  jury's guilty verdict only if 'the record contains no evidence, regardless of how it is weighed,' from which a jury could  have returned a conviction."" Presbitero, 569 F.3d at 704 (quoting United States v. Moses, 513 F.3d 727, 733 (7th  Cir. 2008)). 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *9 Page 5 of 38 ""In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, [a defendant] bears a heavy, indeed, nearly insurmountable,  burden."" United States v. Warren, 593 F.3d 540, 546 (7th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted); cf. United States v. Jones,  713 F.3d 336, 339-40 (7th Cir. 2013) (he height of the hurdle depends directly on the strength of the government's  evidence). In other words, a ""defendant faces an uphill battle in challenging the sufficiency of the evidence."" United  States v. Orlando, 819 F.3d 1016, 1021 (7th Cir. 2016). It follows that under Rule 29, courts ""do not reassess the  weight of the evidence or second-guess the trier of fact's credibility [*13]  determinations."" United States v. Arthur,  582 F.3d 713, 717 (7th Cir. 2009); see also United States v. Severson, 569 F.3d 683, 688 (7th Cir. 2009). Instead,  ""[s]orting the facts and inferences is a task for the jury."" Warren, 593 F.3d at 547. A. Counts 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8: Sex Trafficking To sustain the convictions under the Trafficking Victim's Protection Act (""TVPA""), 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a), in Counts 2,  3, 4, 6, and 8 of the Superseding Indictment, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1)  Nichols knowingly recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, or maintained Betty Jo (for Count  2), Michelle (for Count 3), Minor A (for Count 4), Marzett (for Count 6), and Jameela (for Count 8), or knowingly  benefitted financially or by receiving a thing of value from participating in a venture that recruited, enticed, harbored,  transported, provided, obtained, or maintained the respective women and girls; (2) Nichols knew or recklessly  disregarded the fact that force, threats of force, or coercion would be used to cause the respective women and girls  to engage in a commercial sex act; and (3) the offense was in or affecting interstate commerce. 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a); see also United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d 584, 592 (7th Cir. 2017); United States v. Thompson, 864 F.3d  837, 840-41 (7th Cir. 2017); United States v. Woods, 695 F. App'x 949, 953 (7th Cir. 2017) (finding sufficient  evidence to sustain sex-trafficking convictions). The government's evidence at trial was framed by the testimony of Dr. Sharon Cooper, a sex [*14]  trafficking  expert who has testified multiple times as an expert in the Northern District of Illinois and elsewhere. Dr. Cooper  explained the desperate situations victims find themselves in that make them easy targets and the relationship  dynamics between traffickers and their victims. She first explained that traffickers typically recruit vulnerable  individuals to work for them, such as runaways, disenfranchised children, individuals with significant adversity in  their lives, children with mental illness or even simply individuals with low self-esteem (meaning they may be more  easily manipulated), and young mothers—particularly those who are working to regain custody of their children. Tr.  at 208-14. For these individuals, traffickers promise a ""dream"" life in exchange for the work: the money they make  will go to a house and family in the future and that ""even though they may have to do a lot of things they don't want  to do at this point, that's going to end because the pimp is going to make sure that they have a wonderful life in the  end."" Id. at 211-12. In this way, traffickers sometimes use love and romance to recruit victims and make them feel  like they belong to a new family. Id. at 215-17. Once they [*15]  are part of the so-called family, victims may not feel  victimized because everyone is experiencing the same things, which normalizes the overall experience. Id. at 220,  230 (""Almost never do the victims get to keep the money that they've made. And they're just—they're just sort of  brainwashed to believe that this is how the family works and he is the person who gets to have all of the money.""). Dr. Cooper explained the different tactics that traffickers use to make their victims more compliant and easier to  control, including romance, rewards for good behavior, drugs, and violence—both physical violence and threats of  violence. Traffickers typically have rules that their victims must follow and the most common consequence for  broken rules is battering, so victims often are subject to violence when, for example, they make eye contact with  other pimps, fail to bring in a certain amount of money per day (known as a ""quota""), or are not subservient. Id. at  229-32. Victims sometimes view the punishment as their fault, ""not the fault of the trafficker who is the one beating  them up"" because after a beating the trafficker may ""say to the victim that they didn't want to do that, it was the  victim's fault, they shouldn't [*16]  have made them do that, and they need to to[e] the line, they need to bring in  their amount of money, they need to be respectful, et cetera, so that he will not have to resort to those types of  behaviors again."" Id. at 217, 224, 239.   2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *12 Page 6 of 38 Within this framework, the government presented testimony from the six victims listed in the Superseding  Indictment (Betty Jo, Michelle, Minor A, Ciara, Marzett, and Jameela). Betty Jo, who was also known as ""Becky,""  testified that she first met Fears when he sent her a message online, indicating that he wanted to work with her and  they could ""build a future together."" She understood that Fears was asking to be her pimp. At the time of the  message, which was sent sometime in 2012, Betty Jo was 25 and homeless, living out of a hotel in Lansing, Illinois.  She agreed to meet Fears and he brought Nichols along for the meeting. Fears told Betty Jo that if she worked for  him, the two would take trips together and could even share a car and apartment. Id. at 776-78. She agreed to work  for him (performing commercial sex acts with customers obtained from the Internet), but after a few weeks she  decided to work for Nichols instead. Betty Jo worked with Nichols in 2012 and then again in 2014. She [*17]  testified that the two had a ""business  relationship"" and that Nichols exercised considerable control over everything she did. For example, he posted her  pictures on Backpage to solicit costumers and he decided how often to post them; he set her work schedule-- seven  days a week, twenty-four hours per day, and only he could decide if she could have a day off; he instructed her to  answer all calls or texts from customers—which she received on a cellphone Nichols provided for her—regardless  of the time that they came in; he set her rates; he required that she give him all of the money she made from her  customers; and he would not allow her to talk to any other pimps or any men who were not customers. Id. at 784- 87, 823, 837. To monitor compliance, Nichols would check her phone for missed calls or texts to prohibited  individuals. If he saw something he did not like on her phone, Nichols would yell at or smack her. Id. at 787. Betty  Jo testified that there were plenty of days that she did not want to perform sex acts, but she ""still had to do them"" or  risk getting in trouble with Nichols. Id. at 823; see also id. at 785 (""Q. What would happen if you didn't answer the  phone? A. He—we'd get yelled at or in trouble.""). She testified that on [*18]  a busy day, she would see somewhere  between ten and twenty customers and make as much as $1,000, which she turned over to Nichols in full. Id. at  784-85. With regard to living arrangements, Betty Jo testified that she stayed in rooms at national hotel chains (e.g., Days  Inn, Red Roof Inn, Extended Stay) paid for by Nichols and sometimes rented in her name. She would perform  commercial sex acts in these rooms, so they typically had two beds: ""One to work on, and then one to sleep on."" Id.  at 809-11. Nichols also took her on trips outside of Illinois to work. For example, Betty Jo described a trip to  Minnesota that she took with Nichols, Little Baby, and Kaila (other women who worked for Nichols) in or around  December 2012. Id. at 805-06. She also discussed a trip she took to Memphis in October 2014, where again  Nichols posted her ads on Backpage, she worked, and she gave the money to Nichols. In addition to paying for the  hotel rooms, Nichols paid for Betty Jo's other living expenses, such as food, clothes, hair, and nails. Nichols also  supplied Betty Jo with drugs; at the time, she used crack cocaine and marijuana to get through the day. Just like he  had rules about how and when to work, Nichols had rules about drugs: Betty [*19]  Jo was only allowed to get drugs  from him and he sometimes withheld drugs from her. Id. at 804-05. Nichols once caught Betty Jo and another woman who worked for him, Daisy, in a hotel room smoking crack  cocaine that they got from a Backpage customer; he smacked them both in the face. Id. at 796-97. This was one of  about five or six violent episodes Betty Jo recalled. For example, at a hotel in Lansing with three other women in the  room, Nichols found out that Betty Jo was texting Fears (who, despite being Nichols's friend and co-conspirator,  was still another pimp) and he slapped her in the face so hard that she thought her ear was bleeding. Id. at 801. On  a different day at the same hotel, Betty Jo and Nichols got in a fight. After she hit him, he hit her. She fell to the floor  and ended up with a black eye and a busted lip. Id. at 802-03. As for Michelle, whose nickname was ""Molly,"" she testified that after a childhood spent with relatives, in foster care  and in group homes, she moved to Chicago from New York (leaving two children behind) at 22 years-old without  any connections; she almost immediately met Nichols in a hotel where she was working and began prostituting  herself for him. Id. at 536-41. She worked for him on and off for approximately [*20]  two and a half years. Like  Betty Jo, Michelle testified that she had sex with customers—recruited from Backpage with ads placed and paid for  by Nichols—in various hotel rooms paid for by Nichols with cash from prostitution but placed under someone else's  name (for example, hers or Wright's). Id. at 549-61. After the customers left, Nichols would count the money in front  of her to make sure none of it was missing. 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *16 Page 7 of 38 Michelle testified that Nichols decided what to do with the money. Id. at 540, 563-69. The evidence introduced at  trial reflected that, in addition to buying the hotel rooms for himself and the women, Nichols used the money to buy  condoms, toiletries for the women and girls, food, drugs, clothes for himself, work clothes for the women and girls,  travel expenses, phone bills, and to support and promote his aspiring rap group, the Hit Squad, among other things.  Like Betty Jo, Nichols would monitor Michelle's phone to make sure that she was not breaking his rules. Id. at 563- 68. He required that she work most every day of the week, at least in the beginning, seeing as many as seven  customers per day, and she testified that Nichols gave her cocaine and ecstasy to stay awake and work. Again,  similar to Betty Jo, she was not [*21]  allowed to get drugs from anyone other than Nichols. She worked even when  she did not want to—for instance, when she was menstruating—because ""I didn't really have a choice. It wasn't a  choice whether I wanted to work or not."" Id. at 579-581. She testified that at times she worked without sleep for  multiple days in a row even though she did not want to. She could not even leave the hotel to get food or toiletries;  either those would be purchased and brought to her so that she did not miss any calls or she was required to get  Nichols's permission to leave to get them. Id. at 579-80, 627-31. Michelle generally testified that when she did something that Nichols ""didn't like or something that upset him or  something that didn't pertain to his rules or it didn't fit his criteria of what [she] was supposed to be doing,"" he would  physically abuse her or deprive her of things she needed. Id. at 581-82. She described these things he did not like  as falling asleep and missing calls from potential customers, telling Nichols that she did not want to do something,  or talking back to him. Id. at 640. She called Nichols's beatings, which typically took place in the hotel rooms where  she was living and working, ""very, very close to torture."" Id. at 582. Sometimes others [*22]  were in the room when  Nichols beat her, like Fears. Id. at 583. One significant beating occurred in April 2014, when Nichols discovered text messages between her and Fears  when he was checking her phone. After finding these messages, Nichols repeatedly struck Michelle's hand and her  back with a wooden hanger. He made her get into a car driven by Wright and Nichols continued to beat her there.  Nichols was in the passenger seat and Michelle was in the back of the car when he threw her flip phone at her  head, causing her to bleed profusely. Ultimately, Wright drove to a hospital and Nichols made Michelle get out of  the car. She ended up needing three stiches to close her head wound. Id. at 584-88. Wright, who also testified at  trial, corroborated Michelle's account by recalling that she was badly bruised when she got in his car and already  had a black eye. He saw Nichols throw the phone at Michelle's head, which caused her to bleed ""real bad"" and get  blood all over the car. According to Wright, Nichols told him that he had punched and kicked Michelle and beat her  over the back repeatedly with a wood coat hanger from the hotel room because she was being disloyal by talking to  Fears. Id. at 1283-84. Wright saw Michelle the [*23]  next day and described her: ""She looked bad. She had a black  eye. She had bruises all over her body. She could barely move."" Id. at 1284. When Nichols took the stand, he too  admitted that this incident happened, but he disputed its severity. Id. at 1510-12 (""She asked me could she have  her phone back, and I—shit, I gave—I mean—excuse me. I gave it to her. I got upset.""). In addition to working in the Chicagoland area, Michelle travelled with Nichols, Fears, and others to work. She  testified about a 2014 trip to Atlanta she took with Nichols, Fears, Stallion, and Marzett. Wright drove. While there,  Nichols poster her and Stallion on Backpage; Stallion had sex with customers in exchange for money in a hotel  room and gave the money to Nichols. Marzett danced at a strip club and gave the money she earned to Nichols. Id.  at 610-12. Next, Minor A testified that she began to work, stripping and giving the money to Nichols, in or around June 2014  when she was only 13 years-old. She essentially was homeless—she had been running away from home since she  was 10 and she would roam the streets. Id. at 1082-94. In exchange for working, Nichols paid for Minor A's hotel  rooms and food and he provided marijuana and alcohol if she wanted it. He also told [*24]  her that he would help  her get an apartment someday. After working at the club for a few days, Nichols began to post Minor A's pictures on  Backpage and she started having sex with customers using condoms he supplied. She gave him all the money she  made. Minor A had sex with strangers at various hotels (""incalls"") and she also traveled to customers' houses to  have sex there (""outcalls"") with Nichols's approval. She recalled one particular outcall to a customer in Indiana;  Wright drove and Candace came along. Id. at 1108-09. This went on until September 2014 when Minor A was  arrested. Id. at 1094-95. While detained, she called Nichols to bail her out. He said he would but that she ""better be  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *20 Page 8 of 38 ready to suck some dick and rub some feet when you get out, bitch, for putting me back."" Id. at 1127-28. Minor A  understood Nichols to mean that she would have to pay him back by having more sex with men. During the time she worked for Nichols, Minor A testified that he threatened her, for example by saying he would  beat her up if any of the money she earned ""came up missing."" Id. at 1097; see also id. at 1112 (when asked what  Nichols would do if any money was missing, Minor A replied ""he'll beat our ass""). Nichols made the same threat if  he found out that Minor [*25]  A did not answer a phone call from a Backpage client, because she was required to  answer every call. Id. at 1114. As a result, Minor A always answered her calls because she ""took him up on his  word, that if I missed a call, he'll beat my ass."" Id. Because of these threats, Minor A worked even when she did not  want to, like while she was menstruating or when she had a painful infection. Minor A testified about a time when Nichols was violent with her: they were in a hotel room and Nichols slapped her  in the face during an argument. Id. at 1097, 1122, 1173. She had braces, and Nichols's hard slap caused her lip to  get stuck in the braces and bleed profusely. Id. at 1122-23. After this incident, Minor A testified that she did not talk  back to Nichols again out of fear of getting hit. Id. at 1123. Minor A also testified about witnessing Nichols's violence  towards others, like when he choked Candace or hit her in the face if she did not do what he told her to do. Id. at  1101-02. Witnessing this violence made Minor A nervous that she would Nichols's target if she ever ""got out of line  with him."" Another victim, Marzett (or ""Celeste""), testified at trial. When she was a child, she frequently ran away from the  home she lived in with her aunt. Marzett explained that [*26]  the two had a bad relationship because Marzett had  disclosed to her aunt that she was raped as a child, but her aunt did not believe her. Id. at 997-98. Marzett later had  two children and she turned to stripping and dancing to support them, because she did not have any other job and  she was having troubles with her family and she did not want to ask them for money. Id. at 1000. In 2012, when she  was working at a strip club called Arnie's, she met Fears (who was with Nichols at the time) and the two exchanged  phone numbers. Marzett eventually called Fears to come get her from a hotel where she was staying because she  ""was at a bad point at the time, so [she] was really ready to leave where [she] was at anyway."" Id. at 999-1000.  Fears picked her up and took her to a hotel in Lansing; Candace was driving the car and Nichols was there. At first,  she thought she might date Fears, but she later learned that he wanted to be her pimp. Id. Marzett continued  working at Arnie's—stripping and also performing sex acts—but she started giving all of the money she made to  Fears. Id. at 1007-08. She did so in part because Fears told her that he would help her ""save money and get  everything"" she needed. Id. She also saw Backpage customers during this [*27]  time. Marzett was at a hotel with Fears when he was arrested. Immediately afterward, Fears and Nichols worked out the  details and Marzett began to work for Nichols. Id. at 1015; see also id. at 384 (Jameela testified that Marzett first  worked for Fears and when he ""got locked up, . . . she came join up our team and started working for [Nichols]."").  Marzett testified about the rules with which she had to comply while working for Nichols (many of which were  described by the other women), including rules that she was not allowed to have eye contact with any other pimps  and that she was required to give all of the money she earned to Nichols. Id. at 1016. She described Nichols's  personality as ""aggressive,"" noting that she saw him ""get made easy and get frustrated at the girls a lot easily."" Id.  at 1015-16. Marzett witnessed Nichols act violently towards other women who worked for him (like Little Baby and  Candace), which made her feel ""nervous and scared"" that she would do something wrong and be at the receiving  end of Nichols's violence, so she ""basically did everything that he wanted [her] to do."" Id. at 1018-19. She later left  Nichols after he yelled at her for asking to go see her daughter. See id. at 1305, 1355 (Wright testified that Nichols  threatened to [*28]  beat up Marzett if she kept going back and forth from her grandmother's house to the hotel  because Nichols wanted her at the hotel ""working all night""). She feared that he would come after her. Id. at 1024- 25. Indeed, the government introduced a jail call between Nichols and Kaila where Nichols berated Kaila for  allowing Marzett to leave and told her to go after Marzett to ""get my bitch back"" or ""get my money back."" Id. at  1636. 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *24 Page 9 of 38 Finally, Jameela (or ""Icis"") testified that she worked for Nichols from 2012 to 2014. Jameela originally met Nichols  in 2009 when she was pregnant and living at a homeless shelter. In 2012, after living briefly in another state,  Jameela returned to Illinois and began working with Nichols primarily because he promised to help her regain  custody of her young son, which she lost while working for Nichols previously. Id. at 359, 430-32. During this time,  Jameela stripped and performed sex acts at a strip club in Markham, Illinois. In addition to that, Nichols created,  paid for, and posted ads for Jameela online at Backpage. Id. at 361, 365. Different from the other women and girls,  Nichols did not permit Jameela answer the calls that came in response to her ads because she had a speech  impediment and he was afraid that [*29]  she would ""run the customer away."" Like the other women, Jameela gave  all the money she earned to Nichols. See id. at 419 (Jameela testified that Nichols would go through ""our stuff and  take our money and then put us out of [his] car""). Nichols set her rates and her working days, and he required that  she bring in a certain amount of money per day. Id. at 362-64. If she did not meet her quota, so to say, Jameela  testified that Nichols got mad and would make her stay up and have sex with more customers to try to make more  money without sleeping. Id. at 417-19, 443. Like the other women and girls, Jameela was subject to Nichols's many  rules, including in addition to those described above no boyfriends and no talking to family without going through  Nichols. Id. at 456. Jameela testified that Nichols was violent with her: he smacked her in the face on several occasions, like once  when he hit her after she said something he did not like. Id. at 385-86. He also made threatening comments about  beating her if she had a boyfriend or shooting any boyfriend she might have. Id. at 391. In addition to the physical  abuse and threats, Nichols mocked Jameela's speech impediment and would tell her that no one would want her  due to it. For example, Wright testified that Nichols [*30]  would call her a ""retarded bitch a lot of the times . . .  because the way she talked."" Id. at 1275. Jameela testified that there were days when she did not want to work for  Nichols, but she ""just [went] work because, like I say, I don't do the drama or—after he hit me, I don't want that  situation happen again, so I just go work and just—but people at work know I don't want to be there because how  my mood is."" Id. at 457. Nichols did not help Jameela regain custody of her son and she eventually left him for a  second time. Nichols kept all of the money she earned. Id. at 400. All of the above accounts of violence were corroborated by Wright. As relevant, Wright met Nichols and Fears at a  strip club and worked as Nichols's driver continuously from July 2013 until October 2014. Id. at 1196. He generally  testified that he knew Nichols to control the women and girls who worked for him through the use of threats of  violence and actual violence, that Nichols was always ""hitting on them beating them up, been talking real  disrespectful to them."" Id. at 1210-11; see id. at 1253 (""He would beat them up, punch them, slap them, kick  them.""). Consistent with the testimony recounted above, Wright testified that the beatings were the consequence if  one of Nichols's [*31]  rules was broken, like talking back to him, failing to turn over all of the money made from sex  acts, or missing a call from a customer. Id. at 1127-28, 1234-35. With regard to specific events, Wright recalled  witnessing Nichols slap Candace and drag her across the floor at a hotel in Lansing after she had become upset  that her clothes were at Kaila's house, and he saw Nichols physically abuse Candace while she was pregnant. Id.  at 1257-59. Wright also saw Nichols act violently towards Kaila. One time when she did not want to go to work at a  strip club, Wright drove Nichols to Kaila's house and Nichols beat Kaila in front of her kids, dragged her to the car,  and then dropped her off at the club where she went to work. Id. at 1266-67. Another time Nichols repeatedly  slapped Kaila in Wright's car for talking to other women who worked at the strip club. Id. at 1267-68. In addition,  Wright testified that he either had seen or knew about instances when Nichols was violent with Michelle, Stallion,  Jameela, Minor A, Betty Jo, and Little Baby. Id. at 1280-1312. Like Wright, Betty Jo, Michelle, Minor A, Marzett, and Jameela all testified about witnessing Nichols physically  abuse other women and girls, many times at the hotel where they were all staying. For example, Betty [*32]  Jo        2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *28 Page 10 of 38 testified that one time while she was in the same hotel room as Daisy, Nichols entered the room to find that Daisy  was asleep and not answering calls from potential Backpage customers. Nichols ""smacked her out of her sleep""  because she was supposed to be answering her phone. Id. at 796-98. The women and girls also described  countless instances wherein Nichols hit, punched, kicked, and beat Candace or Kaila—both of whom had worked  for him for years, had children with him, and were considered his ""bottoms,"" or those women who had worked their  way up to the top of the sex trafficking organization and who begin to supervise and train other women and girls.  See id. at 216 (testimony of Dr. Cooper); see also id. at 374-75 (Jameela testified that she saw Nichols hit Kaila  across her chest with a small baseball bat in a car on the way to a strip club), 426-27 (Jameela testified that Nichols  beat Candace every other day and Candace still would go to work after that), 596 (Michelle testified that Candace  was beat by Nichols because ""[s]he could have talked back. She could have tried to leave. She could have refused  to work. Anything.""), 594-600, 787-89 (Betty Jo testified that she saw Nichols drag Candance across the room  by [*33]  her hair), 789-94, 814-17, 1101-02 (Minor A testified that she saw Nichols choke Candace and hit her in  the face). Faced with this evidence, Nichols did not dispute that he was involved in prostitution, although he described it as  ""managing"" or ""promoting"" the women. However, as to the sufficiency of the evidence, Nichols argues as he did in  his mid-trial motion for dismissal that the government failed to prove that he used force, threats of force, or coercion  to require anyone to commit any sex trafficking act. (Dkt. 279) at 9; see also Tr. at 1459 (arguing in part that the  government failed to prove ""force, violence, threats, or coercion because none of the witnesses have testified— short of Brandon [Wright] who doesn't have personal knowledge of such—none of the other witnesses have  testified that Mr. Nichols used force, threats, coercion, fraud to induce their participation in illegal or commercial sex  acts.""). This argument has two prongs. First, Nichols argued at trial that all of the women and girls he managed  agreed to work with him and agreed to stay with him, despite knowing that they could leave at any time. Second, he  argued that all of the physical violence described by [*34]  the witnesses in the government's case was not related  to his business, but was instead inflicted for personal reasons. Importantly for this case, and for a general understanding of the complexity of sex trafficking in general, Dr. Cooper  explained that victims frequently will stay with a trafficker because they have nowhere else to go. Id. at 235 (""If a  victim has been recruited from being homeless and just sleeping on the streets, et cetera, and begging for food  from restaurants, then just having a roof over their head is for them a step up from where they were.""). In addition,  Dr. Cooper testified that sometimes traffickers will manipulate their victims to get them to stay, for example by  claiming that they will help a victim regain custody of her child or promising a romantic relationship and a future.  She also explained that victims will leave and then return to traffickers because they feel stigmatized, and feel like  it's difficult to survive financially without the trafficker, particularly if they have no education and low self-esteem. Id.  at 236. Given the testimony of Dr. Cooper, it was not surprising that the jury heard testimony on cross examination that the  victims stayed with Nichols through [*35]  horrific episodes of abuse and grueling work schedules and conditions or  left him at least once (sometimes many times) and still returned. But the jury also heard evidence that the victims  did not want to leave Nichols because he gave them a place to stay, paid for their food and other needs, and gave  them drugs; some also testified either that Nichols came after them when they left or they feared that he would. For  example, Jameela testified that the women and girls had the option to leave ""but not with our money."" Id. at 419-20.  Michelle testified that every time she left, Nichols ""came after [her]. It ended up to not having a choice."" Id. at 675.  Betty Jo also testified that she did not have anywhere else to go if she left Nichols and he never gave her the  money she earned while working for him. Id. at 819, 823. Marzett, too, feared that he would come after her if and  when she left. In addition, Michelle testified that she returned to Nichols more than five times because she had nowhere else to  go, did not know anyone else in the area, and felt as though she had no other options. See id. at 541 (""Well, that  was kind of like I didn't have anywhere to stay. And at that time, like, I was just fully—just everything I did was  him. [*36]  I just—I mean, all I knew was him.""). She testified, ""I really didn't want to be with him, but it wasn't a  choice."" Id. at 614. For example, the government introduced a recorded call that Michelle placed to Nichols in  August 2014, where she asked him to bail her out and for ""her old job back."" She explained that she ""just didn't  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *32 Page 11 of 38 want to be in jail and [she] knew he was the only person that would have came and got"" her. Id. at 621, 714-15,  730-31. On the call, he threatened to come and find her if she left before paying off her debt. Id. at 621. Similarly,  Jameela testified that she moved back to Illinois because she needed to be in state to fight for custody of her son.  When she returned, she was ""[b]ouncing from place to place with [her] friends"" without a job, and Nichols contacted  her. He told her that he would help her get a house and a car, that he would help her get back on her feet and  regain custody of her son if she worked for him again. Id. at 359, 430. At trial, because he represented himself with standby counsel, Nichols cross examined the women and girls who he  allegedly trafficked and effectively elicited testimony from many of them that they consented to prostitute  themselves and they got into it willingly. Jameela, for one, testified [*37]  on cross that she was neither threatened  or forced to ""be with"" Nichols. Id. at 454-55. Michelle also confirmed that Nichols did not ""force her to be a  prostitute."" Id. at 654. Betty Jo and Marzett testified similarly. Id. at 863, 1040. Minor A also testified that Nichols did  not force her to engage in prostitution, even though she had never done so before. Id. at 1147-48, 1150. This  testimony, too, was touched on by Dr. Cooper's expert testimony. For one thing, she explained victims may struggle  to see themselves as victims or being forced because they may instead see any punishment from the trafficker as  their fault or just something they have to endure to make him happy. Id. at 239. Sometimes they may also view  themselves as part of the enterprise—an earner rather than a victim. Id. at 238-39. Both perceptions can make  victims believe that the punishment is their fault. They may not see the situation as one in which they are being  forced to work. Id. In addition to these issues with perception, she highlighted the distinction between ""prostitution""  and ""trafficking"": ""A prostitution scenario is where you have an exchange of sex between two people. Trafficking  scenario is when there's third party control."" Id. at 246. Thus, as in Carson, whether the women willingly  agreed [*38]  to work as prostitutes is not the heart of the matter; it is whether they ""willingly agreed to essential  become enslaved—that is, to turn over all of their money and freedom and suffer abuse."" Carson, 870 F.3d at 591. Here, the testimony that the women chose to prostitute themselves stood in stark juxtaposition with the testimony  that the women and girls routinely were beaten and threatened by Nichols for crossing him. On this point, Nichols  admitted that he hit the women. He argued, however, that the violence was not connected to the business, that it  was personal (such as violence in response to disrespect directed to Nichols on a personal level) and therefore  wholly separate from prostitution. In other words, the violence was not used to force any of the women to engage in  commercial sex acts. To be sure, on cross examination, Nichols elicited testimony concerning the personal,  intimate, or even romantic relationships he had with many of the witnesses or other women, including Candace,  Kaila, Stallion, Michelle, and Jameela. But the government introduced evidence that the women and girls around  Nichols were working for him nearly all day, every day and that even what Nichols described as ""personal  relationships"" [*39]  were part of his sex trafficking business and another way to control them. See Tr. at 1554  (Nichols testified that he was managing escorts at all hours of the day and night). Specifically, Nichols told his sister  in a recorded jail call that Candace and Kaila were ""hookers"" and that he had sex with the women around him  because that was part of his job. Id. at 1277-78, 1613-15; see Gov't Ex. 209A. Jameela also testified that, although  she had been intimate with Nichols, she only considered her relationship with him to be that of a ""worker."" Tr. at  438. When asked by Nichols why she felt this way in light of the fact that she was once pregnant by Nichols, she  stated: ""Like everybody else, you got other baby mamas on the team working for you and turning the money in, so  that don't mean nothing."" Id. at 439-40; see id. at 440 (""As you said it, we was not in a relationship. As you stated,  you—I was working for you.""). Nichols's personal and business relationships with the women and girls who worked for him were inextricable. The  jury heard ample uncontradicted testimony from Betty Jo, Michelle, Minor A, Marzett, and Jameela that Nichols  used violence and threats of violence to enforce his business rules. For example, Nichols slapped [*40]  women  who missed calls from potential customers, he slapped and beat women—including Betty Jo and Michelle—who  talked to Fears without permission, he slapped women for taking drugs from customers, and he threatened to beat  anyone who withheld money from him. He yelled at girls who did not answer calls and acted like they did not want  to work. E.g., id. at 602 (Michelle testified that Nichols yelled at Little Baby for this). In other words, there was ample  evidence that Nichols hit and threatened to hit women over money. Wright testified that in training the women and  girls to work for Nichols, Candace typically told them ""don't talk back to Buck or do anything that's going to get on  his bad side 'cuz there will be consequences and repercussions, which will be him beating them up."" Id. at 1227.  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *36 Page 12 of 38 What is more, Betty Jo and Minor A, who both testified about times that Nichols hit them, also testified that they only  had business relationships with him. Further, the victims testified that they became more compliant overall after Nichols beat them. Jameela testified that  she worked when she did not want to because she did not want Nichols to hit her again. Id. at 457. Michelle testified  that Nichols's beatings made her [*41]  feel like ""nobody. Like nothing was good enough."" Id. at 583. Minor A  testified that she did not talk back to Nichols again for fear of getting hit. Id. at 1123. And Betty Jo, Michelle, Minor  A, Marzett, and Jameela all discussed the numerous times in which they witnessed Nichols beat or choke other  women who worked for him. Regardless of the reasons for the beatings, all of the victims testified that witnessing  Nichols's violence towards others made them upset and fearful of future violence directed towards themselves of  others, so they tried to be compliant and to avoid anything that would make Nichols upset. See, e.g., id. at 598  (Michelle testified that she felt helpless when Nichols beat Candace because she knew if she intervened, she too  would be beaten), 790 (Betty Jo testified, ""I just tried not to do stuff to make him upset so he wouldn't hurt  Cand[a]ce.""), 792 (Betty Jo testified that when Nichols beat Kaila it hurt her feelings and made her upset), 1019  (Marzett testified that witnessing the violence made her ""nervous and scared"" that the same thing would happen to  her, so she ""basically did everything [Nichols's] wanted her to do"" to avoid it), 1102 (Minor A testified that witnessing  Nichols's violence [*42]  made her nervous that she would be the target if she ever ""got out of line with him""). Thus, the jury heard testimony from the victims that as a result of the violence they experienced and witnessed,  they did things they did not want to do, like take calls from customers, work without sleep, or give Nichols all the  money they made. In a rare and remarkable courtroom drama, they also were confronted directly by the man who  they accused of this violence. The jury was able to listen to their testimony and judge their credibility and the jury  unanimously believed that this violence was related to the business relationship of sex trafficking. In this same vein,  Wright testified affirmatively that he saw Nichols ""trick, force, or threaten"" females to ""prostitute themselves"": ""Seen  you do it to all of them."" Id. at 1355. All of this testimony regarding Nichols's violence towards the women who  worked for him, particularly when combined with reasonable inferences from testimony about Nichols's control over  the victims' prostitution work, is more than sufficient to support Nichols's conviction. See, e.g., United States v.  Withers, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98985, 2017 WL 2790562, at *3-4 (W.D. Wis. June 27, 2017) (testimony that the  defendant hit his victims and others, he possessed a gun, victims were scared [*43]  of the defendant, and they  engaged in sex acts when they did not want to was more than enough evidence for the jury to reach its verdict). As if the threatened use of violence and actual violence were not enough, the victim-witnesses also testified about  how they knew Nichols to own and carry guns, which he would keep in safes or under the mattress at hotels and  have at the ready. Id. at 391-92, 447-48 (Jameela testified that Nichols said that he would ""blow people away"" with  the gun and told her that she ""could come up missing and don't nobody care about [her] because [her] family  stopped talking to [her]""), 822, 845-47, 862, 616, 676-78 (""You always had a gun on you. Didn't matter where you  were.""). For his part, Nichols confirmed that he had a gun (or guns) during the 2012 to 2014 time period, although  he argued that he used them for protection of the women and girls who worked for him. However, Wright testified  that Nichols kept the guns to protect his money. Id. at 1208. Wright also testified about an instance when he turned  a gun—albeit a BB gun—on Candace. Specifically, Wright stated that in Joliet, he and Nichols saw Candace  walking down the street with another man, so Nichols shot Candace in the back and then [*44]  in the face with a  BB gun. Id. at 1262-63. Nichols confirmed on cross that he purposely shot Candace. Id. at 1609. The government  also produced evidence that Nichols threatened to shoot Michelle in texts and social media messages. Considering all of this evidence together, the government presented ample evidence that Nichols's violent behavior  towards each of the victim-witnesses who testified at trial and his violent behavior towards other women and girls in  their presence—regardless of the personal or business motivation—caused his victims to live in constant fear and  submit to his rules and comply with demands to try to avoid his beatings and his vindictive actions. Thus, a  reasonable jury could find that Nichols used force, threats of force, and coercion to cause Betty Jo, Michelle, Minor  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *40 Page 13 of 38 A, Marzett, and Jameela to engage in prostitution. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the  government and not questioning the jury's credibility determinations or reassessing the weight of the evidence,  Arthur, 582 F.3d at 717, the evidence is more than sufficient to sustain the convictions on Counts 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8,  and Nichols's motion for acquittal on these counts is denied. B. Count One: Conspiracy to Commit Sex Trafficking [*45]  Count 1 of the Superseding Indictment also charged Nichols with conspiring to engage in sex trafficking with Fears  and others in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1594(c). To convict a defendant of conspiracy, the government must prove  beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant ""knowingly and intentionally joined in an agreement with one or more  other individuals to commit an unlawful act."" Orlando, 819 F.3d at 1022 (quoting United States v. Avila, 557 F.3d  809, 815 (7th Cir. 2009)). Accordingly, the government must show that Nichols knew the essential nature and scope  of the charged conspiracy and that he intended to participate in it. Id. Multiple witnesses testified to the close relationship between Nichols and Fears, one in which they referred to each  other as ""Pops"" and ""Son."" Nichols also testified that he and Fears had a ""good relationship,"" who is eight years his  junior: ""that was my boy."" Tr. at 1526-27. Although Nichols acknowledged throughout trial that Fears also  ""managed"" women and girls, Nichols argued that he never actually sat down with either Fears and agreed to traffic  women and teenage girls but that the two men ran completely ""separate businesses."" Yet, as to their coordination,  the government elicited testimony from Wright and others about how Nichols and Fears worked together [*46]  to  engage in sex trafficking. See, e.g., id. at 368-70 (Jameela testified that Fears worked with Nichols). For example,  the government's evidence demonstrated that the two recruited women and girls—including minors—to join their  teams together and the women and girls switched from working with Nichols to Fears or vice versa, either by choice  or if one of the two was in jail. Betty Jo, Marzett, and Michelle all testified that they worked for both Nichols and  Fears at certain points in time. A woman referred to as ""Ms. Perfect"" also worked for both Nichols and Fears.  Specifically, Wright testified that she first prostituted herself for Nichols, but then Nichols ""got tired of dealing with  her"" because she was ""too emotional,"" so Wright drove her to the hotel where Fears was staying and Nichols ""gave  her to [Fears]."" Id. at 1316-17. Another victim who testified at trial was Ciara. She met Fears in a hotel when she was 16 years-old, and Fears  shortly thereafter introduced her to Nichols. The two convinced Ciara to work for Fears in part because one of her  good friends was working for Nichols and living in a hotel with him. Nichols eventually took Ciara to another hotel  where she met other women who worked for Nichols [*47]  including Candace and where she worked having sex  for money after Nichols took her pictures and posted them on Backpage. Nichols set her rates that night. Id. at 892- 900. Ciara, however, ended up working only for Fears, which she did for about a year and a half. She preferred to  work with him because she thought Nichols was ""abusive. He beats his women."" Id. at 961. Ultimately, she had  experiences with Fears similar to those Betty Jo, Molly, Minor A, and Jameela had with Nichols. Meaning she had  to work all day every day and follow Fears's rules and work constantly or risk punishment (that is, beatings, getting  her face pushed in a toilet, or being denied food). Id. at 909-18. One time, she lied to Fears to have a night off and  when he found out, he threw her to the floor, stomped on her, and broke one of her fingers. Id. at 921-22. Fears  also supplied Ciara with ecstasy so that she could stay awake and work. Id. at 918. She testified that there were  days she worked when she did not want to because ""that was where I was at. It was either work or ain't no telling  what else will happen."" Id. In addition to these joint recruitment and retention efforts, Nichols and Fears operated their sex trafficking  operations together out of the same Chicagoland [*48]  area motels and strip clubs in Lansing, Harvey, and  Downers Grove to name a few. The two typically stayed at the same hotels and on the same floor. E.g., id. at 876  (testimony from a Motel 6 employee that she observed Nichols and Fears at the hotel together and she saw Nichols     2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *44 Page 14 of 38 almost daily in 2013, 2014). As an example as to how the two coordinated, Betty Jo testified that if Nichols was not  at the hotel with her, either Wright or Fears was there and Fears sometimes performed a security function for  Nichols's women. Id. at 798-99. Michelle also testified that Fears sought out Nichols's advice: ""You all were always  around each other. If he didn't know how to handle a female, he would come ask you. If he didn't know something  about a female that just came from you or that knows you, he would come to you."" Id. at 686. In addition to working  their girls in Chicago, Nichols and Fears took the women and girls to out-of-state locations together where they  engaged in sex trafficking, including Tennessee and Georgia. See, e.g., id. at 610-14, 1020-21, 1236, 1335-47. Not only did they operate their sex trafficking businesses out of the same locations, Nichols and Fears shared the  proceeds of their sex trafficking. Specifically, the jury heard testimony that Nichols [*49]  sometimes would lend  Fears money for clothes, food, or hotel rooms. These were rooms that were rented by Wright (or sometimes by the  trafficked women) and ultimately paid for by Nichols. Other times, Nichols lent Fears money for Backpage ads. Id.  at 908, 1201. Nichols and Fears—who were not employed—spent a majority of their time together in the hotels  while the women and girls saw customers. All day long they collected money, played video games, smoked  marijuana, and worked on Hit Squad music. Nichols was the CEO of the Hit Squad; Fears was the President. The  shared profits of their trafficking was used to fund and promote the group, like to make Hit Squad merchandise and  videos. Id. at 394, 425-26, 1206-07. Nichols and Fears also worked together to maintain an environment of fear and intimidation over their women. In  addition to the evidence about Nichols's violent behavior, Michelle and Betty Jo testified that Fears was present in  rooms when Nichols battered them or others, like Candace or Stallion, and he did not intervene. Id. at 371, 583,  787-89. Fears also was violent with women, like Ciara and Ms. Perfect. Further, Wright testified about an instance  where Nichols and Fears beat Ms. Perfect together in a hotel room in front of others. Id. at 1306. At trial, [*50]  Nichols argued that his ""management"" or ""promotion"" of women was completely separate from what  Fears was doing, but at least one witness called Nichols and Fears ""a team"" and described them as ""business  partners when it came to promoting women."" Id. at 685-87; see also id. at 943 (Ciara testified that Nichols and  Fears did ""not necessarily"" work separately and that Nichols ""called the shots, and you know it.""), 956 (Ciara  testified that Nichols and Fears had a business relationship: ""And any time Buck said to do something, it was  done.""). On this topic, Dr. Cooper testified that it is common for an older pimp to mentor a younger pimp by  ""teach[ing] them how to gain and maintain control over women and girls, and especially how to make as much  money as possible from these—from these members of their stable."" Id. at 234-35. In any event, Nichols's attempt to distance himself from Fears ignores all of the evidence the jury heard about the  arrangement between himself and Wright. Dr. Cooper testified that it is common for traffickers to have a network of  sorts, which—especially for pimps who market girls online—includes ""certain taxi drivers who they would be paying  to transport the women and girls to the hotel."" Id. at 234. That's what [*51]  happened here. Wright testified that  Nichols asked him to ""help out with rides, help him to get him and his girls to and from the clubs, to and from the  hotels, and to, you know, do outcalls."" Id. at 1195, 1357 (""I admitted I was your driver; that I helped you out with the  girls, driving you and the girls to and from hotels; to do out-calls to and from the different strip clubs.""). For this work  in support of his sex trafficking organization, Nichols offered Wright $50 per day (in the beginning) and gas  money—money that Wright understood Nichols got ""from pimping."" Wright accepted Nichols's offer and drove  various women and girls, such as Betty Jo, Michelle, Minor A, Marzett, and Jameela, around Illinois and the country  at Nichols's direction from July 2013 until Nichols was arrested in late 2014. Id. at 1195-96; see also id. at 371  (Jameela testified that Wright would drive her to outcalls, strip clubs, to the store, or to get something to eat), 809  (Betty Jo testified that Wright ""would drive girls to outcalls, and he was just the chauffeur""), 1108 (Minor A's  testimony about ""outcalls"" to Indiana; Wright drove). Wright also drove to stores like pharmacies to get things  Nichols and the women needed like condoms, toiletries, [*52]  and Visa gift cards to pay for Backpage ads, which  Nichols would pay for either in person or by giving Wright money. Wright purchased cell phones for the girls and at  Nichols's direction and with money provided by Nichols. Wright also drove Nichols wherever he wanted to go. Id. at  1202-05. Wright worked with Nichols to rent the hotel rooms in his own name and that he paid for rooms with cash  Nichols gave him. Overall, Wright was aware of the intricacies of Nichols's trafficking operation—from the procedure  the girls used to get customers and notify Nichols about the customers to Nichols's rules and the consequences for  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *48 Page 15 of 38 breaking them. He testified that he assisted the operation by doing whatever Nichols asked of him for more than a  year. See United States v. Cephus, 684 F.3d 703, 707 (7th Cir. 2012). Thus, there was overwhelming evidence that the jury could rely on to find that Nichols conspired with others to  engage in sex trafficking. In other words, the evidence described above is more than sufficient to sustain the jury's  verdict as to Count 1, and the motion for acquittal is denied. II. Rule 33 New Trial Motion Alternatively, a court may vacate a judgment and grant a new trial upon the defendant's motion ""if the interest of  justice so requires."" See Fed. R. Crim. P. 33; see also [*53]  United States v. Conley, 875 F.3d 391, 399 (7th Cir.  2017); United States v. Smith, 674 F.3d 722, 728 (7th Cir. 2012). Unlike a motion for acquittal, the Court need not  view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and it may consider the credibility of the witnesses.  See United States v. Washington, 184 F.3d 653, 657 (7th Cir. 1999). Rather, ""a defendant is entitled to a new trial if  there is a reasonable possibility that a trial error had a prejudicial effect upon the jury's verdict."" United States v.  Van Eyl, 468 F.3d 428, 436 (7th Cir. 2006); see also United States v. Kuzniar, 881 F.2d 466, 470 (7th Cir. 1989)  (""[C]ourts have interpreted [Rule 33] to require a new trial in the interests of justice in a variety of situations in which  the substantial rights of the defendant have been jeopardized by errors or omissions during trial.""). However, ""the  exercise of power conferred by Rule 33 is reserved for only the most extreme cases."" United States v. Peterson,  823 F.3d 1113, 1122 (7th Cir. 2016) (citing United States v. Morales, 902 F.2d 604, 606 (7th Cir. 1990), amended  910 F.2d 467 (7th Cir. 1990)). In other words, the Court should grant a motion for a new trial only if ""the evidence  'preponderates so heavily against the verdict that it would be a manifest injustice to let the guilty verdict stand.'""  Conley, 875 F.3d at 399 (quoting United States v. Reed, 875 F.2d 107, 114 (7th Cir. 1989)); see also Presbitero,  569 F.3d at 706. The Court addresses common arguments together where possible in this discussion. A. There Was No Speedy Trial Act Violation Nichols claims without elaborating that the Court erred in denying his pretrial motions to dismiss the indictment on  speedy trial grounds. See (Dkt. 279) at (1)(b). Each time [*54]  Nichols argued that the Speedy Trial Act was  violated, the Court considered his motion and denied it. See (Dkts. 123, 192, 226, 252); see also (Dkt. 298)  (12/21/17 Hearing), (Dkt. 199) (1/8/18 Hearing), (Dkt. 212) (2/1/18 Hearing). In his motion, Nichols specifically  points to motions he filed on May 11, 2017 (Dkt. 142), February 1, 2018 (Dkt. 211), and March 12, 2018 (Dkt. 247)  as wrongly decided. The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution provides that ""in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the  right to a speedy . . . trial."" The Supreme Court has held that the so-called speedy trial clock does not begin to tick  ""before a defendant is indicted, arrested, or otherwise officially accused."" United States v. MacDonald, 456 U.S. 1,  6, 102 S. Ct. 1497, 71 L. Ed. 2d 696 (1982). The government may file charges by filing a criminal complaint based  upon the affidavit of a law enforcement officer. Fed. R. Crim. P. 3. When the charge is brought by a law  enforcement officer as the complainant, the federal prosecutor must indict the case within 30 days or seek an            2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *52 Page 16 of 38 extension of time to file the indictment from the Chief Judge. 18 U.S.C. § 3161(b); see also N.D. Ill. L. Cr. R. 6.1. If  the federal prosecutor does not seek an indictment from the grand jury within 30 days, the complaint is dismissed.  18 U.S.C. § 3162(a); Fed. R. Crim. P. 48(b)(1). This 30-day period from complaint [*55]  to indictment begins to run  ""from the date on which such individual was arrested or served with a summons in connection with such charges,""  which in this matter means the moment Nichols was taken into federal custody, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(b), and not from  the date that the complaint was filed on the docket. See United States v. Clark, 754 F.3d 401, 405-07 (7th Cir.  2014). Specifically, Nichols was charged in a criminal complaint filed on December 29, 2015 in the Northern District of  Illinois with sex trafficking of Individual C by force, fraud, or coercion in violation of the TVPA. (Dkt. 1). An arrest  warrant was issued the same day. (Dkt. 5). At that time, Nichols was incarcerated on unrelated state charges in  Tennessee; he was not in the custody of federal agents. On January 5, 2016, federal agents took Nichols into  custody in Tennessee. (Dkt. Entry 1/5/16) (""ARREST of defendant Samuel Nichols in the Western District of  Tennessee.""); see (Dkt. 7) at 47 (executed arrest warrant); (Dkt. 40); see also Tr. at 1539 (Nichols testified that he  was convicted of domestic battery in 2015 (regarding Candace) and sentenced to one year in prison). After his  initial appearance in the Western District of Tennessee on January 5, Nichols was transported to the Northern  District [*56]  of Illinois. On February 3, 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Nichols on charges of sex trafficking of  Individual C, Individual A, and Minor A. See (Dkt. 21). Therefore, the indictment was returned 29 days after Nichols  was arrested on this matter—within the applicable 30-day time period under § 3161(b). The Superseding Indictment  came down two months later. Nichols previously argued that the 30-day clock began to run on December 29, 2015 because the issuance of the  arrest warrant and filing of the ""criminal complaint constitutes as a summons served in connection with the  charges."" See (Dkt. 211) at 1-2; (Dkt. 247) at 2. Not only is Nichols's assertion wholly unsupported by any authority,  it is not a tenable interpretation of the statute. A complaint is not a summons, and the filing of a complaint with the  Court cannot constitute service of a summons (or even of the complaint itself). Nichols's argument would render the  language of the statute meaningless and would have the clock start running at the time any criminal complaint is  filed. Again, that is not what the statute dictates, and such faulty logic particularly is inapplicable where the criminal  complaint charges a felony as it did here. [*57]  Although a criminal complaint can initiate a misdemeanor  prosecution, a ""complaint that charges a felony can establish a basis for an arrest warrant, justify an arrest made  without a warrant, initiate, continue, or expand an investigation, and notify other law enforcement agencies of its  concern with the person arrested or investigated."" United States v. Richardson, 780 F.3d 812, 814 (7th Cir. 2015)  (citations omitted). That is, a criminal complaint that charges a felony signifies an investigation rather than a  prosecution. Id. Therefore, the filing of the criminal complaint did not constitute an event in which Nichols was  ""otherwise officially accused"" of a federal felony so as to start the speedy trial clock. MacDonald, 456 U.S. at 6. In fact, the Seventh Circuit has already considered and rejected a similar argument that the speedy trial clock  started with the filing of a federal complaint and a detainer with a sheriff. In United States v. Clark, the appellate  court made clear that ""[t]he sine qua non of an arrest for purposes of the [Speedy Trial] Act is the act of  unambiguously bringing the accused into federal custody."" 754 F.3d at 407. In other words, a ""'federal deprivation  of liberty' is required to start the 30-day period under the Speedy Trial Act."" Id. For this reason, [*58]  to the extent  that Nichols has raised any argument that he was arrested on a date before January 5, 2016 because he was  already in custody on state charges, this too fails because the record clearly indicates that he was not brought into  federal custody until January 5, 2016. See (Dkt. 40) (returned arrest warrant); (Dkt. 211) at 6 (Fax Transmission  from Shelby County, Tennessee Sheriff's Office noting that Nichols was in custody at the Shelby County Jail from  April 27, 2015 to January 5, 2016); see also Richardson, 780 F.3d at 815 (""[t]he relevant arrest (that is, one  followed by detention) must be for a suspected federal crime, and there was no federal arrest when he was arrested  on state charges""). Because neither the filing of the complaint, the issuance of the arrest warrant, or the April 2015  arrest on state charges initiated federal custody, Nichols's speedy trial clock did not begin to run until his federal  arrest on the charges brought in this matter on January 5, 2016. He was indicted 29 days later and thus, there was  no violation of the Act. 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *54 Page 17 of 38 B. Counsel Issues Next, Nichols argues that the Court erred in denying his motions for appointment of new counsel. (Dkt. 279) at  (1)(a). Like his argument that [*59]  his speedy-trial motions were erroneously denied, Nichols rests on ""the  arguments and law cited in these motions and incorporates by reference[] that language in these pleading[s]"" as  well as the arguments advanced in open court. Id. at 3. However, even in the criminal context, perfunctory and  undeveloped arguments, unsupported by pertinent authority, are waived and warrant no discussion (even where  those arguments raise constitutional issues); courts are not obligated ""to research and construct the legal  arguments open to parties, especially when they are represented by counsel."" United States v. Holm, 326 F.3d 872,  877 (7th Cir. 2003) (quotations and citations omitted); accord United States v. Cisneros, 846 F.3d 972, 978 (7th Cir.  2017) (claim waived where defendant failed to develop law and underlying facts); United States v. Alden, 527 F.3d  653, 664 (7th Cir. 2008); United States v. McLee, 436 F.3d 751, 760 (7th Cir. 2006) (argument was ""woefully  underdeveloped"" where defendant argued court admitted hearsay statements but failed to identify such  statements). In any event, to summarize the issue, Nichols was entitled to attorney representation to defend the charges brought  against him. See United States v. Irorere, 228 F.3d 816, 826 (7th Cir. 2000). After appointing one attorney, the  Court appointed co-counsel due to the complexity of the charges and the severity of the potential penalty upon  conviction. (Dkts. 81, 83). Yet after counsel's unsuccessful attempt to dismiss [*60]  the indictment based on  speedy trial violations in a motion that they filed at his request but that also explained the lack of supporting legal  authority for the argument (Dkt. 91), Nichols stopped working with his attorneys. In fact, he asserted on numerous  occasions that he could not work with attorneys who did not support his position — a position not supported by the  law. See, e.g., (Dkts. 129, 142, 211, 213). After Nichols filed the first of these motions in March 2017, the Court held hearings on March 21 and April 12, 2017.  See (Dkt. 296) (3/21/17 Hearing Tr.); (Dkt. 297) (4/12/17 Hearing Tr.). Between these hearings, counsel met with  Nichols to work out his concerns. On April 12, 2017, however, Nichols made clear that he would not relent and  insisted on substitute counsel. Nichols based his position on his disagreement with the manner in which counsel  presented his speedy-trial motion, which Nichols viewed as helpful to the government in that it supplied accurate  caselaw to the Court, and his feeling that no progress was being made on his case. Ultimately, Nichols said that he  did not feel that it was in his best interest to stick with his counsel. See (Dkt. 297) at 5-8. After [*61]  hearing  Nichols's arguments, the Court explained that his appointed counsel have an independent ethical obligation not to  bring motions in bad faith or to present a false statement of fact or law to the Court. The Court also explained to  Nichols that while he had a right to counsel, he did not have a right to be appointed the counsel of his choice  (although he was free to hire an attorney of his choosing). So with regard to appointed counsel, he could either  work with counsel or choose to proceed pro se. After his continued refusal to work with counsel, the Court denied  his request for new counsel but granted the attorneys' motion to withdraw due to irreconcilable differences, ordering  that they stay on as stand-by counsel and that they continue trial preparations. See id. at 10-12. The Court warned  Nichols that it was not in his best interest to proceed pro se—a warning the Court repeated to Nichols at each  subsequent status hearing. In addition, the Court again thoroughly explored Nichols's issues with counsel and also  questioned him about his legal and educational history at subsequent hearings. (Dkt. 298) (12/21/17 Hearing Tr.) at  8-47; see also (Dkt. 199) (1/8/18 Hearing); (Dkt. 212) (2/1/18 [*62]  Hearing). During this same time, because of Nichols's desire to continue to fight the indictment on speedy-trial grounds, the  Court exhaustively explained to Nichols that his claim was without merit for the reasons laid out above and allowed  him to seek additional records from the Tennessee jail to demonstrate the flaw in his claim. Nevertheless, Nichols  adamantly refused to accept the rulings and to work with counsel. In requesting new counsel, he claimed to have a  conflict of interest with his appointed lawyers due to the fact that they had filed the motion to dismiss the indictment  with the correct caselaw. A district court abuses its discretion in denying a motion to substitute counsel ""only if there exists a demonstrable  conflict of interest or if counsel and defendant are so at odds as to prevent presentation of an adequate defense.""  United States v. Horton, 845 F.2d 1414, 1417-18 (7th Cir. 1988) (citation omitted). As already described, the Court  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *58 Page 18 of 38 inquired into the basis for Nichols's substitution motions and he made clear that they were based on the way  counsel dealt with his speedy-trial issue and his resultant feeling that they were not working in his best interests.  But the Court explained to Nichols that his speedy-trial argument was [*63]  meritless (see (Dkt. 226) (""Of course,  there is no attorney who could represent Nichols and present his flawed position to the Court as he wishes because  his position is not supported by the law."")), and counsel repeatedly affirmed that they were willing and ready to  assist Nichols in the presentation of an adequate defense. Nichols's disagreement with counsel did not constitute a  conflict. See, e.g., Hall v. United States, 371 F.3d 969, 973 (7th Cir. 2004) (""[A]n actual conflict exists if the defense  counsel was faced with a choice between advancing his own interests above those of his client.""); Lipson v. United  States, 233 F.3d 942, 946 (7th Cir. 2000) (recognizing actual conflict where attorney allows a client's co-defendant  to dictate the client's legal defense because he is paying the client's legal fees). ""[D]enial of a motion to substitute  alleging only 'ethereal distrust' of counsel is not reversible error."" Horton, 845 F.2d at 1418 (United States v. Morris,  714 F.2d 669, 673 (7th Cir. 1983)). ""Nor do 'personality conflicts and disagreements over trial strategy' constitute  grounds for reversible error."" Id. (quoting United States v. Hillsberg, 812 F.2d 328, 333-34 (7th Cir. 1987), and  affirming court's denial of motion to substitute counsel based on finding that ""communication barrier"" between  defense counsel and defendant was merely the result of defendant's refusal to cooperate with defense counsel). It  was clear that the alleged [*64]  conflict here concerned only strategy decisions and a general feeling of distrust  and therefore was not a valid conflict; it was frivolous. See id. at 1421 (""It is no deficiency of defendant's counsel  that he did not file unnecessary motions of some sort to satisfy Horton.""). Further, the Court's inquiries of Nichols and appointed counsel indicated that although they disagreed on how the  speedy-trial motion was handled, they were not so at odds as to prevent presentation of an adequate defense. To  be sure, Nichols refused to meet with counsel at times, but other times he accepted and followed their advice.  Counsel repeatedly represented (and demonstrated) to the Court that they were prepared to proceed to trial and  during dozens of status hearings counsel apprised the Court of the intense work they were engaged in to prepare  for trial. Thus, denial of the motions for substitute counsel was appropriate. See United States v. Thomas, 833 F.3d  785, 793 (7th Cir. 2016) (denial of request for new counsel was not abuse of discretion where defendant refused to  meet or cooperate with fourth appointed attorney); United States v. Volpentesta, 727 F.3d 666, 673-74 (7th Cir.  2013) (denial of request for new counsel was not abuse of discretion; ""arguments over trial strategy (which likely  developed into personality conflicts over [*65]  time as well), . . . do not constitute grounds for substitution of  counsel""). The necessary consequence of a court's denial of a request to substitute counsel ""is that the defendant must  choose whether to (1) continue with appointed counsel, (2) retain counsel, or (3) proceed pro se."" Thomas, 833  F.3d at 792. Here, through his refusal to work with counsel, his belligerent and obstructive behavior, his motions  and in court arguments, and his efforts to delay the trial, the Court found that Nichols had constructively discharged  his attorneys. See (Dkt. 192); (Dkt. 226) at 7-11; (Dkt. 297) at 11; (Dkt. 298) at 37-47. To the extent that Nichols  challenges this finding, it was not error. See Irorere, 228 F.3d 816, 826 (""a defendant may waive his right to counsel  through his own contumacious conduct"") (citing United States v. Fazzini, 871 F.2d 635, 642 (7th Cir. 1989)); see  also United States v. Jones, 844 F.3d 636, 644 (7th Cir. 2016) (where defendant exhibited a ""pattern of delay and  obstruction, the district judge did not abuse her discretion in denying [his] request for appointment of yet another  lawyer""); Volpentesta, 727 F.3d 666, 678 (7th Cir. 2013) (defendant's waiver ""was a strategic decision he made so  that he could pursue the case as he desired""). The Court addressed the difficulties of proceeding pro se with Nichols on numerous occasions and explored at  length his background and experience [*66]  with the legal system. See, e.g., (Dkts. 297, 298). In spite of these  warnings, Nichols refused to work with his appointed counsel. As such, the record clearly reflects that Nichols's  waiver of counsel was knowing and intelligent. See Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L.  Ed. 2d 562 (1975) (in order to represent himself, the accused must knowingly and intelligently forgo those  relinquished benefits) (citations and quotations omitted); United States v. Balsiger, 910 F.3d 942, 953 (7th Cir.  2018) (considering the background and experience of the defendant, the context of his decision, whether the district  court conducted a formal hearing and any other evidence establishes the defendant understood the dangers and  disadvantages of proceeding pro se); accord Volpentesta, 727 F.3d at 677. Indeed, the Court gave Nichols  sufficient opportunity to retain the assistance of appointed counsel; his actions depriving himself of counsel  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *62 Page 19 of 38 establish a knowing and intentional choice. Irorere, 228 F.3d at 828 (citing Fazzini, 871 F.2d at 642); United States  v. Murphy, 469 F.3d 1130, 1136 (7th Cir. 2006) (""a defendant can waive his right to counsel through conduct as  well as words.""); United States v. Harris, 2 F.3d 1452, 1455 (7th Cir. 1993) (finding voluntary and informed waiver  where the defendant refused to cooperate with his lawyers and was told that no substitute counsel would be  appointed for him). Like the defendant in Balsiger, the record here shows that in addition to the Court's explicit  warnings, [*67]  Nichols's conduct demonstrated that he ""sufficiently appreciated the risks of going it alone"" ""as he  repeatedly asserted he was not waiving his right to counsel and relied on standby counsel during trial."" 910 F.3d at  954; see United States v. Hoskins, 243 F.3d 407, 409 (7th Cir. 2001) (upholding waiver where district court advised  defendant that he ""would be far better off being defended by a trained lawyer and that it would be 'unwise' to defend  himself because of the complexity of the legal issues involved""). All in all, Nichols made deliberate decisions  regarding his representation, which were based on his desire to continue to pursue dismissal of the indictment on  speedy-trial grounds. ""A waiver is likely knowing and voluntary if the defendant gave it for strategic reasons or after  repeatedly rejecting the assistance of counsel."" United States v. England, 507 F.3d 581, 588 (7th Cir. 2007); see  also United States v. Banks, 828 F.3d 609, 614-16 (7th Cir. 2016); Volpentesta, 727 F.3d at 678. As a final point, although Nichols refused to accept the Court's ruling on his speedy-trial motions and  correspondingly refused to work with counsel to prepare for trial, counsel continued to provide him competent  services to the best of their ability and whenever Nichols asked or needed them to step in. For example, counsel  requested an initial competency examination and then a second by an individual of their [*68]  selection. They  represented Nichols at the March 1, 2018 competency hearing and briefed the issue. In addition, counsel was  present at trial and assisted Nichols throughout, at times playing significant roles, such as conducting proceedings  during Nichols's brief absences (voir dire and cross examination of Dr. Cooper), arguing the motion for dismissal of  the indictment, and assisting with the jury instruction conference. Counsel also provided frequent advice and  assistance to Nichols in real time. See, e.g., Tr. at 755 (""THE COURT: Okay. What is your reason for showing it?  THE DEFENDANT: Help. MS. WINSLOW: To show that she is, in fact, not a law-abiding citizen . . . .""); id. at 738  (""Let the record also reflect that for the last three days, you've been doing very well, communicating with [Ms.  Winslow] regularly, using questions that she has drafted, stopping in the middle—""); see generally id. (reflecting  countless instances where Nichols conferred with stand-by counsel). The record is replete with instances where  Nichols turned and consulted with his standby counsel sometimes for many minutes at a time before continuing with  his own performance. In his closing argument, Nichols acknowledged [*69]  the efforts of stand-by counsel by  stating on the record: ""I would like to thank my lawyers who have been very patient with me and clearly have my  best interest at heart, even though I was mean to them in the beginning."" Id. at 1766. In sum, having failed to set forth any new reasoning as to why the decisions on this issue merit further  reconsideration and based on the Court's consideration of the record, the Court finds no error in its prior rulings. C. Nichols Was Competent to Stand Trial Regarding his competence, Nichols first generally challenges the Court's finding after the March 1, 2018  competency hearing, which involved the testimony of two different psychologists who evaluated Nichols. See (Dkt.  279) at (1)(d). By way of background, after Nichols requested a mental health evaluation, the Court granted the  motion on August 30, 2017 (Dkt. 173); a doctor from the Isaac Ray Forensic Group was selected. (Dkt. 176). On  December 10, 2017, Dr. Diana Goldstein submitted the ordered report, which indicated that Nichols was competent  to stand trial. (Dkt. 194). The Court thereafter granted Nichols's motion for a second evaluation and on February 12,  2018, Nichols's chosen evaluator, Dr. Michael Fields, [*70]  submitted a report to the Court, wherein he found that  Nichols was not competent to stand trial due to his lack of capacity to conform himself to many of the expectations  of the trial process. The Court held a competency hearing on March 1, 2018 and both psychologists testified and were cross examined.  To summarize, Dr. Goldstein, a neuropsychologist, testified that she met with Nichols on two occasions for a total of  about 13 hours and performed both cognitive and psychological testing in addition to gathering his background  information and conducting a competency interview. See (Dkt. 310) at 17. Dr. Goldstein concluded that Nichols had  personality disorders, learning disorders, and other developmental disorders, but that he did not have any major  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *66 Page 20 of 38 mental disorder or serious psychiatric problem. Id. at 38. She testified that Nichols's disorders were ""behavioral  problems, and they're under his control,"" so there was ""nothing from a cognitive standpoint or psychiatric standpoint  in [her] opinion that is affecting is capacity, his ability to work meaningfully with his attorneys or any with any  attorney if he wants to toward a defense."" Id. at 42. Speaking to Nichols's refusal to work with counsel, Dr.  Goldstein [*71]  testified ""this is willful, he's angry, and he is choosing not to work with his attorneys."" Id. On the  other hand, Dr. Fields, a clinical and forensic psychologist, testified that he spoke with Nichols for about one and a  half hours and discussed his background and the charges pending against him but was not able to administer any  cognitive tests. Id. at 63-64. Based on their interactions, Dr. Fields concluded that Nichols was emotionally unstable  and unable to comport himself effectively, and therefore he was not competent to stand trial. Id. at 72. Ultimately,  after considering both reports, the testimony, other hearing evidence presented including jail calls involving Nichols  (which indicated that Nichols's issues with counsel and competence challenges were ""strategy and a delay tactic""),  and Nichols's cooperative behavior during the competency hearing, the Court discredited Dr. Fields's report and  found Nichols competent to stand trial and to represent himself. See id. at 94-101. Nichols generally argues that this  was an error. (Dkt. 279) at 3. Whether a defendant is competent depends on whether he ""has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer  with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and whether [*72]  he has a rational as well as factual  understanding of the proceedings against him."" Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S. Ct. 788, 4 L. Ed.  2d 824 (1960); see 18 U.S.C. § 4241(d). Absent specific evidence to the contrary, ""there is a presumption that a  criminal defendant is mentally competent to stand trial."" United States v. Teague, 956 F.2d 1427, 1431 (7th Cir.  1992) (quoting Chichakly v. United States, 926 F.2d 624, 633 (7th Cir. 1991)). On this point, Nichols does not make  any specific arguments of error in the Court's finding of competence after the hearing. He also does not cite any  case law to support his position that the Court was incorrect in finding him competent to stand trial. Therefore, the  Court sees no reason to further reconsider its ruling—based on both expert testimony, Nichols's statements, and  the Court's own observations—that Nichols was competent under the Dusky standard. See (Dkt. 310) at 94-101  (among other things, accepting Dr. Goldstein's conclusion that although Nichols had documented personality  disorders, he did not suffer from any mental disease or defect; discrediting Dr. Field's evaluation for using an  improper standard and not actually testing Nichols; finding that Nichols was very much aware that he was facing  serious charges, he was aware of the elements of the charges, and he had formulated certain defenses; and noting  that Nichols was able to comport [*73]  himself to courtroom behavior and cooperate with stand-by counsel during  the hearing); e.g., United States v. Segal, 398 F. Supp. 2d 912, 916 (N.D. Ill. 2005) (factors that the court may  consider include testimony from psychiatrists, the defendant's behavior—both before the court and elsewhere— intelligence, lapses of memory, unresponsiveness and defense counsel's observations). Nichols suggests, however, that even if he was competent to stand trial, he was not competent to represent himself  during the proceedings. See (Dkt. 279) at (1)(c). This is because he has little formal education, reads at a remedial  level, previously was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder and required medication, and could not keep up with  the voluminous discovery in the matter. Id. at 2. Although Nichols concedes that the Court held at least two  hearings to determine his ability to represent himself, he argues that his conduct at trial demonstrated that he  ""clearly was not capable of acting as his own counsel."" Id. He further argues that he was incapable of representing  himself because of certain medications he took during the first few days of trial which caused extreme drowsiness,  impeded his ability to focus, and made him more agitated and jumpy. (Dkt. 294) at 1-2. These [*74]  arguments,  however, are without merit. ""The Constitution does not create two standards for competence—one for standing trial  and the other for self-representation."" United States v. Anzaldi, 800 F.3d 872, 879 (7th Cir. 2015). Thus, the Court  did not err in finding Nichols competent for the reasons already explained above. For what it is worth, Nichols arguments here do not in any way undermine the Court's conclusion that he was  competent. In fact, many of these arguments are belied by the record. For example, the record indicates that  although his educational experiences were less than stable, Nichols is a high school graduate. See (Dkt. 298) at 11- 12. Second, he relayed to the Court that he has significant criminal experience, having been a defendant in at least  nine other criminal matters in state court (represented by counsel), at least one of which went to trial. Id. at 13-14.  Third, he unequivocally told the Court, ""I know how to read."" Id. at 25. Through the course of this discussion,  Nichols indicated that he could understand many of the legal issues that he came in contact with. See id. at 35 (""Me  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *70 Page 21 of 38 reading and me understanding, that will help me.""). Although Dr. Goldstein testified that Nichols reads at a fifth- grade level and lacks school-learned information and [*75]  some attentional skills, she testified that he does very  well in non-verbal problem solving and abstract reasoning. See (Dkt. 310) at 32. Nichols's trial behavior further demonstrated his competence. First, he effectively cross-examined various  witnesses. Generally, the Court noted ""Mr. Nichols has very effectively crossed about the personal relationships  that he's had with many of these individuals who are working for him . . . ."" Tr. at 1464. In particular, he effectively  cross examined Jameela regarding a gun in a rap video, discussed below. Id. at 1467 (the prosecutor noted that  ""he was able to effectively cross-examine the witness about her improper recollection of what the video showed."").  In addition, the Court noted that ""[h]e used [the medical records] effectively to cross the [hospital] records  custodian"" about Michelle's injuries, also discussed below. Id. at 1473. Also regarding Michelle, the Court noted that  Nichols had ""effectively used"" the jail call to impeach her. Id. at 1712. Second, Nichols made several objections throughout trial that were sustained. Third, Nichols asserted various  defense theories throughout the proceedings, such as the theory that he never forced the women and girls to  prostitute [*76]  themselves, the violence discussed at trial was personal or domestic in nature and not related to  the trafficking, and that he had no knowledge or reason to know that anyone who worked for him was a minor.  Significantly, the jury accepted his last argument, finding only that Nichols knew or recklessly disregarded that  force, threats of force, or coercion would cause Minor A to engage in a commercial sex act, and not that he knew or  recklessly disregarded the fact that she was under 18 years of age. See (Dkt. 267) at 2. These themes were  reflected in Nichols's opening statement and closing argument. These examples demonstrate that Nichols actively  and at times successfully participated in his defense and they further support the Court's competency  determination. See Anzaldi, 800 F.3d at 879 (pro se defendant who actively participated in defense at trial and  advanced nuanced legal arguments, such as arguments attempting to negate an element of her crime, reflected an  in-depth understanding of the charges against her and demonstrated her competence); United States v. Berry, 565  F.3d 385, 389 (7th Cir. 2009) (pro se defendant's performance—lodging objections, cross-examining witnesses,  and making opening and closing statements—demonstrated mental competence). Finally, [*77]  the Court has already addressed the issue of Nichols's self-driven over-medication before and at the  start of trial and its effect on the Court's competency ruling. See (Dkt. 319). Seeing that Nichols asserts the same  arguments here, the Court stands on its prior conclusion that ""in light of the two competency evaluations, the March  competency hearing, the Court's investigation of Nichols's medications, the Court's on-the-record discussions with  Nichols regarding his medication, and the revisions to Nichols's medication administration at the start of trial— combined with the Court's observation of Nichols's behavior throughout his criminal proceedings as a whole— Nichols has not carried his burden of demonstrating reasonable cause to believe that he was incompetent at trial.""  Id. at 5. Specifically, jury selection began on the morning of March 12, 2018. After the Court described the case, the  prospective jurors were placed under oath and questioned individually in groups of 14. See (Dkt. 288) (""Voir Dire  Tr."") at 17. While the Court was questioning the fourth prospective juror out of the first group of 14, ""Nichols was  leaning back with his eyes closed, apparently sleeping."" Id. at 63. This is when Nichols [*78]  first mentioned the  issue of medication and drowsiness. Id. at 57, 63. Accordingly, the Court conducted questioning at sidebar to allow  Nichols to ""stand up and wake up."" Id. at 63. But Nichols began to act out and become disrespectful to the Court  and proceedings generally. See, e.g., id. at 66 (""THE DEFENDANT: Why don't you strike myself? I'm tired of this. I  don't—why am I still even here?""). The questioning continued and shortly thereafter the trial broke for a 45-minute  lunch break. Returning around 1:30 p.m., the Court continued to question the first 14 jurors. At one point, Nichols  flippantly asked what the purpose of the questioning was and after the Court explained the jury selection process,  he asked if he could ""just leave."" Id. at 125-26; see also id. at 126 (""THE DEFENDANT: I don't want to be here no  more. I'm not sitting through this. You all sitting here telling these people basically I'm a fucking monster. I don't  want to sit here and listen to this. I want to leave. That's what I want to do.""); id. at 127 (""THE DEFENDANT: I don't  care about nothing you told me. I'm ready to go.""). Eventually, Nichols had profanity-filled outburst in front of the  prospective jurors and he was removed from the courtroom. Id. at 128. Nichols was taken to a [*79]  neighboring  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *74 Page 22 of 38 courtroom with one stand-by attorney, where a live closed-circuit video feed of the proceedings was available to  him. His other stand-by counsel remained in the courtroom to participate in voir dire. Outside of the presence of the potential jurors the next morning, March 13, Nichols expressed his desire to  participate in trial and the Court explained the jury selection process and courtroom rules. Tr. at 86-101. In addition,  the Court discussed information about Nichols's medications that it received from the Metropolitan Correctional  Center where Nichols was detained, since Nichols was unable to provide those details the previous day. Jail  counsel and a pharmacist reported that Nichols had been prescribed an anti-inflammatory medication and two anti- depressants but that the anti-depressants had been discontinued. Nichols disputed the accuracy of that report, so  the Court re-inquired. Id. at 105-08. Regardless of the dispute, Nichols represented that he had not taken his  medication that morning so he would not be sleepy. Id. at 302; Voir Dire Tr. at 324. Nichols participated in jury  selection without any incident. In fact, as is described in further detail below, the Court even allowed Nichols [*80]   to question at sidebar all of the jurors who had been questioned on March 12 after he was removed from the  courtroom who had not been stricken for cause and released. In addition, before the jurors were selected the Court  asked one final question of the panel: Okay, folks. As you can see, Mr. Nichols is cooperating with the trial process today, but I do need to make sure  that yesterday's behavior did not impact the way you look at him as a defendant. I want to make sure that  everyone still presumes him to be innocent, and that you will hold the government to their burden of proof. Is  there anyone here that, after observing yesterday's behavior, believes that they have—that is not the case, that  they can't give him the presumption of innocence? If so, please raise your hand now. Id. at 339. No potential juror responded affirmatively. After lunch, Nichols gave an opening statement, which  previewed his defense theories. However, when the government called its first witness (Dr. Cooper) around 2:30  p.m., Nichols interrupted: ""I want to go. Hey, your Honor, I'm ready. Get me the fuck up out of here. I'm ready to go.  I can't do this. I'm not going to be able to do it."" Tr. at 191. After this, Nichols [*81]  was removed to the satellite  courtroom for the remainder of the day, which involved Dr. Cooper's testimony. Another report from the jail was discussed the following morning, indicating that Nichols's anti-depressants were  supposed to be increased, not discontinued. Id. at 302. Accordingly, the Court reported that increased dosages of  those medications would be prescribed and administered during the pill line—to track compliance—and in the  evenings—to address any possible, but unlikely, sedation issues—with the exception of one of the medications  which required a morning and evening dosage. Id. at 302-03. Nichols did not report drowsiness or any other issues  for the remainder of trial. As the timeline of events reflects, the Court immediately took appropriate measures to  address Nichols's sleepiness and medication-related issues during the first trial day. Moreover, the Court gave  Nichols the opportunity to question prospective jurors from the previous day and ensured that Nichols's behavior  had not prejudiced any of the prospective jurors, meaning that Nichols did not suffer any prejudice on account of the  proceedings on the first day. In addition, neither Nichols's initial drowsiness nor his outbursts during [*82]  the first  two days of trial are cause to disturb the Court's earlier competence conclusion, especially where the administration  of his antidepressants and other medication was modified and Nichols did not experience any further episodes and  he was not again removed from the courtroom. See Woods v. McBride, 430 F.3d 813, 818-20 (7th Cir. 2005)  (defendant's medication-induced drowsiness during jury selection did not upend earlier competence finding); see  also United States v. Savage, 505 F.3d 754, 759-60 (7th Cir. 2007). Indeed, during the remaining eight trial days,  Nichols ably conducted the cross-examination of twelve witnesses with vigor and alertness for hours, he took the  stand and testified in his own defense, and he presented a lengthy closing argument. Overall, the Court did not err  in finding Nichols competent and his behavior during trial did not provide reason to believe that the finding was no  longer accurate. Nichols's motion for new trial is denied on this ground. D. Juror 17 Nichols next claims that he knew one of the jurors and that therefore the Court erred in allowing that individual to  serve on the jury. (Dkt. 279) at (1)(e). In particular, Nichols argues that Juror 17 worked as a security guard at a  placement home and school where Nichols resided as a minor. On account of their [*83]  shared history, Nichols  argues that Juror 17 may not have been able to be fair and impartial. Id. at 3. Nichols did not raise this issue during  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *79 Page 23 of 38 voir dire or at any time during trial, nor did he move to strike Juror 17 during the proceedings. In fact, the first time  the issue was brought to the Court's attention was nearly three months after trial in his Motion for Judgment of  Acquittal Notwithstanding the Verdict or, Alternatively, for New Trial. (Dkt. 279). Counsel for Nichols mentioned the  issue at a status hearing on June 28, 2018, stating that the presence of Juror 17 ""was a big distraction during the  course of the trial because he was abused in that home, and that employee was working there at the time."" (Dkt.  292). At the start of jury selection, the Court introduced Nichols and his stand-by counsel to the entire panel of  prospective jurors. The Court asked, ""Do any of you know any of the people that I just introduced to you? If so,  raise your hand."" Voir Dire Tr. at 9. There was no affirmative response from any prospective juror. Id. The Court  proceeded to question the prospective jurors individually; as described above, Nichols's behavior caused him to be  removed from the courtroom [*84]  in the early afternoon, while the Court was still questioning the first group of 14  prospective jurors. In Nichols's absence, stand-by counsel conducted voir dire and eventually a second group of 14  prospective jurors (Jurors 15 through 28) were placed in the jury box for individual questioning. As relevant to  Nichols's present objection, Juror 17 told the Court that he is and has long been a security guard who was at one  time was deputized to act as an officer by the Chicago Police Department when he was working for Catholic  Charities at an Englewood ""group home for wards of the state and things like that."" Id. at 152. After going through  additional questioning, Juror 17 confirmed that he could listen to the evidence, keep an open mind, and wait until  the end of trial to decide on guilt or innocence. Id. at 152-57. The Court concluded its questioning of this second  panel of 14 jurors and moved on to a third panel late in the day on March 12. Id. at 228. The second day of jury selection resumed with the questioning of the third panel of 14 prospective jurors and with  Nichols's participation. He engaged in questioning the prospective jurors including those who had been questioned  in his absence the previous day. Regarding [*85]  Juror 17, Nichols asked him where he worked and if he had ever  worked with children. Juror 17 replied that he had worked with children at ""Solace Place on the south side,  Englewood, 63rd and Sangamon."" Id. at 332. Nichols asked, ""The school? The group home?"" Juror 17 replied,  ""Yeah."" Id. Nichols then asked if Juror 17 would ""be able to give [him] a fair trial,"" to which Juror 17 replied, ""Yeah.""  Id. Nichols did not have any additional questions for Juror 17, who was excused from the sidebar after this  exchange. After Nichols finished his questioning, the Court explained: So then you have had an opportunity to be here present for the first 12 to ask questions of the second—I'm  sorry, the first 14, to ask questions of the second 14, and the third 14. And we have enough, if you take your  ten strikes and their six, to get our jury, but then we have to come back and ask more questions for alternates,  okay? Id. at 337. The Court again explained that Nichols had ten strikes to use to eliminate ten people he did not want  from those under consideration. Id. at 338. The parties applied their strikes and returned them to the Court. The  Court noted that Nichols had only used nine of his ten allotted strikes; he opted not to use [*86]  his final strike. Id.  at 340-41. As a result of this process, Juror 17 was not stricken by either party and he was selected as the seventh  sitting juror on a panel of 12. Three alternates also were selected. The government first correctly argues that by failing to alert the Court during trial that he may have known Juror 17  or Juror 17's possible bias, Nichols waived this claim. ""Waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right""  and precludes judicial review by extinguishing the error. United States v. Butler, 777 F.3d 382, 387 (7th Cir. 2015)  (citing United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1993)). Forfeiture, on the  other hand, ""is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right . . . by accident or neglect."" Id. (citing Olano, 507  U.S. at 733); see also United States v. Pappas, 409 F.3d 828, 829 (7th Cir. 2005) (""Waiver and forfeiture are  related doctrines; waiver occurs when a defendant intentionally relinquishes or abandons a known right, whereas  forfeiture occurs when a defendant fails to timely assert his rights."") (quotations and citations omitted). ""A forfeiture  is basically an oversight; a waiver is a deliberate decision not to present a ground for relief that might be available in  the law."" United States v. Cook, 406 F.3d 485, 487 (7th Cir. 2005) (citations omitted). 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *83 Page 24 of 38 Nichols was present on the first day of jury selection until the early afternoon and on the second day. For the portion  of jury selection during [*87]  which Nichols was not present in the courtroom, he had a closed-circuit feed of the  selection proceedings available to him. Although he was not physically present in the room when Juror 17 was  questioned initially by the Court, Nichols was given the opportunity to question Juror 17 at sidebar the next day, and  when he did, Juror 17 disclosed that he had been a security guard at Solace Place in Englewood. Nichols appeared  to recognize the location, asking if the juror was referring to the school or group home. Even after the juror  confirmed the reference, Nichols simply asked if the juror would be able to give him a fair trial. He did not raise the  issue of his own placement at Solace Place or his potential recognition of Juror 17. Not only that, he chose not to  use any of his ten preemptory strikes on Juror 17. In addition to these interactions and opportunities during the  selection process, in spite of being given a primer by the Court on how he could use his strikes and in spite of  discussing his strikes with standby counsel. Nichols heard the juror's name repeatedly and he had the opportunity  the eleven trial days to recognize the juror. At some point, Nichols claims that he recognized [*88]  the juror,  because he has since represented that the juror's presence was distracting. Yet, it is undisputed that neither he nor  his stand-by counsel raised any issue about this juror during trial. Nor has Nichols even attempted to offer an  explanation for not raising his issues with Juror 17 during jury selection or trial. Nothing in the record reflects that  Nichols was housed in Solace House during the time that Jury 17 worked there and nothing in the record shows  any link between Nichols and Juror 17. On these facts, it is difficult to comprehend how Nichols's failure to timely  raise the issue could have been due to accident or neglect. Instead, Nichols appears to have decided not to raise  the issue during trial for whatever reason. See United States v. Gootee, 34 F.3d 475, 479 (7th Cir. 1994) (claim of  possible juror misconduct on account of foreman's possession of a legal publication was waived when it was not  brought to the court's attention until after the jury was dismissed and defendant sentenced); see, e.g., United States  v. Cephus, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13098, 2015 WL 470450, at *11 (N.D. Ind. Feb. 4, 2015) (""By not bringing his  alleged knowledge of this possible juror bias to the attention of this Court before the verdict, the Court believes  Cephus has waived his right to a new trial.""). Even if not waived, Nichols's claim fails. [*89]  The requirement of an impartial jury is met when ""the prospective  juror has given final, unequivocal assurances, deemed credible by the judge, that for purposes of deciding the case,  [he] can set aside any opinion [he] might hold, relinquish [his] prior beliefs, or lay aside [his] biases or [his]  prejudicial personal experiences."" United States v. Taylor, 777 F.3d 434, 441 (7th Cir. 2015) (quoting United States  v. Allen, 605 F.3d 461, 464-65 (7th Cir. 2010)). These conditions are satisfied here. After being questioned on this  twice, Juror 17 gave unequivocal assurances — even directly to the face of the defendant upon questioning--that he  could be fair on both occasions. Nichols relies on United States v. Arocho, 305 F.3d 627 (7th Cir. 2002), but that case does not change the result. At  issue there was whether a juror honestly responded to questions during voir dire. ""To obtain a new trial on this  basis, a party must demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and that had  the juror provided the correct response, that response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.""  Id. at 633 (citations omitted). Nichols fails to establish the first prong of this test. That is, to the extent that Nichols  asserts that Juror 17 dishonestly responded to questioning—namely, the question of whether he knew Nichols— Nichols [*90]  has failed to demonstrate that Juror 17's lack of affirmative response to that question was a  falsehood. All that Nichols has put forward on this claim is his own assertion that he ""recalls this juror when he was  at that home."" (Dkt. 279) at 3. Although this establishes that Nichols and Juror 17 may have been in the same place  at the same time, it does not provide any details that would support an inference that the two knew each other such  that Juror 17's nonresponse to the Court's question was a lie. Further, like defense counsel in Arocho, Nichols had  the opportunity to ask Juror 17 further questions about his time working security for Solace Place during voir dire,  but he chose not to. He cannot now ""sandbag"" the government by claiming Juror 17 failed to answer voir dire  questions truthfully. Id. at 635. Accordingly, Nichols is not entitled to a new trial based on any issues with Juror 17. E. The Government Did Not Knowingly Introduce False Testimony Nichols also argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the government committed outrageous conduct by  knowingly eliciting false testimony from Jameela and Michelle. See (Dkt. 279) at (2)(A)—(C). Of course, the  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *86 Page 25 of 38 government's use of false [*91]  testimony to obtain a conviction is a violation of due process. McGeshick v. Fiedler,  3 F.3d 1083, 1087 (7th Cir. 1993) (citing Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 79 S. Ct. 1173, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1217 (1959)).  But that did not happen here. To receive a new trial based on the government's use of allegedly perjured testimony,  a defendant must show that ""(1) the prosecution's case included perjured testimony; (2) the prosecution knew, or  should have known, of the perjury; and (3) there is a likelihood that the false testimony affected the judgment of the  jury."" Simental v. Matrisciano, 363 F.3d 607, 615 (7th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). Mere inconsistencies in  government witnesses' testimony, however, do not establish the government's knowing use of false testimony.  United States v. Saadeh, 61 F.3d 510, 523 (7th Cir. 1995) (citing United States v. Verser, 916 F.2d 1268, 1271 (7th  Cir. 1990)). Rather, ""the alleged perjured testimony must bear a direct relationship to the defendant's guilt or  innocence"" or ""it must relate to a material fact as opposed to some collateral issue."" United States v. Adcox, 19  F.3d 290, 295-96 (7th Cir. 1994). Finally, when a defendant alleges that the prosecution used perjured testimony,  the Court must inquire into whether the defendant had adequate opportunity to expose the alleged perjury on cross- examination. Saadeh, 61 F.3d at 523. 1. Jameela's Testimony As relevant to Nichols's motion for a new trial, Jameela testified at trial that she had seen Nichols with a gun  ""[e]very time we moved to a different hotel."" Tr. at 391. She also authenticated [*92]  a handful of still photographs  from a music video for Nichols's rap group, the Hit Squad, in which she testified that Fears was holding Nichols's  gun. Id. at 396-98. Nichols did not object to the admission of either the video or the stills. Jameela testified that she  danced in the video. Id. at 396. Regarding one of the stills, Government Exhibit 201-F, Jameela testified: Q. . . . Ms. Jameela, on the left-hand side, whose body is in this video? A. Mines. Q. And on—there's a man on the right-hand side of the video. Who is that man? A. That's Buck holding the gun. Q. The same gun? A. Yes. Id. at 398. An excerpt of the video was played in open court, and in one shot, Jameela again testified that Nichols  was holding the gun: Q. Ms. Jameela, at the end there, is Buck pointing a gun at you? A. At my booty. Q. And that's a real gun, right? A. Yes. Id. at 399. On cross examination, Nichols confirmed Jameela's testimony on direct examination: ""Q. And you 100  percent correct that I had a gun in my hand in that video? A. Yes."" Id. at 451. He then played the rap video in its  entirety and asked Jameela about the gun again, to which she replied: ""As I look in the video, [another Hit Squad  member known as] County had the gun. . . . As I look at it in front of [*93]  me and look at it closely, it's not your  arm."" Id. at 452. Based on this discrepancy, Nichols argues that the government purposefully and strategically introduced Exhibit  201-F and only played a portion of the video (Government Exhibit 201) to mislead the jury into believing that Nichols  was holding the gun because viewing the video in its entirety ""clearly showed"" that Nichols did not hold a gun in the  video. (Dkt. 279) at 4. On the other hand, the government contends that Jameela's testimony simply was mistaken  and not perjurious. (Dkt. 312) at 65-66. As the Court acknowledged during trial, the video at issue is a rap video  with lots of movement and the camera cutting between various scenes and is ""confusing"" and contains ""a lot of  movement and a lot of music and a lot of hands and faces and derrieres being flashed all over the place"" (Tr. at  1467, 1470), and thus, even though Nichols was not holding the gun at the point in the video where Jameela first  testified that he was or in Exhibit 201-F, Nichols has failed to show that the government knew or should have known  that Jameela's testimony on this point was false as opposed to mistaken. More importantly, Nichols effectively cross  examined [*94]  Jameela to get her to say that she was mistaken when viewing the video. The jurors had an  opportunity to view the cross examination and determine from Jameela's response whether she intentionally  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *90 Page 26 of 38 misrepresented the video intentionally or whether she was enlightened that she made a mistake during the cross  examination. The jurors clearly credited her testimony that she was mistaken. Even if he had been able to show that Jameela intentionally lied about the videao,, Nichols would not be entitled to  a new trial on this ground because he also failed to show a likelihood that the false testimony affected the judgment  of the jury for at least two reasons. First and most significantly, Nichols very effectively corrected the false or  mistaken testimony on cross examination. That is, he got Jameela to admit directly that it was not his hand holding  the gun. See Tr. at 1467 (noting that Nichols ""crossed her and you broke the statement on direct, and you  effectively crossed her and got her to say upon review it wasn't your hand.""); Saadeh, 61 F.3d at 523-24 (denying  motion for new trial; defendant took advantage of ample opportunity to cross examine witness, discredit him, and  expose any alleged perjury). Second, Nichols [*95]  does not attempt to argue, let alone set forth evidence, that Jameela's testimony actually  prejudiced him during trial. To be sure, this testimony about Nichols holding the gun in the video was only one piece  of evidence among many about Nichols's possession of a gun from 2012 to 2014. Jameela herself offered other  testimony on this point, testifying that Nichols kept a gun with him at the hotels for protection and that he threatened  to blow people away with it. In addition, many other witnesses testified about Nichols's possession of a gun or guns,  including Nichols himself, and both Nichols and Wright testified about an incident where Nichols shot at Candace— in the back and in the face—with a BB gun. Further, the evidence concerning the gun was only one aspect of  Nichols's use of force, threats of force, or coercion. As already detailed above, the government introduced more  than sufficient evidence on this element. Finally, following Jameela's testimony, the Court instructed the jury that it  could consider the gun ""when weighing whether or not the defendant used force, threats of force, or coercion to  cause a victim to engage in a commercial sex act, but you should not consider it [*96]  for any other purpose. Keep  in mind that the defendant here is on trial for sex trafficking and not for a gun offense. And those gun offenses are  not charged."" Tr. at 460. Because of the additional overwhelming evidence and the Court's corrective instruction,  the presence of the gun in Nichols's personal space at the point where it was displayed in the video and still frame  (Exhibit 201-F) was not overly prejudicial. For all of these reasons, Nichols has not shown that Jameela's  testimony about the video prejudiced him by affecting the judgment of the jury, that is, that it bore a direct  relationship to his guilt or innocence. See Van Eyl, 468 F.3d at 436; see also Kuzniar, 881 F.2d at 470. Jameela's  testimony therefore does not constitute grounds for a new trial. 2. Michelle's Testimony i. April 2014 Injuries At trial, the government questioned Michelle about the April 2014 beating that resulted in a hospital stay and  stiches. Nichols takes issue with certain of Michelle's details about the incident: that ""[Nichols] threw me out [of the  car] at the entrance at Ingalls [Hospital]. And the paramedics had to come out and get me because I was  unconscious."" Tr. at 585. Michelle also testified that she still has ""visible injuries from [*97]  that incident,"" including  ""stitch marks"" in her head, ""[m]y bone is sticking out of my hand. And I have a bone sticking out of my back."" Id. at  640-41. In connection with this testimony, Nichols points to a record of Michelle's visit from Ingalls Hospital, which  the government produced in discovery and admitted at trial through a hospital records custodian, which stated that  she was ""ambulatory,"" her gait was steady, and she did not sustain any fractures. See Gov't Ex. 305 (INGALL_001- 000006-42); Tr. at 678-70. Nichols argues that in light of Exhibit 305, Michelle lied about ""what took place,"" and that  the government elicited this false testimony from Michelle ""knowing full well that no medical record supported any of  that testimony."" (Dkt. 279) at 4; see also Tr. at 1471 (""Her testimony is so grossly disproportionate to the medical  records that it couldn't possibly be anything other than perjurious.""). To be sure, Nichols does not deny that he hit  Michelle, he threw a flip phone at her head (Tr. at 1610), and she required medical attention. Instead Nichols    2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *94 Page 27 of 38 argues that Michelle's testimony about how she got into the hospital and her lasting injuries was demonstrably false  and therefore merits a [*98]  new trial. Many of the details to which Michelle testified are corroborated by the medical records. For example, she testified  that the flip phone ""bust [her] head open,"" necessitating three stitches and that she ended up with black eyes and  bruises from her neck to her feet. Id. at 587, 589-90. The medical records similarly reflected that she had been  distressed from pain, she presented with a three-centimeter laceration on the left side of her forehead requiring  three sutures, and she had ""ecchymosis"" noted on her neck, left hand, left eye, back, and knees. See Gov't Ex.  305. She reported sustaining the injuries from being ""kicked, choked, and punched by her xboyfriend."" Id. Regarding the two areas of disputed testimony, compared to the medical records, Michelle's testimony was at worst  mildly inconsistent. Saadeh, 61 F.3d at 523. Michelle described the trauma she endured in this incident—a long  beating followed by head trauma. She testified as to her understanding of her injuries and what happened when the  beating ended. It may have been that Michelle thought she passed out when she got to the hospital. Her imperfect  or possibly exaggerated recollection as to how she got inside the hospital can hardly be deemed perjurious [*99]   based on her perspective at the time of the event. See Tr. at 679 (""Well, I did have a phone chucked at my head,  so, you know, those memories of that day—""). As for her testimony that bones are still sticking out of her hand and  back, Nichols similarly fails to provide any evidence that Michelle committed perjury. Although he points to the  medical records that say that Michelle did not sustain any fractures (although the records note abrasions on her  back and left hand, see Gov't Ex. 305 at INGALL_001-000026), the record is clear that Michelle is not a medical  professional nor does she have any medical knowledge. Michelle testified that she only went to school through the  eleventh grade. Tr. at 533. Therefore, her testimony that she currently has bones out of place again is her personal  interpretation of her injuries. To the extent Michelle's interpretation differs from the medical records, such testimony  does not rise to the level of perjury but is a mere inconsistency. Even assuming that Michelle perjured herself on these points and that the government knew of such perjury,  Nichols has not proven that there is a likelihood that the false testimony affected the judgment of the jury. [*100]   This is particularly true considering the big picture of this violent event. The core facts of this episode are that  Nichols caught Michelle texting Fears and he beat her so badly that she needed medical attention. Whether she  walked into the hospital or not and whether she sustained lesser injuries (not fractures) from being ""kicked, choked,  and punched"" do not undermine the significance of Michelle's testimony. What even Nichols corroborated was that  she was injured and left at the hospital for treatment. That is, these two aspects of the event are not related to  Nichols's guilt or innocence. Even if Michelle had testified with perfect consistency to the records, the evidence at  trial nonetheless established that Nichols badly beat Michelle in April 2014 for texting Fears. As a final point, Nichols had the medical records at issue in his possession to cross examine Michelle. See Saadeh,  61 F.3d at 523 (the court must consider ""whether the defendant had adequate opportunity to expose the alleged  perjury on cross-examination""); see also Tr. at 1057-58 (noting that Nichols had the records at the time of cross and  could have used them for their impeachment value at that time). For whatever reason, despite [*101]  his ample  opportunity, he did not use the records to explore these now-challenged aspects of her testimony. For example, he  never questioned her about her testimony about the lasting injuries to her hand and back. He did, however,  question her about these aspects using a portion of her grand jury testimony, wherein she stated that she had to  crawl into the hospital. Tr. at 678-82. Eventually Nichols asked ""[s]o if that's what happened, then the hospital  records should reflect that then, right?,"" to which Michelle replied, ""Yeah."" Id. at 682. Further, with the hospital  witness, he highlighted the phrases ""Patient arrives ambulatory,"" ""Gait steady,"" and ""No fractures,"" during his  questioning. Id. at 768-70. Even though he decided not to use the records during his cross of Michelle, Nichols still  brought out the inconsistencies in her recollection about arriving at the hospital. Overall, Michelle's testimony did  not result in any unfairness to Nichols and it is not grounds for a new trial. ii. Dropping off Minor A at School Nichols also takes issue with Michelle's testimony that he knew Minor A's age because he once drove her to  ""middle school."" (Dkt. 279) at 4-5. He points to Minor A's testimony that she was [*102]  not in school when she  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *97 Page 28 of 38 worked for Nichols and that he therefore never drove her to any school. Tr. at 1155. However, Nichols again fails to  prove that this testimony entitles him to a new trial. Most significantly, the school testimony at issue was elicited by  Nichols on cross examination as impeachment. It was not included in the prosecution's case. In fact, Michelle  testified on direct examination that she did not know Minor A's age until after the case started, although she had  observed Minor A acting childish. Id. at 639-40. Crossing her on when she first learned Minor A's age, Nichols used  Michelle's grand jury testimony that Nichols had mentioned to Michelle that he was taking Minor A and another girl  to school, which made Michelle understand that Minor A and the other girl were in fact minors. Id. at 696. Michelle  agreed with her grand jury testimony and also her trial testimony. Accordingly, Nichols fails to meet the first or  second elements of the false-testimony test. See Simental, 363 F.3d at 615 (a defendant must show ""(1) the  prosecution's case included perjured testimony; (2) the prosecution knew, or should have known, of the perjury; and  (3) there is a likelihood that the false testimony affected the judgment of the [*103]  jury.""). Continuing with this  analysis, Nichols also cannot meet the third element. All of the testimony on this point regarded Minor A's age at the  time she worked prostituting herself for Nichols. Ultimately, the jury did not find that Nichols knew or recklessly  disregarded that Minor A was a minor. Instead, he was convicted on Count 4 because the jury found that he used  force, threats of force, or coercion to compel Minor A to engage in commercial sex acts. Dkt. 267 (verdict form).  Thus, Michelle's testimony about Nichols's knowledge of Minor A's age cannot be said to have affected the jury in a  manner that entitles Nichols to a new trial. Finally, Nichols had ample opportunity to cross examine Michelle about  her testimony concerning Minor A's age, and he did so with the disputed school testimony. In support of his argument Nichols cites Miller v. Pate, 386 U.S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 785, 17 L. Ed. 2d 690 (1967) for the  proposition that ""physical evidence that creates a false impression of fact"" violates due process. But Nichols does  not point to any physical evidence offered by the government that created a false impression of material fact (all of  the evidence that he specifically takes issue with was testimonial), and regardless, this case is nothing [*104]  like  Miller, where the prosecution offered as evidence a pair of ""blood-stained"" shorts and an expert witness who  testified that the blood type on the shorts was the same as that of the victim, knowing full well that the shorts were  stained with paint instead. Unlike Miller, the government did not knowingly present false evidence and Nichols had  a full opportunity to cross examine the testifying witnesses regarding questionable testimony. F. The Court Did Not Err in Limiting Nichols's Cross Examination Next, Nichols argues that the Court erred by limiting cross examination when the Court (1) excluded a Facebook  post dated March 14, 2018 containing a picture of Michelle holding a pistol, (2) prevented Nichols from exploring the  extent of the benefits Michelle received from the Government for her testimony, (3) ""sustain[ed] the government's  objection to [Nichols's] cross examination on the law enforcement agents instructing cooperating witnesses to 'lie'  about matters known to be false."" (Dkt. 279) at (3), (4), (5). The Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause guarantees criminal defendants the right to confront witnesses at  trial. United States v. Linzy, 604 F.3d 319, 323 (7th Cir. 2010). It ""reflects the belief that adversarial proceedings are  essential to the truth-seeking function."" [*105]  United States v. Khan, 508 F.3d 413, 418 (7th Cir. 2007). That being  said, ""there is no guarantee of cross-examination to whatever extent the defense might wish."" United States v.  Recendiz, 557 F.3d 511, 530 (7th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted); see also United  States v. Beavers, 756 F.3d 1044, 1052 (7th Cir. 2014) (although ""the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants  a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense . . . [it] does not require the admission of irrelevant  evidence (or other types of evidence whose relevance is outweighed by other important considerations)"") (internal  citations omitted). Put differently, the court must allow effective cross examination, but effective cross examination  is not akin to unlimited cross examination. Linzy, 604 F.3d at 323. The court has ""wide latitude . . . to impose  reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about . . . harassment, prejudice, confusion of the  issues, the witness' safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant."" Delaware v. Van Arsdall,  475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986). Considering first the social media photograph of Michelle holding a gun, Nichols argues that because she testified  to his possession of guns, the picture ""went directly to the truth and veracity on this point."" (Dkt. 279) at 6. But he  does not even attempt to explain how the photograph of Michelle holding a gun in March 2018 [*106]  impacts her  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *102 Page 29 of 38 testimony that Nichols possessed a gun or guns during the 2012 to 2014 time period and the Court cannot draw this  link without more. Nichols's second, more general argument is that the photograph goes to Michelle's overall  credibility and that the exclusion of the photo denied him the right to confront Michelle. Id. At trial, Nichols sought to  have the photo admitted ""[t]o show that she is, in fact, not a law-abiding citizen; that despite her claims that it was  Mr. Nichols who got her into this life and who kept her in this life, that, in fact, this is more her character, and that  she's acting autonomously without his influences years after their separation."" Tr. at 754. The Court did not permit  Nichols to introduce the photograph during his cross examination of Michelle. This exclusion did not violate Nichols's constitutional right to cross examine Michelle. Federal Rule of Evidence  608(b) provides that ""[e]xcept for a criminal conviction under Rule 609, extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove  specific instances of a witness's conduct in order to attack or support the witness's character for truthfulness. But  the court may, on cross-examination, allow them to be inquired into if they are probative of the [*107]  character for  truthfulness or untruthfulness of"" the witness. Here, Nichols was given significant leeway with which to question  Michelle's character for truthfulness on cross examination, questioning her at length after her direct testimony and  then having the opportunity to cross examine her once more using a February 9, 2016 call between Michelle and  Nichols while he was in custody at the MCC. On both occasions, Nichols had ample opportunity to impeach  Michelle and he effectively did so by raising her past drug use, her flawed memory, lies that she told him in jail calls,  and her other instances of unlawful behavior. On that last point, Michelle had already testified on direct that she had  been convicted of possession of a controlled substance (a felony). Tr. at 536. She also testified to having sex for  money during the relevant time frame, stealing guns, selling guns, doing drugs, stealing drugs, and selling drugs  during that time. Although she later testified that she was trying to get her life together, she also clearly testified on  cross examination that it was ""not at all"" fair to say that she is a law-abiding citizen now. Id. at 753. Once a trial court permits a defendant to expose a [*108]  witness's motivation, it is of peripheral concern to the  Sixth Amendment how much opportunity defense counsel gets to hammer that point home to the jury."" Recendiz,  557 F.3d at 530 (citing United States v. Nelson, 39 F.3d 705, 708 (7th Cir. 1994)). Accordingly, the Court did not err  in excluding the photograph because Michelle already had testified that she was not law abiding and Nichols  already had successfully impeached her on this and other grounds. See id. at 530 (it would offend the Sixth  Amendment to deny a defendant the ability to establish that the witness had a motive to lie, but once that motivation  has been established, the defendant has no constitutional right to pile on); Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 679 (after the  motive has been established, a judge has a wide latitude to impose reasonable limits on cross-examination); United  States v. Williams, 892 F.3d 242, 249 (7th Cir. 2018) (same). In light of this evidence and impeachment, the extrinsic evidence of Michelle exhibiting unlawful behavior four years  after the events charged in the Superseding Indictment had minimal overall relevance to Michelle's character for  truthfulness (if any). Whatever marginal relevance the picture had was outweighed by concerns of prejudice,  misleading the jury, and the cumulative effect of the photograph. See Fed. R. Evid. 403; United States v. Ozuna,  561 F.3d 728, 738 (7th Cir. 2009) (""a district court may exclude collateral or irrelevant evidence where its tendency  to mislead [*109]  and confuse the jury substantially outweighs its probative value""); see also Carson, 870 F.3d at  597 (""district court judge can decide that the defendant has had ample opportunity to demonstrate motivation and  that additional cross-examination is either not relevant, too prejudicial, would confuse the jury, is repetitive, or any of  the other many reasons a district court might limit the scope of cross examination""). Looking next at the extent to which Michelle was questioned about the benefits she received in exchange for her  testimony, although Nichols mentions ""numerous instances"" in which the Court sustained the government's  objections on this subject matter, he does not point to any with specificity or even argue why they were improper.  See (Dkt. 279) at 6. Nichols's undeveloped and unsupported argument therefore is waived. Holm, 326 F.3d at 877;  McLee, 436 F.3d at 760. Further, the Court's review of the trial transcript reveals no error in its rulings regarding  Nichols's cross of Michelle on this topic. Michelle testified on direct examination that she received lodging and  money for her daily expenses during the trial and had received food, shelter, and help with her everyday needs from  some FBI agents over the past few years. Tr. at 536. On [*110]  cross, Nichols explored this testimony, asking for  further specifics as to the benefits she received, although he limited his questioning to asking how much money she  received and whether she had been coached in her testimony. Id. at 645. No objections were lodged. When  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *106 Page 30 of 38 Michelle was recalled a few days later to testify as to the February 2016 jail call, the government moved to preclude  any questioning on ""previously explored areas of bias, such as her hotel stay and her per diem payments that she  continues to attain while staying, waiting for the trial to conclude."" Id. at 1051-52. Neither Nichols nor his stand-by  counsel opposed the oral motion, and they instead indicated that they wished to explore statements Michelle made  in the call—that she had been bribed by the government to testify, that she did not want to cooperate with the  investigation, and that she was never forced into prostitution by Nichols. Id. at 1052-53. On these arguments, the  Court appropriately limited her testimony to the scope of the call noting that she already had ""testified thoroughly.""  Id. at 1056-57. On the stand, the call was played and Michelle confirmed to Nichols that it was her voice on the call. The  government then asked: Q. Michelle, did the FBI ever [*111]  coerce you? A. No. Q. Did anyone from the U.S. Attorney's Office or federal government ever coerce you during the course of this  investigation or case? A. No. Q. Did anyone from the FBI or the U.S. Attorney's Office bribe you? A. No. Id. at 1064-65. The government asked additional questions about statements Michelle made in the call and her  motivations for such statements, which included Michelle's testimony that she had received threatening calls from  Stallion and Kaila regarding her participation in Nichols's prosecution. Nichols asked questions on further recross,  and his questioning elicited around 13 objections from the government, some of which were sustained. However,  the objectionable questions mostly pertained to how or why Michelle would feel threatened by Stallion, Kaila, or  Nichols or they involved improper commentary to the jury between questions. See id. at 1068-77 (for example,  sustaining objections to questions as to why Stallion and Kaila would threaten Michelle because they were  speculative, sustaining an objection to a question as to whether Nichols knows anyone in New York as lacking  foundation, sustaining an objection to a question as to how someone could call and threaten Michelle if he or  she [*112]  did not have her phone number as calling for speculation, sustaining an objection to Nichols's  comments from the lectern). Notably, Nichols asked a few questions going to Michelle's truthfulness that the Court  allowed over the government's objections. See id. at 1069 (""So is it true that when you lie to someone, you have to  keep lying to cover up the first lie?""), 1077 (""Are you a liar?""). During his recross, Nichols did not ask questions that  probed into Michelle's receipt of any benefits from the government, and in any event, the Court finds no basis to  conclude that any of its rulings on the government's objections to Nichols's questioning were erroneous. Finally, Nichols complains that he was not permitted to cross examine witnesses about law enforcement's  instructions that they lie about matters known to be false and that the Court improperly barred him from using the  term ""lie"" in his cross examination of the government's witnesses. (Dkt. 279) at 6. Nichols does not specify to which  witnesses he believes this argument applies, nor does he point to any particular testimony or objections that fall  under this category. Again, not only is this argument woefully undeveloped and therefore waived, [*113]  it is  completely without merit. As the government points out in its response brief, Nichols was permitted to cross  examine numerous witnesses about their knowledge of what it means to testify under oath and whether they were  lying during their testimony or had lied to the grand jury. See (Dkt. 312) at 77-79; see also, e.g., Tr. at 680 (asking  Michelle, ""so lying isn't a big deal to you?""), 730 (asking Michelle, ""You also testified yesterday about you basically  were lying and manipulating me to have me come get you because you wanted to be bond out of jail. Am I  correct?""), 757 (asking Michelle if she was ""lying and manipulating"" the jury), 833 (asking Betty Jo, ""So you just lied  to the jury?""), 954 (asking Ciara, ""Q. So are you lying to these people or to the grand jury? A. I'm not lying to no  one.""), 1069 (asking Michelle, ""Q. Is it true that when you lie to someone, you have to keep lying to cover up the  first lie? A. To you, yeah. I'm not lying to the jury. I lied to you. It's a whole different thing. That was for my safety to  make you think that I wasn't telling.""), 1357 (asking Wright, ""Do you know that if you lie on that stand, you can go to  jail?""). Of course, the Court precluded [*114]  Nichols from making comments to the jury or accusations during  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *110 Page 31 of 38 witness testimony that the witnesses were lying (see, e.g., Tr. at 1357 (saying to Wright, ""Well, you need to stop  lying."")), but that was more than appropriate. Beyond the appropriateness of the Court's rulings on Nichols's cross examination of government witnesses, Nichols  once again fails to identify or evince that any limitation on his cross examination actually prejudiced him during trial.  See (Dkt. 279) at 5-6. Without having made such a showing, he is not entitled to a new trial. Accordingly, the Court  acted within its discretion to limit Nichols's cross examination in the ways discussed above and Nichols's motion for  new trial is denied on this basis. G. Admission of Other Bad Acts of Fears Nichols argues that the Court erred by allowing testimony about the crimes, wrongs, or bad acts of Fears, which he  claims prejudiced him. See (Dkt. 279) at (10). However, he did not develop this argument by identifying anything he  believes to have been erroneously admitted or even explaining why exactly any evidence was entered in error, and  thus this argument too is waived. Holm, 326 F.3d at 877; McLee, 436 F.3d at 760. Regardless, Nichols was charged in Count 1 with [*115]  conspiring with Fears and others to engage in sex  trafficking. The government presented evidence about specific facts and incidents involving Fears that directly  related to the charged sex trafficking conspiracy as well as the sex trafficking of the victims during the time frame  charged in the Superseding Indictment. In other words, the government did not seek to admit propensity evidence  about Fears and as such, Rule 404(b) is not applicable. See Fed. R. Evid. 404(b); see United States v. Ferrell, 816  F.3d 433, 443 (7th Cir. 2015) (""Rule 404(b) does not apply to direct evidence of the crime charged"") (citing United  States v. Adams, 628 F.3d 407, 414 (7th Cir. 2010), United States v. Alviar, 573 F.3d 526, 538 (7th Cir. 2009)).  Where ""evidence is embraced by the conspiracy in the indictment, the court need not resort to Rule 404(b)  analysis."" Alviar, 573 F.3d at 538; see also United States v. Watts, 535 F.3d 650, 659-60 (7th Cir. 2008) (rejecting  defendant's Rule 404(b) challenge to evidence of defendant's acts in furtherance of conspiracy). To the contrary,  the evidence at issue pertained to Nichols's and Fears's actual trafficking business and they went directly to explain  how it operated and how other individuals interacted within it. See (Dkt. 153). ""This is not, therefore, another bad  act, but rather part and parcel of the crime at issue."" Carson, 870 F.3d at 600. Further, more than seven months prior to trial, the government filed a Santiago proffer in support of its motion to  introduce the hearsay statements of co-conspirators [*116]  made in furtherance of a conspiracy pursuant to  Federal Rule of Evidence Rule 801(d)(2)(E). See (Dkt. 154); United States v. Santiago, 582 F.2d 1128, 1131 (7th  Cir. 1978) (trial court may conditionally admit coconspirator statements before the government has independently  established the conspiracy). The Court approved the Santiago proffer without objection. See (Dkt. 251). Further, as  discussed above, the government made an adequate showing that a conspiracy existed between Nichols and his  co-conspirators and thus under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), statements by his co-conspirators in furtherance of the  conspiracy are admissible non-hearsay. See United States v. Pust, 798 F.3d 597, 602 (7th Cir. 2015). During the proceedings, Nichols did not raise any Rule 404(b) objections and in fact, standby counsel stated that  ""having read the Santiago proffer, I don't believe that there is an area that's 404(b) at this point."" Tr. at 285. Instead,  Nichols objected to the admission of testimony about Fears on relevance grounds. Id. at 546-47. In overruling the  objection, the Court explained that the evidence about Fears and his girls ""is relevant to the indictment because you  are charged in a conspiracy. And the conspiracy, although he has pled to it, is still the charge against you. . . . It's  relevant to the elements of what's charged. And I've already admitted the co-conspirator proffer, there being [*117]        2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *114 Page 32 of 38 no objections."" Id. at 572-73. In total, the direct evidence of Fears's actions relating to sex trafficking during the  relevant time period was both admissible and relevant to the conspiracy at issue. Carson, 870 F.3d at 600. H. The Court Did Not Improperly Admit Physical or Hearsay Evidence Nichols next argues that the Court erred ""in several instances admitting certain hearsay evidence which evidence  did not fall into any of the cognizable exceptions to the hearsay rule"" and generally by admitting physical evidence.  See (Dkt. 279) at (11), (18). As with many of his other arguments, Nichols has waived these perfunctory assertions  by failing to develop them at all. Courts are not obligated ""to research and construct the legal arguments open to  parties, especially when they are represented by counsel."" Holm, 326 F.3d at 877 (quotations and citations  omitted). To be fair, Nichols lodged a handful of hearsay objections during trial, but the Court has not found reason to disturb  its rulings on those issues. For example, the Court properly overruled Nichols's hearsay objection to testimony from  police officer that he was informed that Minor A was 13 years old because such testimony was not offered to prove  Minor A's age, but rather to show the effect [*118]  on the listener or discuss the course of the investigation. See Tr.  at 489; United States v. Shaw, 824 F.3d 624, 630 (7th Cir. 2016). Further, Nichols suffered no prejudice from this  ruling, as the jury did not find that he knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that Minor A was a minor. Similarly,  the Court properly overruled Nichols's objection to Michelle's testimony about threats she received from Stallion in  connection with her participation in the case for the same reason—the effect the threats had on Michelle and how  she reacted to them. Tr. at 1067. As another example, the Court correctly overruled Nichols's hearsay objection to  Minor A's description of what Candace said about how Nichols treated her because such statements were included  in the unobjected-to Santiago proffer and were not hearsay as statements of Nichols's employee or agent on a  matter within the scope of that relationship while it existed or coconspirator. Tr. at 1100; Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D),  (E). Regarding the physical evidence introduced at trial, which included photographs, text messages, emails, social  media records, hospital records, hotel records, and Backpage advertisements, Nichols failed to object to this  evidence both (1) before trial either by moving in limine for its exclusion [*119]  or by responding to the  government's motions in limine for admission of certain records, or (2) at trial before the Court admitted the  evidence. Nichols had numerous opportunities to object to the trial evidence, but he did not, and even in his motion  for a new trial he fails to properly identify any objectionable exhibits. Further, on both points, Nichols fails to assert  any argument to explain how he believes the contested evidence prejudiced him. For all of these reasons, Nichols's  motion for a new trial is denied on these grounds. I. Government's Closing Argument Nichols argues that he is entitled to a new trial based on various things that happened during closing arguments:  the Court erred in overruling his objections to the government's closing where the prosecutors ""made specific  argumentative and prejudicial comments in reference to the defendant, prejudicially misrepresented prospective  evidence and made substantial misrepresentations not supported by the evidence,"" see (Dkt. 279) at (7), id. at (20)  (identical argument); the government committed reversible error when it argued ""personal vouching and brought up  new facts, conclusions, and arguments in closing argument unrelated [*120]  to the defendant's closing argument,""  see id. at (8); the government's closing argument was unduly prejudicial and deprived him of a fair trial, see id. at  (12). Aside from simply noting that the government's closing included prejudicial comments or prejudicially  misrepresented evidence, Nichols critically does not even attempt to show how anything in the closing argument or  rebuttal prejudiced him. This alone is a sufficient basis on which to deny Nichols's motion for a new trial on his  closing-argument concerns. See Van Eyl, 468 F.3d at 436; see also Kuzniar, 881 F.2d at 470. In any event, the  Court will address Nichols's specific arguments to the extent that they are developed and ascertainable. In fact, only  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *117 Page 33 of 38 his argument that his objections to the government's closing were improperly overruled presents an argument that  contains enough identifying information to merit discussion. Nichols did not make any objections during the government's closing argument. See Tr. at 1715-66. Thereafter,  during the government's rebuttal argument, Nichols made five objections. The first instance was as follows: MS. STREIKER: . . . The defendant kept saying that the women weren't forced, that they had choices, so he  didn't commit sex trafficking. [*121]  And he kept saying that he hit women for personal reasons, not business,  so he didn't commit sex trafficking. THE DEFENDANT: Didn't -- objection. THE COURT: Overruled. THE DEFENDANT: I didn't say that. Tr. at 1820. The Court's ruling was correct. Because Nichols argued in closing that he never forced anyone to do  anything, he hit the women and girls but that was strictly personal and had nothing to do with business (see Tr. at  1775, 1780, 1799, 1800, 1817 (""Facts. I hit people. That's a fact. But never over business.""), 1609 (arguing that he  was not on trial for domestic violence)), the prosecutor's rebuttal argument was a proper response. United States v.  Taylor, 728 F.2d 930, 936 (7th Cir. 1984) (""It is settled in this circuit that, in their summations to the jury,  prosecutors are entitled to respond to arguments articulated by defense counsel.""). The second objection was as follows: MS. STREIKER: . . . In fact, you don't need to find any physical violence at all. What you do need to do under  the law -- THE DEFENDANT: She can tell them that? Objection -- THE COURT: Overruled. MS. STREICKER: -- is to consider whether his actions overall, as a whole, all of the violence, all of the threats,  all of the coercion, whether all of that, as a whole, overall, [*122]  caused women to engage in commercial sex  acts. That's the law. . . . Tr. at 1820-21. Again, there was no error. The prosecutor gave a correct characterization of the jury instructions  and the law. The TVPA criminalizes sex trafficking where an individual acts ""in reckless disregard of the fact, that  means of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion described in subsection (e)(2), or any combination of such means  will be used to cause the person to engage in a commercial sex act."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Threats of force and  coercion, which are available to prove a violation of the TVPA, may not encompass physical violence.  Correspondingly, the Court properly instructed the jury that ""[c]oercion means: (1) threats of serious harm to or  physical restraint against any person; or (2) any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that  failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any person."" (Dkt. 263) at 42;  see 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(2). The Court further instructed: ""Serious harm means any harm, whether physical or non- physical, including psychological, financial, or reputational harm, that is sufficiently serious, under the  circumstances, to compel a reasonable person of the same background [*123]  and in the same circumstances to  perform or to continue performing commercial sexual activity in order to avoid incurring that harm."" (Dkt. 263) at 43  (emphasis added); see 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(5). Thus, the prosecutor's statement was an accurate recitation of the  law and Nichols's objection was properly overruled. As for the third objection: MS. STREICKER: . . . And to go back to these hotel records for a minute, the defendant said in his closing, he  talked about how the rooms weren't in his name. He didn't know what was going on in these rooms. The truth is  he had Brandon put the rooms in his name -- THE DEFENDANT: Objection. MS. STREICKER: -- to conceal -- THE DEFENDANT: Objection. She's lying. I never said that. There's no evidence to prove that. THE COURT: Overruled. THE DEFENDANT: I bet. 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *120 Page 34 of 38 MS. STREICKER: He had Brandon put the hotel records in Brandon's name to conceal his involvement. THE DEFENDANT: Never said that. Tr. at 1835. The Court's rejection of Nichols's objection was proper. The testimonial and documentary evidence  introduced at trial clearly demonstrated that hotel rooms were rented in Wright's name. The prosecutor's rebuttal  argument regarding Nichols's intent behind this—to conceal his involvement—was [*124]  proper both as to the  evidence and the reasonable inferences the jury could draw from the evidence. See, e.g., Tr. at 1239 (""Q. What  was your understanding of why the defendant had you put the room in your name? [WRIGHT:] To keep the heat off  of him because in some of these towns the police know him for being a pimp.""). Even though Nichols may not have  directly testified as to his intent, the prosecutor's argument was permissible and the Court did not err in overruling  the objection. Turning to the fourth objection: MS. STREICKER: . . . The defendant argued he didn't know [Minor A's] age or Coco's age or Ciara's age or  Little Baby's age when they were working for him. But you know he did. THE DEFENDANT: Objection. MS. STREICKER: You saw photos of them, for God's sake. THE DEFENDANT: Objection. I never said that. Why she steady saying stuff I never said? THE COURT: It's overruled. She's arguing from the evidence, not just what you said -- THE DEFENDANT: When I say something, she don't say -- all right. THE COURT: Go ahead. THE DEFENDANT: Biased. Tr. at 1837. Here again, the prosecutor's argument appropriately summarized the evidence and responding to  Nichols's closing argument that ""Maybe I just [*125]  wasn't the brightest person in the world or something and got  tricked, but it wasn't purposely. I didn't—I didn't know. I would never deal with minors. I just wouldn't do it."" Id. at  1797. The Court's ruling was not error. Finally, the fifth and last objection came about under the following circumstances: MS. STREICKER: . . . And, finally, I want to note, you have now seen defendant's conduct first-hand. You see  how he's treated this Court, how he's treated this process, how he's treated me, how aggressive he became  when a woman dared to question him. He said I was irritating, I was making him mad, and he was having a  hard time controlling his anger. THE DEFENDANT: Object. MS. STREICKER: He put me down -- THE COURT: Sustained -- overruled. Excuse me. THE DEFENDANT: It's not evidence. THE COURT: It is, actually. The demeanor of the witness on the stand when testifying can be taken into  account by the jury when judging credibility. I'll give you an instruction on it. THE DEFENDANT: I bet. Tr. at 1840-41. Although a defendant's nontestimonial courtroom behavior generally is not evidence subject to  comment, Gomez v. Ahitow, 29 F.3d 1128, 1136 (7th Cir. 1994), here Nichols took the stand and testified in his  defense. As the Court properly instructed the jury: [*126]  ""Part of your job as jurors is to decide how believable  each witness was, and how much weight to give each witness' testimony, including that of the defendant. You may  accept all of what a witness says, or part of it, or none of it. Some factors you may consider include: . . . the witness'  demeanor."" (Dkt. 263) at 9. The specific statements referenced by the prosecutor—Nichols's aggressive behavior  upon questioning, saying that she was irritating, saying that she was making him mad, saying that he was having a  hard time controlling his anger, putting her down, as well as disrespecting the Court and the trial process  generally—all stem from comments made by Nichols on (or immediately before) cross examination or his behavior  during that process. See, e.g., Tr. at 1539, 1571 (""This trial here is a—a big fucking lie.""), 1558-59 (""THE COURT:  You have to answer the question. THE WITNESS: No, I don't. THE COURT: You do. THE WITNESS: Who is going  to make me? THE COURT: Me. THE WITNESS: How? What you all going to do? THE COURT: I can hold you in  contempt of court for not answering the question. THE WITNESS: I'm in jail.""), 1573-76 (""The record will reflect that  2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *123 Page 35 of 38 he is refusing in that he is [*127]  ignoring the Court's direction.""), 1579, 1582, 1587 (""THE COURT: Okay. I am  directing you to answer the question. THE WITNESS: And I told you no.""), 1591, 1599 (""MS. STREICKER: Do you  think this is funny? A. I think you funny.""), 1600 (""THE COURT: . . . And the record will reflect that he wrote 'U Cool'  on the monitor while the prosecutor was getting the next exhibit.""), 1607 (""THE COURT: No. Enough of that. We're  not going to have you fight with the prosecutor.""), 1620-21, 1626, 1628 (""A. - I want to call somebody out their name  right now, but I didn't do it.""), 1629, 1635 (""MS. STREICKER: Objection, Your Honor, to the defendant drawing on  the board. THE WITNESS: Boring. . . . You're boring me. Are you almost finished?""), 1639, 1640 (""THE COURT:  I'm directing you to answer the question. THE WITNESS: And I'm directing you not to please ask me questions  about Kash, 'cause I'm not going to answer it.""). Thus, it was appropriate for the prosecutor to comment on  Nichols's testimonial behavior during closing. Although the prosecutor's comments appear to be contained appropriately to Nichols's behavior and demeanor on  the stand (see (Dkt. 312) at 93 (explaining that here, ""the government [*128]  was properly referring to the  defendant's own testimony, including both his words and his demeanor"")), the fact remains that he was in front of  the jury each trial day acting as his own counsel and frequently making improper comments and acting rudely to the  Court, prosecutors, and witnesses during the proceedings. To the extent that the prosecutor's comments can be  understood to call some of Nichols's non-testimonial conduct into question particularly because some of the specific  disrespectful behaviors mentioned occurred both on and off the stand, ""[i]mproper prosecutorial comments during  closing arguments are reviewed under a prosecutorial misconduct framework."" United States v. Richards, 719 F.3d  746, 764 (7th Cir. 2013) (citation omitted). ""This analysis requires, first a determination that prosecutors acted  improperly, and second a conclusion that the improper conduct prejudiced the defendant."" Id. (citation omitted);  United States v. Badger, 983 F.2d 1443, 1450 (7th Cir. 1993) (prejudice analysis looks at the entire record to  determine if the defendant was deprived of the right to a fair trial). Even if some of the prosecutor's comments could  be considered improperly broad, the Court cannot find that her comments prejudiced Nichols. This is for the same  reason just mentioned—each of the behaviors [*129]  mentioned in rebuttal, even if they also occurred when he  was not on the stand, were on full display while he was testifying in his own defense. Further, any prejudice that  could have occurred from calling out Nichols's non-testimonial conduct was cured by the Court's instruction on this  point, which read: Because defendant Samuel Nichols decided to act as his own lawyer, you heard him speak at various times  during the trial. He made an opening statement and a closing argument. He asked questions of witnesses,  made objections, and argued to the court. I want to remind you that when defendant Samuel Nichols spoke in  these parts of the trial, he acted as a lawyer in the case and his words are not evidence, similar to the  objections and arguments of the parties. The only evidence in this case comes from witnesses who testify  under oath on the witness stand and from exhibits that are admitted. (Dkt. 263) at 11. The prosecutor did not act improperly and Nichols was not denied the right to a fair trial. See  United States v. Wesley, 422 F.3d 509, 518-19 (7th Cir. 2005) (improper comments during closing arguments rarely  rise to the level of reversible error, and considerable discretion is entrusted to the district court to supervise the  arguments of counsel [*130]  . . . ""A new trial is required only if the improper comments prejudiced the defendant's  right to a fair trial.""). Overall, Nichols has not shown that the Court's rulings during the government's closings were  erroneous. J. Jury Instructions        2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *126 Page 36 of 38 Nichol next argues that the Court erred in overruling his objections to the Government's proposed jury instructions  #2, #23, #24, #25, and #27. The corresponding final instructions are #2, #20, #25, #26, #27, #28, #29, #30, #31,  and #37. For background, the Superseding Indictment charges Nichols in the conjunctive. For example, Count 2  charges: Beginning no later than in or about 2012, and continuing until in or about October 2014, in the Northern District  of Illinois, Eastern Division, and elsewhere, SAMUEL NICHOLS, a/k/a ""Buck,"" and CHARLES FEARS, a/k/a  ""Kash,"" defendants herein, in and affecting interstate commerce, knowingly recruited, enticed, harbored,  transported, provided, obtained, and maintained by any means a person, namely, [Betty Jo], and benefitted  financially and by receiving anything of value from participation in a venture which has engaged in recruiting,  enticing, harboring, transporting, providing, obtaining, and maintaining by any [*131]  means [Betty Jo],  knowing and in reckless disregard of the fact that means of force, threats of force, and coercion, and any  combination of such means, would be used to cause [Betty Jo] to engage in a commercial sex act; In violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1591(a) and (b)(1). (Dkt. 51) at 3 (emphasis added to Nichols's  disputed conjunctions). The Jury Instructions were written in the disjunctive. The instruction for Count 2 reads in  part: In order for you to find that defendant Samuel Nichols committed sex trafficking by force, threats of force, or  coercion, as charged in Count Two regarding Betty Jo, also known as Becky, the government must prove each  of the three following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: 1. The defendant knowingly recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, or maintained  Betty Jo; or the defendant knowingly benefitted, financially or by receiving a thing of value, from  participating in a venture that recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, or maintained  Betty Jo; and 2. The defendant knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that force, threats of force, or coercion would be  used to cause Betty Jo to engage in a commercial sex act; and 3. The offense [*132]  was in or affecting interstate commerce. (Dkt. 263) at 26 (emphasis added to Nichols's disputed conjunctions). Nichols argues that because the instructions use the disjunctive ""or"" instead of the conjunctive ""and,"" they represent  a material variance to the elements set forth in the Superseding Indictment. In other words, Nichols argues, as he  did during the instruction conference, that the Court constructively amended the Superseding Indictment by  accepting the challenged instructions. See (Dkt. 279) at (6); (Dkt. 294) at 3-4 (""Who is to say [what] the grand jury  would have done, if they had been faced with the alternative elements presented to them.""); see also Tr. at 1653- 60, 1683-85, 1688, 1690, 1694-95. ""Constructive amendment of the indictment can occur when either the  government (usually during its presentation of evidence and/or its argument), the court (usually through its  instructions to the jury), or both, broadens the possible bases for conviction beyond those presented by the grand  jury."" United States v. Jones, 418 F.3d 726, 729 (7th Cir. 2005) (quoting United States v. Cusimano, 148 F.3d 824,  829 (7th Cir. 1998)). A jury instruction that constructively amends the indictment implicates the defendant's right to  have the grand jury's charges control the offenses actually tried; ""a court cannot [*133]  permit a defendant to be  tried on charges that are not made in the indictment against him."" Id. at 729-30 (quoting Stirone v. United States,  361 U.S. 212, 217, 80 S. Ct. 270, 4 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1960)). Jury instructions must be accurate statements of the law that are supported by the facts in the case. See United  States v. Mancillas, 183 F.3d 682, 707 (7th Cir. 1999). Here, the contested instructions were just that; there is no  dispute that corresponding section of the TVPA is written in the disjunctive. See 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a); see also (Dkt.  294) at 4. Besides being accurate statements of law supported by the facts of the case, the contested jury  instructions also appropriately were contained to the charges set forth in the Superseding Indictment. That is, the    2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *130 Page 37 of 38 substitution of ""or"" for ""and"" did not allow for a conviction based on charges not contained in the Superseding  Indictment. ""[W]here a statute defines two or more ways in which an offense may be committed, all may be alleged  in the conjunctive in one count."" United States v. Cox, 536 F.3d 723, 726-27 (7th Cir. 2008) (internal citations  omitted). Yet, even when it does as much, the jury need only find that the defendant's conduct violates the statute.  See United States v. Rice, 520 F.3d 811, 817 (7th Cir. 2008) (explaining that because the firearm possession  statute was in the disjunctive, the disjunctive jury instructions were proper); see United States v. Kincaid, 571 F.3d  648, 656 (7th Cir. 2009) (although the indictment uses the conjunctive, the statute of conviction [*134]  (using the  disjunctive) is correctly identified in the indictment, the elements of the statute are correctly set forth in the  indictment, and the evidence adduced at trial supports the elements of the indicted offenses); see also Griffin v.  United States, 502 U.S. 46, 112 S. Ct. 466, 116 L. Ed. 2d 371 (1991) (explaining that ""a general jury verdict under a  single count charging the commission of an offence by two or more means"" is sufficient) (emphasis in original). This  is because ""[t]he general rule is that when a jury returns a guilty verdict on an indictment charging several acts in  the conjunctive . . . the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged.""  Turner v. United States, 396 U.S. 398, 420, 90 S. Ct. 642, 24 L. Ed. 2d 610 (1970). ""This rule extends to a trial  court's jury instructions in the disjunctive in the context of a conjunctively worded indictment."" United States v.  Durman, 30 F.3d 803, 810 (7th Cir. 1994). This rule has been applied to situations analogous to the one presented here to reject claims of error based on the  use of the conjunctive in charging documents. Jones, 418 F.3d at 730 (indictment that charged that Jones ""used,  carried, brandished, and discharged a firearm"" was not constructively amended by jury instructions that a finding of  guilt would be appropriate if he ""knowingly used or carried a firearm,"" and that ""'[u]se' may include  brandishing, [*135]  displaying, making reference to a firearm in the defendant's possession, or firing a firearm"");  see also United States v. Muelbl, 739 F.2d 1175, 1179-81 (7th Cir. 1984) (for charged conspiracy to distribute,  dispense, or possess with intent to distribute marijuana, cocaine, and methaqualone, the violation for one drug was  a subset of the indictment for all of the drugs). In other words, Nichols is incorrect in his argument that ""by structuring the indictment the way that they did[,] that  burden [to prove all of the elements set forth in the indictment] was taken on by the Government at the time of the  Indictment."" (Dkt. 294) at 4. The only case Nichols cites is Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 80 S. Ct. 270, 4  L. Ed. 2d 252 (1960), but that case presented a different issue. There, the indictment charged that the defendant  violated the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951, by causing ""supplies and materials (sand) to move in interstate  commerce."" Id. at 213. During trial the judge allowed evidence that the defendant interfered with certain steel  shipments as well. The court instructed the jury that the defendant's guilt could be predicated on either the sand or  steel shipments. Id. at 214. The Supreme Court held that this was error because the indictment could not be  reasonably read to charge interference with movements of steel and thus the defendant's right [*136]  to be  charged by the grand jury about the steel importation had been violated. Id. at 217-18. But the Court does not reach  the same result here, where all possible means to support the conviction (recruiting, enticing, harboring,  transporting, etc.) were included in the indicted counts. So instead of adding new charges or impermissibly  broadening the indictment, as the Jones court held, ""the jury instruction's use of the word 'or' was implicitly  subsumed by the indictment's 'and,' and the jury instructions therefore did not impermissibly broaden the scope of  the indictment."" Jones, 418 F.3d at 730. Relatedly, Nichols argues that the Court erred in preventing him from arguing in closing the above discussed  ""inconsistencies"" between the Superseding Indictment and the instructions, meaning the use of the disjunctive ""or""  in the instructions. See (Dkt. 279) at (21). But for the reasons just discussed, the use of the conjunctive in the  Superseding Indictment and the disjunctive in the Jury Instructions was not an ""inconsistency,"" and Nichols's  argument to the jury that referenced his disagreement to the Court's jury instruction rulings was improper for the  jury to consider. Accordingly, the motion is denied on these grounds. [*137]      2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, *133 Page 38 of 38 K. Due Process Concerns Nichols broadly argues that ""[t]he indictment and proceedings were fundamentally and manifestly unfair; [Nichols]  was denied his right to due process of law, to confront the evidence and witnesses against him, and to the  assistance of counsel according to the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the United States Constitution; due process  and fundamental fairness required the setting aside of the guilty verdicts."" See (Dkt. 279) at (19), (22). Where to  begin with this farreaching and indefinite catchall argument of error? Like many of his other arguments, this vague  laundry list of constitutional violations is not developed or supported by any relevant caselaw and it is considered  waived. See Holm, 326 F.3d at 877; McLee, 436 F.3d at 760. And in light of the lengthy analysis contained herein  and the record of this matter as a whole, the Court finds no basis to support such an argument. L. Cumulative or Overall Error Finally, Nichols claims the cumulative effect of the errors denied him a fair trial. See (Dkt. 279) at (16), (17); see  also id. at (23) (raising all error that may appear from the record). Cumulative error exists where at least two errors  committed during a trial denied defendant a fundamentally fair trial. United States v. Adams, 628 F.3d 407, 419 (7th  Cir. 2010); Alvarez v. Boyd, 225 F.3d 820, 824 (7th Cir. 2000). To demonstrate cumulative error, Nichols [*138]   must establish at least two errors occurred, and ""considered together along with the entire record, the multiple  errors so infected the jury's deliberation that they denied [him] a fundamentally fair trial."" United States v. Allen, 269  F.3d 842, 847 (7th Cir. 2001). Here, no claimed errors warrant either reversal of the sex-trafficking or conspiracy  convictions or a new trial. Overwhelming evidence proved that Nichols committed sex trafficking and conspired with  others to do so. See United States v. Groce, 891 F.3d 260, 271 (7th Cir. 2018). He recruited vulnerable women in  desperate circumstances into prostitution by making various promises of a better life. The jury heard extensive  evidence about how he maintained control over these women and girls by assaults, threats, and manipulation.  Particularly in light of the above analysis, there is no reason to think that any two or more potential errors combined  to deprive him of a fundamentally fair trial. The record demonstrates his guilt ""such that none of the asserted errors,  either individually or cumulatively,"" could have affected the verdict. Adams, 628 F.3d at 420. All in all, the Court  finds no basis on which to grant Nichols a new trial.",1
"United States v. Palms, 21 F.4th 689","[*692]  McHUGH, Circuit Judge. The Government tried Appellant Ramar Palms before a  jury in the Northern District of Oklahoma and obtained  guilty verdicts on three crimes related to sex trafficking.  On appeal, Mr. Palms asks this court to reverse his  convictions and remand for a new trial for two reasons.  First, Mr. Palms argues the district court should have  suppressed the evidence obtained from his cell phone  because the warrant and the search of his cell phone  violated the Fourth Amendment. Second, he argues the  district court abused its discretion when it excluded  sexual behavior evidence under Federal Rule of  Evidence 412 because the exclusion violated the Fifth  and Sixth Amendments. As detailed below, we hold the warrant to search Mr.  Palms's cell phone was sufficiently particular and the  search was reasonable. We also hold the district court  did not abuse its discretion in excluding sexual behavior  evidence under Rule 412. Therefore, [**2]  we affirm Mr.  Palms's convictions. I. BACKGROUND A. Factual History  [*693]  1. Mr. Palms and M.W. In September 2018, Mr. Palms met M.W., a twenty- seven-year-old single mom, at a bar in Tulsa,         Page 2 of 10 Oklahoma. They began to spend time together and went  on a few dates. Eventually, Mr. Palms invited M.W. to  go on a road trip to Louisiana with him. On that road trip,  Mr. Palms told M.W. he was a pimp and that he wanted  her to make money for him. At the time, they were in the  car together ""in the middle of nowhere,"" and M.W. could  not get away from Mr. Palms. ROA Vol. III at 1022. That  night, they stopped at a hotel in Houston, Texas. There,  Mr. Palms assaulted M.W. Then, he advertised M.W.'s  services online and forced M.W. to go on her first ""date.""  Mr. Palms taught M.W. about the pimping industry and  told her she should keep her head down and not look  any man in the eyes because another pimp might steal  her from him. When they returned to Tulsa, Mr. Palms began  controlling every aspect of M.W.'s life. Mr. Palms  required M.W. to quit her two jobs and work for him full- time as a prostitute. He constantly communicated with  M.W. via text messages and phone calls and monitored  her whereabouts. Mr. Palms also [**3]  tracked who  M.W. talked to and controlled her money, car, and  phone. If M.W. did something or talked to a man he did  not approve of, he would hit or strangle her. Mr. Palms posted ads or required M.W. to post ads to  various websites offering commercial sex acts from  M.W. Mr. Palms created a template for her to follow to  ensure she would attract clients. He required M.W. to  post the ads regularly throughout the day and to go on  at least four or five ""dates"" a day. Clients paid Mr. Palms  by Cash App or paid M.W. in cash. In either case, Mr.  Palms required M.W. to give him all the money she  earned. Mr. Palms would occasionally buy M.W. food  and other items, but M.W. had to ask him for money to  support herself and her two children. M.W. could not  cover her utility bills or rent, and eventually she was  evicted. 2. Arrest On November 20, 2018, Tulsa police officer Justin  Oxford was investigating online advertisements for  suspected prostitution. Officer Oxford responded to one  of the ads and was directed to meet M.W. in room 220  at the Peoria Inn in Tulsa. When he arrived, he saw Mr.  Palms parked in a car near room 220. After M.W. let  Officer Oxford into the room, he asked for a sex act  and [**4]  put money on the nightstand. When M.W.  agreed, Officer Oxford identified himself as a police  officer and arrested her. M.W. told Officer Oxford that  she was being forced to work as a prostitute and  identified Mr. Palms as her pimp. Officer Oxford also  saw a text message from Mr. Palms on M.W.'s phone  screen. The police arrested Mr. Palms in the parking lot  and seized his cell phone. 3. Warrant and Search of Mr. Palms's Cell Phone Officer Oxford sought a warrant to search Mr. Palms's  cell phone from a Tulsa County judge. In his affidavit  supporting the warrant, Officer Oxford detailed the  events of November 20, 2018, and the information he  obtained from M.W. about  [*694]  her connection with  Mr. Palms. The judge issued a warrant to search Mr.  Palms's cell phone. The warrant said ""[p]robable cause  ha[d] been shown"" and authorized the police to search  Mr.  Palms's  cell  phone  for  ""[r]ecords,  data,  communications and information which are evidence of  Human Trafficking."" ROA Vol. I at 68. Specifically, the  warrant authorized the police to search Mr. Palms's cell  phone for evidence including, but not limited to, all digital evidence  stored on removable storage and magnetic or  electronic data contained [**5]  in the contents of  such tablet, cell phone, laptop, camera and/or  memory cards, including electronic data storage  devices, which in whole or part contain any and all  evidence related to the subscriber information from  the SIM (subscriber identification module) and/or  ownership information for the device, electronic  mail, call logs, contacts, calendars, location  services information, global positioning (GPS) data  and information, internet chat communications,  browser  cache,  auto-complete  forms,  stored  passwords,  instant  messaging,  SMS  (short  message service), MMS (multimedia message  service),  social  media  account  data  and  information, application data and information,  documents,  photographs,  images,  graphics,  pictures, videos, movies, audio or video recordings,  any associated metadata, and any recorded  documents  depicting  communications,  correspondence  or  storage  of  these  communications, files, graphics, documents, or  other data related to the crime of Human  Trafficking. Id. Officer Brian Booth, a member of the Tulsa Police  Department's intelligence unit, extracted all the data  from Mr. Palms's cell phone pursuant to the warrant.  Officer  Booth  gave  the  extracted  information,  Page 3 of 10 excluding [**6]  the cloud data, to Officer Oxford, who  searched it. B. Procedural History In July 2019, a federal grand jury charged Mr. Palms  with sex trafficking by force, fraud, and coercion in  violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(1)  (Count One); attempted obstruction of sex trafficking  enforcement in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(d) (Count  Two); and retaliation against a victim and causing bodily  harm in violation 18 U.S.C. § 1513(b)(2) (Count Three). 1. Motion to Suppress Prior to trial, Mr. Palms submitted a motion arguing the  evidence obtained from his cell phone should be  suppressed because the warrant and the search of his  cell phone violated the Fourth Amendment. He made  four arguments in support: (1) the document titled  ""Search Warrant"" was not actually a warrant because it  did not have a sufficient statement of probable cause,  command language, or appropriate headings; (2) the  warrant lacked the particularity required by the Fourth  Amendment because it did not limit the search to  specific materials or to a specific crime; (3) the  extraction and search of the data from  [*695]  the cell  phone was unreasonable; and (4) the good faith  exception did not apply because well-trained officers  would have understood this warrant was invalid. The district court held a limited evidentiary [**7]  hearing  on the search of the cell phone. At the hearing, the                  district court heard from Officer Booth, who extracted  the data from the cell phone, and Officer Oxford, who  searched it. Officer Booth testified that he reviewed the warrant and  extracted the data for the search. Officer Booth  explained that he first tried to perform more limited types  of extractions known as a file extraction and a logical  extraction, but they did not work on Mr. Palms's cell  phone because these extraction methods were blocked  by the phone's software or the carrier. He then resorted  to the last extraction option available on the machine he  was using, which was a broad physical extraction.  Officer Booth did not contact any other agencies to help  him limit his extraction because he believed they would  have the same options he had. The physical extraction  created a byte-for-byte copy of the cell phone with data  and metadata. Officer Booth did not limit the search to  certain types of files. He extracted all the data on the  cell phone. Officer Oxford testified about the methodology he used  to search the data. He informally limited his search to  the relevant time-period from September 2018, when  Mr. Palms met M.W., [**8]  to November 20, 2018,  when they were arrested. His methodology involved  viewing SMS messages, MMS messages, photographs,  and emails. Sometimes he used the search function to  search key words, but he also viewed the evidence in  their locations on the cell phone to determine their  context. When Officer Oxford saw something unrelated  to the crime of human trafficking, he moved on quickly.  At one point, Officer Oxford discovered privileged  attorney-client  communications,  and  he  promptly  stopped his search to contact the prosecutor. He did not  come across evidence of any crimes other than human  trafficking during the search. After the evidentiary hearing, the district court denied  Mr. Palms's motion to suppress. The district court held  the warrant satisfied the Fourth Amendment because it  was supported by probable cause, and it was            Page 4 of 10 sufficiently  particular  because  the  search  was  reasonable under United States v. Loera, 923 F.3d 907  (10th Cir. 2019). Alternatively, the district court  determined both the officers relied in good faith on the  warrant. Mr. Palms asked the district court to  reconsider, but the district court denied that motion. 2. Motion in Limine Under Federal Rule of Evidence 412, evidence of the  victim's prior sexual behavior is generally not admissible  in a civil or [**9]  criminal proceeding involving alleged  sexual misconduct. Prior to trial, the Government   [*696]  submitted a Motion in Limine, invoking Rule 412  and requesting the district court prohibit Mr. Palms from  introducing any evidence that M.W. had engaged in  commercial sex acts before she met Mr. Palms. Mr.  Palms opposed the motion on the ground that this  evidence was necessary to protect his Fifth and Sixth  Amendment rights. He also submitted a notice of sexual  behavior evidence, identifying specific sexual behavior  evidence he sought to admit. This included evidence  that M.W. had voluntarily engaged in commercial sex  before she met Mr. Palms, M.W. had an understanding  of the commercial sex business before she met Mr.  Palms,  and  M.W.  knew  how  to  post  online  advertisements for commercial sex before she met Mr.  Palms.  Mr.  Palms  argued  the  evidence  was  constitutionally required because it supported his  alternative theory that it was M.W. who recruited and  enticed Mr. Palms to join her commercial sex business.  He also said the evidence may be necessary to  impeach her credibility generally and specifically on the  elements of the crimes with which Mr. Palms was  charged. The district court ultimately prohibited Mr. Palms from  presenting [**10]  evidence about M.W.'s prior sexual  behavior under Rule 412. The district court determined  the sexual behavior evidence was generally not  admissible, but it left the final decision for trial because  the evidence may be admissible if it was directly  relevant to Mr. Palms's charges or to correct a  misleading impression created by the testimony. The  district court also ruled the evidence would not be  allowed to impugn M.W.'s credibility generally, but it left  open the possibility that Mr. Palms could use M.W.'s      prior court testimony for direct impeachment purposes. At trial, M.W. testified that prostitution was ""not  something [she] would choose to do on [her] own,"" ROA  Vol. III at 1108. To diminish her credibility, Mr. Palms  sought to introduce the evidence of her commercial sex  acts prior to meeting Mr. Palms. With this evidence, Mr.  Palms sought to dispute M.W.'s testimony about her  fear of Mr. Palms when he identified himself as a pimp  and the impression that Mr. Palms taught her how  prostitution works and how to post solicitation ads  online. The district court denied the request, stating the  evidence of prior sexual behavior was irrelevant to  whether Mr. Palms forced her to advertise and  perform [**11]  commercial sex acts in 2018. 3. Trial and Conviction In December 2019, the Government tried the charges  against Mr. Palms to a jury, but the jury could not reach  a verdict. The district court declared a mistrial, and at  the Government's request, set the case for retrial. Prior  to the second trial, the Government obtained a  superseding indictment containing all three of the  original  charges  and  two  additional  charges:  transporting an individual for prostitution in violation of  18 U.S.C. § 2421(a) (Count Four) and online promotion  and facilitation of prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. §  2421A(a) (Count Five). During the second trial, the district court granted a  motion for acquittal as to Count Five (online promotion  and facilitation of prostitution), but it sent the rest of the  charges to the jury. The jury acquitted Mr. Palms on  Count Three (retaliation against a victim and causing  bodily harm) and found him guilty on Counts One (sex  trafficking  by  force,  fraud,  and  coercion),  Two  (attempted obstruction of sex trafficking enforcement),  and Four (transporting  [*697]  an individual for  prostitution). The district court imposed a sentence of  235 months each on Counts One and Two, and 120  months on Count Four, all running concurrently. [**12]  II. DISCUSSION On appeal, Mr. Palms challenges the district court's  decisions to admit the cell phone evidence and to  exclude evidence that M.W. engaged in commercial sex  acts before she met Mr. Palms. We undertake our  analysis by first considering whether the search and  seizure of Mr. Palms's cell phone satisfied the  requirements articulated in the Fourth Amendment.  Page 5 of 10 Then, we review the district court's exclusion of the  sexual behavior evidence under Rule 412. A. Search and Seizure Mr. Palms appeals the district court's decision denying  the motion to suppress the evidence obtained from his  cell phone because (1) the warrant was invalid under  the Fourth Amendment and (2) the search was  unreasonable. When reviewing a district court's denial of  a motion to suppress, we ""view the evidence in the light  most favorable to the government and accept the district  court's  factual  findings  unless  they  are  clearly  erroneous."" United States v. Grimmett, 439 F.3d 1263,  1268 (10th Cir. 2006). But we review de novo the  ultimate question of reasonableness under the Fourth  Amendment. Loera, 923 F.3d at 915. 1. Applicable Law The Fourth Amendment provides, The right of the people to be secure in their  persons, houses, papers, and effects, against  unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be  violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon  probable cause, supported [**13]  by Oath or  affirmation, and particularly describing the place to  be searched, and the persons or things to be  seized. U.S. Const. amend. IV. In other words, the Fourth  Amendment requires warrants to be supported by  probable cause and to describe with particularity who  and what can be searched and seized. After obtaining a  warrant, the Fourth Amendment also requires officers to  conduct the search and seizure reasonably. Here, Mr.  Palms argues neither the warrant nor the subsequent  search satisfied the constitutional requirements. 2. Warrant Particularity Requirement Mr. Palms argues the warrant was not constitutionally  valid because it did not particularly describe the things  to be seized even though it was limited to evidence of  human trafficking. Thus, we must determine whether      ""the crime of human trafficking"" is a sufficiently specific  crime such that a warrant's limitation to  [*698]  search  and  seize  evidence  of  it  satisfies  the  Fourth  Amendment's particularity requirement. We hold that it  is. The Fourth Amendment's particularity requirement  ""'ensures that the search will be carefully tailored to its  justifications[] and will not take on the character of the  wide-ranging  exploratory  searches  the  Framers  intended to prohibit.'"" United States v. Otero, 563 F.3d  1127, 1131-32 (10th Cir. 2009) (quoting Maryland v.  Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 84, 107 S. Ct. 1013, 94 L. Ed. 2d  72  (1987)).  Because  computers  can  contain  enormous [**14]  amounts of information and relevant  evidence can be stored in any location, the Fourth  Amendment requires warrants for computer searches to  ""affirmatively limit the search to evidence of specific . . .  crimes or specific types of material."" Id. at 1132  (quotation marks omitted). The same standard applies  to  cell  phones  because  they  are  essentially  ""'minicomputers that also happen to have the capacity  to be used as a telephone.'"" United States v. Russian,  848 F.3d 1239, 1245 (10th Cir. 2017) (quoting Riley v.  California, 573 U.S. 373, 393, 134 S. Ct. 2473, 189 L.  Ed. 2d 430 (2014)). The guiding purpose of this standard is to establish  practical guidelines about what can be searched and  seized, leaving nothing to the discretion of the officers                                     Page 6 of 10 executing the warrant. United States v. Leary, 846 F.2d  592, 600 (10th Cir. 1988) (""A description is sufficiently  particular when it enables the searcher to reasonably  ascertain and identify the things authorized to be  seized."" (quotation marks omitted)). Thus, ""practical  accuracy rather than technical precision controls the  determination of whether a search warrant adequately  describes the place to be searched."" Otero, 563 F.3d at  1132 (quotation marks omitted). As Mr. Palms contends, the warrant was not limited to  any specific types of materials, such as text messages,  emails, or pictures. Rather, the warrant said the  information to be searched and seized ""include[d], but  [was] not [**15]  limited to, all digital evidence stored on  removable storage and magnetic or electronic data  contained in the contents of such tablet, cell phone,  laptop, camera and/or memory cards."" ROA Vol. I at 68.  Such a broad authorization is permissible under our  precedent, so long as the warrant contained some  ""limiting principle."" See Russian, 848 F.3d at 1245. The Government contends the warrant contained such a  limitation because it permitted the officers to search and  seize only evidence of ""human trafficking."" But Mr.  Palms argues ""human trafficking"" is not sufficiently  specific because the warrant did not cite a specific  criminal statute and because human trafficking is a  broad term that gave the officers ""carte blanche to  search and seize anything in the phone's contents they  believed might pertain in any way to any human  trafficking, at any time, whether for forced labor, for sex,  for drug trafficking, or anything else arguably tied to the  broad universe of 'human trafficking.'"" Aplt. Opening Br.  at 18. We disagree. To be sufficiently particular, search warrants do not  have to identify specific statutes for the crimes to which   [*699]  they are limited. See United States v. Christie,  717 F.3d 1156, 1165 (10th Cir. 2013) (holding a warrant  was particular when it was limited to information [**16]   ""'related to the murder, neglect, and abuse of'"" a child);  United States v. Brooks, 427 F.3d 1246, 1252-53 (10th  Cir. 2005) (holding a warrant satisfied the particularity  requirement when it authorized officers to search a  computer ""for evidence of child pornography""). Mr.  Palms's contrary suggestion would inject the kind of  technical precision the Fourth Amendment does not  require. Christie, 717 F.3d at 1166 (explaining the  particularity requirement has never ""been understood to  demand of a warrant technical precision or elaborate  detail but only practical limitations affording reasonable  specificity""  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted)).  Therefore, the lack of a statutory citation does not  automatically render a warrant invalid. Rather, we must  determine whether the warrant adequately limited the  scope of the search despite the absence of a statutory  reference. The warrant here is sufficiently limited. Oklahoma state  law explicitly prohibits ""human trafficking."" Okla. Stat. tit.  21, § 748(B) (""It shall be unlawful to knowingly engage  in human trafficking.""). And the definition of ""human  trafficking"" is not as unrestrained as Mr. Palms  suggests. It is defined as ""modern-day slavery that  includes, but is not limited to, extreme exploitation and  the denial of freedom or liberty of an individual for  purposes of deriving [**17]  benefit from that individual's  commercial sex act or labor."" Id. § 748(A)(4). Although Oklahoma's definition of ""human trafficking""  includes both types of human trafficking—sex trafficking  and labor trafficking—it is still a sufficiently specific,  defined crime. See, e.g., United States v. Burgess, 576  F.3d 1078, 1083, 1091 (10th Cir. 2009) (holding a  warrant was sufficiently particular when it authorized a  search for evidence of the sale of any illegal controlled  substance even though probable cause for the warrant  was based on evidence of marijuana and cocaine). It  therefore does not run afoul of our rejection of warrants  that broadly encompass ""any crime."" Cf. Otero, 563  F.3d at 1132-33 (holding a warrant was not particular  when it had ""no limiting instruction whatsoever"" and  authorized ""a wide-ranging search of [the appellant]'s  computer""); Cassady v. Goering, 567 F.3d 628, 635-36  (10th Cir. 2009) (holding a warrant was not particular  when there was only ""probable cause to search for  evidence related to marijuana cultivation, yet the  warrant authorized the seizure of all possible evidence  of any crime in any jurisdiction"").               Page 7 of 10 Because Oklahoma law labels the crime as ""human  trafficking,"" and there is no separate ""sex trafficking""  crime, it is ""difficult to imagine how the . . . warrant could  have been [**18]  phrased more specifically."" United  States v. Le, 173 F.3d 1258, 1275 (10th Cir. 1999).  Indeed, the Oklahoma state judge who issued the  warrant and the Tulsa police officers who executed it  would have understood human trafficking to be a  specific crime. And most importantly,  [*700]  the  existence of a statutory definition of ""human trafficking""  would have enabled the executing Tulsa police officers  to understand what evidence the warrant permitted  them to search and seize. Therefore, the warrant's  limitation to evidence of the crime of human trafficking  satisfied  the  Fourth  Amendment's  particularity  requirement. 3. Reasonableness of the Search and Seizure After obtaining a warrant, the officers ""must conduct  their search 'strictly within the bounds set by the  warrant.'"" Loera, 923 F.3d at 916 (quoting Bivens v. Six  Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics,  403 U.S. 388, 395 n.7, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619  (1971)). ""Determining whether a search exceeds the  scope of its authorizing warrant is, like most inquiries  under  the  Fourth  Amendment,  an  exercise  in  reasonableness assessed on a case-by-case basis."" Id.  In general, ""investigators executing a warrant can look  anywhere where evidence described in the warrant  might conceivably be located."" Id. (citing United States  v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 824, 102 S. Ct. 2157, 72 L. Ed.  2d 572 (1982)). However, that limitation can be difficult  to enforce in a computer search where relevant data  could be stored anywhere. See id. To address this problem, we have focused [**19]  on  how the computer search was conducted rather than  what was searched.See id. at 917. ""Shifting our focus             in this way is necessary in the electronic search context  because search warrants typically contain few—if any— restrictions on where within a computer or other  electronic storage device the government is permitted to  search."" Id. (emphasis in original). The reasonableness  of the search method ""depends on the particular facts of  a given case."" Id. at 920. Mr. Palms first argues the extraction of information from  his cell phone was too broad. Officer Booth testified he  could not perform a more limited file extraction or a  logical extraction on Mr. Palms's cell phone, so he  conducted a broad physical extraction of the entire  contents and metadata. And Officer Booth testified that  seeking help from other agencies would have been  pointless because he believed they had the same  extraction options as he had. He therefore extracted a  byte-for-byte copy of the contents of the cell phone and  captured a vast amount of information, including  personal information unrelated to the suspected crime. Mr. Palms also argues the search of the extracted data  should have been limited so that the officers could not  view [**20]  any information that was not related to the  suspected crime. The district court found that Officer  Oxford limited his search to the time after Mr. Palms met  M.W. The court also determined that Officer Oxford   [*701]  searched SMS messages, MMS messages,  photographs, and some emails, and that he would move  on quickly when he came across information or  communications that were not potentially relevant to the  crime of human trafficking. The district court noted that  Officer Oxford discovered some privileged attorney- client  communications  during  his  search  and  immediately stopped to consult with the prosecutor. We have previously found a similar extraction and  search to be reasonable. In United States v. Burgess,  the officers obtained a warrant to search the defendant's  property for evidence of controlled substances. 576 F.3d  at 1083. During the search, the officers found a hard  drive and searched it. To begin the search, they ""ma[d]e  a byte-for-byte copy of the hard drive."" Id. at 1084.  Although this process captured information beyond the  scope of the warrant, we did not hold the search was  unreasonable. Id. at 1095. Rather, we explained that the  broad extraction was consistent with the reality that        Page 8 of 10 evidence of the crime could be found in various file  types. [**21]  Id. at 1093. The search of the extracted  files then proceeded with the focus on files that might  contain evidence of drug trafficking. Id. at 1094-95. The  officers viewed files even if they were not obviously  labeled with titles related to the suspected crime to  confirm they had not been deceptively labeled, but if the  file did not contain relevant evidence, the officers moved  on immediately. Id. at 1094-95. In Burgess, we  concluded  the  extraction  and  the  search  were  reasonable. Id. at 1095. We reach the same conclusion here. As in Burgess, the  evidence of human trafficking in this case could have  taken many forms, such as text messages, emails,  photographs,  internet  history,  and  transaction  applications. For this reason, the warrant did not limit  the search to one type of information contained on the  cell phone. And the physical extraction of all the data  from the cell phone was reasonable. Likewise, Officer  Oxford limited his search to the time-period when Mr.  Palms knew M.W. and viewed the types of files that  were most likely to contain evidence of the crime of  human trafficking. When he came across unrelated  personal information or communications, he quickly  moved to the next thing. And when he came across  privileged attorney-client communications, [**22]  he  immediately stopped his search and contacted the  prosecutor. This search methodology was sufficiently  limited. Therefore, both the extraction and the search  methodology were reasonable. Because the warrant and the search of the cell phone  complied with the Fourth Amendment, we affirm the  district court's denial of the motion to suppress. B. Federal Rule of Evidence 412 Mr. Palms argues the district court erred by excluding  evidence of M.W.'s prior commercial sex work under  Federal Rule of Evidence 412. Specifically, Mr. Palms  appeals the decision to exclude evidence that (1) M.W.  had knowledge of how to post online advertisements for  commercial sex before she met Mr. Palms, (2)  [*702]          M.W. had voluntarily engaged in commercial sex acts  before meeting Mr. Palms, and (3) M.W. knew about  certain aspects of the commercial sex business before  she met Mr. Palms. He argues exclusion of this  evidence violated the Confrontation Clause and his  federal due process rights. ""To the extent the challenge to the exclusion of  evidence proffered by the defendant is based on a  constitutional objection . . . we review the district court's  ruling excluding that evidence de novo."" United States v.  Pablo, 696 F.3d 1280, 1297 (10th Cir. 2012). Otherwise,  a district court's ruling on the admissibility of evidence is  reviewed for abuse of discretion. United States v. A.S.,  939 F.3d 1063, 1071 (10th Cir. 2019). 1. Applicable [**23]  Law Under Federal Rule of Evidence 412, ""[e]vidence  offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual  behavior"" and ""[e]vidence offered to prove a victim's  sexual predisposition"" are ""not admissible in any civil or  criminal  proceeding  involving  alleged  sexual  misconduct."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(a). The purpose of this  rule is ""to safeguard the alleged victim against the  invasion of privacy, potential embarrassment and sexual  stereotyping."" Fed. R. Evid. 412, advisory committee  notes to 1994 amendments. However, there is an  exception in criminal cases when the exclusion of the  evidence ""would violate the defendant's constitutional  rights."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C). As relevant here, defendants have constitutional rights  to due process and to confront witnesses against them.                     Page 9 of 10 The Fifth Amendment provides, ""[n]o person shall . . . be  deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process  of the law."" U.S. Const. amend. V. This amendment  provides  individuals  with  both  substantive  and  procedural due process rights. As it relates to this  appeal, the Due Process Clause provides a defendant  with the right to a fair trial. Fero v. Kerby, 39 F.3d 1462,  1478 (10th Cir. 1994) (""A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a  basic requirement of due process."" (quoting In re  Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136, 75 S. Ct. 623, 99 L. Ed.  942 (1955))). The Sixth Amendment provides, ""[i]n all criminal  prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be  confronted with the witnesses [**24]  against him."" U.S.  Const. amend. VI. This is known as the Confrontation  Clause, and its purpose is to guarantee defendants ""'an  opportunity for effective cross-examination.'"" Delaware  v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89  L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986) (quoting Delaware v. Fensterer,  474 U.S. 15, 20, 106 S. Ct. 292, 88 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1985)  (per curiam)) (emphasis in original). However, the right  is not limitless. It does not guarantee a defendant the  right to cross-examine witnesses ""in whatever way, and  to whatever extent, the defense might wish."" Id. (quoting  Fensterer, 474 U.S. at 20). Together, the Fifth and Sixth Amendments provide  defendants with the  [*703]  ""right to present a defense.""  United States v. Oldman, 979 F.3d 1234, 1252 (10th  Cir. 2020) (quotation marks omitted). 2. Analysis Mr. Palms argues the exclusion of evidence that M.W.  understood and participated in commercial sex work  before she met him violated his constitutional rights to a  fair trial, to confront witnesses against him, and to  present a full defense. First, he argues the sexual  behavior evidence is relevant because it ""tends to  counter"" the Government's assertion that Mr. Palms  ""enticed or recruited"" M.W. to perform commercial sex  acts—an element of Count One. Aplt. Opening Br. at 28.  Second, he argues the evidence would ""impeach the  credibility of"" M.W. Id. at 30. Pursuant to the Confrontation Clause and the Due  Process Clause, sexual behavior evidence ""may be  required to be admitted . . . where relevant and  probative on a central issue of sexual offense [**25]   charges."" A.S., 939 F.3d at 1072 (quotation marks  omitted). Evidence is considered relevant if it ""has any  tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it  would be without the evidence."" Fed. R. Evid. 401.  However, relevance is not enough; the evidence must  also be probative of a central issue to be required by the  Constitution. In addition, ""the Constitution does not  mandate the admission of irrelevant or general  impeachment evidence."" A.S., 939 F.3d at 1074. Mr. Palms's first argument is not persuasive because  the sexual behavior evidence is not probative of a  central issue in this case. Evidence that a sex trafficking  victim previously engaged in prostitution is irrelevant to  whether that victim was forced or coerced into working  as a prostitute at a later date. See 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)  (prohibiting using ""means of force, threats of force,  fraud, [and] coercion"" to ""cause [a] person to engage in  a commercial sex act""). Other circuit courts have  consistently come to the same conclusion. United  States v. Rivera, 799 F.3d 180, 185 (2d Cir. 2015)  (""Evidence of victims' prior acts of commercial sex is  irrelevant to whether those victims were coerced into  working as prostitutes.""); United States v. Roy, 781 F.3d  416, 420 (8th Cir. 2015) (""The victim's participation in  prostitution either before or after the time period in the  indictment has no relevance to whether Roy [**26]  beat  her, threatened her, and took the money she made from  prostitution in order to cause her to engage in  commercial sex.""); United States v. Cephus, 684 F.3d  703, 708 (7th Cir. 2012) (explaining evidence the victim  had been a prostitute before ""would not be evidence  that she consented to be beaten and to receive no  share of the fees paid by the johns she serviced""); see  also United States v. Brown, 810 F. App'x 105, 108 (3d  Cir. 2020) (unpublished) (""[W]hether Brown's victims  engaged in prostitution before 2011 or after 2014 would  have had little if any probative value.""), cert. denied, 141  S. Ct. 443, 208 L. Ed. 2d 136 (2020); United States v.  Valenzuela, 495 F. App'x 817, 819-20 (9th Cir. Nov. 2,  2012) (per curiam) (unpublished) (""Appellants cannot  show the relevance of questions about prior prostitution  to either Appellants' knowledge of the use of force,  fraud, or coercion, or the victims' consent to work in  prostitution.""). Even if M.W. participated in commercial  sex work in 2017 and knew how to post ads for  commercial sex, that does not tend to prove Mr. Palms  did not force her to engage in prostitution during the  period charged. Indeed, this lack of probative value is  exactly why Rule 412 exists. It ""preclude[s] defendants  from arguing that because the victim previously  consented to have sex—for love or money—her claims  of coercion should not be believed."" Rivera, 799 F.3d at  185.  [*704]  As to the issue of impeachment, Mr. Palms  Page 10 of 10 argues he should [**27]  have been permitted to present  the evidence of M.W.'s prior commercial sex work when  M.W. testified prostitution is ""not something [she] would  choose to do on [her] own."" Aplt. Opening Br. at 29.  Because the sexual behavior evidence is not relevant to  or probative of the issues on trial, this is general  impeachment evidence that is not required by the  Constitution. See A.S., 939 F.3d at 1074 (holding  evidence of prior sexual behavior is not constitutionally  required if it would solely diminish the witness's general  credibility). And we cannot say the district court abused  its discretion in excluding the sexual behavior evidence  under Rule 412. Thus, we affirm the district court's ruling  excluding the evidence of M.W.'s prior commercial sex  work.",1
"United States v. Paul, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72619","MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER I. INTRODUCTION This matter is before the undersigned United States District Judge for a ruling on Defendant Lee Andrew Paul's  (""Paul"") Motion Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence [Docket No. 203] (the ""§ 2255  Page 2 of 7 Motion""). Paul has also filed a letter [Docket No. 220] requesting a sentence reduction. For the reasons set forth  below, Paul's § 2255 Motion and request for a reduced sentence are denied. II. BACKGROUND On December 11, 2015, a jury returned a verdict finding Paul guilty of three counts of commercial sex trafficking in  violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). Jury Verdict [Docket No. 98]. Paul's convictions arose from the sex trafficking of  two girls, ages 12 and 16, and a 19 year old woman. In Counts I and II, the jury found Paul trafficked the minor girls.  Id. In all three Counts, the jury found Paul used force, fraud or coercion in furtherance of his crimes. Id. Paul was  sentenced to a prison term of 396 months on each of Counts I, II, and III, to be served concurrently. [*2]   Sentencing J. [Docket No. 147] at 2; Sentencing Tr. [Docket No. 169] at 46. Paul appealed his conviction, arguing: 1) the evidence was insufficient to support each count of conviction; 2) each  count in the superseding indictment contained multiple crimes and was therefore duplicitous; and 3) the district  court's jury instructions defining ""coercion"" and ""fraud"" rendered § 1591(a) void for vagueness as applied. United  States v. Paul, 885 F.3d 1099 (8th Cir. 2018). On March 22, 2018, the Eighth Circuit affirmed Paul's conviction. Id.  at 1101. The Supreme Court denied Paul's writ of certiorari on October 1, 2018. See Paul v. United States, 139 S.  Ct. 290, 202 L. Ed. 2d 190 (2018). Paul then filed this § 2255 Motion. He asserts ineffective assistance of counsel claims against his trial counsel,  Michael Colich, and his appellate counsel, Virginia Villa. Paul also argues that the Government failed to establish  the requisite knowledge for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1591. In addition to the § 2255 Motion, Paul requests  that his sentence be reduced because he has rehabilitated himself while in prison and desires to assist his family  during the COVID-19 pandemic. III. DISCUSSION A. Legal Standard Persons in federal custody are provided a limited opportunity to collaterally attack the constitutionality, jurisdictional  basis, or legality of their sentence [*3]  under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. See United States v. Addonizio, 442 U.S. 178, 185,  99 S. Ct. 2235, 60 L. Ed. 2d 805 (1979). ""Relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is reserved for transgressions of  constitutional rights and for a narrow range of injuries that could not have been raised on direct appeal, and if  uncorrected, would result in a complete miscarriage of justice."" Walking Eagle v. United States, 742 F.3d 1079,  1081-82 (8th Cir. 2014) (quoting United States v. Apfel, 97 F.3d 1074, 1076 (8th Cir. 1996)). Section 2255 generally may not ""be used to relitigate matters decided on direct appeal."" Sun Bear v. United States,  644 F.3d 700, 702 (8th Cir. 2011) (citing Davis v. United States, 417 U.S. 333, 346-47, 94 S. Ct. 2298, 41 L. Ed. 2d  109 (1974)); see also United States v. Shabazz, 657 F.2d 189, 190 (8th Cir. 1981) (per curiam) (""Claims which  were raised and decided on direct appeal cannot be relitigated on a motion to vacate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §  2255.""). B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel     2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72619, *1 Page 3 of 7 ""To establish ineffective assistance of counsel within the context of section 2255 . . . a movant faces a heavy  burden."" Apfel, 97 F.3d at 1076. A defendant must show that ""(1) his attorney's performance failed to conform to the  degree of skill, care, and diligence of a reasonably competent attorney; and (2) he was prejudiced by the attorney's  poor performance."" Pierce v. United States, 686 F.3d 529, 531 (8th Cir. 2012) (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466  U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984)). The defendant must overcome the ""strong presumption"" that  his counsel provided reasonable assistance. Id. Overcoming that presumption requires a showing that, ""in light of  all the circumstances, the lawyer's performance was outside the range of professionally competent assistance.""  Cox v. Norris, 133 F.3d 565, 573 (8th Cir. 1997). If the defendant can show his counsel's performance was  inadequate, [*4]  he then must show that, but for the deficient performance, the outcome of his case would have  been different. Id. Paul argues that his trial and appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by: (1) failing to challenge  the Third Superseding Indictment [Docket No. 89]; (2) failing to assert prosecutorial misconduct; (3) failing to file a  pretrial severance motion; (4) failing to object to the Jury Instructions and Verdict Form; (5) failing to challenge §  1591(a) as unconstitutionally vague; and (6) advising Paul to stipulate to the interstate commerce element of  Counts I-III. 1. Challenging the Third Superseding Indictment Count I of the Third Superseding Indictment charged Paul with using ""force, fraud, and coercion"" to traffic Z.S.,  ""who had not yet attained the age of 14 years . . . all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591(a),  1591(b)(1), 1591(c), 1594(a), 1594(c), and 2."" Count II charged Paul with using ""force, fraud, and coercion"" to traffic  K.J., ""who had not yet attained the age of 18 years . . . all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections  1591(a), 1591(b)(1), 1591(c), 1594(a), 1594(c), and 2."" Count III charged Paul with using ""force, fraud, and  coercion"" to traffic A.S., all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591(a), 1591(b)(1), 1591(c),  1594(a), 1594(c), and 2."" Paul argues his ""trial Counsel failed to conduct a proper inquisition [*5]  into who were the participants of the  alleged 'conspiracy' [under 18 U.S.C. § 1594(c)] and 'venture' [under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(2)] in Counts 1 and 2, by  not disputing it's [sic] lack of correlation to Paul's case."" Mem. Supp. [Docket No. 204] at 9; Reply [Docket No. 219]  at 2. Paul contends he was the only person indicted and charged with conspiracy to commit trafficking, and ""A.S.  was not mentioned in the charging instrument as being a co-conspirator."" Mem. Supp. at 7, 9. Paul argues that ""in  permitting the government to try the case on Conspiracy to commit Sex Trafficking of a Minor, the District Court  allowed the introduction of an enormous amount of evidence of the Substantive offense [of] 1591(a)(2)."" Mem.  Supp. at 7. This argument fails to recognize that because Paul was charged with the substantive offense of §  1591(a), evidence relevant to the substantive offense would have been admitted regardless of whether Paul had  also been charged with conspiracy to commit sex trafficking under § 1594(c). Paul has not demonstrated how  counsel's failure to challenge the Third Superseding Indictment as defective based on the conspiracy charge was  deficient, much less prejudicial, under the Strickland standard. Paul also contends his trial counsel [*6]  was ineffective for failing to raise duplicity and multiplicity challenges to the  Third Superseding Indictment. Paul's duplicity arguments are based on his contention that § 1591(a) includes two  separate crimes—sex trafficking minors and sex trafficking through force, fraud or coercion—and there was no  unanimous finding by the jury as to either crime. This argument was considered and rejected by the Eighth Circuit  on direct appeal. Paul, 885 F.3d at 1104-05. The Eighth Circuit held that ""the district court eliminated this risk of  non-unanimity by instructing the jury, and reflecting on the verdict form for Count I (Z.S.) and for Count II (K.J.), that  it must make separate findings whether Paul committed (i) 'the crime of sex trafficking of a minor,' and (ii) 'the crime  of sex trafficking by use of force, fraud, or coercion.' In convicting Paul of Counts I and II, the jury unanimously  found Paul guilty of both offenses against both victims. Thus, there was no duplicity."" Paul, 885 F.3d at 1105. Paul's multiplicity argument is that he should not have been charged for three counts of trafficking, because the  three individuals he trafficked ""were alleged to be transported at the same time on the same trip."" Reply at 10. This  argument fails because [*7]  each of the individual victims warrant a separate count of sex trafficking. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72619, *3 Page 4 of 7 Paul also argues that the Third Superseding Indictment was constructively amended, and that trial and appellate  counsel were ineffective for failing to challenge the constructive amendment. ""In cases in which courts have found a  constructive amendment of an indictment by virtue of the trial court's instructions to the jury, the instructions in  effect allowed the jury to convict the defendant of an offense different from or in addition to the offenses alleged in  the indictment."" United States v. Begnaud, 783 F.2d 144, 147 (8th Cir. 1986). Paul contends the Jury Instructions  and Verdict Form constructively amended the Third Superseding Indictment by stating that Paul was charged in  Counts I and II with using force, fraud, and coercion. Mem. Supp. at 15-16; Reply at 4-5. This argument is meritless  because the Jury Instructions and Verdict Form were correct. Counts I and II expressly charged Paul with sex  trafficking Z.S. and K.J. ""knowing that force, fraud or coercion would be used."" The Jury Instructions and Verdict  Form did not allow the jury to convict Paul of a different or additional offense beyond the offenses alleged in the  Third Superseding Indictment. Paul similarly [*8]  argues that the Government ""misled the Court that Paul was charged with Force, Fraud, and  Coercion in Counts I and II,"" and that as a result the Government was improperly permitted to introduce evidence of  Paul's sexual assaults on victims Z.S. and K.J. Reply at 5. Paul argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to  object to the admission of this evidence. Again, Counts I and II explicitly charge Paul with sex trafficking Z.S. and  K.J. through the use of force, fraud, and coercion. The evidence of Paul's assaults on Z.S. and K.J. was properly  admitted as direct evidence of the crimes charged. 2. No Prosecutorial Misconduct Paul claims that his trial and appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to assert prosecutorial  misconduct. Paul contends the prosecutor misled the grand jury into returning the First Superseding Indictment  [Docket No. 21], which added a sex trafficking charge for trafficking A.S. (Count III). Paul argues the initial  Indictment [Docket No. 15], which charged Paul with engaging in and conspiring to sex traffick Z.S. and K.J., was  based on a criminal complaint and affidavit that included A.S.'s name. Paul contends the prosecutor  subsequently [*9]  redacted A.S.'s name from the complaint and affidavit, and used the redacted materials to obtain  the First Superseding Indictment that added A.S. as a victim. Paul argues his counsel should have objected to the  Government alleging A.S. was both a co-conspirator and a victim. ""As a general rule, prosecutorial misconduct does not warrant federal habeas relief unless the misconduct infected  the trial with enough unfairness to render petitioner's conviction a denial of due process."" Louisell v. Dir. of Iowa  Dep't of Corr., 178 F.3d 1019, 1023 (8th Cir. 1999) (internal quotations and alterations omitted). Paul does not  explain how redacting a sex trafficking victim's name in grand jury materials is improper. Nor has Paul alleged that  the grand jury was somehow unaware of or confused as to the true identity of A.S. Paul also argues the Third Superseding Indictment constituted prosecutorial misconduct because it charged Paul  with sex trafficking by use of force fraud and coercion. Paul contends he ""was prejudiced because the government  repeatedly stated [during trial] that the defendant used force, fraud and coercion to cause all three of his victims to  engage in commercial sex actions."" Mem. Supp. at 30. This argument lacks any basis. Paul has not shown any prosecutorial [*10]  misconduct, much less misconduct that caused enough unfairness to  render Paul's convictions a denial of due process. Paul's counsel was not deficient for failing to assert prosecutorial  misconduct. 3. Pretrial Motion for Severance Paul also claims his trial attorney was ineffective for not filing a pretrial motion to sever Counts I and II (sex  trafficking minors Z.S. and K.J. using force, fraud, and coercion) from Count III (sex trafficking A.J. using force,  fraud, and coercion). Paul argues that the evidence in Count III had a ""spill over"" effect that prejudiced the jury's  judgment on Counts I and II. 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72619, *7 Page 5 of 7 Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a) states that ""[t]he indictment or information may charge a defendant in  separate counts with 2 or more offenses if the offenses charged . . . are of the same or similar character, or are  based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan."" The  offenses in Counts I and II were ""of the same or similar character"" and were ""based on the same act or transaction""  as Count III, because Paul sex trafficked all three victims at the same time and in each other's presence. All three  Counts were also parts of a ""common scheme or plan"" by Paul [*11]  to victimize young, vulnerable women. Trial  counsel's decision not to seek to sever Count III was neither deficient nor prejudicial as the severance motion would  have been without merit. 4. Jury Instructions and Verdict Form Paul also argues his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the Jury Instructions and Verdict Form. ""Jury  instructions are acceptable if, taken as a whole, they adequately apprise the jury of the essential elements of the  offenses charged and the burden of proof required of the government."" United States v. Brown, 478 F.3d 926, 928  (8th Cir. 2007). Paul argues the Court's Jury Instructions for Counts I and II were erroneous because they stated the wrong mens  rea requirement for proving Paul's knowledge of Z.S. and K.J.'s ages. The Court disagrees. The Jury Instructions  for Counts I and II track nearly verbatim the offense of sex trafficking a minor under § 1591, including the requisite  mens rea. Compare 18 U.S.C.A. § 1591(a)(1), (c) with Jury Instructions 10, 11, 14. Taken as a whole, the Jury  Instructions addressing Counts 1 and 2 ""adequately apprise the jury of the essential elements of the offenses  charged and the burden of proof required of the government."" Brown, 478 F.3d at 928. Counsel's lack of objection  to the Jury Instructions was not ineffective assistance [*12]  under the Strickland standard. Paul also argues that counsel was ineffective for not requesting a specific unanimity instruction or special verdict  form. This argument fails because the Eighth Circuit has held in this case that ""the district court eliminated th[e] risk  of non-unanimity by instructing the jury, and reflecting on the verdict form for Count I (Z.S.) And for Count II (K.J.),  that it must make separate findings whether Paul committed (i) 'the crime of sex trafficking of a minor,' and (ii) 'the  crime of sex trafficking by the use of force, fraud, or coercion.'"" Paul, 885 F.3d at 1105. 5. Constitutionality of § 1591(a) Paul argues his counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the constitutionality of § 1591(a) as unconstitutionally  vague. Paul claims § 1591 is vague because it lacks clarity as to whether the statute includes a single offense or  multiple offenses. The challenged statute provides: (a) Whoever knowingly— (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce ... recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains,  or maintains by any means a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture which has engaged  in an act described in violation of paragraph (1), knowing, [*13]  or in reckless disregard of the fact, that means of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion  described in subsection (e)(2), or any combination of such means will be used to cause the person to engage  in a commercial sex act, or that the person has not attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage  in a commercial sex act, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b). 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) (2012).   2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72619, *10 Page 6 of 7 ""A statute is void for vagueness if it: (1) fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is  prohibited, or (2) it is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement."" Paul,  885 F.3d at 1105. Paul does not explain how a person of ordinary intelligence would lack notice of what is  prohibited by § 1591, or how the statute encourages discriminatory enforcement. Moreover, the Eighth Circuit  concluded in Paul's appeal that although there may be some ambiguity as to whether § 1591 includes two separate  crimes—the crime of sex trafficking of a minor and the crime of sex trafficking by use of force, fraud, or coercion— the concern is not relevant here because ""the jury unanimously found Paul guilty of both offenses against both [Z.S.  and K.J.]."" Paul, 885 F.3d at 1105. Counsel's failure to challenge § 1591 as void for vagueness on [*14]  this  ground was not deficient or prejudicial. 6. Stipulation to Interstate Commerce Element Paul argues his trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance by advising him to stipulate to the interstate commerce  element of Counts I-III. At trial, the parties stipulated that various websites, hotels, and cell phone carriers were  entities ""affecting interstate commerce."" Trial Tr. Vol. III [Docket No. 166] at 652-654. The Government introduced  substantial evidence of Paul's use of these entities in the commission of his crimes. Paul argues ""no reasonable  counsel would have advised his client to lift the Government's burden of proof and stipulate to an essential element  of the offense."" Mem. Supp. at 52. A trial counsel's decision to stipulate to facts is a tactical decision. Edgemon v. Lockhart, 768 F.2d 252, 255 (8th  Cir. 1985). Matters of trial tactics do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel unless the chosen tactic is  ""wholly without reason."" Williams-Bey v. Trickey, 894 F.2d 314, 316 (8th Cir. 1990). Based on the evidence  presented by the Government that Paul used hotels, cell phone carriers, and websites in committing his crimes,  Paul's trial counsel was not deficient in advising Paul to stipulate to the interstate commerce element of the sex  trafficking offenses charged in Counts [*15]  I-III. If contested, the element would be readily susceptible to easy  proof by the prosecution. C. Rehaif Paul argues his convictions on all counts must be vacated under Rehaif v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2191, 204 L.  Ed. 2d 594 (2019). He contends that under Rehaif, the Government was required to prove that Paul knew his  conduct was unlawful. Rehaif involved a charge for unlawful possession of a firearm. The holding in Rehaif requires the Government prove  that a person whose prohibited status bars them from possessing a firearm know of both this status and his  possession of a firearm to ""knowingly violate"" the ban in 18 U.S.C. § 922(g). Id. at 2196-97, 2200. The rationale  behind the holding is that ""the possession of a gun can be entirely innocent,"" and ""[i]t is therefore the defendant's  status [as a felon or alien], and not his conduct alone, that makes the difference. Without knowledge of that status,  the defendant may well lack the intent needed to make his behavior wrongful. His behavior may instead be an  innocent mistake to which criminal sanctions normally do not attach."" Id. at 2197. Paul argues that under Rehaif, the Government was required to prove that Paul knew he had violated the material  elements of § 1591(a). He contends the Jury Instructions wrongly stated that ""the government is not required [*16]   to prove that the defendant knew his acts or omissions were unlawful."" Jury Instructions No. 14. This argument lacks merit. Unlike the statute at issue in Rehaif, the sex trafficking statute does not criminalize  otherwise innocent conduct. Paul's behavior in sex trafficking two minors and a 19-year old woman using force,     2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 72619, *13 Page 7 of 7 fraud and coercion was not ""an innocent mistake to which criminal sanctions normally do not attach."" Rehaif, 139 S.  Ct. at 2197. The jury was properly instructed that the Government need not prove that Paul knew his acts or  omissions were unlawful. Additionally, the Jury Instructions correctly declined to apply a mens rea requirement to  the interstate commerce element of § 1591. See United States v. Collier, 932 F.3d 1067, 1075 (8th Cir. 2019)  (holding that ""knowingly"" does not apply to the ""interstate or foreign commerce"" element of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1)). D. Request for Reduced Sentence Paul has filed a letter requesting that the Court reduce his sentence. He states that he has completed several  educational courses offered by the Bureau of Prisons and has rehabilitated himself while in custody. Paul also  states that the mother of his children is a health care worker, and that he desires to assist his family while they are  enduring the COVID 19 pandemic. The Court is hopeful that [*17]  the many educational and vocational opportunities Paul has afforded himself while  in custody will improve his remaining time in custody and allow him to find steady employment and lead a  productive life upon his release. The Court also recognizes that the current pandemic presents added difficulty and  stress to prisoners and their families. However, Paul has not identified an exception to the general rule that ""[t]he  court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed. 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c). The request for a  reduced sentence is denied. IV. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY The Court may grant a certificate of appealability only where a defendant has made a substantial showing of the  denial of a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2); Tiedeman v. Benson, 122 F.3d 518, 523 (8th Cir. 1997). To  make such a showing, ""[t]he petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court's  assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong."" Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S. Ct.  1595, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542 (2000). The Court finds it unlikely that another court would decide the issues raised in this  § 2255 Motion differently, or that any of the issues raised in Paul's Motion would be debatable among reasonable  jurists. Therefore, the Court declines to grant a certificate of appealability.",1
"United States v. Raniere, 55 F.4th 354","[*357]  JA.C, Circuit Judge: After a six-week jury trial, Keith Raniere was convicted  in the United States District Court for the Eastern District  of New York (Nicholas G. Garaufis, Judge) of numerous  counts related to his leadership of two organizations: a  self-styled  executive  coaching  and  self-help  organization called [**3]  NXIVM and a secret society  called ""DOS,"" an acronym for ""Dominus Obsequious  Sororium,""  a  phrase  that  roughly  translates  to  ""Lord/Master of the Obedient Female Companions."" At  trial, the Government presented evidence that Raniere  led both entities as pyramid organizations, and that he— alongside his ""inner circle""—committed, attempted, or  conspired to commit various crimes, including sex  trafficking, forced labor, identity theft, wire fraud,  racketeering, sexual exploitation of a minor, possession  of child pornography, and obstruction of justice. During  the lengthy trial, the Government also presented  evidence that members of the organizations recruited  and groomed sexual partners for Raniere, and that  numerous  women  were  coerced  to  engage  in  nonconsensual sexual acts with Raniere. On appeal, Raniere raises numerous challenges to his  various convictions. By summary order issued on the  same day as this opinion, we dispose of most of  Raniere's arguments (along with the appeal of Raniere's  co-defendant, Clare Bronfman). We write separately  here to address Raniere's arguments concerning his sex  trafficking convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 1591. Raniere's  arguments  turn  on  the  meaning  of  ""commercial sex act,"" [**4]  which the statute defines as  ""any sex act, on account of which anything of value is  given to or received by any person."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(e)(3). He principally argues that to qualify as a  ""commercial sex act,"" there must be a monetary or  financial component to the ""[]thing of value"" that is given  or received, and the sexual exploitation must be for  profit. We conclude that the statute has no such  requirement. Accordingly,  [*358]  we AFFIRM the  District Court's judgment concerning his sex trafficking  convictions.     55 F.4th 354, *354; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 33910, **2 Page 4 of 10 I. BACKGROUND In or around 2003, Raniere founded an organization  called NXIVM, a self-styled executive coaching and self- help organization. New members paid thousands of  dollars to attend self-help workshops. NXIVM members  referred to Raniere as ""Vanguard."" In 2015, Raniere created the secret society ""DOS,""  which was structured as a pyramid, with Raniere at the  head, followed by first-line ""masters"" and their  subordinate ""slaves."" ""Slaves"" were expected to be  obedient to their ""masters."" Apart from Raniere, all DOS members were women.  And Raniere's identity as the head of DOS was initially  concealed from newly recruited ""slaves,"" who were told  that the organization was a ""women's-only secret [**5]   society."" DOS ""masters"" recruited slaves mostly from NXIVM and  targeted women who were experiencing difficulties in  their lives. To join, DOS recruits were required to  provide ""collateral"" to prove their commitment to the  organization. ""Collateral"" took many forms, including  sexually explicit photographs and videos of themselves,  rights to financial assets, and letters containing  damaging accusations—whether true or untrue—about  family members and friends. DOS ""slaves"" were expected to provide their ""masters""  with services called ""acts of care,"" which included  buying them groceries, editing videos, cleaning, and  organizing. Each ""slave"" was expected to provide about                    an hour of work per week for her ""master"" as her  ""normal contribution."" In some cases, ""masters""  assigned their ""slaves"" to engage in sexual conduct with  Raniere and implied that collateral might be released if  the slaves refused. DOS ""slaves"" were also required to  be branded with a symbol that, unbeknownst to them,  consisted of Raniere's initials. During the branding  ceremony, participants were normally required to be  nude and to say, ""Master[,] please brand me. It would  be an honor, an honor that I want to wear for the [**6]   [re]st of my life."" Allison Mack—a DOS ""master"" and one of Raniere's co- defendants who pleaded guilty to racketeering and  racketeering conspiracy—recruited Nicole to join DOS  as a ""slave"" in February 2016. As part of that process,  Mack asked that Nicole provide ""collateral."" Nicole  provided a series  [*359]  of letters she wrote falsely  alleging sexual abuse by her father and other damaging  accusations, as well as a sexually explicit video of  herself. She was later required to provide additional  ""collateral,"" including credit card authorizations and the  right to her grandmother's wedding ring. Mack subsequently ""assigned"" Nicole to contact  Raniere and tell him that she would do ""anything that he  asked."" On May 31, 2016—while Nicole and Mack were  together in Mack's house—Raniere called Mack, and  Mack instructed Nicole to go outside so that Nicole  would meet Raniere ""across the grass"" from the house's  backdoor. Raniere subsequently blindfolded Nicole, led  her into a car, and drove her to a house. He then led  Nicole—still blindfolded—through some trees and inside  a building. There, he instructed her to undress and tied  her to a table. Another person in the room, whose  identity was unknown to Nicole, [**7]  performed oral  sex on Nicole. Nicole subsequently told Mack about the  incident, and Mack called Nicole ""really brave."" Nicole had additional sexual encounters with Raniere  during her time as a DOS ""slave."" Mack regularly  required Nicole and other ""slaves"" to pose for nude  photographs, including close-up photographs of their  genitalia. Nicole also performed uncompensated work  for Mack, including transcribing tapes and reviewing  articles. Mack also recruited another ""slave,"" India, who in turn  recruited a second-order ""slave"" named Jay. Jay  provided ""collateral"" to India, including a sex tape and a    55 F.4th 354, *358; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 33910, **4 Page 5 of 10 video describing abuse to which she was subjected as a  child. She provided further ""collateral"" on a monthly  basis. Jay was required to perform uncompensated services  for Mack, including cleaning her house, doing her  laundry, and picking up her groceries. She was also  required  to  transcribe  certain  videos  without  compensation. In addition, Mack gave Jay a ""special  assignment"" to ""seduce"" Raniere and ""have him take a  naked picture"" of Jay; Jay understood this assignment  to include having sex with Raniere. Jay refused to carry  out the assignment and decided to leave DOS. After Raniere and several [**8]  members of his ""inner  circle"" were indicted, each of Raniere's co-defendants  pleaded guilty to various crimes. Following a six-week  jury trial before Judge Garaufis, Raniere was convicted  of: racketeering conspiracy (Count 1); racketeering  (Count 2); forced labor conspiracy (Count 3); wire fraud  conspiracy (Count 4); sex trafficking conspiracy (Count  5); sex trafficking of Nicole (Count 6); and attempted sex  trafficking of Jay (Count 7). In support of their guilty  finding for Count 2, the jury found that the Government  had proved that Raniere had engaged in all of the  alleged racketeering acts: four acts of conspiracy to  commit identity theft, two acts of identity theft,  conspiracy to unlawfully possess an identification  document, two acts of sexual exploitation of a child,  possession of child pornography, conspiracy to alter  records for use in an official proceeding, trafficking for  labor and services, document servitude, extortion, sex  trafficking of Nicole,  [*360]  and forced labor. The  District Court sentenced Raniere principally to 120  years' imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.               II. DISCUSSION We dispose of most of Raniere's arguments on appeal  in a summary order filed simultaneously herewith. We  write separately in this opinion to address Raniere's  argument that a ""commercial sex act""—statutorily  defined as ""any sex act, on account of which anything of  value is given to or received by any person,"" 18 U.S.C.  § 1591(e)(3)—must involve the exchange of monetary  or financial benefits. We first address the statutory text  before turning to Raniere's specific challenges. A. ""Commercial Sex Act"" Congress enacted the statute at the center of this  appeal, 18 U.S.C. § 1591, as part of the Trafficking  Victims Protection Act of 2000 (""TVPA""), Pub. L. No.  106-386, 114 Stat. 1464 (2000). HN1[ ] In passing the  TVPA, Congress's purpose was ""to combat trafficking in  persons, a contemporary manifestation of slavery  whose victims are predominantly women and children,  to ensure just and effective punishment of traffickers,  and to protect their victims."" [**10]  22 U.S.C. § 7101(a). In relevant part, Section 1591 provides for punishment  of any individual: (a) Who[] knowingly— (1) in or affecting interstate or foreign  commerce, . . . recruits, entices, harbors,  transports,  provides,  obtains,  advertises,  maintains, patronizes, or solicits by any means  a person; or (2) benefits, financially or by receiving anything  of value, from participation in a venture which  has engaged in an act described in violation of  paragraph (1), [while also] knowing[] . . . that means of force,  threats of force, fraud, coercion . . . , or any  combination of such means will be used to cause  the person to engage in a commercial sex act, . . . . 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) (emphasis added). Section 1591 goes on to define a ""commercial sex act""  as ""any sex act, on account of which anything of value is  given to or received by any person."" Id. § 1591(e)(3)  (emphasis added). The statute does not explicitly define  the phrase ""anything of value,"" and the scope of that  phrase is the subject of the present appeal. Raniere argues that Section 1591 ""was designed to  55 F.4th 354, *359; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 33910, **7 Page 6 of 10 punish  sexual  exploitation  for  economic  profit.""  Raniere's Br. 23-24; see also Raniere's Supp. Br. 9. He  therefore concludes that the phrase ""anything of value,""  as it is used in the statute, must mean ""economic  benefit[]."" Raniere's [**11]  Br. at 24. We do not agree. HN2[ ] We begin our analysis ""with the statutory text,  exhausting 'all the textual and structural clues' bearing  on its meaning and construing each word 'in its context  and in light of the terms surrounding it.'"" United States v.  Bedi, 15 F.4th 222, 226 (2d Cir. 2021) (footnote omitted)  (first quoting Wis. Cent. Ltd. v. United States, 138 S. Ct.  2067, 2074, 201 L. Ed. 2d 490 (2018); then quoting  Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 9, 125 S. Ct. 377, 160 L.  Ed. 2d 271 (2004)). Where, as here, a phrase is ""not  defined by statute, we normally construe it in accord  with its ordinary or natural meaning."" Smith v. United  States, 508 U.S. 223, 228, 113 S. Ct. 2050, 124 L. Ed.  2d 138 (1993). If we find that a phrase is unambiguous  and is ""coherent  [*361]  and consistent"" with the  statutory scheme, then ""the inquiry ceases."" Friends of  the E. Hampton Airport, Inc. v. Town of E. Hampton,  841 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Kingdomware  Techs., Inc. v. United States, 579 U.S. 162, 171, 136 S.  Ct. 1969, 195 L. Ed. 2d 334 (2016)); see also Matal v.  Tam, 582 U.S. 218, 137 S. Ct. 1744, 1756, 198 L. Ed.  2d 366 (2017) (rejecting a proposed ""resort to legislative  history"" as unpersuasive because a court's ""inquiry into  the meaning of the statute's text ceases when 'the  statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory  scheme is coherent and consistent'"") (quoting Barnhart  v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 450, 456, 122 S. Ct.  941, 151 L. Ed. 2d 908 (2002)). We start with the prefix ""any"" in the phrase ""anything of  value."" ""Read naturally, the word 'any' has an expansive  meaning, that is, one or some indiscriminately of  whatever kind."" Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S.  214, 219, 128 S. Ct. 831, 169 L. Ed. 2d 680 (2008)  (cleaned up). Our understanding of ""anything of value""              is thus guided by the expansive meaning of ""any."" See  United States v. Cook, 782 F.3d 983, 988 (8th Cir.  2015) (""The phrase 'anything of value' [in Section  1591(e)(3)] is extremely broad.""). In addition, we  observe  that [**12]   Congress's  definition  of  ""commercial sex act""—""any sex act, on account of  which anything of value is given to or received by any  person,"" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(3) (emphases added)— uses the word or prefix ""any"" three times. Congress's  repeated use of the word ""any"" in its definition  ""commercial sex act"" further supports an expansive  understanding of the specific phrase at issue here,  ""anything of value."" We have previously had occasion, albeit in other  contexts, to consider the remainder of the phrase. We  have clarified in those other contexts that the phrase  ""thing of value"" ""is generally construed to cover  intangibles as well as tangibles."" United States v.  Girard, 601 F.2d 69, 71 (2d Cir. 1979). In Girard, we  observed that all of the following are ""things of value"":  ""amusement,"" ""[s]exual intercourse, or the promise of  sexual intercourse,"" ""a promise to reinstate an  employee,"" ""an agreement not to run in a primary  election,"" and ""[t]he testimony of a witness."" Id.  (citations omitted). And in United States v. Maneri, we  held that the phrase ""thing of value"" includes  intangibles, specifically ""the opportunity for a sexual  encounter, in return for distributing child pornography"" in  the context of the advisory Sentencing Guidelines for 18  U.S.C. § 2252. 353 F.3d 165, 168 (2d Cir. 2003).  Although the statutory phrase [**13]  at issue here is  ""anything of value"" and not a misspelled version, ""any  thing of value,"" our earlier holdings on ""thing of value""  remain instructive. Indeed, adding the expansive prefix  ""any"" onto ""thing"" only underscores our understanding  that ""anything of value"" should be broadly understood to  include intangibles. A ""thing of value"" as it appears in  Section 1591 may be intangible. Finally,  and  consistent  with  our  expansive  understanding of the phrase thus far,  [*362]  we  interpret the word ""value"" to refer to ""a subjective, rather  than objective, concept."" Cook, 782 F.3d at 988 (quoting  United States v. Petrovic, 701 F.3d 849, 858 (8th Cir.  2012)). Stated differently, in the ordinary sense, we  construe the word ""value"" to ""focus . . . on the value  which the [recipient] subjectively attaches to what is  sought to be received."" Id. at 988-89 (quoting Petrovic,  701 F.3d at 858); see also United States v. Williams,  705 F.2d 603, 623 (2d Cir. 1983) (concluding that the  phrase ""anything of value,"" as it is used in the bribery  statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201, ""has consistently been given a  55 F.4th 354, *360; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 33910, **10 Page 7 of 10 broad meaning"" and that the district court correctly  construed the phrase ""to focus on the value that the  defendants subjectively attached to the items received"").  This conforms with the dictionary definition of ""value,""  which includes ""relative worth, utility, or importance."" 3  Webster's Third New International Dictionary [**14]   2530 (1976). HN3[ ] Bearing in mind these textual clues, we  conclude that, as it is used in Section 1591, the phrase  ""anything of value"" need not have a monetary or  financial component. Nothing in the statutory text  indicates such a requirement, and in fact, a natural  reading of the broad language used in Section  1591(e)(3) forecloses such a reading. Put another way,  for purposes of the statute, monetary worth is not the  sole measure of ""value."" See United States v. Nilsen,  967 F.2d 539, 543 (11th Cir. 1992) (discussing the  phrase ""thing of value"" as it is used in 18 U.S.C. § 876).  Accordingly, we hold that for sexual exploitation to be  actionable under Section 1591, it need not have been  conducted—as Raniere argues it must—for profit. B. Raniere's Arguments Turning to Raniere's specific arguments on appeal as  they concern his sex trafficking convictions, we find  none of them persuasive. a. Challenges to the Jury Instruction Raniere first argues that the District Court erred in its  instructions to the jury on the sex trafficking counts. HN4[ ] ""We review de novo a properly preserved  challenge to a jury instruction, reversing where the                 charge, viewed as a whole, either failed to inform the  jury adequately of the law or misled the jury about the  correct legal rule."" United States v. Capers, 20 F.4th  105, 116 (2d Cir. 2021) (quoting United States v.  Binday, 804 F.3d 558, 581-82 (2d Cir. 2015)). ""In  reviewing a jury instruction, [**15]  we 'examine not only  the specific language that the defendant challenges but  also the instructions as a whole to see if the entire  charge delivered a correct interpretation of the law.'""  United States v. Al Kassar, 660 F.3d 108, 127 (2d Cir.  2011) (quoting United States v. Bala, 236 F.3d 87, 94- 95 (2d Cir. 2000)).  [*363]  The District Court instructed the jury on the  ""element"" of sex trafficking as follows: The third element that the Government must prove  is that the Defendant knew that Nicole would be  engaged in a commercial sexual act. A commercial  sexual act is any sex act of which anything of value  is given to or received by any person because of  such sex act. HN5[ ] It is not required that the  victim actually performed a commercial sex act as  long as the Government has proved that the  Defendant  recruited,  enticed,  harbored,  transported,  provided,  obtained,  maintained,  patronized or solicited the victim for purposes of  engaging in commercial sex acts. A thing ""of value""  need not involve a monetary exchange and need  not have any financial component. The phrase ""any  sex act"" should be given its plain meaning and may  include any act performed with another for sexual  gratification. Jury Charge at 99-100, United States v. Mack, No. 18- CR-204 (NGG) (E.D.N.Y. June 18, 2019), ECF No. 728  (emphases added). Raniere's initial objection is to the first italicized  sentence above. In particular, [**16]  he disputes the  propriety of the District Court's usage of the phrase  ""because of"" and argues that the sentence should have  read: ""A 'commercial sex act' is any sex act on account  of which anything of value is given to or received by any  person."" Defendant Keith Raniere's Requests to Charge  at 64, 86, Mack, No. 18-CR-204 (June 7, 2019), ECF  No. 692-1 (emphasis added). He argues that the phrase  ""because of"" ""means only a 'connection to' or a  proximate causational relationship to,"" whereas ""on  account of"" ""underscores a quid pro quo."" Raniere's    55 F.4th 354, *362; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 33910, **13 Page 8 of 10 Supp. Br. 18. We find no error in the District Court's use of the term  ""because of."" Although the statute, 18 U.S.C. §  1591(e)(3), uses the phrase ""on account of,"" we find no  meaningful  difference  between  that  phrase  and  ""because of."" Raniere does not point to any authority  supporting his view of the difference in meaning  between ""because of"" and ""on account of,"" which we  understand to be virtually indistinguishable. Indeed, in a  different context, the Supreme Court has noted that  ""[t]he words 'because of' mean 'by reason of: on account  of.'"" Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 557 U.S. 167, 176,  129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009) (quoting 1  Webster's Third New International Dictionary 194  (1966)). As a result, the District Court's use of ""because  of"" neither [**17]  failed to inform the jury adequately of  the law nor misled the jury about the correct legal rule. Raniere next challenges the second italicized sentence  in the above jury instructions: ""A thing 'of value' need  not involve a monetary exchange and need not have  any financial component."" He argues that a ""commercial  sex act"" must involve the exchange of monetary of  financial benefits. For the reasons stated in Section II.A  of this opinion, ante, we reject his argument. As we  have concluded, the phrase ""anything of value"" need  not have a monetary or financial component, and the  actionable sexual exploitation need not have been  conducted for profit. The jury was neither misinformed  nor misled about the law. Accordingly, we find no error  in the District Court's instruction.  [*364]  b. Sufficiency-of-the-Evidence Challenge to  the Sex Trafficking Counts Next, Raniere challenges the sufficiency of the evidence  presented against him at trial concerning his Section  1591 counts: sex trafficking conspiracy, sex trafficking of  Nicole, and attempted sex trafficking of Jay. HN6[ ] When preserved, we review claims of  insufficient evidence de novo. Capers, 20 F.4th at 113.  When hearing a sufficiency challenge on appeal, we         make a ""limited inquiry tailored [**18]  to ensure that a  defendant receives the minimum that due process  requires: a 'meaningful opportunity to defend' against  the charge against him and a jury finding of guilt 'beyond  a reasonable doubt.'"" Musacchio v. United States, 577  U.S. 237, 243, 136 S. Ct. 709, 193 L. Ed. 2d 639 (2016)  (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 314-15, 99  S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979)). ""All that a  defendant is entitled to on a sufficiency challenge is for  the court to make a 'legal' determination whether the  evidence was strong enough to reach a jury at all."" Id. at  244 (quoting Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319). HN7[ ] It is no surprise then that a defendant raising a  sufficiency challenge ""face[s] a heavy burden."" Capers,  20 F.4th at 113 (quoting United States v. Ho, 984 F.3d  191, 199 (2d Cir. 2020)). Indeed, ""we must sustain the  jury's verdict if, crediting every inference that could have  been drawn in the government's favor and viewing the  evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,  any rational trier of fact could have found the essential  elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt."" Id.  (cleaned up). We ""may enter a judgment of acquittal  only if the evidence that the defendant committed the  crime alleged is nonexistent or so meager that no  reasonable jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable  doubt."" Id. (quoting United States v. Atilla, 966 F.3d 118,  128 (2d Cir. 2020)). In conducting our review, ""[w]e must analyze the  evidence in conjunction, not in isolation, and apply the  sufficiency test to the totality of [**19]  the government's  case and not to each element, as each fact may gain  color from others."" Atilla, 966 F.3d at 128 (cleaned up).  And ""[w]e must credit every inference that the jury might  have drawn in favor of the government, because the  task of choosing among competing, permissible  inferences is for the jury, not for the reviewing court."" Id.  (cleaned up). i. ""Anything of Value"" Raniere first argues that the Government failed to  provide evidence that ""anything of value"" was received  or given in connection with a sex act. We disagree. The Government did in fact present evidence at trial that  DOS ""masters,"" including Mack, obtained ""things of  value"" in connection with assigning their DOS ""slaves""  to engage in sexual acts with Raniere. For example, the  Government presented evidence that Mack was able to  maintain and strengthen her privileged position in the  DOS hierarchy because of the relationship between  55 F.4th 354, *363; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 33910, **16 Page 9 of 10 Raniere and one of Mack's ""slaves,"" Nicole. The  Government also presented evidence that Raniere set  an expectation that DOS ""masters"" would receive  approximately 40 hours of ""work"" per week from their  various ""slaves."" Gov. App'x 235 (testimony of Lauren  Salzman, one of Raniere's co-conspirators who pleaded  guilty [**20]   to  racketeering  and  racketeering  conspiracy). Moreover, those ""masters"" who were able  to recruit a sufficient number of ""slaves"" (and ""slaves"" of  ""slaves"") would qualify for a ""special position"" and  receive ""special privileges"" from  [*365]  Raniere. Id.  Furthermore, the Government presented evidence that  Raniere authorized certain payments to Mack for her  work as ""head trainer"" at the same time that Mack  encouraged  a  ""slave,""  India,  to  ""complete  [an]  assignment"" involving ""tak[ing] all her clothes off, while  [Raniere was] clothed, pos[ing] in the most revealing  way, and hav[ing Raniere] take a picture of her."" Id. at  1269, 1271 (emails between Raniere and Mack). Raniere argues that ""[m]aintaining a spot in the first line""  of DOS cannot constitute ""anything of value"" for  purposes of Section 1591. Id. at 1047 (Government  counsel's trial summation). But as discussed above, we  reject the argument that only the exchange of things  with monetary value can suffice for purposes of the  statutory definition of ""commercial sex act."" A privileged  position in an organization may constitute intangible  ""value."" And indeed, here, evidence presented at trial  demonstrated that the privileged position came with  direct benefits, including [**21]  free labor from the  ""slaves"" who were expected to perform ""acts of care"" for  their ""masters."" The evidence regarding the giving or receiving of  ""anything of value"" submitted at trial was neither  nonexistent nor meager. We conclude that the evidence  was strong enough to reach a jury and that Raniere was  afforded at least ""the minimum that due process  requires."" Musacchio, 577 U.S. at 243. We therefore  decline to disturb Raniere's convictions on these counts.  The Government did not fail to provide sufficient  evidence that ""anything of value"" was received or given  in connection with a sex act. ii. ""On Account of"" Next, Raniere argues that even if things of value were  given or received, they were not given or received ""on  account of"" a sexual act. The Government presented  evidence that on May 31, 2016, Raniere blindfolded  Nicole, ordered her to undress, and tied her to a table,  after which a third person performed oral sex on Nicole  in Raniere's presence. Raniere argues that the  Government failed to present evidence that Mack— Nicole's ""master""—received anything of value ""on  account of"" the May 31, 2016 sexual act. In another context, the Supreme Court has interpreted  the phrase ""'on account of' to ""require[e] a causal [**22]   connection between the term that the phrase 'on  account of' modifies and the factor specified in the  statute . . . ."" Rousey v. Jacoway, 544 U.S. 320, 326,  125 S. Ct. 1561, 161 L. Ed. 2d 563 (2005) (interpreting  11 U.S.C. § 522(d)(10)(E)). Similarly, we interpret the  statutory language in Section 1591(e)(3) to require a  causal connection between the sexual act and the  giving or receiving of anything of value. With that in mind, we conclude that Raniere's sufficiency  challenge lacks merit. At trial, the Government offered  evidence from which a reasonable jury could have  concluded that Mack's receipt of various things of value  were causally connected to her assigning her ""slaves"" to  engage in sexual acts with Raniere, including the May  31, 2016 incident. This included testimony that Mack  directed Nicole ""[t]o reach out to . . . Raniere,"" which  Nicole first did in April 2016 by email. Gov. App'x 747-48  (testimony of Nicole). The Government also offered  testimony that Nicole understood Mack's relationship  with Raniere to be the ""most important relationship"" to  Mack, and that, accordingly, Nicole understood that it  was ""important to [Nicole's] relationship with [Mack] to  make [Raniere] happy"" and that how Nicole ""related to  [Raniere] . . . reflected on [Mack]."" Id. at 764-65  (testimony of Nicole). Nicole understood [**23]  that she  needed to be ""well behaved"" in front of Raniere. Id.   [*366]  at 765. And Nicole kept Mack apprised of her  relationship with Raniere, including by informing her of  the May 31, 2016 incident. Id. at 760. She further  received  encouragement  from  Mack  to  ""make  [Raniere's] life easier."" Id. at 764. The Government's evidence purporting to establish that  Mack received things of value ""on account of"" her  assigning ""slaves"" to engage in sexual acts with Raniere  was neither nonexistent nor meager. Based on this  evidence, a reasonable jury could conclude that Mack's  privileged position in DOS was causally connected with  her ""assignment"" of Nicole to Raniere for sexual  purposes. As with the evidence that ""anything of value""  was received or given in connection with a sex act, the  evidence relevant to whether Mack received things of  value ""on account of"" her assigning ""slaves"" to engage  in sexual acts with Raniere was strong enough to reach  55 F.4th 354, *364; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 33910, **19 Page 10 of 10 a jury. Thus, we conclude that Raniere had a  meaningful opportunity to defend himself. iii. ""Coercion"" Finally, Raniere argues that there was no evidence that  the sexual acts were ""coerced"" as required by 18 U.S.C.  § 1591. The statute defines ""coercion"" to include  ""threats  of  serious [**24]   harm,""  18  U.S.C.  §  1591(e)(2)(A), and the statute in turn defines ""serious  harm"" to mean: any harm, whether physical or nonphysical,  including psychological, financial, or reputational  harm, that is sufficiently serious, under all the  surrounding circumstances, to compel a reasonable  person of the same background and in the same  circumstances to perform or to continue performing  commercial sexual activity in order to avoid  incurring that harm. Id. § 1591(e)(5). Nicole testified that she felt that she had ""[n]o choice"" in  complying with Mack's instruction to ""tell [Raniere] that  [she] would do anything that he asked [her] to do."" Gov.  App'x 756 (testimony of Nicole). She further testified that  she had submitted ""collateral"" to Mack in the form of,  inter alia, letters implicating her family members in  criminal activity, a sexually explicit video, and a letter  about a prominent former romantic partner that could  ""ruin [Nicole's] career."" Id. at 740. Nicole testified that  she understood that breaking her ""commitment"" to DOS  and her ""master"" would mean that her ""collateral"" would  be released. Id. at 746. Once again, Raniere has failed to persuade us that  there is insufficient evidence to sustain his convictions.  Any rational trier [**25]  of fact could have found  coercion beyond a reasonable doubt.",1
United States v. Robinson,"[*26]  JA.C, Circuit Judge: Defendant-appellant Devon Robinson appeals from the  January 26, 2011 judgment of the United States District  Court for the Eastern District of New York (John  Gleeson, Judge), convicting him, following a jury trial, on  two counts of sex trafficking of a minor in violation of  18 U.S.C. § 1591. On an issue of first impression, we  consider the appropriate construction of 18 U.S.C. §  1591(c), an evidentiary provision added by the HN1[ ]  William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008 (""TVPRA""), Pub. L. No.  110-457, 122 Stat. 5044 (2008), which provides that ""[i]n  a prosecution . . . in which the defendant had a  reasonable opportunity to  [**3] observe the [victim], the  Government need not prove that the defendant knew  that the person had not attained the age of 18 years."" 18  U.S.C. § 1591(c) (Supp. II 2008). We hold that this  provision, when applicable, imposes strict liability with  regard to the defendant's awareness of the victim's age,  thus relieving the government's usual burden to prove  knowledge or reckless disregard of the victim's  underage status under § 1591(a). We reject Robinson's  remaining evidentiary and sentencing challenges as  lacking merit, and therefore affirm the judgment of the  District Court. BACKGROUND On April 14, 2010, a federal grand jury returned a  superseding indictment charging Devon Robinson with  three counts of child sex trafficking in violation of 18  U.S.C. § 1591. Two counts proceeded to trial, both  relating to a single minor victim, Jane Doe, who was  born on April 5, 1991. These two counts corresponded  to the two versions of § 1591 in effect when Robinson is  alleged to have trafficked Jane Doe. Count One, as  renumbered at trial, charged sex trafficking  [*27]  of  a minor under the amended version of § 1591 and  covered the period from December 23, 2008, when the  amendments took effect, through April  [**4] 5, 2009,        702 F.3d 22, *22; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **2 Page 6 of 16 when Jane Doe turned eighteen. Count Two charged  sex trafficking of a minor under the preceding version  of § 1591(a) and covered the period from January 1,  2007 through December 22, 2008.                                              A. The Trial A jury trial commenced before Judge Gleeson in the  Eastern District of New York on June 21, 2010. During  trial, the government called Jane Doe—who at that time  was nineteen years old—to testify. After she invoked the  Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination  and was granted immunity, the government received  permission to treat her as a hostile witness. She testified  that she had run away from home on several occasions  in her early teenage years, and had dropped out of high  school at the age of seventeen. While in high school,  Jane Doe began to work as an exotic dancer at a strip  club and as a prostitute. She was arrested several times  for and convicted of prostitution in Queens, New York, in  2008 and 2009. Jane Doe testified that she met  Robinson through his sister two and a half years prior to  the trial and started dating him when she was  seventeen. She also testified that she  [**7] told  ""everybody"" that she was nineteen at the time.  Throughout the trial, Jane Doe insisted that Robinson  was her boyfriend rather than her pimp, and that he was  only living off of her income as a prostitute rather than  facilitating that line of work. The balance of the evidence against Robinson  consisted primarily of recorded statements. On July 18,  2008, Robinson made a videotaped statement to a  detective and an assistant district attorney (""ADA"") in  the Queens County District Attorney's Office, in which  he admitted that he had been staying with his ""girlfriend""  Jane Doe at the Courtesy Hotel in Hempstead, New  York, for about three months and that Jane Doe paid for  their room. The videotaped statement included the  following exchange: ADA: You gotta, the obvious thing[ ] [is] you got to  be real with us[.]  [*28]  DR: But I ain't gonna say I'm a pimp though.  But you know. ADA: You watch out for them and they give you  money[.] DR: They take care of me. Word[.] ADA: I think that's by definition a pimp[.]        702 F.3d 22, *27; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **4 Page 7 of 16 DR: (laughter) * * * DR: [Robinson admitted to having promoted  prostitution on an occasion in the past.] So I  stopped it. So I tried to do something else. You feel  what I'm saying? ADA: That's when you  [**8] moved on to the  prostitution. DR: Exactly. Tried to do something else. And  awright [sic], it worked for a little while. Gov't App'x 11. The prosecution also introduced thirty- five recorded telephone calls that Robinson made from  various detention facilities between July 20, 2008, and  April 10, 2010. As demonstrated in the following  excerpts, Robinson repeatedly implored Jane Doe to  make money for him: September 2, 2008: ""You're gonna make that bread  tonight, right baby? . . . . So you're gonna make  daddy happy when I call you in the morning?"" Id. at  29. September 7, 2008: ""Listen, every night, you give  [Robinson's grandmother] 200 f***ing dollars man . .  . . [J]ust make 200 tomorrow, give all that sh** to  my grandma man. . . . [T]onight, yo, you better on  some real sh** man, like these next 7 days man. 2,  4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. Yo man, that's 1400. 200 dollars  every mother f***ing day to my grandmother for the  next 7 days man."" Id. at 48, 50, 54. September 9, 2008: ""Can you please make me  happy baby? That's all, man. That's all I want you to  do man is just to get that money out for me baby. . .  . How hard is it, right? Every date that you go on,  right, when you finish with the date, how hard   [**9] is it to get the date to drop you off on 115?""  Id. at 58, 62. In other conversations, Robinson threatened Jane Doe  when she failed to deliver the money: September 16, 2008: ""Word to my mother . . . if my  grandmas have to bail me out, when I come home  I'm not f***in with you no more and I'm gonna beat  the sh** out of you . . . I'm gonna beat the sh** out  of you stupid slut a** man."" Id. at 101. September  26, 2008: ""I'm ready to send a bit** over there to  wash you the f*** up . . . . I said I'm ready to send,  I'm ready to send somebody over there to f*** you    up man. . . . All right, listen I'm gonna get the last  laugh man. Always remember that, when I come  home I'm gonna have the last laugh. Cause I'm  gonna beat the sh** out of your stupid a**. Word to  mother I'ma throw you in a f***ing garbage can and  let everybody know you ain't sh**. . . . [S]tupid bit**,  f*** you talking about[?] Yo, just make sure man  you get that money tonight man. And you take that  to my grandmother man on some real sh** man.""  Id. at 110, 113. October 4, 2008: Jane Doe: ""If I was to ever leave you, what  would you do?"" Robinson: ""Kill your a**."" Jane Doe: ""Didn't you use to say till death do  us part? . . . . What does  [**10] that mean?  You're gonna kill me before I leave right?""  [*29]  Robinson: ""Yeap, kill you."" Id. at 132. During other phone calls, Robinson discussed women  named ""Angie"" and ""Creame."" For instance, in an  October 11, 2008 call, Robinson told his cousin, Tykim,  that when he got out of jail, ""Creame is back in my  possession."" Robinson also said that he spoke to  Creame and that she was ""ready to come back to her  n***er"" and that Robinson told her ""just stay where  you're at though right now man I'll be home soon man.  You're coming back to a pimp."" Id. at 140. B. The Verdict and Sentence On June 24, 2010, the jury returned a guilty verdict on  both counts of sex trafficking of a minor in violation of  § 1591. The jury also found by special verdict that  Robinson (1) knew that Jane Doe was under the age of  eighteen, (2) recklessly disregarded that fact, and (3)  that he had a reasonable opportunity to observe Jane  Doe. On January 21, 2011, Robinson was sentenced  principally to 180 months of imprisonment on each  count, to run concurrently, followed by five years of  supervised release. Judgment was entered on January  26, 2011. This appeal  [**11] followed. DISCUSSION Section 1591 was first enacted as part of the  Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (""TVPA""),  702 F.3d 22, *28; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **6 Page 8 of 16 Pub. L. No. 106-386, 114 Stat. 1464 (Oct. 28, 2000),  the stated purpose of which was ""to combat trafficking  in persons, a contemporary manifestation of slavery  whose victims are predominantly women and children,  to ensure just and effective punishment of traffickers,  and to protect their victims."" 22 U.S.C. § 7101(a) (2002).  HN4[ ] The TVPA defined as ""severe forms of  trafficking in persons"" the two forms of sex trafficking  proscribed by § 1591—sex trafficking involving a  commercial sex act ""induced by force, fraud, or  coercion,"" or in which the person induced to perform the  sex act was under the age of eighteen. Id. § 7102(8)(A)  (2000). Under the TVPA, a conviction for child sex  trafficking under § 1591 required proof, inter alia, that  the defendant acted ""knowing . . . that the person has  not attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act . . . ."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a) (2000) (emphasis supplied). Section 1591  [**12] was amended by the William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2008 (""TVPRA""), Pub. L. No.  110-457, 122 Stat. 5044 (2008), which took effect on  December 23, 2008. Under the amended version of §  1591, a defendant could be convicted of child sex  trafficking upon a showing, inter alia, that he acted  ""knowing, or in reckless disregard of the fact . . . that the  person has not attained the age of 18 years and will be  caused to engage in a commercial sex act."" 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a) (Supp. II 2008) (emphasis supplied).HN5[ ]   The TVPRA  [*30]  also added a new subsection (c),  which provides as follows: In a prosecution under subsection (a)(1) in which  the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to  observe the person so recruited, enticed, harbored,  transported, provided, obtained or maintained, the                 Government need not prove that the defendant  knew that the person had not attained the age of 18  years. Id. § 1591(c) (Supp. II 2008). The proper construction of  the new § 1591(c) is an issue of first impression in our  Circuit. As noted above, Count One charged Robinson with sex  trafficking of a minor, in violation of the amended  version of § 1591, while Count Two charged him with  sex trafficking of a minor, in violation of the previous  version of § 1591. On appeal, Robinson primarily  contests his knowledge or reckless disregard of Jane  Doe's status as a minor. Specifically, Robinson argues  that his conviction should be reversed because (1) the  District Court erred by instructing the jury that he could  be convicted upon a showing that he had a ""reasonable  opportunity"" to observe Jane Doe, and (2) evidence was  insufficient to prove that he knew or recklessly  disregarded that Jane Doe was a minor. Robinson also  argues (3) that  [**14] the District Court erred by  admitting certain recorded telephone calls, and (4) that  his  sentence  of  180  months  was  procedurally  unreasonable. We address these arguments in turn. A. The Jury Instructions on Count One Robinson challenges the jury instructions on Count One,  which charged him with sex trafficking of a minor, in  violation of the amended version of § 1591. Robinson's  argument  focuses  on  the  statute's  mens  rea  requirement with regard to his awareness that Jane Doe  was a minor. The District Court charged the jury, in  relevant part, that ""[t]o prove Count One, the  government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt . . .  that [the defendant] knew that Jane Doe had not  attained the age of eighteen years, or he recklessly  disregarded that fact, or he had a reasonable  opportunity to observe Jane Doe."" Joint App'x 215. In  other  words,  the  District  Court  identified  three  independent ways of proving criminal liability with  respect to Robinson's awareness of Jane Doe's status  as a minor: (1) he knew that she was under eighteen,  (2) he recklessly disregarded the fact that she was  under eighteen, or (3) he had a reasonable opportunity  to observe her. On appeal, where our HN6[ ] review of jury  instructions  [**15] for legal error is de novo, United  States v. Kozeny, 667 F.3d 122, 130 (2d Cir. 2011), the  parties present two widely divergent interpretations of  the statute. Robinson argues that § 1591(c) is a  702 F.3d 22, *29; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **11 Page 9 of 16 conjunctive requirement, meaning the government must  prove both that he had a reasonable opportunity to  observe Jane Doe and that he recklessly disregarded  her age. In support of this view, he cites the only federal  decision addressing this question. See United States v.  Wilson, No. 10-60102-CR, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  75149, 2010 WL 2991561 (S.D. Fla. July 27, 2010),  report and recommendation adopted by 2010 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 83178, 2010 WL 3239211 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 16,  2010). In Wilson, the district court adopted the  magistrate judge's report and recommendation, which  stated that ""where the Government elects to proceed  under the reckless disregard level of mens rea, Section  1591(c) requires the Government to prove beyond a  reasonable doubt not only that the defendant acted in  reckless disregard [of the victim's status as a minor], but  also that the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to  observe the person recruited."" 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  75149, [WL] at *7.  [*31]  By contrast, the government defends the District  Court's instructions, arguing that the word ""knew"" in §  1591(c) refers to  [**16] knowledge and reckless  disregard, thus creating a freestanding alternative to  proving either of the mens rea alternatives in § 1591(a).  See Gov't Br. 43 (""The district court correctly read §  1591(c) to mean that the government need not prove  the knowledge element—whether under a knowing or  reckless disregard standard—in cases where the  defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the  victim."" (emphasis in original)). Robinson responds to the government's interpretation  by pointing out that the amended version of § 1591(a)  requires the government to prove ""know[ledge]"" or  ""reckless disregard,"" whereas § 1591(c) mentions only  that in certain circumstances the government need not  prove that the defendant ""knew"" that the victim was a  minor. Compare 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) (Supp. II 2008)  (defendant must have acted ""knowing, or in reckless  disregard of the fact, that . . . the person has not  attained the age of 18 years""), with id. § 1591(c) (Supp.  II 2008) (in certain circumstances, ""the Government  need not prove that the defendant knew that the person  had not attained the age of 18 years""). Based on this  discrepancy,  Robinson  frames  the  government's  argument as an unwarranted effort ""to  [**17] insert  language into a statute in the interest of achieving  symmetry."" Appellant's Br. 43; see also Duncan v.  Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 173, 121 S. Ct. 2120, 150 L. Ed.  2d 251 (2001) (""[W]here Congress includes particular  language in one section of a statute but omits it in  another section of the same Act, it is generally  presumed  that  Congress  acts  intentionally  and  purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.""  (quotation marks omitted)). HN7[ ] We must begin, of course, with the plain  language of the statute, and ""our inquiry must cease if  the statutory language is unambiguous . . . and the  statutory scheme is coherent and consistent."" Schindler  Elevator Corp. v. United States ex rel. Kirk, 131 S. Ct.  1885, 1893, 179 L. Ed. 2d 825 (2011) (alterations and  internal quotation marks omitted). ""The plainness or  ambiguity of statutory language is determined by  reference to the language itself, the specific context in  which that language is used, and the broader context of  the statute as a whole."" Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519  U.S. 337, 341, 117 S. Ct. 843, 136 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1997).  ""In interpreting the statute at issue, we consider not only  the bare meaning of the critical word or phrase but also  its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.""  Holloway v. United States, 526 U.S. 1, 6, 119 S. Ct.  966, 143 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1999)  [**18] (alteration and  internal quotation marks omitted). Or, as Justice Scalia  observed in another context, ""the words of a statute are  not to be read in isolation; statutory interpretation is a  'holistic endeavor.'"" Regions Hosp. v. Shalala, 522 U.S.  448, 466, 118 S. Ct. 909, 139 L. Ed. 2d 895 (1998)  (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting United Sav. Assn. of  Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Assocs., Ltd., 484  U.S. 365, 371, 108 S. Ct. 626, 98 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1988)). Robinson's interpretation is mistaken. The text and  structure of the statute do not indicate that § 1591(c)  imposes an additional element on top of the mens rea  requirement in § 1591(a). Quite to the contrary, §  1591(c) states what the government ""need not prove.""  18 U.S.C. § 1591(c) (Supp. II 2008) (emphasis  supplied). The better reading of § 1591(c) is that HN8[ ] the  government may prove that the defendant had a  reasonable opportunity to view the victim in lieu of  proving knowledge.  [*32]  In relevant part, § 1591(c)  reads: where ""the defendant had a reasonable  opportunity to observe the [victim], the Government  need not prove that the defendant knew that the person  had not attained the age of 18 years."" Id. Viewed in  context, the most natural reading of this provision is that  proof  that  the  defendant  had  a  reasonable   [**19] opportunity to observe the victim may substitute  for proof that the defendant knew the victim's underage  status. Because § 1591(a) requires proof of knowledge  or reckless disregard—not both—the government may  satisfy its burden by proving knowledge or the substitute  702 F.3d 22, *30; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **15 Page 10 of 16 for knowledge under § 1591(c). Accordingly, § 1591(c)  supplies an alternative to proving any mens rea with  regard to the defendant's awareness of the victim's age.  This reading gives force to the provision's obvious  goal—to reduce the government's burden where the  defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the  victim. This commonsensical understanding of § 1591(c) also  vindicates ""the cardinal rule that, HN9[ ] if possible,  effect shall be given to every clause and part of a  statute."" RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated  Bank, 132 S. Ct. 2065, 2071, 182 L. Ed. 2d 967 (2012)  (quotation marks omitted); see also Duncan, 533 U.S. at  174 (""It is our duty to give effect, if possible, to every  clause and word of a statute."" (quotation marks  omitted)). If Robinson were correct that § 1591(c)'s use  of the word ""knew"" did not remove the usual mens rea  requirement, then § 1591(c) would add nothing to the  statute.  That  is  because  by  including  reckless   [**20] disregard as one of the mens rea options, §  1591(a) already provides that a defendant may be  proved guilty without having known that the victim was a  minor. In sum, HN10[ ] the plain reading of § 1591(c),  and the only interpretation that preserves any meaning,  is that the provision creates strict liability where the  defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the  victim. Accordingly, just as the District Court instructed,  § 1591(a) and § 1591(c) provide the government with  three distinct options—prove beyond a reasonable  doubt that: (1) the defendant had knowledge of the  victim's underage status; (2) that the defendant  recklessly disregarded that fact; or (3) that the  defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the  victim. We are mindful that HN11[ ] criminal statutes are  generally construed to include mens rea requirements.  See Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 605-06,  114 S. Ct. 1793, 128 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1994); United  States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 437-38, 98 S.  Ct. 2864, 57 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1978). But that presumption  does not apply to sex crimes against minors, see  Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 251 n.8, 72  S. Ct. 240, 96 L. Ed. 288 (1952), at least when ""the  perpetrator confronts the underage victim personally,""  United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 72  n.2, 115 S. Ct. 464, 130 L. Ed. 2d 372 (1994).      [**21] Moreover, the presumption applies  [*33]  when  someone engages in ""otherwise innocent conduct,""  including constitutionally protected conduct, id. at 72,  and thus has little purchase for Robinson, who was  engaged in sex trafficking. See United States v.  Griffith, 284 F.3d 338, 351 (2d Cir. 2002) (""[A] defendant  is already on notice that he is committing a crime when  he transports an individual of any age in interstate  commerce for the purpose of prostitution.""); see also X- Citement Video, 513 U.S. at 73 n.3 (""Criminal intent  serves to separate those who understand the wrongful  nature of their act from those who do not, but does not  require knowledge of the precise consequences that  may flow from that act once aware that the act is  wrongful.""); cf., e.g., United States v. Feola, 420 U.S.  671, 684, 95 S. Ct. 1255, 43 L. Ed. 2d 541 (1975)  (holding that ""to effectuate the congressional purpose of  according maximum protection to federal officers,"" a  federal criminal statute punishing assaults against  federal officers ""cannot be construed as embodying an  unexpressed requirement that an assailant be aware  that his victim is a federal officer""). Our interpretation of § 1591(c) also maintains uniformity  with the other federal child-protective statutes that use  nearly identical language and that have been interpreted  to ""lack [ ] mens rea requirements with respect to [the  victim's] age."" United States v. Jennings, 496 F.3d 344,  353 (4th Cir. 2007). For example, in 18 U.S.C. § 2241  and § 2243—two provisions that punish sexual abuse of  children—Congress drafted subsections labeled ""[s]tate  of mind proof  [**23] requirement,"" which explain that  ""the Government need not prove that the defendant  knew"" the victim was a minor. 18 U.S.C. § 2241(d), §  2243(d). Courts have uniformly interpreted these                         702 F.3d 22, *32; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **19 Page 11 of 16 provisions as disclaiming mens rea requirements with  respect to the victim's age. See, e.g., United States v.  White Calf, 634 F.3d 453, 457 (8th Cir. 2011)  (addressing § 2243(d)); United States v. Ransom, 942  F.2d 775, 776 n.1 (10th Cir. 1991) (addressing §  2241(d)); see also Jennings, 496 F.3d at 352-53  (addressing both sections and applying the same  principle to § 2244); United States v. Juvenile Male, 211  F.3d 1169, 1171 (9th Cir. 2000) (addressing § 2241(c)).  Moreover, one of these provisions—§ 2241(d)— evidently was the template for § 1591(c). Having used  identical language, Congress obviously intended the  same principle to apply with respect to § 1591(c), thus  making the defendant's awareness of the victim's age   [*34]  irrelevant when the defendant had a reasonable  opportunity to observe the victim. Finally, we note that § 1591(c)'s drafting history further  supports  [**25] our textual analysis. The legislative  reform that culminated in the adoption of § 1591(c) in  the 2008 amendments began in the House of  Representatives with a bill that would have left  knowledge as the only mental state referenced in §  1591(a) but would have added the following provision:  ""In a prosecution under this subsection, the Government  need not prove that the defendant knew that the person  had not attained the age of 18 years."" H.R. 3887, 110th  Cong. § 221 (as passed by H.R., Dec. 4, 2007). The  House bill thus proposed to make the trafficking of  minors into a strict-liability crime with respect to a  defendant's awareness of the victim's age, even if the                            defendant never observed the victim. The members of  the Senate Judiciary Committee apparently disfavored  this strict-liability option and instead reported a bill  adding ""or in reckless disregard"" to the mens rea  requirement in § 1591(a). S. 3061, 110th Cong. § 222  (as reported by S. Comm. on the Judiciary, Sept. 8,  2008). The House then responded by passing another  bill, this time keeping the proposed mens rea language  from the reported Senate bill but adding the provision  that now appears in § 1591(c)—providing that when ""the  defendant  [**26] had a reasonable opportunity to  observe"" the victim, ""the Government need not prove  that the defendant knew that the person had not  attained the age of 18 years."" H.R. 7311, 110th Cong. §  222 (as passed by H.R. Dec. 10, 2008). This drafting  history helps clarify what is already apparent when  reading § 1591 in its entirety: The government need not  prove any mens rea with regard to the defendant's  awareness of the victim's age if the defendant had a  reasonable opportunity to observe the victim. Given this holding, we conclude that the District Court  did not err in giving the three-part jury instruction. HN12[ ] In a prosecution under § 1591, the government may  satisfy its burden of proof with respect to the defendant's  awareness of the victim's age by proving any of the  following beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the defendant  knew that the victim was under eighteen, (2) the  defendant recklessly disregarded the fact that the victim  was under eighteen, or (3) the defendant had a  reasonable opportunity to observe the victim. B. The Sufficiency Challenge Robinson raises sufficiency challenges on Counts One                  702 F.3d 22, *33; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **24 Page 12 of 16 and Two, arguing that the government failed to present  sufficient evidence that he either knew or recklessly  disregarded Jane Doe's minor status. HN13[ ] When  reviewing a sufficiency challenge, we will uphold the  judgments of conviction if ""any rational trier of fact could  have found the essential elements of the crime beyond  a reasonable doubt."" Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307,  319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979). As we   [*35]  have  [**28] often stated, this standard is  ""exceedingly deferential,"" to the jury's role as factfinder.  United States v. Hassan, 578 F.3d 108, 126 (2d Cir.  2008). ""In considering such a challenge, we must view  the evidence in the light most favorable to the  government, crediting every inference that could have  been drawn in the government's favor, and deferring to  the jury's assessment of witness credibility, and its  assessment of the weight of the evidence."" United  States v. Chavez, 549 F.3d 119, 124 (2d Cir. 2008)  (internal citations, alterations, and internal quotation  marks omitted). Robinson primarily argues that the evidence was  insufficient to prove his knowledge or reckless disregard  of Jane Doe's status as a minor because Jane Doe  testified repeatedly that she told Robinson, his family,  and ""everybody"" she was nineteen. When she was  arrested for prostitution, Jane Doe also told the police  she was nineteen; the police were able to determine her  true age only by producing her arrest record (or ""rap  sheet""). Robinson also cites the testimony of Donald  Smith, who worked at a hotel frequented by Robinson  and Jane Doe, and who testified that an African  American female staying with Robinson appeared   [**29] to be ""maybe 21, 22"" years old. The government responds by pointing out that  Robinson's ""reasonable opportunity to observe"" Jane  Doe was ""a highly relevant circumstance from which an  inference of knowledge or reckless disregard can be  drawn."" Gov't Br. 37. For example, in a call recorded on  January 5, 2010 (when Jane Doe was eighteen years  old), Jane Doe stated that she and Robinson had ""been  together"" every weekend ""for like three years."" In  another  conversation,  Robinson  and  Jane  Doe  discussed her birthday. The government argues that  even if people who interacted with Jane Doe on a short- term or casual basis could be deceived about her age,  ""it would strain credulity to suggest that someone who  had known her as long and as intimately as Robinson  would not have learned her true age."" Gov't Br. 39.    Finally, the jury had an opportunity to observe Jane Doe  testify at trial, when she was nineteen years old, and  also to view several photographs of Jane Doe taken  before she turned eighteen. The government concludes  that it was well within the province of the jury to find that  Jane Doe's appearance  [**30] and demeanor were  such that her status as a minor would have been  obvious to someone intimately involved in her life. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the  government, see Evans v. United States, 504 U.S. 255,  257, 112 S. Ct. 1881, 119 L. Ed. 2d 57 (1992), we  conclude that the record supports the jury's finding of  guilt on Counts One and Two. With regard to Count  One, it is uncontested that Robinson had a ""reasonable  opportunity to observe"" Jane Doe when he was causing  her to engage in commercial sex acts as a minor, and,  as explained above, that showing satisfies the  government's burden under the amended statute. See  18 U.S.C. § 1591(c) (Supp. II 2008). Therefore, we  reject Robinson's sufficiency argument with respect to  Count One. And, even if we disregarded § 1591(c), the  jury still had sufficient evidence under the amended  version of § 1591(a) to render its special verdict with  respect to Robinson's reckless disregard of Jane Doe's  status as a minor. A reasonable jury could conclude that  Robinson's ability to personally observe his underage  victim, especially given  [*36]  their intimate relationship,  put him on notice of an unjustifiably high risk that she  was underage. See note 9, ante. For the same  [**31] reasons, a reasonable jury also  could conclude, both with respect to the Count One time  period and the Count Two time period, that Robinson  knew that Jane Doe was under the age of eighteen at  the time he was causing her to engage in commercial  sex acts within those respective time spans. The  government's case rested on circumstantial evidence,  but HN14[ ] ""the mens rea elements of knowledge and  intent can often be proved through circumstantial  evidence  and  the  reasonable  inferences  drawn  therefrom."" United States v. MacPherson, 424 F.3d 183,  189 (2d Cir. 2005). In fact, ""[a] verdict of guilty may be  based entirely on circumstantial evidence as long as the  inferences of culpability drawn from the circumstances  are reasonable."" Id. at 190. Moreover, our role in  reviewing  sufficiency  arguments  is  ""exceedingly  deferential,"" Hassan, 578 F.3d at 126, because ""it is the  task of the jury, not the court, to choose among  competing inferences,"" MacPherson, 424 F.3d at 190  (quotation marks omitted). A reasonable jury could determine, based on the  702 F.3d 22, *34; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **27 Page 13 of 16 evidence of the relationship between Robinson and  Jane Doe, that during both relevant time periods  Robinson was aware of Jane Doe's status as a minor,  especially  [**32] given that their relationship began  before Jane Doe dropped out of high school during her  junior year. The jury also had an opportunity to witness  Jane Doe's appearance at trial in June 2010 when she  was nineteen, and based on that appearance jurors  could have inferred that Robinson knew that Jane Doe  was a minor both before and after the statutory  amendment in December 2008. See, e.g., United States  v. Brooks, 610 F.3d 1186, 1197 (9th Cir. 2010) (jury's  ""opportunity to consider [the victim's] appearance during  her testimony, at which time she was eighteen,"" was  among the evidence sufficient to show defendant's  knowledge that the victim was a minor). While this  evidence by no means required the jury to infer  Robinson's knowledge of Jane Doe's underage status,  looking at the evidence as a whole and drawing all  reasonable inferences in the government's favor, we  cannot say that no rational trier of fact could have found  beyond a reasonable doubt that Robinson knew that  Jane Doe was a minor. C. The Evidentiary Rulings Robinson also challenges the admission of recorded  telephone calls that included evidence of his relationship  with other prostitutes and evidence that he threatened  and used  [**33] force against Jane Doe. HN15[ ] We  review a district court's evidentiary rulings with  deference, ""mindful of its superior position to assess  relevancy and to weigh the probative value of evidence  against its potential for unfair prejudice."" United States  v. Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d 102, 131 (2d Cir. 2010). ""We  will reverse an evidentiary ruling only for 'abuse of  discretion.'"" Id.; see also In re Sims, 534 F.3d 117, 132  (2d Cir. 2008) (explaining that the term of art ""abuse of  discretion"" includes errors of law). 1. Evidence Regarding Robinson's Relationship with  Other Prostitutes First, Robinson argues that the District Court erred by  admitting several recorded telephone calls in which  Robinson discussed his former, current, or prospective  control of other prostitutes, including Angie and Creame.  Robinson  asserts  that  this  evidence  served  to  demonstrate  only  his  propensity  to  engage  in  prostitution-related  activity,  and  was  therefore  inadmissible  [*37]  under Rule 404(b) of the Federal  Rules of Evidence. In this case, the District Court held that the  conversations that made reference to other prostitutes  did not constitute ""other act"" evidence within the  meaning of Rule 404(b), and therefore admitted the  conversations as proof of the nature of the relationship  between Robinson and Jane Doe. In particular, the  District Court noted that ""a critical factual dispute"" in the  case was whether the relationship between Robinson  and Jane Doe could be ""characterized as the  relationship between a pimp and a prostitute."" Joint  App'x 97. The District Court concluded that the  conversations in which Robinson discussed other  prostitutes ""shed important light [on] whether or not  Jane Doe was a prostitute working with or for the  defendant."" Id. We find no error in that decision. HN17[ ] Evidence of  uncharged criminal conduct is not evidence of ""other  crimes, wrongs, or acts"" under Rule 404(b) if that  conduct ""arose out of  [**35] the same transaction or  series of transactions as the charged offense, if it is  inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the  charged offense, or if it is necessary to complete the  story of the crime on trial."" United States v. Carboni, 204  F.3d 39, 44 (2d Cir. 2000) (quotation marks omitted);  see also United States v. Quinones, 511 F.3d 289, 309  (2d Cir. 2007). Robinson argued at trial that Jane Doe  was his ""girlfriend"" and that he had no control over her  prostitution activities. Evidence that Robinson was in the  prostitution business and controlled prostitutes other  than Jane Doe was therefore ""necessary to complete  the story of the crime on trial."" Carboni, 204 F.3d at 44  (quotation marks omitted); see also United States v.  Curley, 639 F.3d 50, 59 (2d Cir. 2011) (holding that  defendant's  prior  uncharged  acts  of  abuse  demonstrated ""a pattern of activity that continued up to  the time of the charged conduct,"" and were therefore              702 F.3d 22, *36; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **31 Page 14 of 16 probative of the defendant's intent). Robinson also argues that, because he had stipulated  that he had ""promoted prostitution on an occasion in the  past,"" the District Court erred by failing to exclude the  conversations about other prostitutes as needlessly   [**36] cumulative and unfairly prejudicial under Rule  403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. But contrary to  Robinson's  assertions,  the  recordings  were  not  cumulative of Robinson's stipulation. The stipulation did  not ""complete the story,"" Carboni, 204 F.3d at 44,  because it did not demonstrate the context of  Robinson's conversations with Jane Doe, including Jane  Doe's awareness that Robinson prostituted other  women and her struggles to maintain a preferred status  among those women. Nor was the evidence regarding  the other prostitutes unfairly prejudicial. Indeed, that  evidence was no more inflammatory than the child   [*38]  sex trafficking charges involving Jane Doe. See,  e.g., United States v. Roldan-Zapata, 916 F.2d 795, 804  (2d Cir. 1990) (holding that prior act evidence was not  unduly prejudicial because, in part, it ""did not involve  conduct any more sensational or disturbing than the  crimes with which [the defendant] was charged""). We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its  discretion by admitting the recorded telephone calls  involving other prostitutes as direct proof of the charged  crimes. See Quinones, 511 F.3d at 309. 2. Evidence That Robinson Threatened and Used  Force Against Jane Doe Robinson further contends that the District Court erred  by admitting recorded telephone calls in which he  threatened, among other things, to beat Jane Doe and  to kill her if she were to leave him. Robinson argues that  this evidence was irrelevant because Robinson was  charged with sex trafficking of a minor—not with sex  trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion. We disagree.  Evidence of threats was relevant here because it  addressed the nature of the relationship between  Robinson and Jane Doe. A reasonable juror, for          example, could conclude that Robinson sounded a lot  more like Jane Doe's pimp than her ""boyfriend,"" ""lover,""  or ""best friend,"" when he threatened that, if she did not  have the ""f***ing money,"" he would ""beat the sh** out of  [her] stupid a** . . . [and] throw [her] in a f***ing garbage  can and let everybody know [she] ain't sh**."" Robinson's fallback  [**38] argument, that the threat  evidence caused him unfair prejudice, is equally  unavailing. The sole case Robinson cites in support of  his prejudice argument, United States v. Colombo, 869  F.2d 149 (2d Cir. 1989), is readily distinguishable. In  that case, we reversed a conspiracy conviction where  the district court admitted ""background"" evidence that  the  defendant's  co-conspirators  had  raped  and  sodomized a woman in the course of a robbery— despite the fact that the defendant was not present  during the sexual assault and did not know that it would  occur. Id. at 153. Here, by contrast, Robinson's threats  were not simply gratuitous evidence of violence offered  to show the ""background"" of the charged offense.  Instead, the evidence of these threats related to material  factual disputes at trial. On these facts, we conclude that the District Court did  not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of  Robinson's threats of using force against Jane Doe. D. The Sentencing Challenge Finally, Robinson contends that his sentence of 180  months  of  imprisonment  was  procedurally  unreasonable. HN19[ ] We review a criminal sentence  for reasonableness, which ""amounts to review for abuse  of discretion."" United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180,  187 (2d Cir. 2008)  [**39] (en banc). ""Reasonableness  review requires an examination of the length of the  sentence (substantive reasonableness) as well as the  procedure employed in arriving at the sentence  (procedural  reasonableness).""  United  States  v.  Johnson, 567 F.3d 40, 51 (2d Cir. 2009). A district court  commits procedural error where it fails to calculate (or  improperly calculates) the Sentencing Guidelines range,  treats the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, fails to  consider the § 3553(a) factors, selects a sentence  based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails adequately to  explain the chosen sentence. Gall v. United States, 552  U.S. 38, 51, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445 (2007). Robinson's entire sentencing claim rests on a single  word in the District Court's remarks at the sentencing  proceeding, as highlighted in the following passage: 702 F.3d 22, *37; 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24700, **34 Page 15 of 16  [*39]  The driving factors of this sentence have to  be, in my judgment . . . this very chilling, really,  ownership of [Jane Doe] by the defendant and the  threats . . . that he wasn't kidding around when he  said he was going to come home and beat her up,  the evidence in the conversations themselves that  he had done that in the past and she still came  back, and the use of that control to force them on  her, and  [**40] I mean force. I listened to her testimony. I mean, she was an  impressive young woman, I thought, but she was a  minor in the situation she was in and, make no  mistake about it, no matter what she says, she was  coerced as a minor to prostitute herself by this  defendant. That bundle of activity—the ownership of a person,  the threatening, the physical abuse, forcing them to  become a prostitute—is so much more worthy of . .  . condemnation expressed in the form of jail time  than most of the federal crimes we see. Joint App'x 261-62 (emphasis supplied). Robinson  contends that the highlighted word demonstrates a  ""significant procedural error,"" Gall, 552 U.S. at 51,  because there was no evidence that he forced Jane  Doe ""to become a prostitute"" in the first instance. We  disagree. The clear import of the District Court's  remarks, taken as a whole, was not that Robinson had  corrupted an otherwise innocent victim, but that he had  taken control of Jane Doe and forced her to engage in  prostitution. For example, the tapes contain numerous  conversations in which Robinson coerced Jane Doe to  prostitute herself when she was reluctant or unwilling to  do so. We find no error, procedural or otherwise, in the   [**41] District Court's commentary on the nature of the  relationship between Robinson and his victim, or in the  Court's sentencing decision.",1
"United States v. Smith, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217838","[*1] ORDER ON DEFENDANTS' JOINT MOTION TO  COMPEL DISCLOSURE OF VICTIM'S NAME, DATE OF BIRTH, AND CRIMINAL  HISTORY THIS CAUSE is before the Court on the Defendants  Xavier Latrell Smith and Jayla Denice Welch (""Defendants"") Joint Motion to Compel  Disclosure of Victim's Name, Date of Birth, and Criminal History, (""Motion"") ECF No. [75]. The  Government filed a Response, ECF No. [93], and  Defendants filed a Reply, ECF No. [100]. The Court has  considered the Motion, the Government's Response, the Defendants' Reply, the  record and applicable law, and is otherwise fully  advised. Defendants' Motion is granted. I. BACKGROUND Defendants are charged by Indictment with Conspiracy  to Commit Sex Trafficking (Count I), Sex Trafficking of a  Minor (Count II), Transporting a Minor to Engage in  Sexual Activity (Count III), Coercion and Enticement of a  Minor to Engage in Sexual Activity (Count IV),  Commission of Sex Offense by Registered Sex  Offender (Smith) (Counts V and VI). See ECF No. 1 CASE NO. 23-20122-CR-BLOOM [3].  Separate  Arraignments  were  held  for  the  Defendants on April 7, 2023, and June 13, 2023,  ordering all parties to comply with Local Rule 88.10  (Criminal Discovery). ECF Nos. [11], [34]. The Standing  Orders advised the [*2]  parties that upon a properly  filed Motion, the Court could order that responsive  discovery or inspection be ""denied, restricted, or  deferred."" Id. On April 21, 2023, and June 26, 2023, this Court  entered Protective Orders to protect the Minor Victim  from any public, or general disclosures. See ECF Nos.  [20], [38]. Provisions in the Protective Orders include:  Counsels for both parties shall not provide materials  subject to the standing order to any person unless  provide by the Order or with prior Court approval;  Defendants may only possess Confidential materials in  the presence of their counsel and as necessary to  prepare for the case; counsel for both parties shall only  refer to the victim as ""Minor Victim"" in any public filing or  under seal; counsel for the Defendants must ensure that  they or any necessary third party that obtains access  also receive a copy of this Court's Protective Order;  counsel for both parties must destroy or cause to be  destroyed all copies of materials responsive to this  standing order. Id. The Defendants now seeks an Order from this Court  requiring the Government to disclose the victim's name,  date of birth, and criminal history. The Defendants  Page 2 of 5 assert this information [*3]  is material to prepare their  defenses, complete their independent due diligence  investigations, and otherwise adequately prepare for  trial. Id. at 1. Defendants argue that Brady v. Maryland,  373 U.S. 83 (1963), Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S.  150 (1972), Local Rule 88.10(o)(2), the Federal Rules of  Criminal Procedure, and the Fifth and the Sixth  Amendments to the United States Constitution support  their Motion. Id. at 2-3. 2 CASE NO. 23-20122-CR-BLOOM The Government responds that Defendant's Motion  should be denied because the Defendants are not  entitled to Minor Victim's identity at this stage of the  proceedings and neither the United States Constitution  nor Rule 16 require the Government to disclose said  information. II. LEGAL STANDARD Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure ""is  the primary rule governing pretrial discovery in criminal  cases, and it 'spells out the materials the prosecution  must produce on the defendant's request.'"" United  States v. Russell, No. 22-20348, 2022 WL 17736195, at  *1 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 17, 2022) (quoting United States v.  Jordan, 316 F.3d 1215, 1249 (11th Cir. 2003)). In  addition to the discovery obligations embodied by Rule  16, a criminal defendant's due process rights obligate  the prosecution to disclose information that is favorable  to the defendant and that is material either to guilt or to  punishment. Brady v. Maryland, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963). Favorable evidence for Brady purposes includes both  exculpatory and impeachment evidence. See Giglio v.  United States, 92 S. Ct. 763 (1972); Jordan, 316 F.3d at  1253. But mere ""favorableness"" to the defendant is not enough to  qualify for Brady protections-the information must  also [*4]  be material. Evidence ""is material as long as  there is a strong indication that it will play an important  role in uncovering admissible evidence, aiding witness  preparation,  corroborating  testimony,  or  assisting  impeachment or rebuttal."" United States v. Lloyd, 992  F.2d 348, 351 (D.C.Cir.1993). In Giglio v. U.S., 405 U.S. 150 (1972), the Supreme  Court extended Brady to disclosure of impeachment  material. U.S. v. Singleton, No. 22-14048, 2023 WL  2164588, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 13, 2023). See Jordan,  316 F.3d at 1253. Under Giglio, ""[w]hen the reliability of  a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence,  nondisclosure of evidence affecting credibility"" 3 CASE NO. 23-20122-CR-BLOOM justifies a new trial. Giglio, 405 U.S. at 153-54. The  difference between Brady material and Giglio material is  that Brady information is exculpatory, meaning it ""relates  to evidence which directly tends to lessen a defendant's  guilt,"" while Giglio material is impeaching, meaning that  it relates to ""witness credibility type evidence of a collateral nature...  indirectly making it less likely that the defendant is  guilty."" U.S. v. Hopkins, 2008 WL 4453583, at *2 (E.D.  Cal. Oct. 3, 2008). The purpose of Giglio and its  progeny is ""to insure that the jury knows the facts that  might motivate a witness in giving testimony."" Brown v.  Wainwright, 785 F.2d 1457, 1465 (11th Cir.1986)  (quoting Smith v. Kemp, 715 F.2d 1459, 1467 (11th Cir.), cert.  denied, 464 U.S. 1003, 104 S.Ct. 510, 78 L.Ed.2d 699  (1983)). III. DISCUSSION Defendants assert that due process requires certain  evidence  be  disclosed,  specifically  exculpatory  evidence. Brady 373 U.S. at 87. Moreover, [*5]  Local  Rule 88.10(o)(2) requires that ""[d]iscovery which is to be made in connection with trial  shall be made not later than fourteen (14) days after the  arraignment, or such other time as ordered by the  court."" Id. Defendants asserts that this includes  identification of any government witnesses, promises of  immunity, preferential treatment, or other inducements  falling within Giglio 405 U.S. 250, as embedded in Local  Rule 88.10(d). In support, Defendants cite to Roviaro v.  U.S., 353 U.S. 53 (1957), that there is ""no fixed rule with  respect to disclosure"" rather, balance must be struck  between ""the public interest [] against the individual's  right to prepare his defense."" Id. at 629. The  circumstances of the case, possible defenses, etc., are  among the ""relevant factors"" that may be involved in the  balancing test. Id. One of the relevant factors is ""the possible  significance of the informer's testimony."" Id. Page 3 of 5 Defendants claim that here, Minor Victim is highly  significant to this case, and therefore 4 CASE NO. 23-20122-CR-BLOOM Defendants are likely more entitled to the disclosure of  her identity. ECF No. [75] at 3. Finally, Defendants' state that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments  of the United States Constitution compel disclosure of  Minor Victim's identity as it is essential to their defense.  ECF No. [75] at 2. The Government responds [*6]  that Rule 16 of the  Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure does not entitle  Defendants to Minor Victim's information. ECF No. [93]  at 7. For support, the Government cites to United States v. Fischel, 686 F.2d  1082, 1090 (5th Cir. 1982) (""discovery in criminal cases  is narrowly limited. . . [with] no provision for the  production of [witness] names""); United States v. Belfast, No. 06-20758, 2007 WL  9705938 (Apr. 26, 2007) (""[a]lthough [d]efendant may not have the right to a disclosure of  alleged victim's identity, [the] district court may compel  the Government to identify its witnesses in advance of  the trial to ensure the orderly administration of justice."")  (citing United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296 (2nd Cir.  1976)); and United States v. Green, No. 04 CR.424 (RWS), 2004  WL 2985361 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2004) (""A district court  may compel the government to provide [] a pretrial  disclosure of the identity of the government's witness []  in the exercise of the court's discretion"" but disclosure  ""should not be granted unless the defendant makes 'a  specific showing that disclosure is both material to the  preparation for his defense and reasonable in light of  the circumstances'"") (citations omitted). The Government argues that Defendants have failed to  make a proper showing to warrant disclosure. ECF No.  [93] at 8. The Government attacks Defendants' claim  that they cannot adequately prepare their defense  because the government has provided ""hundreds of  pages of materials"" yet ""much [that] has been made  available [*7]  has yet to be reviewed,"" thus Defendants'  argument is without merit. Id. Furthermore much of the  evidence is already contained within Defendants' cellular phones. Id. 5 CASE NO. 23-20122-CR-BLOOM The Government also contends that Roviaro, 353 U.S.  53 does not require the Government to disclose the  requested information. Instead, the Government ""has  the privilege to withhold from disclosure the identity of  persons who furnish information of violations of law"" to  pertinent law enforcement officials. Id. at 60. However,  the Government concedes that this privilege is not  absolute, noting that if the protected communication  does not reveal an identity, or if the identity has already  been disclosed, the privilege gives way. Id. at 60-61.  The Government points out that ""relevant factors"" in Roviaro serve as a balancing test  on disclosure of identity. Consequently, the Government  reasons that the existence of this balancing test directly  contradicts Defendants' assertion that the Government  is automatically required to disclose the Minor Victim's  identity. ECF No. [93] at 10. Regarding Local Rule 88.10(o)(2), the Government  points out that while the Rule requires that discovery in  connection with the trial be made no later than fourteen  days after arraignment, [*8]  the second clause allows  for differentiated timing: ""or at such other time as  ordered by the court."" The Government argues that if any information it has is  subject to Rule 16, this clause permits withholding the  information without running ""afoul"" of the rule. ECF No.  [93] at 12. The Government does not contend that it  filed a relevant motion as to Local Rule 88.10, or that  this Court made such a ruling. Regarding  Defendants'  Constitutional  claims,  the  Government argues that Defendants only make  superficial allegations as to Constitutional implications in  this case. Id. at [13]. The Government argues that as  Minor Victim's identity is not exculpatory, constitutional  protections are no implicated. Id. 6 CASE NO. 23-20122-CR-BLOOM The Government recognizes that if Minor Victim is  called to testify at trial, then her criminal history (if any  exists)1 would be discoverable under Giglio 405 U.S.  150 ""as materials that could be used to impeach her  credibility."" Id. at 13. Therefore, the Government has  agreed to produce such materials three weeks prior to  trial. Id. Here, the Government distinguishes production  Page 4 of 5 timing of impeachment materials from Rule 16 and  Brady materials, arguing that ""pure"" Giglio materials do not require immediate [*9]   production, rather, the requirement is a sufficient  amount of time for effective use at trial or closer to the  time of the witness' testimony. ECF No. [93] at 13. The  Government relies on United States v. Russell, No. 22- 20348, 2022 WL 17736195 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 17, 2022),  holding that ""the disclosure of 'pure' Giglio materials []  are not set in stone, and that as long as [d]efendant is  afforded enough time to use the materials effectively at  trial, 'there is no violation of his rights from deferring  production of this material until closer to the time of the  witnesses' testimony'"" (quoting United States v. Aiken,  76 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1344-45 (S.D. Fla 1999)). See  also Aiken, 76 F. Supp at 1344 (ordering pure  impeachment  materials  on  plea  and  immunity  agreements, records of convictions, etc. to be produced  within ten business days of that trial and allowing the  Government to make a further showing to defer  disclosure if needed). Defendants reply that the Standing Discovery Orders in  this case require disclosure, ECF No. [100] at 1,  compare ECF Nos. [20], [38]. Further the Government's  ""strained reading"" of 1 Minor Victim could not have consented to her  trafficking. Furthermore, transcripts of the Detention  Hearing as to Defendant Welch have on the record  alleged that Minor Victim asked Defendant Smith ""if she  made  enough  money,  whether  she  would  be  allowed [*10]  to go see her family."" ECF No. [58] at 8.  Furthermore, one of the alleged terms placed upon  Minor Victim by Defendants was a requirement that she  make one thousand dollars per week with all payments  going to defendant Smith. Id. 7 CASE NO. 23-20122-CR-BLOOM Local  Rule  88.10(o)(2)  would  mean  that  the  Government could simply withhold critical information  from Defendants ""and await an Order from the Court""  whenever they wish. ECF No. [100] at 2. Next, Defendants argue that Minor Victim's  identity is not privileged since she had ""a role in this  case."" Id. Defendants contend that the Government's  reliance on 18 U.S.C. § 3509(d) is misplaced as §  3509(d) provides that information pertaining to a minor  victim may be disclosed ""to persons, who by reason of their participating in the  proceeding, have reason to know such information."" Id.  at 3; see 18 U.S.C. § 3509(d)(1)(ii). Defendants agree with the Government that Roviaro  requires a balancing test to ""determine when the  Government's privilege must give way to a defendant's  right to prepare his defense."" Id. at 2. However,  Defendants assert that when disclosure is ""relevant and  helpful to the defense of an accused or is essential to a  fair determination of a cause, the privilege must give  way."" Roviaro, 353 U.S. at 628. Further, Defendants  argue that [*11]  Roviaro is analogous to this case as  the Supreme Court reversed upon a finding that the  Government failed to disclose the identity of that  informer, who was the soler participant other than that  petitioner. Id.; see also ECF No. [100] at 4. Defendants also attack the Government's reliance on  United States v. Russell, 2022 WL 17736915 (S.D. Fla.  Dec. 17, 2022) and United States v. Calderon, 127 F.3d  1314 (11th Cir. 1997). Defendants argue that Calderon  is distinguishable. In Calderon, the Government did not  possess the testimony in question (""there was nothing to  provide because the information was not 'in the  possession of the United States' within the meaning of  18 U.S.C. § 3500 or Rule 26.2"") Id. at 1335. In Russell,  the Government had already ""made certain advance  disclosures of Giglio [] material in response to  Defendant's [] requests. . . . [and had] produced the  criminal records of the two alleged adult victims, and that a background search on the  alleged minor victim did not yield any results."") 8 CASE NO. 23-20122-CR-BLOOM 2022 WL 17736195, at *4. Moreover, in Russell, the  Government did not have any additional materials  responsive to the remaining requests by that defendant.  Id. Nevertheless, that court noted that the Government  must ""continue to live up to"" its Brady obligations. Id. at  *5. Finally, Defendants contend that the Government's  argument on 18 U.S.C. § 3509, and reliance on Lewis,  2017 WL 750456 (S.D. Ga. Feb. 27, 2017) are  misplaced. [*12]  ECF No. [100] at 3. Lewis concerned a protective order against disclosure of  an alleged minor victim's identity during trial. 2017 WL  750456, at *5. As there are already protective orders in  place for Minor Victim, Defendants argue that Lewis is  unavailing.  Defendants  did  not  address  the  Page 5 of 5 Government's argument that disclosure of Minor  Victim's information is not reasonable per § 3509(d).  Defendants instead reiterate that § 3509(d) provides  that a minor victim's information may be disclosed to  persons who have reason to know ""by reason of their  participation in the proceeding."" § 3509(d); see ECF No.  [100] at 3; see also ECF No. [93] at 8. Furthermore,  Defendants point out that the protective orders as to  Minor Victim's identity satisfy concerns raised regarding  § 3509 and Lewis. See ECF No. [100] at 2; see ECF  Nos. [20], [38]. The  Court  finds  Defendants'  arguments  to  be  persuasive. Roviaro imposes a balancing test to  determine whether disclosure of privileged information,  such as the true identity of an informer, to determine  whether that privilege must give way to the fundamental  requirements of fairness. Furthermore, the Local Rules  dictate that if there are promises of immunity, leniency,  or other inducements within the scope of Giglio, the  Government  shall [*13]   disclose  those  to  the  Defendants. L.R. 88.10(d). Correspondingly, the Standing Discovery  Orders in this case make clear that ""it is the continuing  duty of counsel for both sides to immediately reveal [all]  material within the scope of Local Rule 88.10."" ECF  Nos. [11], [34]. 9 CASE NO. 23-20122-CR-BLOOM Finally,  Defendants'  argument  regarding  §  3509(d)(1)(A)(ii) is correct. The statutory privacy  protections for child victims allows for disclosure of a  minor's confidential information only to persons involved  in the proceeding who have reason to know of such  information. Of note, § 3509(d)(1)(A)(i) requires that  even with this limited disclosure, that information must  remain confidential, restricted, and secure. The statute,  along with the Protective Orders already entered, will  also guard Minor Victim from potential embarrassment  and harms. The  Government  must  provide  the  information  requested, specifically the Minor Victim's legal name,  date of birth, and criminal history, if any exists.",1
"United States v. Streb, 477 F. Supp. 3d 835","[*843]  ORDER DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL A jury convicted Defendant Kendall Andrew Streb of trading money and drugs for sex with underage girls,  distributing [**2]  controlled substances to minors, and unlawfully possessing drugs and guns in connection with his  other crimes. Streb timely moved for a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, contending a number  of discovery disputes, evidentiary rulings, and trial management decisions produced cumulative error in the  proceedings. [ECF Nos. 383; 400]. The matter is fully submitted, and the Court finds a hearing to be unnecessary.  See LR 7(c). Because the interest of justice does not require a new trial, Streb's Motion for New Trial is DENIED. I. BACKGROUND Streb was initially charged by criminal complaint on April 18, 2019, with one count of Sex Trafficking of a Minor, in  violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1) and (b)(2). [ECF No. 1]. He was later indicted by grand jury as part of a larger,  multi-party investigation on May 15, 2019, of the following charges: 477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *835; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **153730 Page 13 of 33 • Sex Trafficking of Children as to Minor Victim A (""MVA""), in violation of  [*844]  18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1), (b)(2)  (Count 12); • Distribution of a Controlled Substance to a Person Under Age Twenty-One as to MVA, in violation of 21  U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 859 (Count 13); • Sex Trafficking of Children as to Minor Victim B (""MVB""), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1), (b)(2) (Count  14); • Coercion and Enticement of a Minor as to MVB, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b) (Count 15); • Distribution of a Controlled Substance [**3]  to a Person Under Age Twenty-One as to MVB, in violation of 21  U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 859 (Count 16); • Possession with Intent to Distribute Methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) (Count  17); • Possession of a Firearm in Furtherance of a Drug Trafficking Crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i)  (Count 18); and • Unlawful User in Possession of a Firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(3) and 924(a)(2) (Count 19). [ECF No. 35 at 7-10] (sealed). Second and Third Superseding Indictments were later filed in the case, charging  Streb with additional counts of sex and drug trafficking offenses: • Sex Trafficking of Children as to Minor Victim E (""MVE""), in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1), (b)(2) (Count  26); and • Distribution of a Controlled Substance to a Person Under Age Twenty-One as to MVE, in violation of 21  U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) and 859 (Count 32). [ECF Nos. 95 at 14; 163 at 17] (sealed). Streb's trial was severed from those of his co-defendants and set to  commence on January 21, 2020. On the morning of trial, Streb brought to the Court's attention a recent disclosure by the Government informing  defense counsel of expenditures made for or on behalf of the minor victims in the course of pre-trial meetings and  preparation sessions (""Disclosure No. 1""). See generally Trial Tr. (""Tr."") 2-82, 116-23; 250-51. The [**4]   disclosure, appearing in the form of a letter dated January 19, 2020, provided: Throughout the pendency of the case, meetings and/or prep sessions were individually held with Minor Victims  A, B, and E. During these meetings and/or prep sessions, lunch was sometimes provided by staff with the U.S.  Attorney's Office, the Iowa City Police Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or other non-profit or  law enforcement agencies. Additionally, sometimes Minor Victims A, B, and/or E were provided items to help  them care for their basic needs, such as shampoo, body wash, soap, and basic items of clothing. Minor Victim  A was once given a gift card to assist her with purchasing school supplies. All of these items were provided by  either members of the U.S. Attorney's Office, the Iowa City Police Department, the Federal Bureau of  Investigation, and/or other non-profit or law enforcement agencies.  [*845]  [ECF No. 353 at 3] (sealed); see also Tr. 3. Noting the seriousness of the disclosure's timing two days  before trial and the vagueness of the letter's contents, the Court recessed and ordered the Government to produce  a more detailed accounting of the specific benefits given to each of the minor [**5]  victims. Tr. 8-14. When the  Court reconvened, the Government produced a bullet-point list detailing the expenditures alluded to in its original  letter and noted supplemental information about benefits that had not been previously disclosed; the list also  disclosed additional benefits the minor victims might have received in the course of the Government's investigation  and trial preparation that were not included in its January 19, 2020 letter (""Disclosure No. 2""). Tr. 14-22, 41; see  [ECF No. 353 at 7-8, 10]. The majority of the instances disclosed by the Government involved paying for meals and  transportation costs for the minor victims related to their grand jury testimony and trial preparation, while others  related to the purchase of necessities (such as clothes and toiletries) for their benefit. See [ECF No. 353 at 7-8].  These expenditures ranged from $3 snacks to, in one instance, $150 worth of clothes. See id. On at least one     477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *843; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **2 Page 14 of 33 occasion, one of the minor victims (MVA) had been given a total of $50 in gift cards to purchase school supplies. Id.  at 7. The Court declined to exclude testimony from the minor victims or postpone jury selection, but instead offered to  continue the proceedings as [**6]  a sanction for the Government's late disclosures. Tr. 20, 24-25. After consulting  with counsel, Streb declined a continuance and elected to proceed with trial. Tr. 24-29. That afternoon, after voir dire, the Court held a hearing outside the presence of the jury where the Government  produced a report authored by Detective David Gonzalez, the lead detective on the case. The report described the  expenditures made for or on behalf of the minor victims and the dates on which they were made in even greater  detail, while disclosing still more expenditures that were not included in either of the Government's first two notices  (""Disclosure No. 3""). [ECF No. 353 at 12-14]; see generally Tr. 40-110. Most of the funds, the Government  represented, came from non-profit organizations dedicated to helping victims of crime and the Iowa City Police  Department Association (""ICPDA""), while some of the money came from the victim coordinator for the Federal  Bureau of Investigation. [ECF No. 353 at 9, 15]. Additionally, the prosecutors and lead detective informed the Court  that they would, on occasion, pay for small items out of their own pocket. Tr. 65-66, 68, 69-71. In a professional  statement to the Court, [**7]  counsel for the Government represented that the timing of its disclosures concerning  these benefits conferred on the minor victims was unintentional, an inadvertent oversight due to the scope and  complexity of this multi-defendant, multi-victim investigation. Tr. 73-76. Streb again moved to dismiss the case as a  sanction for the Government's conduct or, in the alternative, bar witness testimony from the minor victims and law  enforcement officers who participated in the expenditures. Tr. 44-59; see [ECF No. 324]. Recognizing the problem with the Government's disclosure was not the benefits themselves, but the timing and  manner of their disclosure, the Court found there to be no bad faith in the Government's reporting  [*846]  of the  minor-victim benefits, deliberate attempt to supress the information, or intent to misrepresent the investigation. Tr.  41-43, 52-53. The Court denied Streb's motion to dismiss, finding dismissal or exclusion of witness testimony to be  too extreme of a sanction; but other approaches were appropriate to remedy the Government's untimely  disclosures. See Tr. 77-79. First, the Court promised to allow the defense ""very liberal"" and ""wide open"" cross- examination related [**8]  to the witness benefits, of both the minor victims and the investigating officers. Tr. 78,  109. And the Court promised to consider some kind of curative or limiting instruction to the jury about the timing of  the disclosures if provided by the defense at the close of evidence. Tr. 78. Finally, the Court agreed to forgive the  defense's untimely and insufficient expert witness disclosures and allowed Streb to present the expert testimony,  subject to the rules of evidence. Tr. 79, 103-04 (""[W]hat's sort of good for the goose is good for the gander.""); cf.  [ECF Nos. 291; 314]. After taking up other evidentiary issues and pretrial matters, Tr. 82-110, the case proceeded  to trial. The evidence and testimony presented to the jury established that Streb paid money and traded drugs for sex from  three underage girls between the ages of fifteen and seventeen years old from late 2018 to early 2019. All three  minor victims testified against Streb. MVB testified that from at least as early as November 2018, and continuing  through February 2019, Streb contacted her to pay for sex on numerous occasions. Tr. 871-73, 876-80. Each time,  MVB testified, Streb paid her money or gave her methamphetamine, [**9]  sometimes both, in exchange for  engaging in sexual intercourse with him. Tr. 876-77. MVB testified that Streb smoked methamphetamine every          477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *845; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **5 Page 15 of 33 time they met, and she would occasionally join in smoking methamphetamine with him. Tr. 882-83. Text messages  between MVB and Streb extracted from MVB's phone records, along with phone location data, corroborated MVB's  account of exchanges occurring on November 3, 2018; December 22, 2018; December 29, 2018; January 27,  2019; February 4, 2019; February 13, 2019; and February 27, 2019. See Tr. 961-991, 1031-1099; [ECF Nos. 381- 33; 381-61; 381-62; 381-63; 381-64; 381-65; 381-66] (sealed). MVE was introduced to Streb by MVB after she asked MVB about a way to make money. Tr. 777-78. On  December 26, 2018, MVB arranged for MVE to meet up with Streb to exchange sex for money and  methamphetamine while MVB waited in the bathroom of the hotel room. Tr. 778-83, 787, 885-88. MVE testified she  told Streb she was seventeen years old prior to engaging in sexual intercourse with him. Tr. 780-87. MVB  arranged for MVE to meet up with Streb again on January 19, 2019, and Streb again paid MVE in cash and  methamphetamine for sex while MVB waited outside the hotel. [**10]  Tr. 789-795, 888-90. Streb solicited MVE a  third time on January 20, 2019. After picking her up from a gas station and driving to a nearby  [*847]  hotel, Streb  paid MVE, who performed commercial sex acts again in exchange for money and methamphetamine. Tr. 798-804.  MVE testified Streb smoked methamphetamine each time they met and that she smoked from his pipe on the  second and third occasions. Tr. 783-85, 795, 802. Text messages between MVB, MVE, and Streb, along with  phone location data, corroborated MVE's account of her interactions with Streb on those dates. See Tr. 667-99,  740-56; [ECF Nos. 381-23; 381-59; 381-60] (sealed). MVA also met Streb through MVB. MVB, she said, encouraged MVA to communicate with Streb about making  money by setting up a time and place to meet up with him for sex. Tr. 436-40; cf. [ECF No. 381-18] (sealed). MVA  testified that on December 29, 2018, Streb picked her up from Hills, Iowa, and drove to a hotel in Iowa City, where  he had rented a room. Tr. 440-47. On the way to the hotel, Streb stopped at a gas station to pay MVB a ""finder's  fee""-payment for setting up Streb with MVA. Tr. 447; see also Tr. 884-85. MVA also testified she told Streb she was  seventeen and [**11]  in high school as they talked in his truck on the way to the hotel. Tr. 445-446. When they  arrived at the hotel room, Streb smoked methamphetamine and assisted MVA in trying it. Tr. 448-54. Streb then  gave MVA money and engaged in oral and vaginal sex acts. Tr. 454-63. Text messages between MVB, MVA, and  Streb, along with phone location data, corroborated MVA's account of her interactions with Streb on December 29,  2018. See Tr. 293-330; [ECF Nos. 381-15; 381-58] (sealed). The jury also received evidence seized during a March 26, 2019 search of Streb's home and truck demonstrating  Streb had possessed firearms and controlled substances in a manner consistent with drug distribution. The search  revealed two loaded handguns in Streb's bedroom closet, and ammunition was found on Streb's nightstand and in  his truck. Tr. 634-51. A total of 4.5 grams of actual methamphetamine was also found in Streb's possession. Tr.  998-99. The search revealed a digital scale, razor blade, mirror, empty baggies, envelopes, and methamphetamine  in Streb's bedroom—all items indicative of drug trafficking. Tr. 626-33; see also Tr. 884. A pipe and eleven  individually-packaged baggies of [**12]  methamphetamine were found in his truck. Tr. 626-33. Streb's live-in  girlfriend, Nicole Lara, confirmed the firearms were Streb's. Tr. 1230-31. Lara further testified Streb gave her  methamphetamine and they would smoke it together. Tr. 1230-31; see also Tr. 661-64. Streb himself admitted to  owning the firearms and being a methamphetamine user in two post-Miranda interviews with police after the search  of his home. See Tr. 926-34; [ECF Nos. 382-10; 382-12]. The jury deliberated for less than three hours before finding Streb guilty of Counts 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 26, and  32; he was acquitted on Count 13. See generally [ECF Nos. 342; 344 (sealed)]. The jury found Streb to have        477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *846; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **9 Page 16 of 33 recklessly disregarded the fact that MVA was under the age of eighteen; recklessly disregarded the fact that MVB  was under the age of eighteen and had a reasonable opportunity observe MVB; and knew MVE was under the age   [*848]  of eighteen, recklessly disregarded that fact, and had a reasonable opportunity to observe MVE. [ECF No.  344 at 3, 7, 11] (sealed). Presently, Streb urges the Court to grant him a new trial. [ECF No. 383]. He claims a number of errors in the  proceedings, individually or cumulatively, demand that [**13]  he receive a new trial in the interest of justice. II. STANDARD OF REVIEW HN1[ ] Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 allows the district court to grant a new trial upon the defendant's  motion ""if the interest of justice so requires."" Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a). When evaluating the proceedings for  procedural defect, the ""interest of justice"" standard ""requires the district court to balance the alleged errors against  the record as a whole and evaluate the fairness of the trial."" United States v. McBride, 862 F.2d 1316, 1319 (8th  Cir. 1988). ""Under Rule 33, the district court is permitted to 'weigh the evidence, disbelieve witnesses, and grant a  new trial even where there is substantial evidence to sustain the verdict.'"" United States v. McClellon, 578 F.3d 846,  857 (8th Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 1132 (2010) (quoting United States v. Starr, 533 F.3d 985, 999 (8th Cir.  2008)). But a defendant is entitled to a fair trial, not a perfect one, McBride, 862 F.2d at 1320; except in  extraordinary instances, relief is limited where the alleged error is harmless and the substantial rights of the  defendant were not affected. Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a) (""Any error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect  substantial rights must be disregarded.""); see United States v. Arrington, 215 F.3d 855, 857 (8th Cir. 2000); 3  Charles Alan Wright, Federal Practice & Procedure § 581 & n.5 (4th ed.). The decision whether to grant a new trial,  or not, lies within the sound discretion of the district court. United States v. Van Kirk, 935 F.2d 932, 935 (8th Cir.  1991); McBride, 862 F.2d at 1320. III. DISCUSSION Streb raises thirteen discrete complaints about [**14]  the proceedings against him that can be broken down into  three categories: discovery disputes, evidentiary rulings, and trial management decisions. Viewed cumulatively or in  isolation, he argues the circumstances surrounding his prosecution deprived him of a fair trial and provide grounds  to receive a new one in the interest of justice. A. Discovery Disputes HN3[ ] It is important to note at the outset that ""[c]riminal defendants do not have a general constitutional right to  discovery."" United States v. Johnson, 228 F.3d 920, 924 (8th Cir. 2000) (citing Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U.S.  545, 559, 97 S. Ct. 837, 51 L. Ed. 2d 30 (1977)). Nor does the Constitution ""require the prosecutor to share all  useful information with the defendant."" United States v. Ruiz, 536 U.S. 622, 629, 122 S. Ct. 2450, 153 L. Ed. 2d 586  (2002). ""That being said, due process and notions of fair play require the government to disclose all evidence that is  'favorable to an accused' and 'material either to guilt or to punishment.'"" United States v. Sandoval-Rodriguez, 452  F.3d 984, 990 (8th Cir. 2006) (quoting Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963)).  A defendant must otherwise point to a statute, rule of criminal procedure, or negotiated discovery agreement to  obtain  [*849]  material from the government. Johnson, 228 F.3d at 924. And where discovery violations exist,  district courts have broad discretion in imposing sanctions on the Government to right the wrong done to a  defendant. United States v. Polk, 715 F.3d 238, 250 (8th Cir. 2013); United States v. Davis, 244 F.3d 666, 670 (8th  Cir. 2001); see generally Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(d)(2). With these principles in mind, the Court examines each of Streb's discovery [**15]  complaints: (1) the  Government's disclosure of benefits given to the minor victim witnesses two day before trial; (2) the timing of the      477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *847; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **12 Page 17 of 33 Government's disclosure of its Rule 1006 cell phone location data summary exhibits; (3) the defense's access to  records pertaining to MVB; and (4) the number of the Government's discovery disclosures and their manner of  production. 1. Benefits to minor victim witnesses The Court first turns to the Government's disclosure of expenditures made for or on behalf of the minor victims set  to testify against Streb during the course of its investigation and preparation for trial. Streb takes issue with the  timing of the Government's initial production of this information, as well as its series of incomplete disclosures after  the issue was raised the morning of trial. HN4[ ] ""[T]he suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused . . . violates due process where  the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the  prosecution."" Brady, 373 U.S. at 87. Exculpatory evidence also includes ""evidence affecting"" witness ""credibility,""  where the witness's ""reliability"" is likely to be ""determinative of guilt or innocence."" Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S.  150, 154, 92 S. Ct. 763, 31 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1972); see also [**16]  United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 677, 105  S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985) (""When the 'reliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or  innocence,' nondisclosure of evidence affecting credibility falls within th[e] general rule [of Brady]."" (alterations in  original) (quoting Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154))). ""The evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that,  had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A  'reasonable probability' is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome."" Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682;  see also Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 434, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995) (""The question is not  whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in  its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.""). ""The  government has suppressed evidence when it was otherwise unavailable to the defendant, and the prosecution  failed to disclose the evidence in time for the defendant to use it."" United States v. Santisteban, 501 F.3d 873, 877  (8th Cir. 2007) (citing United States v. Barraza Cazares, 465 F.3d 327, 334 (8th Cir.2006)). As the Court recognized prior to trial, the problem with the Government's production of information surrounding the  benefits conferred on the minor victims was threefold: the information was not revealed to the defense in a timely  manner; the Government's [**17]  early disclosures contained material omissions, and its final production was  ultimately inconsistent with its initial January 19, 2020 letter; and the extent to which the U.S. Attorney's Office was  involved in the charitable donations raised problematic ethical concerns. See Tr. 41-43. As evidence impeaching  the influence and motivation of testimony by his accusers, the Government's expenditures related to the minor  victims  [*850]  was clearly material to the defense, and Streb was certainly entitled to this information. See Giglio,  405 U.S. at 154. HN5[ ] But in this circuit, ""Brady does not require pretrial disclosure, and due process is satisfied  if the information is furnished before it is too late for the defendant to use it at trial."" United States v. Almendares,  397 F.3d 653, 664 (8th Cir. 2005); accord United States v. Farley, 2 F.3d 645, 654 (6th Cir. 1993) (""[D]ue process  requires only that disclosure of exculpatory material be made in sufficient time to permit the defendant to make  effective use of that material at trial. The government will fulfill its constitutional obligation by disclosure at trial  unless the defendant can establish that presentation of his defense was so prejudiced that he was prevented from  receiving his constitutionally guaranteed fair trial."" (citation omitted)). Nevertheless, the Court commanded  the [**18]  Government to gather and present paperwork related to these expenditures in order to fully procure the  material to the defense. Tr. 24. And despite the Government's piecemeal disclosures throughout the first day of the  proceedings, Streb ultimately learned of the benefits and their details prior to the presentation of evidence to the  jury. HN6[ ] Thus, to establish a due process violation, Streb ""must prove that the government's delay in disclosing  the information at issue deprived that information of its usefulness and that this deprivation materially affected the  outcome of his trial."" United States v. Spencer, 753 F.3d 746, 748 (8th Cir. 2014). Streb fails to meet this burden. He argues the timing of the disclosures, some of which occurred after the jury was  seated, prejudiced his preparation for voir dire and unfairly burdened his ability to incorporate the information into  his defense. Tr. 7, 55-59; [ECF No. 383-1 at 11]. As a sanction for the eleventh-hour nature of the Government's  disclosure, however, the Court permitted the defense ""very liberal"" and ""wide open"" cross-examination pertaining to  the expenditures, and counsel deftly questioned MVA and Detective Gonzalez about the benefits conferred upon  477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *849; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **15 Page 18 of 33 the minor victims throughout the duration [**19]  of the case. Tr. 78; see, e.g., Tr. 481-90, 1152-72. Streb did not  question MVB or MVE on the subject. See Tr. 1025. And while it is true that the Court found the Government's first  disclosure to be inconsistent with what was ultimately revealed by its second and third disclosures, and these later  productions did not come from the Government until after jury selection, the fact of the expenditures themselves  was available to the defense prior to jury selection and was not of such a nature as to drastically alter the course of  voir dire. Cf. Barraza Cazares, 465 F.3d at 335 (HN7[ ] ""[I]n general, the question of 'availability' under the Brady  test should not depend on counsel's ability to conduct an ongoing investigation after a trial starts.""). Moreover, Streb  was given the opportunity to more fully determine how the minor victim benefits played into his defense when the  Court offered him a continuance of the trial as an additional remedy for the Government's late and deficient  disclosures. He declined. Tr. 12, 20, 24-28. Streb cannot now say the Government's disclosures affected his  substantial rights. See United States v. Porchay, 651 F.3d 930, 941-42 (8th Cir. 2011) (""We agree that the  government should have produced this information before trial, but its inadvertent failure to [**20]  do so did not  require the district court to dismiss [the defendant's] indictment with prejudice.""); United States v. Boykin, 986 F.2d  270, 277 (8th Cir. 1993) (holding the defendant ""suffered little prejudice from the delay[ed]"" disclosure of  impeachment material because he was able to effectively cross-examine the witness about the witness's perjury).  [*851]  Still, Streb argues these sanctions were insufficient. According to Streb, he was prejudiced in the  presentation of his defense because he was limited in his questioning of Detective Gonzalez about the details of the  expenditures and the sources of their financing, and was denied an evidentiary hearing in lieu of the Court's own  inquiry into the matter. See Tr. 12, 1152-79; [ECF No. 383-1 at 8-9]; see also [ECF Nos. 324 at 3-7; 337 at 3-7].  Streb contends the minor victims' testimony should have been excluded entirely. HN8[ ] As the United States  Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has explained: In determining a suitable and effective sanction [for a discovery violation], a court must weigh the reasons for  the government's delay and whether it acted intentionally or in bad faith; the degree of prejudice, if any,  suffered by the defendant; and whether any less severe sanction will remedy the prejudice [**21]  and the  wrongdoing of the government. Davis, 244 F.3d at 670. Fashioning sanctions and remedies for discovery violations falls within the Court's  discretion when applying these factors. United States v. White Horse, 316 F.3d 769, 773-74 (8th Cir. 2003). Exclusion of the witness testimony is an extreme remedy and would not have been an appropriate sanction in this  case. The Government had not acted in bad faith in disclosing the expenditures to the defense and, as discussed  above, any prejudice suffered by Streb after accounting for the other sanctions provided by the Court was ultimately  minimal. See United States v. Amaya, 750 F.3d 721, 727-28 (8th Cir. 2014); Polk, 715 F.3d at 249-50; cf. United  States v. Sims, 776 F.3d 583, 586 (8th Cir. 2015) (affirming exclusion of incriminating DNA evidence not disclosed  by prosecution where lesser sanctions would not remedy prejudice to the defendant or secure future compliance by  the Government). Contrary to the defense's arguments, this case is not like United States v. Librach, 520 F.2d 550,  553 (8th Cir. 1975), where the court ordered a new trial based on the Government's failure to disclose that its  witness was in protective custody and had received almost $10,000 in federal payments, or Davis, 244 F.3d at 670- 71, where the court affirmed the exclusion of ""very convincing"" inculpatory DNA evidence that was disclosed mere  days prior to trial. In contrast to this case, Librach involved an ""egregious case of prosecutorial suppression of  evidence"" [**22]  where the Government granted immunity and paid an enormous sum to a witness even more  culpable than the defendant for his testimony; the minimal value of expenditures for food and necessities made to  crime victims in disparate situations here pales in comparison. 520 F.2d at 553; see also White v. Steele, 853 F.3d  486, 492 (8th Cir. 2017) (distinguishing Librach for its sizeable cash payments as an incentive for testimony with  financial assistance for temporary housing and relocation of eyewitness). And unlike Davis, the disclosure here was  not highly inculpatory evidence that was ""scientific and highly technical in nature"" making it ""virtually impossible"" to  conduct an effective defense after its last-minute production. 244 F.3d at 671-72. In both cases cited by the  defense, exclusion of evidence was the least severe sanction capable of remedying the harm done to the  defendant's ability to prepare his defense. Cf. id. at 672 (""As a general rule, a defendant who does not request a  continuance will not be heard to complain on appeal that he [or she] suffered prejudice as a result of late-arriving  discovery."" (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1178 (1st Cir. 1993), cert.  477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *850; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **18 Page 19 of 33 denied, 512 U.S. 1123 (1994))). The remedies provided by the Court, by contrast,  [*852]  were tailored to address  the specific harm suffered by Streb from the [**23]  Government's disclosures. See Amaya, 750 F.3d at 727. Given  the above, the Court is confident its admonition and order of remedial actions in this case will ensure future  compliance by the Government with discovery obligations and foster greater respect for defendants' Brady rights in  later criminal prosecutions brought within this district. Nor would the further inquiry sought by Streb have been proper, let alone consequential to his defense. The  questioning sought by the defense from Detective Gonzalez about specific line-item transactions on officers' credit  card statements or checks issued by the source of the funding would have offered no more relevant information  about the meals and supplies purchased on behalf of the minor victims to which Streb was entitled, and it would not  have revealed such additional detail capable of meaningfully enhancing its impeachment value. Tr. 1179-80.  Dwelling further on this matter would have unnecessarily delayed trial without the return of any substantive reward.  And the ultimate inquiry desired by Streb—the questioning of the United States Attorney, under oath, about the  Government's Brady disclosure policy and its practice in this particular case—is improper and [**24]  not a  legitimate area of inquiry. HN9[ ] The deliberative process of executive branch officials manifested through  expressions of opinion, advice, or recommendation in intragovernmental communications is protected from  disclosure by executive privilege. See In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 737-38 , 326 U.S. App. D.C. 276(D.C. Cir.  1997) (the ""Espy"" case); In re Franklin Nat'l Bank Sec. Litig., 478 F. Supp. 577, 581 (E.D.N.Y. 1979). Streb fails to  advance any authority showing he is entitled to put the United States Attorney on trial. Streb also takes issue with the benefits themselves. He argues the sanction imposed on the Government should  have been greater because 18 U.S.C. § 201(c)(2) prohibits giving anything of value, directly or indirectly, in  exchange for testimony and thus the expenditures made on behalf of the minor victims were manifestly improper.  See [ECF No. 381-1 at 11]. This argument, however, is foreclosed by United States v. Albanese, 195 F.3d 389, 395  (8th Cir. 1999). Joining the Tenth Circuit, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit expressly  rejected the argument that the federal bribery statute itself prohibits the giving of benefit or compensation to  witnesses testifying in criminal trials: This Court has consistently rejected the argument that the government violates § 201(c)(2) when it grants a  prosecution witness leniency for testifying. We also have a long history of allowing the government [**25]  to  compensate witnesses for their participation in criminal investigations. Id. at 394 (citations omitted). Even the initial panel decision by the Tenth Circuit originally expressing the contrary  view espoused by Streb was quickly vacated and rejected en banc. See United States v.  [*853]  Singleton, 144  F.3d 1343, 1344-52 (10th Cir. 1998), vacated and rev'd on rehearing, 165 F.3d 1297, 1298 (10th Cir. 1999) (en  banc) (holding HN10[ ] ""18 U.S.C. § 201(c)(2) does not apply to the United States or an Assistant United States  Attorney functioning within the official scope of the office""), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1024 (1999). Other circuit courts  of appeals have unanimously rejected the reasoning of Singleton's original panel decision. See, e.g., United States  v. Franky-Ortiz, 230 F.3d 405, 407 (1st Cir. 2000) (rejecting such a ""specious argument""); United States v.  Stephenson, 183 F.3d 110, 118 (2d Cir. 1999); United States v. Hunte, 193 F.3d 173, 174-76 (3d Cir. 1999); United  States v. Feurtado, 191 F.3d 420, 425 (4th Cir 1999); United States v. Condon, 170 F.3d 687, 688-91 (7th Cir.  1999); United States v. Smith, 196 F.3d 1034, 1038-40 (9th Cir. 1999); United States v. Lowery, 166 F.3d 1119,  1123-24 (11th Cir. 1999); United States v. Ramsey, 165 F.3d 980, 988-91, 334 U.S. App. D.C. 193 (D.C. Cir. 1999);  United States v. Haese, 162 F.3d 359, 368-68 (5th Cir. 1998); United States v. Ware, 161 F.3d 414, 418-24 (6th          477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *851; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **22 Page 20 of 33 Cir. 1998). Moreover, as noted by the Albanese Court, HN11[ ] at least one federal statute ""authorize[s] the  federal government to pay witnesses."" 195 F.3d at 395; see 18 U.S.C. § 3521(b) (permitting the Government to  provide services, including payments to meet living expenses, to individuals who testify for the federal or state  governments in criminal trials). As the Court explained on the record, and discussed above, the problem in this case  was not the fact that the minor victims were provided with benefits-""sandwiches or ice cream or given gift cards or  allowed to purchase school supplies""—but simply that [**26]  the Government did not adequately disclose their  details to the defense until the morning of trial after being ordered to do so by the Court. See Tr. 41-43. On the other hand, the evidence against Streb was formidable. The testimony of MVA, MVB, and MVE about their  encounters with Streb was corroborated by one another, as well as by cell phone communications between Streb  and the minor victims and their corresponding cell phone location data sufficient to establish that he had reasonable  opportunity to observe them. Streb's interactions with MVA, MVB, and MVE led the jury to conclude that, at the  least, he recklessly disregarded [**27]  their age. Besides clear evidence of drug distribution recovered from his  home, Streb admitted to using methamphetamine and possessing firearms, and Lara, Streb's girlfriend, confirmed  that he distributed the drugs to her and others. In light of all of the evidence demonstrating Streb's guilt on the  crimes for which he was convicted, Streb has not shown ""the government's delay in disclosing the information at  issue deprived that information of its usefulness and that this deprivation materially affected the outcome of his  trial."" Spencer, 753 F.3d at 748; see also Almendares, 397 F.3d at 664; cf. Smith v. Cain, 565 U.S. 73, 76, 132 S.  Ct. 627, 181 L. Ed. 2d 571 (2012) (HN13[ ] ""[E]vidence impeaching an eyewitness may not be material if the  State's other evidence is strong enough to sustain confidence in the verdict."" (citing United States v. Agurs, 427  U.S. 97, 112-13, 112 n.21, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 49 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1976))). 2. Rule 1006 phone location data summaries Next, Streb complains that the Government's disclosure of a video exhibit compiling raw cell tower information for  the phone locations of Streb and the three minor victims two weeks before trial on January 6, 2020 gave the  Government an undue trial advantage that prejudiced the defense's ability to adequately respond to the digital  evidence. See [ECF No. 383-1 at 3-5]. Government Exhibits 500 through  [*854]  509 converted this raw cell tower  data into a video of a [**28]  map displaying approximated locations for each individual and was used in conjunction  with text message communications between Streb and each of the minor victims to corroborate the girls' testimony  of the dates they met up with him to exchange sex acts for money and methamphetamine. [ECF Nos. 381-58; 381- 59; 381-60; 381-61; 381-62; 381-63; 381-64; 381-65; 381-66] (sealed); see also Tr. 562, 742, 963. Streb argues he  should have received the exhibit sooner in the discovery process in order to independently investigate its  consistency with the underlying data with a forensic expert. HN14[ ] Federal Rule of Evidence 1006 permits a proponent of evidence ""to use a summary, chart, or calculation  to prove the content of voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs that cannot be conveniently examined in  court."" Rule 1006 is an evidentiary rule, not one of discovery, and ""provides that only the underlying documents, not  the summaries themselves, must be produced to the opposing party."" Colón—Fontánez v. Municipality of San  Juan, 660 F.3d 17, 30 (1st Cir. 2011); accord United States v. Mazkouri, 945 F.3d 293, 301 (5th Cir. 2019)  (rejecting defendant's argument that the Government ""should have disclosed the summary charts earlier"" because  it ""has no basis in Rule 1006""); United States v. Lewis, 594 F.3d 1270, 1281-82 (10th Cir. 2010) (holding defendant  was not entitled to review Government's financial database because the ""underlying [**29]  documents"" Rule 1006  entitled him to ""[were] not the database but the bank records themselves; the database ""served only as an aid in  preparing the summary""); Fidelity Nat'l Title Ins. Co. of N.Y. v. Intercountry Nat'l Title Ins. Co., 412 F.3d 745, 753  (2d Cir. 2005) (HN15[ ] ""Rule 1006 requires only that the summarized documents be made available to the  opposing party at a 'reasonable time'; it does not say when the summaries must be made available to the party—for  that matter, it nowhere states that the summaries must be made available to the opposing party.""); Coates v.  Johnson & Johnson, 756 F.2d 524, 550 (7th Cir. 1985) (holding ""only the underlying documents, and not the  summaries, must be made available to the opposing party"" under Rule 1006); United States v. Foley, 598 F.2d  1323, 1338 (4th Cir. 1979) (rejecting argument that summary charts ""should have been made available longer in  advance of trial"" under Rule 1006 because the rule ""refers to making available the original documents, not the  charts themselves""). Rather, Rule 16(a) sets out the discovery to which a defendant is entitled and provides, in  pertinent part: 477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *853; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **25 Page 21 of 33 Upon a defendant's request, the government must permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or photograph  books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of  any of these items, if the item is within the government's possession, custody, or control, and: (i) the item is material to preparing [**30]  the defense; (ii) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-chief at trial; or (iii) the item was obtained from or belongs to the defendant. Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E). Except in instances not applicable here, the defense is not entitled to disclosure of  ""reports, memoranda, or other internal government documents made . . . for the government . . . in connection with  investigating or prosecuting the case."" Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(2); see also United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S.  456, 463, 116 S. Ct. 1480, 134 L. Ed. 2d 687 (1996) (holding a defendant ""may not examine Government work  product in connection with his case""). The cell phone location data summaries in Exhibits  [*855]  500 through 509  clearly constitute Government work product made by federal agents using cell phone data that had been previously  disclosed to the defense. The material is therefore sheltered by Rule 16(a)(2) and not subject to general pre-trial  discovery. See United States v. Meadows, No. 14-cr-251 (SRN/JSM), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165383, 2014 WL  6684977, at *4 (D. Minn. Nov. 25, 2014); United States v. Acarino, 270 F. Supp. 526, 527 (E.D.N.Y. 1967); cf.  Lewis, 594 F.3d at 1281-82 (holding notice requirement of Rule 1006 was satisfied where the Government made  the records underlying the summary available for review well before trial and all documents used to create it were  admitted into evidence). HN16[ ] Rule 1006 itself requires only that original or duplicate records underlying a summary exhibit be made  ""available . . . at a reasonable time and place."" [**31]  ""A reasonable time and place 'has been understood to be  such that the opposing party has adequate time to examine the records to check the accuracy of the summary.'""  United States v. Isaacs, 593 F.3d 517, 527 (7th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted); accord White Indus., Inc. v. Cessna  Aircraft Co., 611 F. Supp. 1049, 1070 n.10 (W.D. Mo. 1985) (""Ordinarily that 'reasonable time' [of Rule 1006] will be  at some point before trial, since the object is to give opposing counsel a meaningful opportunity to prepare  challenges to the materials; although it would be within the trial court's discretion to permit the matter to be dealt  with during trial.""). Here, counsel represent that the Government produced the records of the raw cell phone  location data to the defense on May 24, 2019 (phone records of Streb and phone extraction of MVB), June 21,  2019 (phone records of MVE), and December 12, 2019 (phone records for MVA and MVB). See [ECF Nos. 391 at  3; 400 at 2]. The Government first notified the defense of its intent to use Rule 1006 location mapping summaries of  this data in its December 31, 2019 disclosure of Detective Michael Smithey as an expert witness to introduce them.  [ECF No. 253 at 2-3]. The Government even produced drafts of the summary exhibits to the defense on January 6,  2020, see [ECF No. 294 ¶ 11], and listed the drafts in its initial exhibit [**32]  list on January 13, 2020, [ECF No. 296  at 12-13]. After reviewing the nature and timing of the disclosures, the Court finds Streb was afforded a reasonable  time to review the Government's summary exhibits in relation to the underlying data. See, e.g., United States v.  Mitchell, No. 1:15-cr-00040-JAW, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79168, 2016 WL 3406427, at *3 (D. Me. June 17, 2016)  (ruling disclosure of summaries one week before trial sufficient where defendant had cell phone records for over  one year); United States v. Pickel, No. 2:07-cr-21, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36433, 2007 WL 1452908, at *2 (E.D.  Tenn. May 17, 2007) (ordering disclosure of Rule 1006 summaries two weeks before trial where the defense  already had a copy of the underlying documents); cf. E.E.O.C. v. HBE Corp., 135 F.3d 543, 553 (8th Cir. 1998)  (ruling disclosure of Rule 1006 summary three weeks prior to trial was reasonable). The data concerned a finite  number of relevant dates for each minor victim, of which the defense had ample notice from the indictment and  other evidence disclosed in discovery. Without any explanation Streb contends the video summaries altered the character of the cell tower data disclosed  to him, creating new data which he was denied an adequate opportunity to review. [ECF No. 381-1 at 3]. He offers  no proof of such an allegation or concrete examples of how the summaries are inaccurate or erroneous. Streb had  sufficient time [**33]  to provide the underlying phone location records to an expert in order to evaluate the  477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *854; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **29 Page 22 of 33 summary's accuracy prior to trial. See [ECF No. 391-1  [*856]  at 1]. The defense extensively cross-examined  Detective Smithey on the summaries on three separate occasions, Tr. 580-611, 756-73, 991-97, and the record  does not indicate their accuracy is questionable. 3. Access to school records of MVB Streb also contends he was wrongfully denied access to MVB's ""juvenile records, applications to travel, counseling  records, [and] school records relevant to dates[,] times and places that could establish if the victims were in another  location at a particular time"" for purposes of cross-examination. See [ECF No. 383-1 at 13]; see also [ECF No. 261  at 1-2]. Streb was never so prohibited. HN17[ ] Discussed above, Rule 16 entitles a defendant to certain records  ""within the government's possession, custody, or control."" Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E), (a)(1)(F)(i). The  Government represented prior to trial that it did not have any of the requested information in its possession and had  disclosed everything else to Streb's attorneys. See [ECF No. 268 at 1]. Streb offers nothing to indicate that is not  the case. To the extent Streb complains he should have received [**34]  information that would have allowed the  defense to serve subpoenas to obtain such information, Streb did not move to subpoena records of a crime victim  from a third party under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17 and made no effort to make the requisite showing of  what specific records he sought or why such records were material to the defense. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3)  (requiring court order to compel production of ""personal or confidential information about a victim"" from a third  party); United States v. Hardy, 224 F.3d 752, 755-56 (8th Cir. 2000) (""[T]he moving party must show that the  subpoenaed document (1) is relevant, (2) is admissible, and (3) has been requested with adequate specificity.""). 4. Timing and manner of discovery disclosures More broadly, Streb contends the issues discussed above are indicative of a larger pattern of discovery violations  by the Government in both the number and timing of its disclosures as well as the manner in which they were made  that undermined his defense—what Streb refers to as the Government's ""manipulation"" of the discovery process.  See [ECF No. 383-1 at 12-13]. He complains that he was not able to access video and audio recordings of the  minor victims until December 9, 2019, and the Government only allowed him to view ""certain key materials"" at the  United [**35]  States Attorney's Office. Though he does not contend the Government violated any discovery  deadlines, he takes issue with the number and volume of discovery production by the Government, complaining  that the Government's twenty-three disclosures ""presented a constantly shifting target"" that unjustly hampered  Streb's ability to prepare his defense. Id. at 12-13. But Streb does not claim the Government produced any evidence in violation of the parties' Stipulated Discovery  and Protective Order, [ECF No. 87]. And aside from the Government's disclosure of expenditures made for or on  behalf of the minor victims, addressed above, he has not identified any particular instance where material was  improperly or untimely disclosed. Limitations on the access of certain materials is not an uncommon practice due to  the sensitive nature of records and need  [*857]  to protect victims, informants, and ongoing investigations from  their public dissemination—but the defense was never denied the material. Even assuming a discovery violation  occurred, Streb was not prejudiced by the timing and manner of the Government's discovery disclosures. United  States v. Thompson, 365 F. App'x 42, 44 (8th Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (finding no abuse of discretion and affirming  district court ruling [**36]  declining to sanction Government for unspecified discovery violation). That Streb  complains about the volume of discovery speaks to the complexity of the case and the magnitude of the many  charges against him. B. Evidentiary Rulings HN18[ ] District courts likewise have broad discretion in ruling on evidentiary matters. United States v. Omar, 786  F.3d 1104, 1112 (8th Cir. 2015); see United States v. Anderson, 783 F.3d 727, 745 (8th Cir. 2015) (""We review     477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *855; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **33 Page 23 of 33 evidentiary rulings for clear abuse of discretion, 'reversing only when an improper evidentiary ruling affected the  defendant's substantial rights or had more than a slight influence on the verdict.'"" (citation omitted)). Turning to the  evidence presented at trial, Streb raises numerous evidentiary issues he claims were in error, prejudicing his right  to a fair trial: (1) exclusion of evidence of the minor victims' engagement in sex trafficking; (2) denial of the  defense's motion for mistrial and restriction on cross-examination concerning MVE's pregnancy; (3) limitations on  the defense's cross-examination of MVB concerning her dismissed juvenile delinquency petition; (4) exclusion of  the defense's cosmetologist expert witness; (5) admission of cell phone extraction reports over Streb's objection;  and (6) rejection of the defense's requests to admit records [**37]  under Rule 106, the ""rule of completeness."" 1. Evidence of minor victims' engagement in sex trafficking The Court will first address Streb's argument that the Court erred in issuing a ""blanket prohibition"" against  questioning related to MVA, MVB, and MVE's prior participation in sex trafficking and excluding photographs  demonstrating the minors' prior engagement in such activities. See [ECF No. 383-1 at 15-17]. Streb sought to  introduce pictures of the minor victims at trial, some of which were posted as online advertisements promoting their  availability for commercial sex acts or sent in private communications, and to elicit testimony about how they  presented themselves as being older than they were in prior solicitations. Tr. 82-103; see generally [ECF Nos. 318;  319; 323] (sealed). HN19[ ] Rule 412 of the Federal Rules of Evidence prohibits evidence of a victim's sexual history to prove the  victim engaged in ""other sexual behavior"" or to prove the victim's ""sexual predisposition."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(a).  There are three exceptions in criminal cases: (A) evidence of specific instances of a victim's sexual behavior, if offered to prove that someone other than the  defendant was the source of semen, injury, or other physical evidence; (B) evidence of specific instances [**38]  of a victim's sexual behavior with respect to the person accused of  the sexual misconduct, if offered by the defendant to prove consent or if offered by the prosecutor; and (C) evidence whose exclusion would violate the defendant's constitutional rights. Fed. R. Evid. 412(b)(1). The limitations of Rule 412 shield victims of sexual misconduct from ""invasion of privacy,  potential embarrassment and sexual stereotyping that is associated with public disclosure of  [*858]  intimate sexual  details and the infusion of sexual innuendo into the factfinding process,"" and ""encourages victims of sexual  misconduct to institute and to participate in legal proceedings"" against their offenders or abusers. 1994 Advisory  Committee Notes to Fed. R. Evid. 412; see United States v. Elbert, 561 F.3d 771, 776 (8th Cir. 2009) (""[T]he  limitations created by Fed. R. Evid. 412 on a defendant's ability to present evidence 'is not arbitrary or  disproportionate to the purpose it is designed to serve,' because the exclusion serves an important interest—the  prevention of 'potential embarrassment or harassment of alleged victims of sexual abuse.'"" (quoting United States  v. Bordeaux, 400 F.3d 548, 558 (8th Cir. 2005))). HN20[ ] The protections put in place by Rule 412 apply with  particular force in cases involving minor victims. See United States v. Ogden, 685 F.3d 600, 606 (6th Cir. 2012);  Clardy v. McKune, 89 F. App'x 665, 673-74 (10th Cir. 2004); cf. Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836, 852, 110 S. Ct.  3157, 111 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1990) (""[A] State's interest in 'the protection of minor victims of sex crimes from  further [**39]  trauma and embarrassment' is a 'compelling' one."" (citation omitted)). Despite falling within the ambit of Rule 412, Streb failed to disclose his intent to introduce the images into  evidence and pursue that line of questioning until the day before trial. HN21[ ] A party wishing to introduce          477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *857; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **36 Page 24 of 33 evidence under an exception to Rule 412 must serve notice on the Government, interested parties, and the victims  through a motion filed with the Court that ""specifically describes the evidence and states the purpose for which it is  to be offered"" at least fourteen days prior to trial. Fed. R. Evid. 412(c)(1). Streb's disclosures, [ECF Nos. 318; 323]  (sealed), satisfy none of these requirements. His failure to disclose his intent to pursue this subject matter violates  the notice provision of Rule 412 as well as the minor victims' right to be present at the hearing concerning their  admissibility. Fed. R. Evid. 412(c)(2) (""Before admitting evidence under this rule, the court must conduct an in  camera hearing and give the victim[s] and parties a right to attend and be heard.""); cf. Crime Victims' Rights Act §  102, 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8) (as amended 2015). HN22[ ] And the failure to follow these procedural safeguards,  alone, ""constitutes 'sufficient grounds . . .' to exclude the evidence."" United States v. Betts, 911 F.3d 523, 529 (8th  Cir. 2018) (citing United States v. Roy, 781 F.3d 416, 421 (8th Cir. 2015)). Streb [**40]  argues his untimely disclosures should be excused because the Court's exclusion of the images and  prohibition against questioning directed at the minor victims' prior engagement in sex trafficking violated his rights  under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution to present an effective  [*859]  defense.  HN24[ ] The Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause guarantees a defendant's right ""to present evidence  favorable to himself on an element that must be proven to convict him."" Clark v. Arizona, 548 U.S. 735, 769, 126 S.  Ct. 2709, 165 L. Ed. 2d 842 (2006). The Sixth Amendment ""guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal  prosecution 'to be confronted with the witnesses against him,'"" Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 315, 94 S. Ct. 1105,  39 L.

Neither fundamental right is unlimited,  however, and both bend to rules of evidence serving legitimate purposes so long as they are not disproportionate to  the ends they aim to promote. E.g. Clark, 548 U.S. at 770; United States v. Scheffer, 523 U.S. 303, 308, 118 S. Ct.  1261, 140 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1998). Streb was charged with three counts of sex trafficking of minors under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1) and (b)(2), which  required the Government to prove Streb recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, advertised,  maintained, patronized, or solicited each of the minor victims, knowing or recklessly disregarding the fact that the  minor victim was under the age of eighteen years old and would be caused to engage in a [**41]  commercial sex  act. But HN25[ ] ""[i]n a prosecution under subsection (a)(1) in which the defendant had a reasonable opportunity  to observe the [trafficked individual], the Government need not prove the fact the defendant knew, or recklessly  disregarded the fact, that the person had not attained the age of [eighteen] years."" Id. § 1591(c). In other words,  ""[s]ection 1591(c) unambiguously creates an independent basis of liability when the government proves a  defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the victim.""

And ""[w]hen the government proceeds on the theory that a defendant had a reasonable opportunity to  observe the victim, his mistake about the victim's age is no defense."" Whyte, 928 F.3d at 1330. The result is ""strict  liability with regard to the defendant's awareness of the victim's age."" Robinson, 702 F.3d 22, 26 (2d Cir. 2012).            477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *858; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **39 Page 25 of 33  [*860]  Streb was charged with all three theories with regards to MVA and MVE; he was charged with recklessly  disregarding MVB's age or, alternatively, having had a reasonable opportunity to observe MVB. See [ECF No. 163  at 7-8, 14] (sealed). Simply put, these photographs and lines of questioning were irrelevant. Though the Court agrees the images could  have had some degree of probative value if Streb were to testify that he viewed the images in question or agreed to  patronize the minor victims as a result of seeing them, Tr. 92, 99, 102-03, nothing in the record suggests, let alone  establishes, that was the case. Having elected not to testify in his own defense, Streb presented no connection  between his encounters with the minor victims and evidence of their prior sex trafficking activity. How the minor  victims represented themselves to Streb is all that was relevant to the question of whether Streb knew or recklessly  disregarded the age of the minor victims when paying them to perform commercial sex acts, or whether [**43]  he  had a reasonable opportunity to observe them; what the minor victims looked like, and how they represented  themselves on other occasions, was not. See, e.g., Roy, 781 F.3d at 420 (""The victim's participation in prostitution  either before or after the time period in the indictment has no relevance to whether [the defendant] beat her,  threatened her, and took the money she made from prostitution in order to cause her to engage in commercial  sex.""); Elbert, 561 F.3d at 777 (""Whether the children engaged in acts of prostitution before or after their encounters  with [the defendant] is irrelevant, and would only prove other people may be guilty of similar offenses of recruiting,  enticing, or causing these victims to engage in a commercial sex act.""). HN27[ ] Still, Rule 403 allows a court to ""exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially  outweighed by a danger of . . . unfair prejudice."" Contrasted with whatever minimal probative value of the evidence  might have had was its highly prejudicial effect on the privacy and protection of the minor victims. See Roy, 781  F.3d at 419 (affording ""substantial deference to a trial court's exclusion of evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence  403 so long as the trial court's exercise of discretion [does] not unfairly prevent a party from [**44]  proving [its]  case"" (alterations and emphasis in original) (citation omitted)). ""Assuming any impeachment relevance of the  minors engaging in other acts of prostitution"" here, ""any probative value the evidence may have '[was] substantially  outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.'"" Elbert, 561 F.3d at 777 (citing Fed. R. Evid. 403). Exclusion of the  images and text messages showing the minor victims' past participation in sex trafficking activities, and prohibiting  the defense from questioning the minor victims on this subject, did not violate Streb's rights under the Fifth or Sixth  Amendments. See id. (concluding evidence of alleged prior acts of prostitution ""has no impeachment value here  because evidence the children previously engaged in prostitution does not contradict evidence the children  engaged in the acts of prostitution for which [the defendant] has been charged""); see also, e.g., Haines, 918 F.3d at  697-99 (""That [the minor victim] may have prostituted on other occasions on her own does not change the result"" of  the defendant's guilt under § 1591(a)); United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d 584, 593 (7th Cir. 2017) (holding ""whether  the victims had previously worked as prostitutes was irrelevant to the required mens rea"" under § 1591(a));  Lockhart, 844 F.3d at 510 (""[E]vidence of  [*861]  the victims' pre-and post-indictment acts of prostitution would be  irrelevant [**45]  to this case as it does not 'make . . . more or less probable' the fact that [the defendants] caused  their victims to engage in a commercial sex act during the time period alleged in the indictment."" (quoting Fed. R.  Evid. 401)); United States v. Gemma, 818 F.3d 23, 34-35 (1st Cir. 2016) (holding evidence of alleged prior  prostitution was ""either entirely irrelevant or of such slight probative value in comparison to its prejudicial effect that  a decision to exclude it would not violate [defendant's] constitutional rights""). The exclusion of evidence of the minor victims' prior acts of sex trafficking and sexual activity does not establish a  violation of Streb's rights under the Fifth or Sixth Amendments.         477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *859; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **42 Page 26 of 33 2. Inquiry into MVE's pregnancy Relatedly, Streb claims the Court's rulings with respect to MVE's unexpected disclosure of her pregnancy during  cross-examination prejudiced his defense. The Court had previously prohibited evidence and argument regarding  the minor victims' prior sexual history, Tr. 414-17, 736-37, and both parties agreed that subject could not be  inquired into under Rule 412, [ECF Nos. 254 at 4-10; 277 at 2]. As often occurs in trial practice, however, the  anticipated testimony did not go as according to plan. On cross-examination, defense counsel had inquired into  MVE's [**46]  past drug use and its effect on her memory and perception of events concerning Streb as relayed  through her several interviews with law enforcement. Defense counsel asked MVE whether she continued using  drugs after her first interview with investigators in February 2019, and she responded ""no"" by stating she was  pregnant at that time. Tr. 829. Streb now argues the Court should have granted a mistrial or, alternatively, issued a curative instruction informing  the jury that the fact of MVE's pregnancy should not have been disclosed, all while permitting the defense to  explore the issue beyond ensuring the pregnancy was not associated with Streb. See [ECF No. 383-1 at 14-15].  HN28[ ] ""As a general rule, it is within the discretion of the district court to decide whether a trial has been so  tainted by prejudicial testimony that a mistrial should be declared . . . ."" United States v. Urick, 431 F.3d 300, 304  (8th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). Less extreme remedies are usually adequate to cure the admission of a prejudicial  statement in most cases, however. United States v. Coleman, 349 F.3d 1077, 1087 (8th Cir.2003) (citing United  States v. Muza, 788 F.2d 1309, 1312 (8th Cir. 1986)). Whether the verdict was ""substantially swayed"" by the  prejudicial comment, thus requiring a mistrial, depends on whether the alternative remedy ""was sufficient in the  context of the entire [**47]  trial, [weighing] the prejudice against the strength of the government's evidence."" Urick,  431 F.3d at 304. Following MVE's unsolicited disclosing of her pregnancy to the jury, defense counsel smoothly continued with  cross-examination and ably transitioned away from the issue. Just prior to ending cross-examination, the Court  permitted defense counsel to ask MVE to confirm that her child was not related to her interactions with Streb, and  the witness was excused. See Tr. 863 (""Q. Is the baby you had Mr. Streb's baby? A. No.""); see also Tr. 864.  Allowing the defense to pursue a very circumscribed line of questioning in order to demonstrate to the jury that the  pregnancy was unconnected to Streb both ameliorated the concern that the jury would infer the child was  associated with MVE's interactions with Streb while protecting MVE from unfair prejudice and embarrassment. See  Tr. 866. There was no confusion  [*862]  about the fact that the child was not Streb's. The evidence against Streb  was strong, and the Court finds the jury's decision to convict him of Count 26, sex trafficking of a minor in relation to  MVE, was not ""substantially swayed"" by her disclosure. Streb argues he should have been allowed to question MVE [**48]  about a text message indicating the race of her  baby (being of a different race than Streb) and Streb's use of a condom, but this inquiry would have run afoul of the  general prohibition against evidence of a victim's sexual history contained in Rule 412 of the Federal Rules of  Evidence and unnecessarily delved into collateral matters. The proposed line of questioning fit into none of the  exceptions. It would have elicited testimony about MVE's sexual history unrelated to her interactions with Streb, and  the defense's pointed question asking MVE to confirm that Streb was not the father of her child worked to confirm  that another was the source of her pregnancy. Cf. Fed. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(A) (permitting introduction of evidence ""to  prove that someone other than the defendant was the source of semen, injury, or other physical evidence""). HN29[ ] Furthermore, consent is not a defense to sexual contact with a minor. Elbert, 561 F.3d at 776; see Fed. R. Evid.  412(b)(1)(B). Streb does not argue the exclusion of his desired testimony violated his constitutional rights, and the  Court finds any possible prejudice was harmless. See United States v. Santisteban, 501 F.3d 873, 879 (8th Cir.  2007) (""To determine whether a Confrontation Clause error was harmless, we look to 'whether, assuming that the  damaging potential of the cross-examination were fully realized, a reviewing court might nonetheless [**49]  say  that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.'"" (quoting Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 684, 106  S. Ct. 1431, 89 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986))). In the end, ""there is no reasonable basis to believe that these references could have improperly tainted the jury's  deliberation."" Urick, 431 F.3d at 305; cf. United States v. Arias, 936 F.3d 793, 798 (8th Cir. 2019) (""Considering the  nature of the charged offenses [sexual abuse of a child] and the evidence against [the defendant], a blurted  477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *861; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **45 Page 27 of 33 comment that [the defendant] had previously committed a parole violation was not the sort of evidence that would  create 'an overwhelming probability' that the jury would be unable to follow the court's curative instruction."" (citation  omitted)). MVE's statement revealing her pregnancy was inadvertent and the fault of neither party. In light of the  proposed question's limited probative value and considerable prejudice to MVE compared to the substantial  evidence of Streb's guilt, Streb is not entitled to a new trial on this basis. 3. Impeachment of MVB Streb also complains the Court erred in prohibiting the defense from questioning MVB about the details of the state  juvenile charges filed against her for conduct related to this case, which were later dismissed. See [ECF No. 383-1  at 13]; see also [ECF No. 287]. Although Streb agreed in pre-trial filings that [**50]  such evidence would not be  admissible, [ECF No. 277 at 5], the defense nonetheless sought to elicit detailed information from MVB related to  her arrest and detention at trial. Tr. 901-04. Sustaining the Government's objection, the Court ruled Streb could not  question MVB about the offenses she was charged with or inquire into the details of her dismissed delinquency  petition. Tr. 904; [ECF No. 350 at 2] (sealed). Now, Streb argues he should have been allowed to fully impeach the  testimony of MVB with the details of her dismissed charges because she was ""treated as a coconspirator  [*863]   during trial for purposes of admitting her hearsay testimony under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule."" Rule 608(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides: Except for a criminal conviction under Rule 609, extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove specific instances  of a witness's conduct in order to attack or support the witness's character for truthfulness. But the court may,  on cross-examination, allow them to be inquired into if they are probative of the character for truthfulness or  untruthfulness of: (1) the witness; or (2) another witness whose character the witness being cross-examined has testified about. Fed. R. Evid. 608(b) (emphasis added). HN30[ ] Generally, [**51]  a conviction must be a felony or one involving a  dishonest act or false statement to be admissible to attack a witness's character for truthfulness. See Fed. R. Evid.  609(a). Evidence of a witness's juvenile adjudication are admissible only if (1) it is offered against a witness in a  criminal case; (2) the witness is not the defendant; (3) an adult's conviction for the same offense would be  admissible to attack the adult's credibility; and (4) admission of the evidence is ""necessary to fairly determine guilt  or innocence."" Fed. R. Evid. 609(d). The evidence and testimony the defense sought to use to impeach MVB satisfies none of these requirements  because the alleged acts did not involve dishonesty and no admission or finding of guilt was made; the public  record of the accusation would have been inflammatory and highly prejudicial to MVB; and any inquiry into such  matters would have confused the issues before the jury, substituting MVB's conduct for Streb's. See United  States v. Alston, 626 F.3d 397, 404 (8th Cir. 2010) (""The Rule 403 balancing of probative value versus prejudicial  effect is an integral step toward a determination of admissibility under . . . Rule 608(b)."" (citation omitted)), cert.  denied, 563 U.S. 929 (2011). Although not permitted to solicit information about the delinquency charges in the  level [**52]  of detail originally sought, the defense was permitted to inquire into the existence of charges, the fact of  their dismissal, and the impact on the truthfulness of MVB's testimony. See United States v. Frederick, 683 F.3d  913, 919 (8th Cir. 2012) (affirming exclusion of prior victims' accusations because evidence of prior acts was  disputed; allowing inquiry would have been highly prejudicial; and risked ""confusion of the issues"" or ""misleading  the jury"" (citations omitted)).       477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *862; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **49 Page 28 of 33 4. Defense cosmetologist expert Turning to the defense's case-in-chief, Streb contends he should have been permitted to present the testimony of a  cosmetologist expert who, he claims, would have testified as to how the application of makeup could impact one's  perception of age. [ECF No. 383-1 at 18-19]. The defense sought to introduce the testimony of Kim Cox, Director of  the Iowa School of Beauty, to speak to the jury about makeup techniques capable of making an individual  [*864]   appear older than her actual age. The Court waived Streb's untimely and insufficient Rule 16 expert witness  disclosures as a sanction for the Government's last-minute production of benefits conferred on the minor victims,  but the proposed expert testimony was still required to be relevant to the proceedings [**53]  as probative of Streb's  guilt or innocence for the crimes with which he was charged. Tr. 79-80, 103-04. Expert witness testimony is governed by Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence: A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the  form of an opinion or otherwise if: (a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the  evidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case. Fed. R. Evid. 702. HN31[ ] The key requirement is that the expert testimony ""help the trier of fact to understand  the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,"" Fed. R. Evid. 702(a), which ""goes primarily to relevance,"" Daubert v.  Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 591, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993). The gatekeeping  function of Rule 702 requires the trial court to ensure all expert testimony is both reliable and relevant. Smith v.  Bubak, 643 F.3d 1137, 1140 (8th Cir. 2011); Khoury v. Philips Med. Sys., 614 F.3d 888, 892 (8th Cir. 2010); see  also Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Canon USA, Inc., 394 F.3d 1054, 1057 (8th Cir. 2005) (""A trial court must be given  wide latitude in determining whether an expert's testimony is reliable."" (citing Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526  U.S. 137, 152, 119 S. Ct. 1167, 143 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1999))). HN32[ ] Of course, expert testimony may still be  excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger [**54]  of unfair prejudice, confusing the  issues, misleading the jury, or wasting time, even if it is otherwise admissible. Fed. R. Evid. 403. None of the testimony proffered by the defense was relevant as ""scientific, technical, other specialized knowledge""  capable of assisting the jury to understand the facts of the case to qualify as expert testimony; the application of  makeup, and its superficial effects on an individual's appearance, is well within jurors' ability to understand in their  common and everyday lives. Cf. Jespersen v. Harrah's Operating Co., Inc., 444 F.3d 1104, 1117 (9th Cir. 2006)  (Kozinski, J., dissenting) (arguing practical effects of applying makeup is common knowledge and should be  acknowledged by judicial notice). Streb argues that Ms. Cox's testimony would have illuminated the effects of  makeup on the perception of age because MVB testified she enjoyed wearing makeup because it allowed her to be  ""a whole nother [sic] person"" and used makeup to represent herself to be older than her actual age, and MVE had  dyed her hair and appeared to be wearing lip chap or rouge in one of the pictures of her. See Tr. 912-16, 832-35.  But the record is devoid of any specific testimony from the minor victims about whether they wore makeup in such a  way when they were with Streb. [**55]  And because Streb did not testify, he was unable to show how he might  have perceived the girls. Because Streb could not provide a basis for the testimony of Ms. Cox as an expert, and  she had no personal knowledge of the minor victims or their makeup habits when interacting with Streb, there was  no relevant testimony she could have offered. See Tr.  [*865]  1004-07. Admitting her testimony would have been  unhelpful at best, and would have improperly invaded the fact-finding role of the jury. 5. Cell phone extraction reports Streb also complains that the Court allowed inadmissible hearsay evidence to be presented to the jury when it  admitted records from cellphone extractions taken from the minor victims' and Streb's phones because neither of  the detectives testifying as to the records prepared the underlying extraction reports. See [ECF No. 383-1 at 14]; Tr.  582. Because he did not have an opportunity to cross-examine the individual who prepared the exhibits, he argues,  the records should have been excluded. 477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *863; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **52 Page 29 of 33 Rule 803(6) provides that ""[a] record of an act, event, condition, opinion, or diagnosis"" is excluded from the hearsay  rule if: (A) the record was made at or near the time by—or from information transmitted [**56]  by—someone with  knowledge; (B) the record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business, organization, occupation,  or calling, whether or not for profit; (C) making the record was a regular practice of that activity; (D) all these conditions are shown by the testimony of the custodian or another qualified witness, or by a  certification that complies with Rule 902(11) or (12) or with a statute permitting certification; and (E) the opponent does not show that the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation  indicate a lack of trustworthiness. Fed. R. Evid. 803(6). HN33[ ] Rule 902(11) provides that the records produced by a regularly-conducted activity  are self-authenticating when certified by the custodian of the records or ""another qualified person"" who complies  with federal law. Records generated by an electronic process or system that produces an accurate result and data  copied from an electronic device also satisfy this requirement if certified in accordance with Rule 902(11). See Fed.  R. Evid. 902(13), (14). The cell phone extraction reports at issue here were introduced under Rules 902(13) and (14). The Government  presented testimony that the records were made at the time by someone with knowledge of their contents; that they  were kept in the [**57]  ordinary course of a regularly-conducted activity; and that the making of the reports was a  regular practice of that activity. See Tr. 278-81, 289-90, 318-19, 687-79. The records were certified by a qualified  custodian. [ECF No. 242-11]; see Tr. 582-84. And the Government made these records available to the defense,  [ECF No. 242], with ample time prior to trial to present ""a fair opportunity to challenge them,"" Fed. R. Evid. 902(11).  The defense never sought their exclusion by arguing ""the source of information or method or circumstances of  preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness."" Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)(E). As such, the records were properly admitted  under this exception to the hearsay rule. 6. Rule 106 motions Next, Streb argues the Court misapplied Federal Rule of Evidence 106 to exclude relevant segments of records that  he claims were necessary to clarify and contextualize portions of those documents admitted through Government  exhibits. See [ECF No. 383-1 at 19-22]. HN34[ ] The ""rule of completeness,"" as it is known, provides: If a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party may require the  introduction, at that time, of any other part—or any other writing or recorded statement—that  [*866]  in fairness  ought to be considered at the [**58]  same time. Fed. R. Evid. 106. The rule permits an adverse party to admit the complete writing or recording advanced by the  other party if ""necessary to '(1) explain the admitted portion, (2) place the admitted portion in context, (3) avoid  misleading the trier of fact, or (4) insure a fair and impartial understanding.'"" McCoy v. Augusta Fiberglass Coatings,  Inc., 593 F.3d 737, 747 (8th Cir. 2010) (quoting United States v. Flentge, 151 F. App'x 490, 491-92 (8th Cir. 2005)  (per curiam)). The rule requires specificity from the moving party: ""To sustain a Rule 106 objection, 'the party urging  admission of an excluded conversation must specify the portion of the testimony that is relevant to the issue at trial  and that qualifies or explains portions already admitted.'"" Id. (citation omitted). But ""the rule does not come into play  when 'a few inconsistencies between out-of-court and in-court statements are revealed through cross-examination;  rather, it operates to ensure fairness where a misunderstanding or distortion created by the other party can only be  averted by the introduction of the full text of the out-of-court statement.'"" United States v. Ramos—Caraballo, 375  F.3d 797, 803 (8th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). During the prosecution's case-in-chief, the Government introduced a portion of the video recording and transcript  from detectives' March 26, 2019 interview with Streb after his arrest. [**59]  Tr. 928-34; see [ECF Nos. 382-10; 382- 12]. These excerpts were used by the Government to show that Streb had admitted to possessing the  methamphetamine and firearms found during the execution of the search warrant of his house. See Fed. R. Evid.  477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *865; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **55 Page 30 of 33 801(d)(2)(A) (excluding statements of an opposing party from the definition of hearsay). Streb argues the Court  misapplied Rule 106 when it denied his requests to present additional segments of dialogue from that interview that  were omitted from the Government's exhibit. At first Streb was unable to identify a specific part of the Government's  exhibit that was in need of explanation, clarification, or contextualization and sought to admit the entire record of his  interview. When pressed, Streb identified on two portions of the written transcript he claimed were in need of  clarification. The first entails the following exchange: [Detective Ryan Wood]: When was the last time you used meth? [Kendal Streb]: [unintelligible] RW: Um. You smoke it or? KS: Yeah. RW: Do you use anything else? KS: No. [ECF No. 382-10 at 1]; see also Tr. 951-52. The second includes the detective's question to Streb: ""RW: So those  [firearms confiscated from Streb's house] aren't going to come back stolen? KS: [**60]  No."" [ECF No. 382-12 at 1];  see also Tr. 952-53. He claimed the following dialogue spoken by Detective Ryan Wood should have been  admitted: So obviously we work on the Johnson County Drug Task Force; okay? By all indications it looks like you have  user quantities of meth and marijuana in the residence. And there's not gonna be any indication that you're  selling, or anything? Tr. 937-36, 947-48. Streb contends this segment of his interview implies law enforcement officers believed Streb to  be merely a drug user, not a drug dealer, while the partial record admitted in the Government's exhibits gave the  jury the opposite (incriminating) impression. The portions of the interview admitted in the Government's exhibits were not misleading or in want of clarification,  nor did  [*867]  they distort the meaning of the statements contained therein. Nothing in the language quoted by  Streb actually indicates the detective expressed the opinion that Streb was not a drug dealer, and its admission was  not necessary under the rule of completeness to qualify, explain, or place into context any of the admitted portions  for the jury. Streb's efforts to admit these portions of the full interview transcript amount [**61]  to nothing more than  an attempt to admit his own self-serving exculpatory statements made at the time of the interview into evidence.  See Tr. 954. Being hearsay, testimony about the statements was properly excluded. Streb claims Rule 106 allows an exception to hearsay but fails to point to any authority for such a proposition. It  does not. HN35[ ] The rule of completeness does not independently allow for the admission of inadmissible  hearsay solely for the sake of completeness, and numerous authorities already recognize this. See Ramos— Caraballo, 375 F.3d at 803 (""'Rule 106, the rule of completeness, . . .' does not 'empower[] a court to admit  unrelated hearsay in the interest of fairness and completeness when that hearsay does not come within a defined  hearsay exception.'"" (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Woolbright, 831 F.2d 1390, 1395 (8th Cir.  1987), abrogated on other grounds by Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177  (2004))); accord United States v. Collicott, 92 F.3d 973, 983 (9th Cir. 1996) (""Rule 106 'does not compel admission  of otherwise inadmissible hearsay evidence.'"" (quoting Phoenix Assocs. III v. Stone, 60 F.3d 95, 103 (2d Cir.  1995))); United States v. Wilkerson, 84 F.3d 692, 696 (4th Cir. 1996) (""Rule 106 . . . would not render admissible  the evidence which is otherwise inadmissible under the hearsay rules.""). Still, Streb claims in a one-sentence  retort that the exclusion of those hearsay statements forced him to forgo his privilege against self-incrimination,        477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *866; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **59 Page 31 of 33 violating [**62]  his rights under the Fifth Amendment. Streb cites no authority for the proposition that the Due  Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment entitles a criminal defendant to introduce under Rule 106 his own or others'  hearsay statements that do not fall within any exception. Nor did Streb actually testify and forgo that privilege to  remain silent. Without more detailed briefing the Court is unable to analyze such a claim further. Streb also argues the Court erred in applying Rule 106 when it precluded the defense from presenting additional  text messages between MVE and MVB, and communications concerning MVE's pregnancy and plan to purchase  contraception that were excluded from the Government's summary exhibit of their exchange. See Tr. 281-97, 406- 08; 955-57; see also [ECF No. 381-24] (sealed). Streb also sought to admit a portion of an early interview of MVE,  stating: Minor Victim E told the affiant she was aware that Minor Victim B engaged in prostitution. Minor Victim E  admitted that she also engaged in prostitution on at least two occasions. She explained that on or about the  beginning of January 2019, she needed money to purchase  [*868]  a Plan B pill so she decided to prostitute  herself. Tr. 738-39. Streb asserts these exchanges and statements by MVE were [**63]  relevant to show MVE's motivation  for soliciting Streb and call into question her prior statements regarding his condom use and other details divulged  to law enforcement throughout the course of the investigation. But the minor victims' reason for engaging in  commercial acts with Streb are irrelevant to the question of whether Streb solicited or patronized the underage girls  for commercial sex acts knowing, or in reckless disregard of, the fact of their age or after having had a reasonable  opportunity to observe them. Streb never identified specific portions of the Government's evidence that required the  admission of these additional records, and this alone is fatal to his claim. E.g. McCoy, 593 F.3d at 474 (rejecting  Rule 106 objection where counsel failed to explain why the entire report should be admitted or point to which  portions would be relevant to the issues at trial); Flentge, 151 F. App'x at 492 (rejecting Rule 106 objection where  the defendant ""never identified which portions of the record would be relevant to the trial and how the additional  excerpts would place the government's evidence in context""). And admission of information regarding MVE's  pregnancy and purchase of contraception would have violated Rule 412's prohibition of ""other sexual [**64]   behavior"" evidence. Finally, Streb complains he was not allowed to introduce his own exhibit of written summary telephone records for  MVB—proposed Defense Exhibit NN—when a similar electronic exhibit was already introduced as Government's  Exhibit 16. See Tr. 1174-92; [ECF No. 360]. Streb wished to introduce the proposed exhibit in his cross-examination  of Detective Gonzalez to establish MVB had contact with other individuals at or around the time the records showed  she was in contact with Streb. But again, the defense offers no particular portion of Exhibit 16 that distorted or  misled the jury for which the inclusion of the additional records were necessary under Rule 106. Moreover, any  record of MVB's communications with other individuals has no bearing on Streb's communications with her and is  irrelevant to the question for which Streb was on trial: whether or not he paid her for sex. More practical problems existed with Streb's proposed Exhibit NN, however. Streb sought to admit the exhibit  during the cross-examination of Detective Gonzalez without any prior notice or disclosure to the Government or the  Court. The proposed exhibit added three pages that were not a part of the original document, [**65]  and was  missing two-thirds of the actual data from the records. Tr. 1182-84. Detective Gonzalez was asked to examine the  document, with approximately 2,000 lines of data, over a lunch recess. Tr. 1185. The end result was that the only  testimony offered in support of the proposed exhibit was that it was not accurate, was not complete, and itself  misrepresented the data of the original records. Tr. 1187-88. And even as a summary of Government Exhibit 16,  Streb did not comply with the notice requirements of Rule 1006. At the very least, Streb suffered no prejudice from  being denied the opportunity to present an exhibit that was cumulative of the Government's. C. Trial Management HN36[ ] Trial management falls well within the discretion of the trial court. United States v. Williams, 720 F.3d 674,  692 (8th Cir. 2013). Indeed, the Federal Rules of Evidence expressly permit—in fact, instruct—the trial court to  477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *867; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **61 Page 32 of 33 ""exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence""  [*869]  for  the purposes of determining the truth, avoiding wasted time, and protecting witnesses from harassment or undue  embarrassment. Fed. R. Evid. 611(a). Streb raises a number of complaints related to the conduct of the trial, finding  it to have been unfair. Streb generally complains [**66]  that the Court allowed the Government to employ leading questions when  conducting direct examinations of the minor victims. See [ECF No. 383-1 at 17-18]. HN37[ ] Typically, ""[l]eading  questions should not be used on direct examination except as necessary to develop the witness's testimony."" Fed.  R. Evid. 611(c). But ""[t]he child witness is a long-recognized exception to this rule."" United States v. Butler, 56 F.3d  941, 943 (8th Cir. 1995) (citing United States v. Nabors, 762 F.2d 642, 650 (8th Cir. 1985)). The Eighth Circuit has  long endorsed trial courts' discretion in permitting the use of leading questions with victims of sexual offenses. See,  e.g., United States v. Rossbach, 701 F.2d 713, 718 (8th Cir. 1983). In its review of the trial transcript, the Court  finds the prosecution's use of leading questions was neither excessive nor inappropriate. Streb also complains the Court restricted his cross-examination in a way that was ""flawed and favored the  Government"" because it would not allow impeachment ""unless the exact same question had been answered out of  court by the witness and a different answer given by the witness."" [ECF No. 383-1 at 22-26]. He asserts these  limitations violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to present evidence in his defense and confront witnesses.  See Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 1111, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974). It did not. HN38[ ] Though not  technically required under the federal rules, see 1972 Advisory Committee Note to Fed. R. Evid. 613; see Rush v.  Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 399 F.3d 705, 720 (6th Cir. 2005), it [**67]  is well within a trial court's discretion to impose  traditional common law procedural safeguards for the impeachment of minor witnesses with prior inconsistent  statements, Fed. R. Evid. 611(a) (""The court should exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of  examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to . . . make those procedures effective for determining the  truth . . . avoid wasting time . . . and . . . protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.""); see 28  Victor J. Gold, Federal Practice & Procedure § 6202 (noting the common law approach is ""better suited to saving  time and preventing unfair treatment of witnesses,"" and it ""mitigates the danger that prior inconsistent statements  will be used improperly for substantive purposes""); cf. United States v. Moore, 149 F.3d 773, 781 (8th Cir. 1998)  (""Traditionally, courts have insisted that a witness be directed to a prior inconsistent statement during cross- examination, before the statement is admitted.""). This is particularly true when questioning minor victim witnesses  accusing a defendant of sex trafficking-related crimes. The effect of the defense's failure to properly impeach  witnesses resulted in the insertion of misleading, out-of-context hearsay or statements prohibited by Rule 412  that [**68]  would only have served to harass the minor victim witnesses and confuse the facts before the jury. See,  e.g., Tr. 491-93; 899-907; 911. HN39[ ] Indeed, ""[c]ourts must be watchful that impeachment is not used as a  subterfuge to place otherwise inadmissible hearsay before the jury."" United States v. Logan, 121 F.3d 1172, 1175  (8th Cir. 1997) (citing United States v. Rogers, 549 F.2d 490, 497 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 918  (1977)). Streb was not prevented from fully exploring the minor victims' prior statements to law enforcement and  their consistency  [*870]  with trial testimony—any harm suffered by Streb as a result of the Court insisting on this  impeachment procedure was harmless. See Bordeaux, 570 F.3d at 1051 (rulings on prior inconsistent statements  are ""subject to harmless error analysis"" (citing United States v. Buffalo, 358 F.3d 519, 521-22 (8th Cir. 2004))). The  impeachment procedural requirement imposed by the Court to protect the minor victims and prevent confusion did  not violate Streb's constitutional rights and does not require a new trial. Finally, Streb complains the Court, in general, was hostile to the defense and favored the prosecution, unduly  influencing the jury and tainting its verdict. HN40[ ] ""[T]he balance [between a judge's comments and the overall  fairness of trial] is adversely tipped against the defendant in a criminal trial where the judge's role loses its color of  neutrality and tends to [**69]  accentuate and emphasize the prosecution's case."" United States v. Williams, 720  F.3d 674, 694 (8th Cir. 2013) (alterations in original) (citation omitted). A new trial is warranted on these grounds  only ""where 'the court's comments throughout a trial are one-sided and interfere with a defendant's case to such an  extent that the defendant is deprived of the right to a fair trial.'"" Id. (citation omitted). After carefully reviewing the  trial record, the Court concludes Streb's arguments of favoring the prosecution to be without merit. 477 F. Supp. 3d 835, *868; 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153730, **65 Page 33 of 33 D. Cumulative Effect Streb last contends the Court should grant him a new trial based on the cumulative effect of errors in the  proceedings, even if any one is insufficient, alone, to affect his substantial rights. HN41[ ] A new trial may be  granted to a criminal defendant ""where the case as a whole presents an image of unfairness that has resulted in the  deprivation of a defendant's constitutional rights, even though none of the claimed errors is itself sufficient to require  reversal."" United States v. Riddle, 193 F.3d 995, 998 (8th Cir. 1999); see also McBride, 862 F.2d at 1319-20  (finding cumulative errors of prosecutorial misconduct ""seriously infected the fairness of the trial,"" warranting a new  trial). But a new trial is not warranted based on the cumulative effect of trial errors ""unless there is  substantial [**70]  prejudice to the defendant."" United States v. Anwar, 428 F.3d 1102, 1115 (8th Cir. 2005)  (denying new trial involving alleged Brady violations and prosecutorial misconduct because ""[t]he cumulative effect,  if any, of the claimed errors was not such as to deny [the defendant] a fair trial""); see also United States v. Steffen,  641 F.2d 591 (8th Cir. 1981) (same). Moreover, the doctrine does not apply to evidentiary rulings committed to the  Court's discretion. United States v. Gladfelter, 168 F.3d 1078, 1083 (8th Cir. 1999). Here, the evidence weighed  heavily against Streb and clearly established his guilt. Viewing the record as a whole, the cumulative effect of the  claimed errors did not deny Streb a fair trial or result in a miscarriage of justice.",1

The motion is supported by a brief  prepared pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738  (1967). Our independent review of the entire record  reveals that counsel's assessment of the relative merit  of the appeal is correct. Because independent  examination of the entire record reveals no arguable  issue of merit, counsel's motion to withdraw is  GRANTED, and Streeter's conviction and sentence are  AFFIRMED. 1 1 After Burns filed the Anders brief, Streeter filed, pro  se, motions both to dis-charge Burns as counsel and to  be appointed new appellate counsel.

I. INTRODUCTION 538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *49; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **89419 Page 15 of 43 Defendant Michael Jabaar Wilkins is charged with two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud, and coercion, four  counts of transportation of an individual with an intent to engage in prostitution, two counts of coercion and  enticement to travel in interstate commerce to engage in prostitution, one count of interstate travel and  transportation in aid of racketeering enterprises, and one count of assault. Superseding Indictment, Dec. 9, 2020,  ECF No. 61. A jury trial is scheduled to begin in this case on July 26, 2021. In brief, Mr. Wilkins stands accused of trafficking three victim-complainants from Norfolk, Virginia, to Washington,  D.C. to engage in prostitution and other commercial sexual acts. Id. The charged offenses occurred between 2011  and 2019, during which time Mr. Wilkins is alleged to have transported these complainants to ""the Track""— a  location in the District under investigation by the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (""MPD"")  and FBI Child Exploitation and Human Trafficking Task Force due to the prevalence of street- level commercial  sexual exploitation in the area. Mr. [**3]  Wilkins is also charged with assaulting one of the complainants while she  was working at the Track—an altercation that was caught on tape by a security camera. Before the Court are a number of motions from both parties. The Government has filed motions in limine seeking:  (1) the exclusion of any evidence of the complainants' other sexual behavior and sexual predisposition (ECF No.  27); (2) the preclusion of use of the victims' last names (ECF No. 28); (3) the introduction of business records  evidence (ECF No. 33); (4) the introduction of expert witness testimony (ECF No. 34); (5) the prohibition of  references to sentencing, the exclusion of witnesses from the courtroom during trial, the exclusion of evidence not  produced in reciprocal discovery, preclusion of self-serving hearsay, admission of jail call admissions, and  preclusion of Mr. Wilkins's counsel cross-examining government witnesses regarding inadmissible criminal  convictions (ECF No. 35); (6) the admission of electronic communications evidence (ECF No. 36); and (5) the  admission of other crimes evidence (ECF No. 40). Mr. Wilkins has also filed motions requesting: (1) that the Court  sever the assault charge in the indictment [**4]  (ECF No. 38), and (2) that the Court suppress evidence obtained   [*63]  from search warrants of two cell phones and Mr. Wilkins's Instagram account (ECF No. 39). A motions  hearing was held on March 31, 2021 to allow for oral argument on each of these motions. The Court addresses  each of the pending motions in turn. II.

The Government's Motion to Exclude Evidence of Victims' Other Sexual Behavior and Sexual Disposition The Court begins its analysis with the Government's Motion to Exclude Evidence of Victims' Other Sexual Behavior  and Sexual Disposition (""Gov't Rule 412 Mot.""), ECF No. 27. The Government intends to call three witnesses who  will testify that Mr. Wilkins sexually exploited them for financial gain. Gov't Rule 412 Mot. at 1; see also Hr'g Tr. at 9.  Pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 412 and 403, the Government has moved to preclude Mr. Wilkins from  eliciting testimony from these witnesses during cross-examination about their other sexual behavior or their sexual  dispositions, including any commercial [**6]  sex acts engaged in by the witnesses before or after being allegedly  exploited by Mr. Wilkins. Id. In response, Mr. Wilkins contends that the exclusion of this evidence with respect to the  complainants  [*64]  would violate his constitutional right to present a complete defense. Def.'s Opp'n to Gov't Mot.  in Lim. to Exclude Evid. Of Victims' Other Sexual Behavior and Alleged Predisposition Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid.  412 and Not. of Intent to Offer 412 Evid. (""Def.'s Rule 412 Opp'n"") at 4-6, ECF No. 45. HN3[ ] Federal Rule of Evidence 412 provides that, in a ""civil or criminal proceeding involving alleged sexual  misconduct,"" both ""evidence offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual behavior"" and ""evidence offered  to prove a victim's sexual predisposition"" is ""not admissible."" Fed. R. Evid. 412. The animating purpose behind  Rule 412 is ""to safeguard the alleged victim against the invasion of privacy, potential embarrassment and sexual  stereotyping that is associated with public disclosure of intimate sexual details."" Fed. R. Evid. 412 advisory  committee's note to 1994 amendment. In a criminal case, there are three exceptions to this rule of exclusion, but  the only one argued by Mr. Wilkins is that this evidence is of the type that its ""exclusion would violate the  defendant's constitutional [**7]  rights."" Fed. R. Evid. 412(b)(1)(C). Specifically, Mr. Wilkins claims that excluding  evidence of the complainant's commercial sex work will abridge his constitutional right to present a complete  defense. See Def.'s Rule 412 Opp'n at 5-6. HN5[ ] A criminal defendant has a constitutional right to present evidence in his own defense. See Crane v.  Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 690, 106 S. Ct. 2142, 90 L.

Solomon, 399 F.3d 1231, 1239 (10th Cir. 2005) (""[A]  criminal defendant does not have a constitutional right to present evidence that is not relevant and not material to  his defense.""). Furthermore, a defendant's right to introduce evidence must also ""bow to accommodate other  legitimate interests,"" which includes protecting a victim of sexual misconduct from harassment and unnecessary  invasions of privacy. See Michigan v. Lucas, 500 U.S. 145, 149-50, 111 S. Ct. 1743, 114 L. Ed. 2d 205 (1991). HN6[ ] In the context of Rule 412, federal courts have found that a victim's participation in prostitution either  before or after a defendant uses force, threats, fraud, or coercion to cause the victim to engage in prostitution is  irrelevant to the question of whether [**8]  the defendant committed the crime. See United States v. Cephus, 684  F.3d 703, 708-09 (7th Cir. 2012); see also United States v. Roy, 781 F.3d 416, 420 (8th Cir. 2015) (""The victim's  participation in prostitution either before or after the time period in the indictment has no relevance to whether [the  defendant] beat her, threatened her, and took the money she made from prostitution in order to cause her to  engage in commercial sex.""). For example, in Cephus, the Seventh Circuit held that a defendant convicted of sex  trafficking could not introduce evidence that one of his victims had previously engaged in prostitution because the  fact that the victim had previously participated in commercial sex work was irrelevant. 684 F.3d at 708. The court  noted that ""the fact that [the victim] had been a prostitute before"" had no bearing on whether the defendant had  beaten or threatened her during the time period in the indictment. Id. In finding prior involvement in prostitution  irrelevant, these cases thus recognize the illogical and impermissible assumption of the following inference: that  simply because the victim had previously engaged in prostitution, it was somehow less likely that she was coerced  or threatened to engage in prostitution on a later occasion. Mr. Wilkins contends that excluding evidence that the complainant [**9]  was involved in prostitution before  connecting with Mr. Wilkins would leave out a critical part of the story: the complainant knew Mr. Wilkins since she  was eight years old, they had an ""up and down friendship,"" and the complainant contacted Mr. Wilkins for protection  after she was assaulted by ""Keon"" for ""renegading""—i.e., engaging in commercial sex work in a prostitution zone  without having someone to vouch for her. See Def.'s Rule 412 Opp'n at 5. Thus, he claims that this evidence  ""crystalizes the notion that [the complainant] actively sought a way to stay in the sex trade rather than walking away  after she was assaulted by Keon, and is direct proof that her[] relationship with Mr. Wilkins was not the product of  coercion."" Id. at 6. The Government disputes this factual recitation, arguing that the complainant did not start  working for Mr. Wilkins until eighteen months after the assault Mr. Wilkins details. Gov't Reply to Def.'s Opp'n to  Gov't Mot. in Lim. to Excl. Evid. Of Victims' Other Sexual Behavior and Alleged Predisposition Pursuant to Fed. R.  Evid. 412 (""Gov't Rule 412 Reply"") at 4, ECF No. 57. Even accepting Mr. Wilkins's factual assertions as true,  evidence of the complainant's previous commercial sex [**10]  work is wholly irrelevant to whether Mr. Wilkins  coerced her to engage in prostitution during the time period alleged in the superseding indictment, because nothing  about the complainant's prior sexual behavior makes it more or less likely that Mr. Wilkins coerced her into traveling  in  [*66]  interstate commerce to engage in prostitution. The fact that the complainant ""sought a way to stay in the  sex trade"" at one point has no bearing on whether Mr. Wilkins coerced her to engage in prostitution on a later  occasion. Holding otherwise would permit the chain of inferences rejected by Cephus and Roy: that because the  complainant had previously engaged in prostitution, it is somehow less likely she would have been coerced by Mr.  Wilkins to engage in prostitution during the charged time period. Consequently, because evidence of the  complainant's prior involvement in prostitution is irrelevant to whether Mr. Wilkins coerced her to engage in  prostitution during the time period in the indictment, Mr. Wilkins does not have a constitutional right to present it.  See Libby, 475 F. Supp. 2d at 91. Thus, the Court grants the Government's Rule 412 motion in limine. Even if evidence that the complainant was involved in commercial sex work was [**11]  relevant and admissible  under Rule 412, the Court would still exclude the evidence under Rule 403. HN7[ ] Rule 403 excludes relevant  evidence ""if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the  issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of  cumulative evidence."" Fed. R. Evid. 403. The probative value of a piece of evidence ""may be calculated by  comparing evidentiary alternatives,"" Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 184, 117 S. Ct. 644, 136 L. Ed. 2d  574 (1997), and when evaluating whether to exclude evidence on grounds of unfair prejudice, the ""availability of  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *64; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **7 Page 18 of 43 other means of proof may . . . be an appropriate factor,"" id. (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 403 advisory committee's notes).  The crux of Mr. Wilkins's argument is that his longstanding personal relationship with the complainant negates the  contention that he coerced her into engaging in prostitution. See Def.'s Rule 412 Opp'n at 5-6. Mr. Wilkins is  certainly free to elicit testimony from the complainant about their longstanding friendship, and any outreach she  made to Mr. Wilkins concerning her personal safety. This would allow Mr. Wilkins the opportunity to present this  ""critical piece"" of his ""complete defense"" while avoiding disclosure of the complainant's other sexual [**12]   behavior. The Government does not oppose the admission of this type of testimony. See Hr'g Tr. at 12 (statement  of Government counsel indicating that ""had the victim approached the defendant and initiated contact in any way,  that's admissible""). Considering this evidentiary alternative that exists to demonstrate the relationship between Mr.  Wilkins and the complainant, and cognizant of the need to ""safeguard the alleged victim against the invasion of  privacy, potential embarrassment and sexual stereotyping that is associated with public disclosure of intimate  sexual details,"" Fed. R. Evid. advisory committee's note to 1994 amendment, the Court finds the probative value of  the complainant's other sexual behavior substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. Accordingly, the  Government's motion to exclude this evidence is granted. B. The Government's Motion to Preclude Use of Victim's Last Names The Government has also filed an unopposed motion, pursuant to the Crime Victims' Rights Act, to preclude the  use of the complainants' last names throughout the course of the trial. Gov't. Mot. to Preclude Use of Victims' Last  Names, ECF No. 28. It argues that this is necessary in order to prevent the complainants from [**13]  being subject  to ""harassment, humiliation and/or obstruction form the defendant, the media, and others . . . [and] to protect the  safety  [*67]  of these vulnerable witnesses."" Id. at 1. Mr. Wilkins does not oppose this request. See Hr'g Tr. at 18.  Accordingly, the Court grants the motion to allow each of the complainants to testify using only their first names,  and directs Mr. Wilkins's counsel to also refrain from using the complainants' full names during his cross- examination and argument. C. The Government's Motion to Admit Business Records The Government next provides notice of its intent to offer a variety of business records under Federal Rule of  Evidence 803(6), including records from ""hotels, online advertising websites, social media websites, cellular  telephone companies, internet service providers, DC License Plate Readers, and correctional facilities."" Gov't Mot.  to Introduce Evid. Pursuant to Fed. Rule Evid. 803(6) and 902(11) at 2, ECF No. 33. Instead of calling foundation  witnesses for each of the records, the Government intends to provide ""a written declaration from a custodian of the  records certifying that the records were made in accordance with the requirements of Rule 803(6),"" as per the  dictates of Rule 902(11). Id. The parties represented at the motions [**14]  hearing that they are largely in  agreement on this issue. The Court reiterates that the Government is to specify in the pretrial statement which  records they wish to introduce at trial, and must provide the relevant certifications to Mr. Wilkins's counsel so he  may raise objections as appropriate. D. The Government's Notice of Intent to Offer Expert Witness Testimony The Government next provides notice of its intent to offer the expert testimony of FBI Agent William B. Shute,  explaining that he will use cell site and GPS data records from two telephone numbers to prepare maps with plotted  cell site locations, which will correspond with ""the movement of these phones between Norfolk, VA and  Washington, D.C. during the time periods alleged in the counts charged in the Indictment."" See Gov't Rule 702 Mot.  at 2, ECF No. 34. Mr. Wilkins does not oppose the admission of Special Agent Shute's testimony. The Court  reminds the Government, as it stated on the record at the motions hearing, see Hr'g Tr. at 26, that they must  provide to Mr. Wilkins's counsel in a timely manner any data analysis or exhibits that Agent Shute is preparing for  trial. 538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *66; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **11 Page 19 of 43 E. The Government's Motion to Prohibit References to Potential [**15]  Penalties The Government next requests, as one part of their omnibus Motion in Limine (""Gov't MIL""), ECF No. 35, that the  Court prohibit Mr. Wilkins's counsel from introducing evidence, advancing arguments or questions, or otherwise  mentioning any potential penalties Mr. Wilkins may face if convicted. Id. at 1. HN8[ ] When a jury has no  sentencing function, it should not consider the question of punishment in arriving at its verdict. See Shannon v.  United States, 512 U.S. 573, 579, 114 S. Ct. 2419, 129 L. Ed. 2d 459 (1994) (noting that evidence relating to the  punishment and effect of a defendant's conviction are not probative as to innocence or guilt and can needlessly  confuse the jury); see also Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 2.505 (5th ed. 2011)  (instructing that the question of possible punishment is not for the jury). Mr. Wilkins does not contest the  Government's motion, and has made clear to the Court that he does not intend to advance any arguments related  to the potential penalties Mr. Wilkins may face. See Def.'s Opp'n to Gov't Mot. in Lim. at 2, ECF No. 48; see also  Hr'g Tr. at 27. Accordingly, (though perhaps a moot point), the Court will grant the Government's  [*68]  motion to  preclude the introduction of this type of evidence. F. The Government's [**16]  Motion to Permit Case Agent to Remain at the Government's Table but Exclude  Other Witnesses from the Courtroom During Trial The Government also requests, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 615(3), that the Court allow the case agent  for this matter, Detective Sullivan, to be present in the courtroom and remain at counsel table throughout trial, while  all other witnesses are excluded from the courtroom. Gov't MIL at 3. HN9[ ] Federal Rule of Evidence 615  provides that upon a party's request or by its own authority, a court ""must order witnesses excluded so that they  cannot hear other witness' testimony."" Fed. R. Evid. 615. But the rule exempts ""an officer or employee of a party  that is not a natural person, after being designated as the party's representative by its attorney."" Fed. R. Evid.  615(b); see also United States v. Lee, 834 F.3d 145, 162 (2d Cir. 2016) (affirming decision to exempt ATF special  agent because he was properly within Rule 615(b) exemption as a 'representative' of the government). Mr. Wilkins's  counsel made clear at the motions hearing that he does not oppose this request, which, as already explained, is  consistent with the governing Rules of Evidence. See Hr'g. Tr. at 27. Accordingly, Detective Sullivan will be  permitted to remain at the Government's table throughout trial, while the other witnesses will be excluded. G. The Government's [**17]  Motion to Exclude Evidence Not Produced in Reciprocal Discovery The Court turns next to the Government's request to exclude any evidence that Mr. Wilkins has not provided to the  Government in reciprocal discovery. See Gov't MIL at 4. HN10[ ] The Court reiterates that Rule 16(b)(1)(A)  imposes a ""reciprocal discovery requirement"" between the United States and a criminal defendant. See United  States v. Hardy, 586 F.3d 1040, 1043 (6th Cir. 2009). The Court accordingly orders that Mr. Wilkins comply with  these obligations regarding providing reciprocal discovery to the extent it exists. H. The Government's Motion to Preclude Mr. Wilkins from Introducing Self-Serving Hearsay The Government has also filed a general motion to alert Mr. Wilkins's counsel and the Court that it intends to  introduce multiple statements made by Mr. Wilkins as admissions by party-opponent pursuant to Federal Rule of  Evidence 801(d)(2), and seek to bar Mr. Wilkins from subsequently introducing any of his own statements, which  the Government contends remain barred as hearsay. Gov't MIL at 4. HN11[ ] The Court reminds both parties that  Federal Rule of Evidence 801 prohibits hearsay, which is defined as any ""out-of-court statement offered to prove  the truth of the matter asserted."" Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). While the Federal Rules of Evidence set forth various  exceptions to hearsay, self-serving [**18]  hearsay is not one of those. See United States v. Rivera-Hernandez, 497  F.3d 71, 82 n.5 (1st Cir. 2007) (internal citation omitted) (""To be received in evidence an admission . . . must be  contrary to that party's position at the time of the trial.""); United States v. Palow, 777 F.2d 52, 56 (1st Cir. 1985)  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *67; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **14 Page 20 of 43 (holding that Rule 801(d)(2)(A) excludes the introduction of self-serving statements by the party making them).  Consequently, Mr. Wilkins is prohibited from introducing self-serving hearsay statements, though the Court will, of  course, make these fact specific determinations as necessary if they arise during trial.  [*69]  I. The Government's Motion for Admission of Jail Call Admissions The Government has stated its intent to introduce admissions and statements captured during the defendant's  recorded jail calls as non-hearsay admissions of a party opponent under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2). Gov't  MIL at 6. During the motions hearing, Mr. Wilkins's counsel confirmed that he is in receipt of the jail phone calls in  question, and requested the specific phone calls the Government intends to introduce be identified. Hr'g Tr. at 29.  The Court directs the Government to do so, and also to provide Mr. Wilkins's counsel with the applicable log that  identifies which of the calls applies to each of the complainants. It will decline to rule further on this motion at  this [**19]  time. J. The Government's Motion for Preclusion of Mr. Wilkins's Counsel Cross-Examining Government  Witnesses Regarding Inadmissible Criminal Convictions The Government initially moved, prior to the filing of the superseding indictment, to preclude Mr. Wilkins's counsel  from cross-examining any Government witnesses regarding criminal convictions that are inadmissible under the  Federal Rules of Evidence. See Gov't MIL at 7. During the motions hearing both parties indicated that the criminal  histories of the three complainants had been provided to Mr. Wilkins's counsel, and the parties would work through  this issue and submit an update to the Court in their Joint Pretrial submission. See Hr'g Tr. at 33. Accordingly, the  Court takes no action on this motion at this time. K. The Government's Motion to Admit Electronic Communications The Government has also filed a motion stating its intent to introduce text messages and Instagram multimedia  messages between Mr. Wilkins and certain complainants. See Gov't Mot. Admit Electronic Evid., ECF No. 36. The  Government states that it is prepared to demonstrate the communications' relevancy and authenticity pursuant to  Federal Rules of Evidence 401 and 901, and invoke exemptions to [**20]  the rule against hearsay pursuant to  Federal Rule of Evidence 801 as needed. Id. The Court directs the parties to move forward with the exchange of  the proposed trial exhibits, so Mr. Wilkins's counsel can raise specific objections as warranted, which the Court can  then rule on as necessary. L. The Government's Motion to Introduce Various Rule 404(b) and Rule 609 Evidence The Government's final motion requests, pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 404(b) and 609, the admission of a  wide variety of evidence pertaining to Mr. Wilkins's past interactions with law enforcement and his past criminal  convictions. See Gov't Mot. in Lim. to Introduce Evid. Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)/609 (""Gov't 404(b) Mot.""),  ECF No. 40. HN12[ ] Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) prohibits the use of ""other crimes, wrongs, or acts . . . to  prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the  character."" Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(1). Prior bad acts are permitted, however, as evidence of ""motive, opportunity,  intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident."" Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(2). This  list of permitted uses in Rule 404(b) of other crimes evidence is not exhaustive. United States v. Miller, 895 F.2d  1431, 1435-36, 283 U.S. App. D.C. 9 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (citing United States v. Moore, 732 F.2d 983, 987 n.31, 235  U.S. App. D.C. 381 (D.C. Cir. 1984)). Importantly, ""Rule 404(b) is a rule of inclusion rather than exclusion,"" as it  prohibits only evidence ""which lacks any purpose but proving  [*70]  character."" [**21]  United States v. Bowie, 232  F.3d 923, 929-30, 344 U.S. App. D.C. 34 (D.C. Cir. 2000). In short, the rule operates as a prohibition on pure  propensity evidence that cannot serve any other probative purpose. 538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *68; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **18 Page 21 of 43 HN13[ ] To determine admissibility under Rule 404(b), courts conduct a two-part analysis. Miller, 895 F.2d at  1435. First, a court must consider whether the evidence proffered is ""probative of a material issue other than  character."" United States v. Clarke, 24 F.3d 257, 264, 306 U.S. App. D.C. 251 (D.C. Cir. 1994); Fed. R. Evid.  404(b). Next, if the evidence meets this threshold, the Court examines whether the probative value is ""substantially  outweighed"" by a danger of unfair prejudice such that the Court should exclude admission. Miller, 895 F.2d at 1435  (quoting Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 687, 108 S. Ct. 1496, 99 L. Ed. 2d 771 (1988)); see also Fed.  R. Evid. 403. Evidence is unfairly prejudicial if it prejudices a defendant's case ""for reasons other than its probative  value,"" United States v. Wallace, 124 Fed. Appx. 164, 167 (4th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted), such as by creating ""an  undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis,"" United States v. Gartmon, 146 F.3d 1015, 1021, 331  U.S. App. D.C. 74 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (quoting Old Chief, 519 U.S. at 180). HN14[ ] It must be noted, however, that Rule 404(b) applies only to extrinsic evidence of other crimes or bad acts  and is not required when the admissibility of ""intrinsic"" evidence is at issue. Bowie, 232 F.3d at 929. In this Circuit,  evidence is considered ""intrinsic"" when it is either ""part of the charged offense"" or an uncharged act ""performed  contemporaneously with the charged crime . . . [that] facilitate[s] the commission of the charged crime."" Id; see also  id. at 928-29 (rejecting [**22]  the approach of other Circuits that define intrinsic evidence to encompass any  evidence that ""explains the circumstances"" or ""completes the story"" as an impermissibly low threshold that would  allow for Rule 404(b) to be circumvented on a ""flimsy basis.""). Accordingly, any evidence of the crimes charged in  Mr. Wilkins's superseding indictment or evidence of crimes that occurred contemporaneously and to further the  charged offenses can be considered intrinsic, and is exempt from the Rule 404(b) analysis. See id. at 927  (""Evidence that constitutes the very crime being prosecuted is not [prior bad act evidence].""); see, e.g., United  States v. Alexander, 331 F.3d 116, 126, 356 U.S. App. D.C. 299 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (statement that Defendant ""'[has]  a gun on him now' constituted intrinsic, admissible evidence on [a] felon-in-possession charge"" (alteration in  original)); United States v. Coughlin, 821 F. Supp. 2d 35, 45 (D.D.C. 2011) (determining that evidence of the  defendant's medical and athletic activities constituted intrinsic evidence of the charged offense of making a  fraudulent claim to the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund). However, intrinsic evidence remains  [*71]   subject to a Rule 403 balancing analysis. See Fed. R. Evid. 403. The Government contends that much of the  evidence in dispute here is intrinsic evidence, rendering any Rule 404(b) analysis unnecessary. The Court reviews  each of the Government's [**23]  requested evidentiary admissions in turn. 1. Evidence of Mr. Wilkins's Alleged Acts of Physical and Sexual Violence The Government has moved to enter into evidence several instances of physical and sexual violence Mr. Wilkins  allegedly committed against one of the complainants, J.J. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 13-14. These incidents include (1) a  physical altercation in a hotel room in North Carolina where J.J. was knocked unconscious and woke up in an  Atlanta hospital with permanent injuries; (2) a January 10, 2013, assault that occurred in a Charlottesville, Virginia  hotel that apparently transpired after Mr. Wilkins demanded money from J.J. to pay bills for the mother of his child,  and when he found out that J.J. lied about not having money, he severely beat her; (3) a September 19, 2011,  assault that J.J. reported to the Virginia Beach Police Department that involved Mr. Wilkins forcing her out of a car  he was driving (by a hotel where she was engaging in commercial sex at his behest), after which he hit her in the  stomach, pulled her hair, and stole her purse; (4) a December 19, 2011, assault reported to the Montgomery  County Police that occurred at a Days Inn hotel after [**24]  J.J. told Mr. Wilkins she wanted to return to Norfolk,  Virginia and Mr. Wilkins assaulted her when she tried to leave, stealing her cash and cell phone; and (5) a February  16, 2013, attack that J.J. reported to the Norfolk Police Department, describing that Mr. Wilkins became physically          538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *70; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **21 Page 22 of 43 violent and cut her upper body when she refused to have sexual intercourse with him. Id. at 13-15. The Government  has stated its intent to have both J.J. testify to these incidents and also to call law enforcement to describe and  corroborate these various assaults. Id. at 12, 15. Mr. Wilkins, unsurprisingly, has moved to have this testimony excluded under both Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b)  and Rule 401. See Opp'n to Gov't Mot. in Lim. to Introduce Evid. Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) & 609 (""Def.'s  404(b) Opp'n"") at 8, ECF No. 64. He contends that there is not any connection between this violence—which he  seems to characterize as being of the domestic violence variety—and the charges of sex trafficking that are at issue  in this case. See Hr'g Tr. at 59. Consequently, he claims that this evidence can serve only as impermissible  character propensity evidence, since it is not relevant to the charged crimes, and must be barred due to its highly  prejudicial nature. [**25]  Id. He is particularly concerned about the introduction of testimony relating to the alleged  events of February 16, 2013, as he believes these events can be construed as an attempted rape, and thus would  be highly prejudicial if presented to a jury. Def.'s 404(b) Opp'n at 8-9. The Court, while acknowledging the likely powerful impact of this evidence, finds that Mr. Wilkins's argument  regarding the supposed limited relevance of these assaults to the charged offenses to misunderstand the relevant  law. Mr. Wilkins is charged with two counts of Sex Trafficking by Force, Fraud, or Coercion, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  § 1591(a)(1), among other related charges. See Superseding Indictment at 1. Accordingly, the jury will be tasked  with determining whether Mr. Wilkins used force, fraud, or coercion to cause the three complainants to engage in  commercial sex acts. HN15[ ] Coercion, for the purposes of this offense, is defined as ""(A) threats of serious harm  to or physical restraint against any person; (B) any  [*72]  scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to  believe that failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any person; or (C)  the abuse or threatened abuse of law or the [**26]  legal process."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(2). ""Serious harm"" is further  defined to include both physical and non-physical harm that is ""sufficiently serious, under all the surrounding  circumstances, to compel a reasonable person of the same background and in the same circumstances to perform  or to continue performing commercial sexual activity in order to avoid incurring that harm."" Id. § 1591(e)(5). HN16[ ] Given the realities of the different types of coercion sex trafficking victims are frequently subjected to,  courts have recognized that traffickers often force victims ""to continue prostituting by creating an environment of  fear and dependence through the use of threats of violence, actual violence, and various forms of manipulation  against them."" United States v. Scott, 434 F. App'x 103, 106 (3d Cir. 2011). When evaluating if a defendant exerted  coercive force over a complainant, juries are thus directed to evaluate the totality of a defendant's conduct toward a  trafficking victim, including any threats or specific instances of past violence that may have created a ""culture of  fear"" such that the victim's conduct was rendered involuntary. See, e.g., United States v. Carson, 870 F.3d 584, 600  (7th Cir. 2017) (finding that evidence of a defendant's rape of a sex trafficking victim was ""direct evidence of [the  defendant] coercing one of his victims [**27]  and exerting control over her. . . . [I]t [wa]s a key part of the message  from the defendant that 'I control you and can do as I please'""); United States v. Webster, No. 08-cv 30311, 2011  U.S. App. LEXIS 26438, 2011 WL 8478276, at *2 (9th Cir. Nov. 28, 2011) (finding that ""severe beatings"" were used  to create ""an environment of fear of physical harm"" that was ""more than sufficient"" to conclude the defendant  exercised coercion over sex trafficking victims for the purpose of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(2)(B)). Indeed, such a culture  of fear and coercion can be created even in the absence of a defendant's abuse of a specific victim, when the victim  is made aware of the defendant's history of physical or sexual violence against others. See United States v. Harris,  701 F.2d 1095, 1100 (4th Cir. 1983) (evidence that defendant beat other people—though not the victim—was  relevant because it contributed to a ""reign of physical terror""); United States v. Alzanki, 54 F.3d 994, 999 (1st Cir.  1995) (noting, in describing the facts, that ""[t]he climate of fear was enhanced"" due to the victim witnessing her  employer physically abusing his wife); Webster, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 26438, 2011 WL 8478276 at *2 (explaining  that defendant cultivated an environment of fear by ""severe beatings that [he] administered, which he had the other  women and girls attend and observe"" and ""naturally cause[d] the observers to infer that similar violence might be  inflicted on them if they disobeyed any of [his] rules.""). The Court can therefore [**28]  quickly dispose of Mr. Wilkins's argument that these violent episodes are somehow  irrelevant to the pending charges in this case. Indeed, several courts have considered this exact issue. In United  States v. Evans, a defendant also facing sex trafficking charges argued that the violent physical assaults he inflicted  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *71; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **24 Page 23 of 43 on his trafficking victims were not evidence of forced sex work but rather completely separate evidence of ""domestic  violence"" in their personal intimate relationship. 272 F.3d 1069, 1097 (8th Cir. 2001). The court summarily rejected  this argument, concluding that, ""these violent acts are relevant and probative of Mann Act violations because they  describe actions taken to control and discipline"" the women he sexually exploited and happened to also have  personal relationships with.  [*73]  Id; see also United States v. Nichols, No. 15-cr-756-1, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  15081, 2019 WL 398775, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 31, 2019) (rejecting defendant's argument that physical abuse ""was  related to personal matters, not [his prostitution] business.""). Accordingly, the Court finds that these past assaults constitute direct, intrinsic evidence of coercion that Mr. Wilkins  used to cause the complainants to engage in commercial sex acts. This violence is thus ""part of the charged  offense,"" Bowie, 232 F.3d at 929, and exempt from Rule 404(b). See, e.g., Carson, 870 F.3d at 600 (determining  that a past rape [**29]  of sex trafficking victim was not bad act evidence, but ""evidence of the very crime [of sex  trafficking by fraud, coercion, or force], pure and simple""); United States v. Washington, 810 Fed. Appx. 478, 481  (8th Cir. 2020) (finding that evidence of domestic assault of sex trafficking victim was directly relevant to the  question of whether the victim's conduct was voluntary or whether coercion or force was used, and thus properly  admitted as intrinsic evidence regarding a sex trafficking charge); Campbell, 764 F.3d at 888 (finding that evidence  of a ""pattern intended to cause a person to believe that failure to perform an act [of prostitution] would result in  serious harm"" to be intrinsic, direct evidence of coercion under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(2)(B) (alteration in original)). This evidence also passes the Rule 403 balancing test. For the reasons described above, this evidence is highly  probative as to the question of whether Mr. Wilkins used ""force, fraud, or coercion"" to get the complainants to  engage in sex work. While there is prejudice inherent in this evidence, it is only that which stems from the legitimate  probative force of the evidence and is directly related to the central question in this case. See Wallace, 124 Fed.  Appx. at 167. Thus, the probative value of this evidence is far from ""substantially outweighed"" by any unfair  prejudice. [**30]  The Court will accordingly allow J.J. to testify regarding these acts of physical violence, to help the  jury understand why she and the other complainants may have felt coerced into engaging in sex work at Mr.  Wilkins's insistence. The Court will also allow the introduction of corroborating testimony from law enforcement to  the extent it is necessary to support J.J.'s credibility. 2. Evidence of Mr. Wilkins's Access to Firearms The Government has also moved to introduce evidence that demonstrates that during the time of the charged  offenses, Mr. Wilkins had ready access to firearms. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 3. It seeks to accomplish this by  introducing testimony from both responding law enforcement and a complainant who witnessed a June 12, 2019  incident in Norfolk, Virginia, where Mr. Wilkins allegedly shot himself in the groin. Id. Mr. Wilkins opposes this  admission, arguing that this testimony is inadmissible under both Rule 402 and Rule 404(b), and furthermore, that  any argument the gunshot wound he suffered was ""self-inflicted"" is speculative. Def.'s 404(b) Opp'n at 4. The  Government responds by positing that evidence of Mr. Wilkins's gun possession is intrinsic to the charged crimes,  due to its theory [**31]  that the complainants engaged in commercial sex acts at  [*74]  Mr. Wilkins behest due to a  fear of him that was driven, in part, by his ready access to deadly firearms. See Gov't Reply to Def.'s Opp'n to  Introduce Evid. Pursuant FRE 404(b) & 609 (""Gov't 404(b) Reply"") at 3-4, ECF No. 66. The Court agrees that evidence of gun possession in this case is intrinsic evidence because it is ""part of the  charged offense."" Bowie, 232 F.3d at 929. This is because, mirroring in many ways the analysis this Court has  already conducted regarding Mr. Wilkins's past physical assaults of the complainants, evidence of Mr. Wilkins's  access to firearms constitutes a source of his potential coercion over the complainants. HN17[ ] The Government  must prove at trial that Mr. Wilkins used force, fraud or coercion to cause the three complainants to engage in  commercial sex acts and, as previously detailed, coercion includes ""any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause  a person to believe that failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any      538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *72; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **28 Page 24 of 43 person."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(2). Firearms are potentially deadly weapons. Evidence regarding Mr. Wilkins's access  to guns, therefore, goes directly to a possible coercive scheme he used to accomplish [**32]  a key element of the  charged offenses. Other courts have reached similar conclusions and allowed for the admission of evidence  demonstrating that sex trafficking victims were aware that the defendant owned or had access to firearms. See,  e.g., United States v. Lewis, 762 F. App'x 786, 798 (11th Cir.) (per curiam) (affirming district court's admission of  undated photograph of defendant holding a firearm, as it ""tended to corroborate [complainant's] testimony"" that she  was coerced into engaging in prostitution due to the defendant's habitual use of firearms) cert. granted, judgment  vacated on other grounds, 140 S. Ct. 613, 205 L. Ed. 2d 380 (2019); Nichols, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15081, 2019  WL 398775 at *12 (sustaining sex trafficking conviction based in part on victims' testimony that ""they knew [the  defendant] to own and carry guns"" thus contributing to coercive environment that caused complainants to engage in  sex work); United States v. Roach, 896 F.3d 1185, 1196 (10th Cir. 2018) (finding evidence that defendant  threatened victim with gun in lap ""showed that [he] used violence to coerce [a victim-witness] into prostitution""). Turning to the Rule 403 analysis, the Court finds that allowing the admission of testimony describing the entirety of  the June 12, 2019 incident does, however, pose a substantial risk of confusion of the issues such that even the  strong probative value of this evidence could be [**33]  substantially outweighed. See Fed. R. Evid. 403. In  particular, the evidence related to the specifics of Mr. Wilkins's injury—i.e., whether the injury was self-inflicted—  poses a heightened risk of unfair prejudice or confusion of the issues because it is unclear what exactly transpired,  and this lack of clarity could allow the jury to make improper and unnecessary inferences or simply generate  confusion. Furthermore, this issue is utterly tangential to the core issues before the Court in this case, and  admission of this fact risks allowing the trial to devolve into a mini-trial on the question of if Mr. Wilkins shot  himself—a question that is completely irrelevant to the case at hand. Indeed, even the Government admitted to   [*75]  the Court at the motions hearing that the question of who shot Mr. Wilkins (or if the wound was self- inflicted)  is ""not the issue here."" Hr'g Tr. at 50. Given that both parties appear to agree, the Court holds that only evidence of  Mr. Wilkins's gun possession or access as illustrated by the June 12, 2019 incident is admissible. The complainants  remain free to testify regarding their personal knowledge of Mr. Wilkins's gun access or possession to the extent it  informed their decisions [**34]  to engage in sex work at his command, and corroborating testimony from law  enforcement describing the June 12, 2019 incident is admissible as long as it stays within the parameters described  here. 3. Evidence of Mr. Wilkins's Access to and Distribution of Illegal Drugs The Government has also stated its intent to ""elicit evidence, corroborated by [Mr. Wilkins's] criminal record, that  [he] had access to, possessed, and distributed illicit narcotics throughout the period of time charged in the  Indictment."" Gov't 404(b) Reply at 10. Mr. Wilkins objects to this testimony, contending that this line of evidence is  not relevant to any issue other than his character and accordingly must be excluded. Def.'s 404(b) Opp'n at 6-7.  The Government argues in response that, as with gun possession and Mr. Wilkins's past assaults, this evidence is  intrinsic to the charged sex trafficking offenses such that Rule 404(b) does not apply. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 10-11.  The Court agrees in theory, though in light of the apparently limited relevance of the evidence and high risk of unfair  prejudice, the Court will impose significant restrictions on the admission of this category of evidence. In many ways this line of evidence [**35]  repeats the same analysis conducted regarding the evidence of Mr.  Wilkins's firearm use and alleged past assaults on the complainants. In sum, to the extent evidence of Mr. Wilkins's  access and provision of illegal narcotics to the complainants facilitated his ""coercive control"" over them, this  evidence would become part of the charged offense itself. See Bowie, 232 F.3d at 927 (""Evidence that constitutes  the very crime being prosecuted is not [prior bad act evidence]""). HN18[ ] Where sex trafficking victims had been  supplied drugs, evidence of a defendant's access to illegal narcotics has been found appropriately admissible for  this purpose. See, e.g., United States v. Campbell, 49 F.3d 1079, 1084 (5th Cir. 1995) (finding evidence of drugs  provided to complainants by defendant while defendant allegedly transported complainants involved in prostitution      538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *74; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **31 Page 25 of 43 to be ""relevant intrinsic evidence of how the actual violation occurred""); United States v. Betts, 911 F.3d 523, 530  (8th Cir. 2018) (finding evidence that defendants provided victim-complainants various drugs and alcohol intrinsic  evidence of how defendants ""controlled the girls' behavior""). Accordingly, evidence of Mr. Wilkins's provision of  illegal narcotics to the complainants would be properly admitted here as intrinsic evidence of any coercive force  used to compel the sex [**36]  trafficking crimes at issue. However, the admission of this evidence runs into trouble at the Rule 403 balancing stage, when the Court turns to  ""assess the probative value of the evidence as compared to the risk of unfair prejudice."" United States v.  Hitselberger, 991 F. Supp. 2d 108, 127 (D.D.C. 2014) (cleaned up) (quoting United States v. Larrahondo, 885 F.  Supp. 2d 209, 227 (D.D.C. 2012). First, admission of the entirety of the evidence the Government seeks to enter  into evidence contains content of marginal probative value. Simply because Mr. Wilkins has prior drug offense  arrests and convictions does not mean he was providing illegal narcotics to the complainants. Underlining  [*76]   the point, the Government has not made clear that any of the three complainants will testify that Mr. Wilkins  provided them with illegal drugs while they engaged in commercial sex work for his benefit. Further diminishing any  probative value of this evidence, at the motions hearing the Government conceded that while they intend to enter  into evidence Mr. Wilkins's felony conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine, this is not one of the  narcotics the three complainants are alleged to have used. Rather, one of the complainants had an underlying  heroin addiction, and the Government alleges that generally all the complainants used substances [**37]  such as  ""molly"" and marijuana to engage in commercial sexual activity. See Hr'g Tr. at 49. This discrepancy is telling, and  quite clearly diminishes the probative value of any admission of evidence of Mr. Wilkins's access to or distribution of  otherwise unrelated drugs. Against this limited probative value, the admission of evidence describing Mr. Wilkins's past drug-related offenses  presents a substantial risk of unfair prejudice. HN19[ ] The risk of unfair prejudice is high when it comes to  evidence of past convictions. See, e.g., United States v. Watson, 171 F.3d 695, 703, 335 U.S. App. D.C. 232 (D.C.  Cir. 1999) (evidence of past drug convictions ""invites the jury to infer that [a defendant] has a propensity for drug  offenses.""). The Court is concerned that the jury could infer culpability based on this evidence, and not the charges  actually at issue in this case. See, e.g., United States v. Ring, 706 F.3d 460, 472, 403 U.S. App. D.C. 410 (D.C. Cir.  2013) (noting evidence is unfairly prejudicial when it has ""an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper  basis""). In the absence of a stronger, relevant connection between the drugs Mr. Wilkins is alleged to have  previously trafficked in and those provided to the three complainants, the Court finds this evidence's probative value  is substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. To address [**38]  these concerns the Court will allow the admission of evidence that relates to Mr. Wilkins's use of  illegal drugs as a coercive tactic to force the complainants to engage in sex work for his benefit. This means the  complainants will be able to testify and describe any provision of illegal narcotics Mr. Wilkins provided them. See,  e.g., United States v. Lewis, No. 415-cr-196, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27236, 2017 WL 750456, at *4 (S.D. Ga. Feb.  27, 2017) (finding that testimony from alleged victims that defendant provided them ""with drugs to enable them to  engage in commercial sexual activity"" was admissible evidence). To the extent Mr. Wilkins has prior law  enforcement interactions that demonstrate his possession of those specific drugs, that evidence is admissible to  corroborate the veracity of the complainants' accounts. But any evidence of Mr. Wilkins's use or access to drugs he  is not alleged to have provided to the complainants—which the Court understands to encompass the majority of the  drug-related prior ""bad acts"" the Government currently seeks to enter into evidence—must be excluded as the risk  of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs any probative value this evidence can provide. 4. Unnamed Witness Testimony The Government has also moved to introduce testimony from an unnamed male witness [**39]  who will present  testimony regarding how Mr. Wilkins began to engage in the commercial sexual exploitation of women in 2011 or  2012, and went on to transport the three complainants to Washington D.C. from Norfolk, Virginia to engage in sex  work. Gov't Mot. 404(b) at 11-12. He also is prepared to testify that he knew Mr. Wilkins assaulted one of the  complainants  [*77]  when she ""got out of line"" and Mr. Wilkins ""had to correct her."" Id. at 12. 538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *75; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **35 Page 26 of 43 The Court begins by noting that it is generally unclear if the Government still intends to introduce this evidence. At  the time of the original briefing on this issue, the indictment had not yet been superseded, so the testimony of this  unnamed witness was to be admitted to discuss ""the defendant's commercial sexual exploitation of women other  than the victims who serve as the basis for the counts charged in the current Indictment."" Id. But the Superseded  Indictment now presumably includes these women as named complainants. At the motions hearing Mr. Wilkins's  counsel objected to the admission of this testimony to the extent it may be hearsay or that this unnamed witness  may not be competent to testify to these issues. Without more information, the Court [**40]  is not prepared to  make a ruling on this issue today but instead directs the Government to clarify its position as to the current status of  this witness and the content and basis for any testimony he may provide. 5. Mr. Wilkins's Prior Contacts with Law Enforcement The Government also seeks to introduce into evidence a number of specific incidents of Mr. Wilkins's prior contacts  with law enforcement that it argues are ""indicative of commercial sexual exploitation."" Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 7  (capitalization omitted). The proposed evidence includes five separate interactions between law enforcement and  Mr. Wilkins that occurred on December 10, 2011, January 25, 2015, June 18, 2018, August 3, 2019, and  September 12, 2019, all of which fall within the time period he is charged with the offenses in the Superseding  Indictment. See id. at 7-10. Mr. Wilkins opposes the introduction of this evidence on a variety of different grounds,  but he generally alleges that these interactions are relevant only to show bad character, and thus violate Rule  404(b). Def.'s 404(b) Opp'n at 5-6. In response, the Government contends that the evidence is intrinsic to the  charged offenses such that Rule 404(b) does not apply. Gov't [**41]  Reply at 6-7. They also argue that even if this  evidence is found to be extrinsic, under a Rule 404(b) analysis these interactions are still admissible as highly  probative evidence of Mr. Wilkins's intent and motive to engage in sexual exploitation, as well as his knowledge of  ""what was happening inside the hotels where he was frequently arrested."" Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 18. The Court  reviews each interaction in turn. a. December 10, 2011 Interaction On December 10, 2011, during the time period covered by Count I of the Superseding Indictment when Mr. Wilkins  was allegedly sex trafficking complainant J.J. in Washington D.C., Mr. Wilkins was arrested in the District for  possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 7. The Government intends to offer law  enforcement testimony that, prior to Mr. Wilkins's arrest, police officers observed him speak with two women who  were engaged in commercial sex work at the corner of 16th Street and New York Avenue, before he parked his  Cadillac with Virginia tag XEJ4403 in the parking lot of the Comfort Inn located at 1601 New York  [*78]  Avenue,  Northeast, Washington D.C. Id. at 8. A search of the vehicle Mr. Wilkins was driving by law enforcement  revealed [**42]  cocaine in the driver's side door panel. Id. The Government argues that this information is intrinsic, rather than extrinsic, evidence of the charged offenses.  Gov't 404(b) Reply at 6-7. HN20[ ] As has already been noted, evidence can properly be considered intrinsic in  this Circuit if it is either an act the defendant is charged with, or if it occurred contemporaneously with the charged  offenses. See Bowie, 232 F. 3d at 927 (""Evidence that constitutes the very crime being prosecuted is not [prior bad  act evidence]""). Mr. Wilkins is charged with trafficking J.J. during the time of this police encounter. Indeed, the  Government appears to contend that at the time of this arrest J.J. was working in the hotel while Mr. Wilkins waited  outside. See Gov't 404(b) Reply at 8. As a result, location and proximity evidence—namely, that Mr. Wilkins was  found waiting in the parking lot of a hotel known for ongoing prostitution activity while the woman he is alleged to  have trafficked was inside engaging in commercial sex work for his financial gain—appears to be ""part of the  charged offense"" of sex trafficking J.J., or at the very least evidence of ""acts performed contemporaneously with the      538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *77; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **39 Page 27 of 43 charged crime . . . [that] facilitate [**43]  the commission of the charged crime."" Bowie, 232 F.3d at 929. The Court  therefore agrees that information pertaining to Mr. Wilkins's whereabouts during his December 10, 2011 arrest  constitute intrinsic evidence and are exempt from Rule 404(b). See id. This is not, however, the end of the Court's review, as intrinsic evidence must still pass the requisite Rule 403  balancing test in order to be admitted at trial. HN21[ ] Rule 403 provides that a court ""may exclude relevant  evidence if [that evidence's] probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following:  unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting  cumulative evidence."" Fed. R. Evid. 403. After completing the balancing test, the Court concludes that the probative  value of admitting this encounter with law enforcement as evidence of Mr. Wilkins's physical location is not  substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, because it is only prejudicial for reasons related to its  probative value. See Wallace, 124 Fed. Appx. at 167 (noting that ""[u]nfair prejudice under Rule 403 does not mean  the damage to a defendant's case that results from the legitimate probative force of the evidence"" quoting Jack B.  Weinstein & Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 404.21(3)(b) [**44]  (Joseph M. McLaughlin, ed.,  2d. ed. 2002)); Fed. R. Evid. 403. And bad acts evidence is typically ""not barred by Rule 403 where such evidence  'did not involve conduct any more sensational or disturbing than the crimes with which [the defendant] was  charged.'"" United States v. Fuertes, 805 F.3d 485, 494 (4th Cir. 2015) (alteration in original) (citation omitted). That  said, admission of the specific details of Mr. Wilkins's arrest beyond his locational information could pose unfair  prejudice. The Court is particularly concerned that allowing in evidence of the cocaine found in Mr. Wilkins's car  would be unduly prejudicial, as it poses the risk of ""lur[ing] the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different  from proof specific to the offense charged."" Old Chief, 519 U.S. at 180. Mr. Wilkins is not charged with drug  offenses in this case, nor does the Government contend that any of the complainants were addicted to cocaine and  he used this dependency to maintain his climate of coercion over them. See Hr'g Tr. at 49; see also supra Section  III.L.3. This piece of evidence is therefore of limited probative value and is substantially out weighed [*79]  by the  risk of prejudice. Accordingly, the Court will limit the admission of testimony from the December 11, 2011 police  interaction to exclude any reference to the drugs found in his car. b. January 25, 2015 Interaction On January 25, 2015, Mr. Wilkins was arrested in yet another hotel parking lot—this time for trespass in the parking  lot of a Red Roof Inn in Virginia Beach— when law enforcement found him sleeping in his car. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at  8. Prior to arrest, Mr. Wilkins was observed deleting information off his phone and putting something into his mouth  as the officers approached. Id. The Government intends to introduce evidence that two of the complainants were  inside a hotel engaging in commercial sex acts while Mr. Wilkins sat outside in a car. Gov't 404(b) Reply at 5-6. The  Government contends that this evidence is also intrinsic to the crimes charged in the Superseding Indictment. Id. at  6-7. The Court agrees, and for the reasons detailed below will allow this evidence to be admitted, subject to certain  limitations. The Court again finds that the evidence that Mr. Wilkins was outside of a hotel—this time allegedly while two of the  complainants engaged in commercial sex inside with clients for his financial benefit— is not an ""other crime"" but  rather ""direct evidence of the fact in issue."" [**45]  Bowie, 232 F.3d at 929 (quoting United States v. Badru, 97 F.3d  1471, 1474-75, 321 U.S. App. D.C. 137 (D.C. Cir. 1996)). The main fact in issue in this case is whether Mr. Wilkins  trafficked the complainants as he is charged. See generally Superseding Indictment. Consequently, Mr. Wilkins's  location is offered as intrinsic evidence of the charged offenses themselves.         538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *78; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **42 Page 28 of 43 Having determined that this evidence can properly be considered intrinsic, the Court turns next to the Rule 403  balancing test. Fed. R. Evid. 403. The Court is again concerned that the probative value of this evidence—which as  articulated by the Government is focused primarily on the locational and proximity evidence it provides— is  substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair propensity prejudice that would accrue if the entirety of this  interaction was entered into evidence. As Mr. Wilkins articulates, ""it is a stretch to argue that the acts of 'deleting  information off of his phone' and 'putting something in his mouth' would qualify as. . . relevant to . . . the allegations  made in this case."" Def.'s 404(b) Opp'n at 5. And while of limited relevance, this information could confuse the jury  or allow them to make an improper inference about his behavior. In short, there is a very real risk it would lead to  unfair speculation and innuendo. This danger [**46]  can be appropriately mitigated by limiting the admission of this  police encounter to focus on Mr. Wilkins's location and proximity to the hotel at the time of this police interaction,  while barring any testimony describing how he allegedly placed something in his mouth while sitting in the car or  deleted information off his phone.  [*80]  c. August 3, 2019 Interaction The Government next seeks to admit evidence stemming from an encounter between Mr. Wilkins and an  undercover MPD officer that occurred on August 3, 2019. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 8-10. The officer in question was, at  the time, working undercover as a sex worker, and Mr. Wilkins approached her to purchase sex. Id. at 9. She asked  him to come back shortly and observed him circling the block in a green van for roughly 10-15 minutes. Id. When he  returned, he informed her he was a pimp, and asked her who she worked for and why she was out ""on his block.""  Id. Mr. Wilkins apparently became agitated and ""got in the undercover officer's face"" before walking away. Id.  Shortly thereafter, he approached her for a second time, asked why she was ""giving money away,"" and then tried to  grab her fanny pack. Id. He also chest bumped her after she requested [**47]  that he not touch her and invited her  into his green van to talk. Id. The undercover officer refused, and ultimately left the area. Id. at 9-10. The  Government intends to introduce testimony from this undercover member of the MPD's Human Trafficking Unit in its  case-in-chief. Id. at 10. The Court will again begin by first determining if this evidence can be considered ""intrinsic"" to the charged crimes.  The Government argues it is, because it arises out of the same series of transactions as the charged offense, is  necessary to complete the story, and is inextricably intertwined with evidence regarding the charged offense. Gov't  404(b) Reply at 5-6 (citing United States v. Troya, 733 F.3d 1125, 1131 (11th Cir. 2013)). But as this Court has  already noted, this is not the standard this Circuit uses to define intrinsic evidence—evidence that ""completes the  story"" or ""arises from the same general transactions"" is not enough to qualify the evidence as intrinsic. Bowie, 232  F.3d at 929 (""As we have said, all relevant prosecution evidence explains the crime or completes the story. The fact  that omitting some evidence would render a story slightly less complete cannot justify circumventing Rule 404(b)  altogether.""). HN23[ ] Under Bowie, intrinsic evidence is strictly limited to evidence that [**48]  is either (1) part of  the charged offense itself or (2) an uncharged act performed contemporaneously and to facilitate the charged  crime. Id. The Court lacks necessary information at this time to be able to determine if this interaction can properly  be classified as intrinsic evidence. As Mr. Wilkins notes, ""[t]here is no allegation that this interaction involved any of  the complaining witnesses involved in this indictment, or that they were even on the scene—and no allegation that  this encounter took place on a day when any offense charged in the indictment occurred."" Def.'s 404(b) Opp'n. at 6.  It is therefore unclear if this interaction was somehow part of the charged offenses or ""performed  contemporaneously"" to further any of the charged sex trafficking acts. See Bowie, 232 F.3d at 929. However, the Court need not decisively resolve this issue today. That is because this evidence is clearly admissible  under Rule 404(b) as evidence of intent, knowledge, and lack of mistake. See Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(2). The  Government bears the burden in this case of proving that Mr. Wilkins knew that force, fraud or coercion was used to  cause the three complainants to engage in commercial sex work, and that the other offenses were knowingly  committed. [**49]  The undercover officer's testimony about the events of August 3, 2019—that Mr. Wilkins  attempted to both set up a commercial sex date with her and recruit her, that he referred to himself as a ""pimp,"" and  that he was in the vicinity of the ""Track"" driving a vehicle later linked to the transportation of one of the  complainants—constitutes  [*81]  highly probative evidence on this question of Mr. Wilkins knowledge and intent  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *79; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **45 Page 29 of 43 regarding the crimes that he is charged with. The evidence also serves to undercut any claim of accident or  mistake. This evidence is probative on several material issues other than character, and consequently meets the  first prong of the Rule 404(b) test. Turning to the second prong of the Rule 404(b) analysis, the Court finds that this testimony easily survives the Rule  403 balancing test, as the probative value (as described above) far outweighs any unfair prejudice. Indeed, nothing  about this evidence appears unfairly prejudicial in the sense it would cause a jury to make an improper inference— the only negative inferences arise from legitimate inferences a factfinder could draw from this evidence. See  Wallace, 124 Fed. Appx. at 167. Accordingly, this interaction may be admitted into evidence in full. 6. Additional Police Interactions [**50]  In addition to these three incidents that Mr. Wilkins specifically opposed the admission of in his opposition, Mr.  Wilkins contends that all evidence of any other police encounters must be excluded as unfairly prejudicial under  Rule 403. Def.'s 404(b) Opp'n at 8. The other three incidents the Government seeks to enter into evidence occurred  on November 10, 2015, June 18, 2018, and September 10, 2019. The Court finds that two of these incidents very clearly constitute intrinsic evidence. First, on November 10, 2015,  Mr. Wilkins was arrested for Possession with Intent to Distribute Cocaine. Gov't 404(b) Reply at 6. The Government  has moved to introduce testimony from law enforcement officials who will state that they were called to a hotel  located in Chesapeake, Virginia, where they observed a silver Cadillac parked outside. Id. When they approached  the car, they smelled marijuana, and found additional narcotics inside both the Cadillac and Mr. Wilkins's rectum. Id.  The police also spoke with O.R., one of the complainants in this case who was present at the scene. Id. Mr. Wilkins  told the police at the time that he was at the hotel with O.R., who he referred to as his girlfriend, because  their [**51]  home was being fumigated. Id. On September 12, 2019, an undercover member of the MPD's Human Trafficking Unit observed one of the  complainants being dropped off at a hotel in the District by a green van—the same vehicle that she recognized from  when Mr. Wilkins had previously confronted her on the Track. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 10. The complainant was  subsequently arrested for ""Solicitation of Prostitution"" and went on to admit that she had been dropped off by her  ""pimp,"" who went by ""Lucky."" Id. at 10-11. Law enforcement found the vehicle in question, which was driven by Mr.  Wilkins, who agreed to a search of the vehicle. Id. at 11. The search turned up several purses, a bulk package of  Trojan condoms and various items of women's clothing. Id. Mr. Wilkins was not arrested, but the Government now  seeks to introduce testimony from the complainant and law enforcement officers describing the incident. Both incidents constitute direct evidence of whether Mr. Wilkins trafficked and transported the complainants as he is  charged and are accordingly intrinsic evidence. In seeming recognition of this fact, Mr. Wilkins does not dispute this  point and instead argues that all evidence of any other [**52]  police encounters must be excluded as unfairly  prejudicial under Federal Rule 403. Def.'s 404(b) Opp'n at 8. The Court is again primarily concerned about  prejudice stemming from the introduction of information regarding Mr. Wilkins's drug possession during the  November 10,  [*82]  2015 incident. As already discussed at length, see supra Section III.L.3, this evidence of Mr.  Wilkins's drug possession is of limited probative value given that it is not a drug he stands accused of providing to  the complainants, and the introduction of this fact carries a substantial risk of unfair prejudice. As a result, the Court  will again exclude any testimony from the November 10, 2015 incident as it relates to the cocaine found on Mr.  Wilkins's person. In contrast, the other information conveyed by testimony describing these two encounters is  closely related to the charged offenses and conveys limited prejudice outside the offenses themselves. HN24[ ] In  a Rule 403 analysis, ""it is a sound rule that the balance should generally be struck in favor of admission when the  evidence indicates a close relationship to the offense charged."" United States v. Day, 591 F.2d 861, 878, 192 U.S.  App. D.C. 252 (D.C. Cir. 1978). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the introduction of testimony discussing both  police interactions [**53]  are admissible, pursuant to the limitations outlined above. The final prior contact with law enforcement that the Government seeks to introduce at trial is less clearly intrinsic  evidence, but the Court finds it meets the necessary requirements for admittance under Rule 404(b). On June 18,  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *81; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **49 Page 30 of 43 2018, Mr. Wilkins was arrested in the District after being found operating a vehicle without a permit. Gov't 404(b)  Mot. at 8. Prior to his arrest, MPD officers observed Mr. Wilkins driving his vehicle around the ""Track"" and speaking  with various women known to be engaging in commercial sex work—testimony the Government now seeks to enter  into evidence. Id. This incident has many similarities to the August 3, 2019 police encounter already analyzed by  the Court above, and the Court again concludes that this testimony constitutes highly probative evidence on the  central question of Mr. Wilkins's knowledge and intent regarding the charged crimes, and can be used to refute any  allegation of accident or mistake—meaning it is a permitted use of other crimes evidence under Rule 404(b). It also  handily meets the Rule 403 balancing test. The Court does not think there will be substantial prejudice that accrues  to Mr. Wilkins from the jury [**54]  learning that he was driving in the District without a permit, and any other  prejudice caused by this testimony derives from the charged crime itself. Accordingly, this testimony can be  introduced in full. 7. Admissibility of Defendant's Prior Related Convictions The Government has moved to introduce a certified copy of Mr. Wilkins's past criminal convictions along with  accompanying law enforcement testimony including: • January 11, 2013 Conviction for Assault and Battery of a Family Member from Charlottesville Juvenile and  Domestic Relations Court; • January 22, 2015 Conviction of Possession of Marijuana from Virginia Beach Circuit Court; • November 10, 2015 Conviction for Possession with Intent to Distribute Cocaine, from Chesapeake Circuit  Court. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 17. The Government intends to introduce these three convictions both in its case-in-chief and as impeachment  evidence pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 609. Id. at 20. Mr. Wilkins argues that these three prior convictions  must be excluded as irrelevant, as they do not make the current charges more likely than they would be without  such evidence. Def.'s 404(b) Opp'n at 6-7.  [*83]  a. Introduction of Mr. Wilkins's Prior Convictions in the Government's Case-in-Chief [**55]  The Government has provided notice that it intends to introduce Mr. Wilkins's three previous convictions into  evidence in its case-in-chief. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 17-18. The Court will first address the two drug-related  convictions before turning to Mr. Wilkins's past assault conviction. Beginning with Mr. Wilkins's two drug offenses, one for marijuana possession and the other for possession of  cocaine with the intent to distribute, the Government appears to seek admission of this evidence under two  theories. It originally seemed to claim that this evidence fits into a non-specified Rule 404(b) category of relevant,  non-propensity evidence, id. at 17, before arguing for admission under an intrinsic evidence theory, Gov't 404(b)  Reply at 6. Based on the evidence currently before the Court, it is not inclined to allow the admission of Mr.  Wilkins's two previous drug-related convictions under either theory of admission at this time. The Court has already discussed the November 10, 2015 arrest in detail. See supra Section III.L.6. In short, the  Court concluded that testimony regarding Mr. Wilkins's proximity to a hotel with one of the complainants at the time  of his arrest constitutes direct evidence [**56]  of whether Mr. Wilkins trafficked and transported the complainants  as he is charged. However, the Court barred the introduction of testimony regarding the cocaine in Mr. Wilkins's  possession, as it found this evidence to be of limited probative value given that it is not a drug he stands accused of  providing to the complainants, and the introduction of this fact carries a substantial risk of unfair prejudice. Id. For  the same reasons the Court will bar the admission of the certified copy of Mr. Wilkins's conviction for this offense. Mr. Wilkins's January 22, 2015 Conviction of Possession of Marijuana proves a slightly more complicated scenario.  At the motions hearing, the Government represented that the complainants used marijuana, among other drugs, in  order to perform commercial sex work. Hr'g Tr. at 49. However, it has not been made clear to the Court that the  Government will argue that it was Mr. Wilkins who provided the complainants with the marijuana they used. This  fact is needed before the Court can properly reach a determination as to if this conviction constitutes intrinsic or  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *82; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **53 Page 31 of 43 Rule 404(b) evidence. This Court has already discussed in depth the way in which evidence of Mr. Wilkins's  drug [**57]  possession and access, to the extent it provides evidence of specific drugs he provided to the  complainants to coerce them to perform sex work for his benefit, can appropriately be considered ""part of the  charged offense."" See supra Section III.L.3. But before that conclusion can be reached, the complainants in this  case must testify that Mr. Wilkins actually provided them with marijuana for this purpose. If this occurs, the Court  believes this conviction would indeed constitute intrinsic evidence, and under Rule 403 the probative value of  evidence that Mr. Wilkins had access to certain drugs he provided to the complainants as the method of coercive  control would not be substantively outweighed by any danger of undue prejudice. Turning next to Mr. Wilkins's conviction for Assault and Battery of a Family Member, the Court begins by noting that  the Government did not specify the underlying offense for this conviction in its Rule 404(b) briefs. However, the  Government clarified the context of this offense in its Motion for a Order Prohibiting Contact with Victims and  Witnesses, ECF No. 71, confirming that this conviction relates to the previously described January 10, 2013  [*84]   altercation between J.J. and Mr. [**58]  Wilkins where he punched her several times, pushed her into various hotel  furniture, and stomped on her leg following a dispute over money. Id. at 7. Mr. Wilkins went on to plead guilty to the  charge of Assault on a Family Member for these acts. Id. at 8. The Court will allow the admission of this conviction in the Government's case-in-chief at trial. The Court has  already analyzed the events underlying this conviction, see supra Section III.L.1, and concluded that this evidence  of physical violence directed at J.J. by Mr. Wilkins constitutes intrinsic evidence of the coercion that Mr. Wilkins  used in order to persuade J.J. to engage in sex work for his benefit, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a). It is thus  ""part of the charged offense,"" Bowie, 232 F.3d at 929, and exempt from Rule 404(b). This same analysis applies to  the admission of Mr. Wilkins's conviction for this assault. And the conviction's probative value is not substantially  outweighed by any unfair prejudice, meaning its admission is allowed under Rule 403. This evidence is highly  probative as to the crucial issue of whether Mr. Wilkins engaged in sex trafficking by coercion, as he is charged.  While there is of course a risk, as with the introduction of any past convictions, that [**59]  a jury could infer  culpability on the basis of this conduct instead of the offenses charged, the Court finds that this risk does not  outweigh—much less substantially outweigh—the very strong probative force of this evidence. See United States v.  Douglas, 482 F.3d 591, 601, 375 U.S. App. D.C. 499 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (noting that evidence of a previous arrest  ""almost unavoidably raises the danger that the jury will improperly conclude that because [the defendant] committed  some other crime, he must have committed the one charged"" but explaining that, without some ""compelling or  unique evidence of prejudice"" this danger alone ""cannot give rise to a per se rule of exclusion."" (internal quotation  marks and citations omitted)). Mr. Wilkins's conviction for Assault on a Family Member can accordingly be admitted. b. Evidence of Mr. Wilkins's Prior Convictions for Impeachment Purposes The Government has also stated its intent to introduce Mr. Wilkins's three prior convictions (listed above) along with  his January 11, 2003 conviction for Assault and Battery of a Law Enforcement Officer as impeachment evidence  regarding his character for truthfulness, should he choose to testify at trial. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 20. As explained  below, the Court will bar the introduction of all three [**60]  of Mr. Wilkins's prior convictions for the purposes of  impeachment. HN25[ ] Rule 609 governs the admission of prior felony convictions for the purposes of impeachment. Fed. R.  Evid. 609. In a criminal case in which the witness is a defendant, evidence of a previous felony conviction that  occurred within the past 10 years ""must be admitted . . . if the probative value of the evidence outweighs its  prejudicial effect to that defendant."" Fed. R. Evid. 609(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). In conducting this balancing test,  a court considers, among other factors, ""the nature of the crime, the time of the conviction, the similarity of the past  crime to the charged crime, the importance of the defendant's testimony, and the degree to which the defendant's  credibility is central to the case."" Jackson, 627 F.2d at 1209. The Court first reviews the type of crimes at issue, and whether these crimes—which include narcotics possession,  narcotics trafficking, and assault and battery—are probative as to Mr. Wilkins's truthfulness. HN26[ ] Felony  convictions naturally ""have some probative value on the issue of  [*85]  credibility."" United States v. Lipscomb, 702  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *83; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **56 Page 32 of 43 F.2d 1049, 1062, 226 U.S. App. D.C. 312 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (en banc). However, certain types of felony offenses, that  do not involve any false statement by the perpetrator, have been found to not be particularly probative of a  witness's [**61]  credibility. See, e.g., United States v. Holland, 41 F. Supp. 3d 82, 93 (D.D.C. 2014) (excluding  assault charge for impeachment purposes after concluding this conviction did not ""involve[] dishonest conduct or  false statements""); Lipscomb, 702 F.2d at 1071 (expressing skepticism that simple narcotics possession crimes  reflect strongly on credibility, compared to other crimes); United States v. Rosales, 680 F.2d 1304, 1306-07 (10th  Cir. 1981) (noting that convictions for violations of narcotics laws do ""not normally suggest the special probative  value on the issue of credibility contemplated by Fed. R. Evid. 609(a)(1)""); United States v. Belt, 514 F. 2d 837,  841, 169 U.S. App. D.C. 1 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (en banc) (noting that simple assault does not involve dishonesty or  false statement); Furtado v. Bishop, 604 F.2d 80,94 (1st Cir. 1979) (remarking that convictions for assault and  battery, among other crimes, were ""not particularly probative of credibility""). All three of Mr. Wilkins's previous  criminal offenses fall into these two categories of offenses, and the Government has not put forth any facts to  indicate that these crimes involved any false or dishonest statements. As a result, the probative value of Mr.  Wilkins's past convictions with regard to truthfulness appears to be minimal. Balanced against this negligible probative value is the significant risk of a prejudicial effect on the jury stemming  from the introduction of these past convictions. HN27[ ] As has been repeatedly noted, there [**62]  is a very real  risk that a jury will ""generaliz[e] a defendant's earlier bad act into bad character and tak[e] that as raising the odds  that he did the later bad act now charged."" Old Chief, 519 U.S. at 180. This risk is also heightened where, as here,  the impeached witness is also the defendant. See Lipscomb, 702 F.2d at 1063 (""There is less risk of prejudice  when a defense witness other than the defendant is impeached through a prior conviction because the jury cannot  directly infer the defendant's guilt from someone else's criminal record.""). Nor can this risk of prejudice be  appropriately limited by a limiting instruction, as the Government suggests. See Gov't 404(b) Reply at 14. As this  Court has previously recognized, ""[w]hen '[t]he jury is told to consider the defendant's prior conviction only on the  issue of credibility and not on the overall issue of guilt . . . the jury [is required] to perform a mental gymnastic which  is beyond, not only their powers, but anybody else's.'"" Holland, 41 F. Supp. 3d at 95 (quoting Lipscomb, 702 F.2d at  1069). Considering the limited probative value and very real risk of significant prejudice, the Court concludes that  the probative value of Mr. Wilkins's convictions for past drug possession, drug possession with intent to distribute,  and assault [**63]  do not outweigh the prejudicial effect of the introduction of this evidence. Consequently, this  evidence is inadmissible for the purposes of impeachment.  [*86]  The Government has also stated its intent to introduce Mr. Wilkins's eighteen-year-old conviction for Assault  and Battery of a Law Enforcement Officer. Gov't 404(b) Mot. at 20. HN28[ ] Rule 609 provides additional limits on  the use of convictions older than ten years. Due to the increased possibility that such convictions are stale, they are  only admissible for impeachment if the ""probative value . . . substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect"" and ""the  proponent gives an adverse party reasonable written notice of the intent to use it."" Fed. R. Evid. 609(b) (emphasis  added). The Government cannot meet this burden here. For all the reasons previously discussed, a defendant's  previous assault conviction generally offers little in the way of probative value as to the question of the defendant's  credibility. See, e.g., Holland, 41 F. Supp. 3d 82 at 93; Belt, 514 F.2d at 841; Furtado, 604 F.2d at 94. Any probative  value is further undercut by the fact this conviction is 18 years old, making it the type of remote conviction that  Congress intended trial courts be ""extremely cautious"" about admitting into evidence. United States v. Pettiford, 238  F.R.D. 33, 39 (D.D.C. 2006) quoting United States v. Bibbs, 564 F.2d 1165, 1170 (5th Cir. 1977). When weighed [**64]  against the prejudicial effect of introducing past convictions that could cause the jury to infer  guilt solely based on this unrelated, previous conviction, the probative value is not ""substantially"" outweighed here.        538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *85; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **60 Page 33 of 43 Accordingly, Mr. Wilkins's prior January 11, 2003 conviction for Assault and Battery of a Law Enforcement Officer is  also barred for the purposes of impeaching Mr. Wilkins for truthfulness. M. Mr. Wilkins's Motion to Sever the Assault Charge Against Him The Court now turns to the pending motions filed by the Defendant, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Wilkins's first motion requests  an order from this Court severing the joinder of what he believes to be an unrelated and prejudicial charge against  him. Def.'s Mot. to Sever Counts (""Def.'s Sever Mot."") at 2, ECF No. 37. He posits that the assault charge is  factually unrelated and lacks any legal relevance to the other sex trafficking counts included in the indictment  against him. Id at 5. He also contends that the continued joinder of the assault charge will cause him prejudice at  trial. Id. at 6. The Government opposes this motion, arguing that the assault charge is of the same character as the  other charges, given that it concerns one of [**65]  Mr. Wilkins's alleged sex trafficking victims, and occurred during  the same time period he has been charged with providing for her sexual exploitation by force. Gov't Opp'n to Def.'s  Mot. to Sever (""Gov't Sever Opp'n"") at 4. For the reasons described below, the Court will deny Mr. Wilkins's Motion  to Sever. 1. Count 10 was Properly Joined Pursuant to Rule 8(a) HN29[ ] Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8 allows for the joinder of offenses when the offenses charged ""are of  the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or constitute parts  of a common [*87]  scheme or plan."" Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). The term ""similar character"" has been defined to  encompass items that are ""nearly corresponding, resembling in many respects, somewhat alike, or having a  general likeness to."" United States v. Treadwell, 566 F. Supp. 80, 86 (D.D.C. 1983); see also United States v.  Werner, 620 F. 2d 922, 926 (2d Cir. 1980) (same). The term ""transaction"" has been defined as ""a series of many  occurrences, depending not so much upon the immediateness of their connection as upon their logical  relationship."" Treadwell, 566 F. Supp. at 86. And offenses are considered to be ""connected together"" when there is  commonality of proof. United States v. Richardson, 161 F.3d 728, 734, 333 U.S. App. D.C. 178 (D.C. Cir. 1998). In  this Circuit, Rule 8 is construed liberally in favor of joinder. Id. at 733. Indeed, when claims can meet the above  definition, joinder is allowed ""even if the [**66]  claims are entirely unrelated to each other."" United States v. Gooch,  665 F.3d 1318, 1325, 398 U.S. App. D.C. 455 (D.C. Cir. 2012). All ten of the charges currently included in the superseding indictment against Mr. Wilkins, including the assault  charge, fall neatly within the confines of Rule 8(a). This is because all of these charges—including the alleged  assault— concern Mr. Wilkins's actions to advance the trafficking of the complainants for commercial sex work. The  alleged assault was not some unrelated event, as Mr. Wilkins contends, but was a physical attack by Mr. Wilkins on  L.H., one of the complainants he is accused of trafficking, occurred on ""the Track,"" or the area in the District where  Mr. Wilkins allegedly transported the complainants for the purpose of engaging in commercial sex work, and  happened during the same time period Mr. Wilkins is charged with obtaining and providing for the complainants'  sexual exploitation. Furthermore, audio captured on a security camera of the altercation indicates that the assault  was an instance of ""discipline"" by Mr. Wilkins to express his displeasure with L.H.'s behavior on the Track—  because she broke the rules by looking at another pimp. It can thus be fairly viewed as a tactic used by Mr. Wilkins  in order to get L.H. to engage [**67]  in commercial sex work. As a result, Mr. Wilkins's assertion that the assault  charge bears no factual or logical connection to the other charged conduct, Def.'s Sever Mot. at 4-5, does not hold  water. The Court accordingly concludes that this incident, ""has a general likeness to"" the other trafficking offenses  charged to be of a ""similar character,"" Werner, 620 F. 2d at 926. As such, joinder is permissible. 2. Severance Pursuant to Rule 14 is Not Appropriate     538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *86; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **64 Page 34 of 43 HN30[ ] Having concluded that the counts were properly joined, the Court must determine if severance is required  pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14, which allows for severance of counts upon a showing of  prejudice. Fed. R. Crim. P. 14. This is allowed even where joinder is otherwise proper. See United States v. Carson,  455 F.3d 336, 372, 372 U.S. App. D.C. 251 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Rule 14 states that if ""joinder . . . appears to prejudice  a defendant . . . the court may order separate trials of counts . . . or provide any further relief that justice requires.""  Fed. R. Crim. P. 14(a). The defendant carries the burden of demonstrating prejudice and that he will be unable to  have a fair trial unless the counts are severed. See Carson, 455 F.3d at 374. However, even when such a showing  is made, the grant of severance is not automatic—it remains within the discretion of the district court to determine if  severance is appropriate. See Gooch, 665 F.3d at 1326. And severance [**68]  is only proper when there is a  ""serious risk"" that without severance the jury will be unable to make ""a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.""   [*88]  Id. at 1336 (citing Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 539, 113 S. Ct. 933, 122 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1993)).  Absent this showing of substantial prejudice to the defendant, ""offenses properly joined under Rule 8 should be  jointly tried to conserve judicial resources, [alleviate] the burdens on citizens serving as jurors, and [to avoid] the  necessity of having witnesses reiterate testimony in a series of trials."" Treadwell, 566 F. Supp. at 86 (alterations in  original) (citing United States v. Clemente, 494 F. Supp. 1310, 1325 (S.D.N.Y. 1980)). Mr. Wilkins has not met this high bar here. He contends that trying the assault charge with the other sex trafficking  charges will create ""a very real likelihood for propensity prejudice . . . [that] would almost certainly lead to a rush to  judgment, juror bias against Mr. Wilkins, and ultimately a guilty verdict . . ."" Def.'s Sever Mot. at 6. He also claims  that he would have to present two separate and inconsistent defenses at trial (though he does not elaborate on this  point in any detail). Id. The Court finds that this is not enough to show prejudice so severe that in effect Mr. Wilkins  would be denied a fair trial, or that the failure to sever would somehow prevent the jury from being able [**69]  to  render a reliable verdict. This is because, even if the charges were severed as Mr. Wilkins requests, the separate juries would still be  presented with the same evidence in each trial through the operation of Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), creating  an ""unnecessary waste of judicial, prosecutorial and civic effort, resources and time."" Treadwell, 566 F. Supp. at 87  (rejecting similar request for severance where offenses charged were factually related). HN31[ ] As the D.C.  Circuit has noted, when a defendant objects to joinder because of criminal propensity prejudice, as is the case here,  ""the trial court should initially be guided by whether evidence of each crime could be admitted in a separate trial of  the other(s) under Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 404(b)."" United States v. Burkley, 591 F.2d 903, 920, 192  U.S. App. D.C. 294 (D.C. Cir. 1978). Under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), evidence of ""other crimes,"" such as  the assault, can be entered into evidence for select non-propensity reasons, such as motive, intent, knowledge,  common scheme or plan, or absence of mistake. Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). The assault fits into a number of these  categories—for example, it illustrates a method by which Mr. Wilkins enacted the ""common scheme or plan"" to  traffic the complainants, shows his intent to use coercive force, and the audio from the assault demonstrates his  knowledge of the sex work engaged in by the complainant. [**70]  Rule 404(b) evidence must also survive Rule  403's balancing test, which is accomplished here given that the probative value of this evidence is far from  substantially outweighed by any danger of unfair prejudice. Burkley, 591 F.2d at 919 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (citing Fed. R.  Evid. 403). As the Government argues, the assault demonstrates one particularly salient way that Mr. Wilkins ""used  persuasion, inducement, enticement, and coercion"" to intimidate victims. Gov't Sever Opp'n at 6. It is therefore  highly probative of, again, both the common scheme Mr. Wilkins enacted to accomplish the crimes and his intent to  commit the charged offenses. Moreover, even though the evidence is prejudicial, it is not unfairly prejudicial, given  that it is unlikely to cause the jury to make any improper inferences, and because this evidence is so closely  intertwined with the other charges brought against Mr. Wilkins. See United States v. Geddes, 844 F.3d 983, 990  (8th Cir. 2017) (""Though all Rule 404(b) evidence is inherently prejudicial, the test under Rule 403 is whether its  probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice."") (emphasis in original) (quoting   [*89]  United States v. Williams, 796 F.3d 951, 960 (8th Cir. 2015)). Consequently, the Court finds the highly  probative value of the assault to substantially outweigh any risk of unfair prejudice, meaning that even if Count 10  were severed, [**71]  evidence of the assault could be entered in both trials pursuant to Rule 404(b). As a result, the Court concludes that the use of severance here would be ""an extreme remedy that would require  wholesale duplication of effort and an unnecessary waste of judicial resources."" United States v. Worman, No. 07- 538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *87; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **67 Page 35 of 43 cr-40, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66028, 2008 WL 3984160, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 28, 2008). Mr. Wilkins's motion is  accordingly denied. N. Mr. Wilkins's Motion to Suppress Evidence Mr. Wilkins has also moved to suppress all evidence obtained from three different search warrants the Government  issued in this case, citing various Fourth Amendment violations. See Def.'s Mot. to Supp. Tangible Evid. & Mem. of  P. & A. in Supp. (""Def.'s Mot. Supp."") at 1, ECF No. 39. These three warrants include: (1) a warrant issued for Mr.  Wilkins's ZTE cellular phone, which was seized incident to his arrest for driving without a permit on June 18, 2018  and held by the MPD for 15-months before a search warrant was issued; (2) a warrant issued for Mr. Wilkins's  Samsung cellular phone seized incident to his arrest on November 5, 2019; and (3) a November 8, 2019 warrant  issued to Facebook for the Instagram account ""THEREAL_LUCKYCHARM."" Id. Mr. Wilkins argues first that the  prolonged, 15-month seizure of his ZTE phone was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 4. [**72]  He  also claims that the search warrants issued for the ZTE Phone and Instagram account failed to properly establish  probable cause. Id. at 6. Finally, he argues that all three warrants issued in this matter are so overbroad to  constitute prohibited ""general warrants."" Id. at 15. The Government opposes all three claims. See Gov't Opp'n to  Def.'s Mot. to Suppress Tangible Evid. (""Gov't Supp. Opp'n""), ECF No. 56. For the reasons listed below, the Court  finds that Mr. Wilkins's first argument is the only one with merit. a. Legal Standard HN32[ ] The Fourth Amendment guarantees that the ""right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,  papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated . . ."" U.S. Const. amend. IV.  When this guarantee is violated, courts will typically impose the exclusionary rule, which requires the suppression of  evidence obtained by unconstitutional means. United States v. Weaver, 808 F.3d 26, 33, 420 U.S. App. D.C. 254  (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citing Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 655, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081, 86 Ohio Law Abs. 513  (1961). This exclusion of evidence (though subject to several sizable exceptions), includes both ""the primary  evidence obtained as a direct result of an illegal search or seizure and . . . evidence later discovered and found to  be derivative of an illegality, the so-called fruit of the poisonous tree."" Utah v. Strieff, 579 U.S. 232, 136 S. Ct. 2056,  2061, 195 L. Ed. 2d 400 (2016) (internal [**73]  quotations omitted). HN33[ ] A seizure of property occurs ""when there is some meaningful interference with an individual's possessory  interests in that property."" United States v. Miller, 799 F.3d 1097, 1102, 419 U.S. App. D.C. 63 (D.C. Cir. 2015)  (citing United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U.S. 109, 113, 104 S. Ct. 1652, 80 L. Ed. 2d 85 (1984)). The reasonableness  of such a seizure ""turns on the nature and extent of interference"" with the individual's possessory interests. Id. A  seizure can ""became unreasonable"" when ""its length unduly intrude[s] upon constitutionally protected interests.""  Jacobsen, 466 U.S. at 124 n. 25; see also United  [*90]  States v. Martin, 157 F.3d 46, 54 (2d Cir. 1998) (noting that  ""even a seizure based on probable cause is unconstitutional if police act with unreasonable delay in securing a  warrant.""). HN34[ ] The Supreme Court has described the assessment of probable cause for purposes of a search warrant  as ""a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit . . . there is a  fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place."" Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S.  213, 238, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983). It is the duty of a reviewing court ""to ensure that the magistrate  had a 'substantial basis for . . . conclud[ing]' that probable cause existed."" Id. at 238-39. When making this  determination, judges ""need not confine their evaluations within rigorous legalistic boundaries but instead may use  their common sense."" United States v. Davis, 617 F.2d 677, 692, 199 U.S. App. D.C. 95 (D.C. Cir. 1979). HN35[ ] It must be noted that [**74]  even when evidence is determined to have been gathered in violation of the  Fourth Amendment, this evidence is not necessarily automatically suppressed. If the officer gathering evidence had  an objectively reasonable reliance on a search warrant, the exclusionary rule will typically not apply. United States  v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 922, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984). This is because the ""exclusionary rule was  adopted to deter unlawful searches by police, not to punish the errors of magistrates and judges."" Massachusetts v.  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *89; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **71 Page 36 of 43 Sheppard, 468 U.S. 981, 990, 104 S. Ct. 3424, 82 L. Ed. 2d 737 (1984). That said, there are several exceptions to  this Leon good faith principle, one of which is that suppression is appropriate ""if the officers were dishonest or  reckless in preparing their affidavit or could not have harbored an objectively reasonable belief in the existence of  probable cause."" Leon, 468 U.S. at 926. b. The 15-Month ZTE Phone Seizure was Unreasonable On June 18, 2018, Mr. Wilkins was arrested in the K Street area of Washington D.C. for driving in the city without a  permit, a minor traffic violation. Def.'s Mot. Supp. at 1-2. The MPD officers subsequently seized his phone incident  to arrest. Id. at 2. The legality of the traffic stop and initial seizure of the ZTE phone are not in dispute. However,  while Mr. Wilkins was released the next day, his ZTE phone was logged as ""Evidence [**75]  or Suspected  Proceeds of Crime,"" and remained in MPD custody for the next fifteen months, until September 18, 2019. On  September 18, 2019, Detective Sullivan, a member of the MPD, applied for a warrant to search the ZTE phone.  Detective Sullivan took this action six days after the arrest of one of the complainants and her subsequent  identification of Mr. Wilkins as  [*91]  her pimp, ""Lucky,"" Gov't Supp. Opp'n at 6, after he inadvertently discovered  through a database check that Mr. Wilkins's ZTE phone was still in custody from the traffic stop over a year prior.  The warrant was granted the same day. Mr. Wilkins contends that the 15-month delay in obtaining a warrant for his ZTE cell phone was an unreasonable  seizure, and accordingly violative of the Fourth Amendment. Def.'s Mot. Supp. at 1. The Government counters that  this delay does not constitute ""meaningful interference"" with Mr. Wilkins's possessory interest in his phone. Gov't  Supp. Opp'n at 2. The Court is unconvinced. HN36[ ] To assess the reasonableness of a seizure, courts are required to ""balance the nature and quality of the  intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests  alleged to justify the intrusion."" [**76]  United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 703, 103 S. Ct. 2637, 77 L. Ed. 2d 110  (1983). When a delayed warrant is at issue, the Eleventh Circuit has identified several ""highly relevant"" factors to  consider when conducting this balancing test, which include: (1) the significance of the interference with an  individual's possessory interest; (2) the duration of the delay; (3) whether the individual consented to the seizure;  (4) the Government's legitimate interest in holding the property as evidence, and (5) whether law enforcement were  diligent in pursuing their investigation. United States v. Laist, 702 F.3d 608, 613-614 (11 Cir. 2012). While there is  no ""bright line past which delay becomes unreasonable . . . [w]hen police neglect to seek a warrant without any  good explanation for that delay, it appears that the state is indifferent to searching the item and the intrusion on an  individual's possessory interest is less likely to be justifiable."" United States v. Burgard, 675 F.3d 1029, 1033-34  (7th Cir. 2012). The Court begins with an evaluation of the extent of the Government's interference with Mr. Wilkins's possessory  interest in the ZTE phone. The interference by the Government was by all accounts, severe. The phone was seized  for fifteen months before a warrant was obtained. HN37[ ] ""The longer the police take to seek a warrant, the  greater the infringement on the person's possessory interest [**77]  will be, for the obvious reason that a longer  seizure is a greater infringement on possession than a shorter one."" Id. at 1033; United States v. Mitchell, 565 F. 3d  1347, 1350 (11th Cir. 2009) (noting that each day a warrant is delayed ""infringes [on the] possessory interests           538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *90; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **74 Page 37 of 43 protected by the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on 'unreasonable searches.'"") (quoting Jacobsen, 466 U.S. at  124). Delays in obtaining a warrant far shorter than the 15 months in this case have been found to be  unconstitutionally long. See, e.g., United States v. Pratt, 915 F.3d 266, 272 (4th Cir. 2019) (finding 31-day delay in  obtaining warrant following seizure of cell phone unreasonable); Mitchell, 565 F. 3d at 1350 (21-day delay in  obtaining warrant for seized computer unreasonable); compare with United States v. Stabile, 633 F.3d 219, 235-36  (3d Cir. 2011) (three-month delay in obtaining warrant for computer reasonable where defendant had consented to  seizure, did not request return of property, and Government provided reasonable explanation for delay). This factor  consequently generally weighs in favor of finding the Government interference here to be meaningful. The Court turns next to evaluate Mr. Wilkins's possessory interest in the ZTE phone. An individual's property  interest in their own cell phone can generally be assumed to be significant. As the Supreme Court has noted, ""[t]he  term 'cell [*92]  phone' is itself misleading shorthand; many of these devices are in [**78]  fact minicomputers that  also happen to have the capacity to be used as a telephone."" Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373, 393, 134 S. Ct.  2473, 189 L. Ed. 2d 430 (2014). This recognition of the capabilities of modern smartphones—which the  Government helpfully clarifies the ZTE phone in question was—means that they contain similar possessory  interests to that of an individual's personal computer. HN38[ ] And ""individuals may have a particularly powerful  possessory interest"" in their own computers, as they are ""relied upon heavily for personal and business use."" Laist,  702 F.3d at 614 (citing Mitchell, 565 F.3d at 1347). Accordingly, as a starting point, Mr. Wilkins appears to have a  strong possessory interest in his ZTE phone. Notably, Mr. Wilkins did not act to seriously diminish this strong possessory interest. He did not consent to the  seizure in any respect, as it was taken from him pursuant to his arrest for driving without a permit. HN39[ ] ""An  individual diminishes his [possessory] interest if he consents to the seizure or voluntarily shares the seized object's  contents."" Pratt, 915 F.3d at 271-72 (finding that defendant's possessory interest in his cell phone was not  diminished where he did not consent to seizure or voluntarily share the phone's contents) (citing United States v.  Christie, 717 F.3d 1156, 1162-63 (10th Cir. 2013)); see also Burgard, 675 F. 3d at 1034 (finding defendant ""had a  strong interest in possessing his cell phone"" [**79]  as ""[a]t no point before the seizure did he abandon the phone or  relinquish it to a third party.""). Nor was Mr. Wilkins afforded the opportunity to access the ZTE phone's contents to  save any critical information prior to the seizure. See Laist, 702 F.3d at 616 (finding possessory interest in the  contents of seized computer diminished where defendant ""was afforded the opportunity to remove whatever he  wanted to download from the computer and hard drives"" prior to seizure). The strongest argument that can be made that Mr. Wilkins had a diminished possessory interest is that he did not,  at any point during the 15-month seizure, specifically request the return of his property from the MPD. Such a  remedy was available to him pursuant to Rule 41(g) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure for the  District of Columbia. See Sup. Ct. R. Crim. P. 41(g) (""A person aggrieved by. . . [a] deprivation of property may  move for the property's return.""). The Government's balancing analysis relies almost exclusively on this omission to  argue that Mr. Wilkins's failure to demand the phone's return forfeited any and all possessory interest he previously  held in his phone. The Court is unconvinced that this single factor, without more, is enough to compel this outcome. HN40[ ] This is because evidence that an [**80]  individual has actively asserted their possessory claim to a piece  of property through requesting its return is only ""helpful, though not essential"" to the determination of one's  possessory interests. Burgard, 675 F.3d at 1033 (""[I]t can be revealing to see whether the person from whom the  item was taken ever asserted a possessory claim to it—perhaps by checking on the status of the seizure or looking  for assurances that the item would be returned. If so, this would be some evidence (helpful, though not essential)  that the seizure in fact affected [his] possessory interests."") (emphasis added). The Court does not find this non  essential fact particularly revealing here. Mr. Wilkins was not legally trained. The notion that he should have known  that he had the legal right to request the return of his phone (which, as discussed, had been logged as evidence   [*93]  and would have required prosecutor approval for release), or that he should bear the cost of obtaining legal  representation to take action in this regard is a high burden to place on an ordinary citizen to safeguard one's  Fourth Amendment rights. Furthermore, as the Government repeatedly emphasizes, Mr. Wilkins was apparently a  ""person of interest"" at the time of his arrest [**81]  for driving without a permit and subsequent seizure of the ZTE  phone. Gov't Supp. Opp'n at 12. If known, this would surely inspire hesitation on his part to undertake affirmative  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *91; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **77 Page 38 of 43 outreach to the MPD to inquire about his property. And such ""[a]n unwillingness to invite a criminal prosecution""  ""cannot [be] equat[ed]. . . [to] a voluntary abandonment of any interest."" Walter v. United States, 447 U.S. 649, 658  n.11, 100 S. Ct. 2395, 65 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1980). For this same reason the Court finds unpersuasive the Government's secondary argument that Mr. Wilkins  disclaimed his possessory interest by somehow voluntarily abandoning his phone—which by its own account, was  taken from his person following his arrest for driving without a permit, and then held in police files as ""evidence.""  This conclusion stretches reason. While, certainly, ""[o]fficers may lawfully seize property that has been voluntarily  abandoned, United States v. Griffith, 867 F.3d 1265, 1279, 432 U.S. App. D.C. 234 (D.C. Cir. 2017), the facts do  not indicate that Mr. Wilkins abandoned the ZTE phone. HN41[ ] ""Whether property has been abandoned is a  question of fact that turns primarily on whether the objective facts available to the investigating officers evidenced (i)  the suspect's denial of ownership, and (ii) that he physically relinquished the property in a way that demonstrated  abandonment."" United States v. Voice, 622 F.3d 870, 877 n.3 (8th Cir. 2010); see also [**82]  United States v.  Thomas, 864 F. 2d 843, 846, 275 U.S. App. D.C. 21 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (noting that abandoned property analysis for  Fourth Amendment purposes requires an inquiry into ""the intent of the person who is alleged to have abandoned""  the property, inferred from ""words spoken, acts done, and other objective facts.""). The Court has not been provided  any evidence that Mr. Wilkins's actions or comments at the time of his arrest indicated an intent to abandon his  phone. The Court concludes that Mr. Wilkins has a significant possessory interest in his ZTE phone, and that the  Government's interference with that interest was meaningful. Turning to the next factor in the analysis, the Court must balance Mr. Wilkins's strong possessory interest in the  ZTE phone against the Government's justification for the seizure to determine if the 15-month delay was  reasonable. The Government claims that the prolonged seizure was required due to the need to ""preserv[e]  evidence of sex trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation that is contained [*94]  in the ZTE Phone."" Gov't  Supp. Opp'n at 12. To support this claim, the Government argues that Mr. Wilkins was a person of interest to MPD  officers at time of initial arrest and seizure, and given the digital content of the data [**83]  contained on the ZTE  phone, there was a heightened interest in protecting this evidence from destruction. Id. This asserted interest falls  apart under close analysis. Mr. Wilkins was stopped and arrested for a traffic offense, not for anything related to sex  trafficking. His phone was seized incident to that arrest, as is apparently MPD policy for all arrests, and then tagged  as ""evidence."" But it is difficult to see how a cell phone could contain any evidence of the crime of driving without a  permit, or how there could be any valid fear of evidence destruction for this type of violation. Nonetheless, it was on  this basis that the ZTE phone was stored as ""Evidence or Suspected Proceeds of Crime"" for the next 15 months.  Detective Sullivan, the member of MPD leading the Human Trafficking Investigation and who later obtained the  warrant, was never even notified about the existence of the ZTE Phone, and only found out about it when he  ""discovered that phone was in MPD's possession"" when looking up various contacts with defendants. Supp. Gov't  Opp'n at 3. The state, in short, seems to have inadvertently retained the ZTE Phone for over 15 months with no real  justification—and certainly no [**84]  probable cause or reasonable suspicion— until it was rediscovered when it  could serve a useful purpose for law enforcement. This stands in stark contrast to nearly all of the other cases that have examined this issue of an extended seizure  prior to a warrant being issued. HN42[ ] The Government's interest in a seizure is strong when there is probable  cause to believe the seized item contains evidence of a crime. See Burgard, 675 F.3d at 1033. Accordingly, in all  cases that have excused an extended delay between a seizure and warrant—as well as others that have not—there           538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *93; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **81 Page 39 of 43 was at minimum probable cause to believe the item seized contained evidence of a crime. See, e.g., Mitchell 565  F.3d at 1351 (defendant admitted that computer seized contained child pornography); Laist, 702 F. 3d at 618  (probable cause for seizure present as agents directly observed child pornography on seized computer); Burgard,  675 F.3d at 1034 (defendant conceded ""police had probable cause to believe phone would contain evidence of a  crime""); Thomas v. United States, 775 Fed. Appx. 477, 490 (""very strong reasons"" including witness testimony  regarding computer's contents and law enforcement observations of computer to conclude it contained evidence of  a crime). In contrast, for the 15 months the ZTE phone was in custody, MPD did not have probable cause to believe  that [**85]  the phone contained evidence of a crime. The Court is deeply uncomfortable with the notion, seemingly  advanced by the Government, that law enforcement has the power to seize and indefinitely hold any property  merely on the Government's word that the property owner is a person of interest in some uncharged, unrelated  crime at the time of the seizure. Quite simply, this is not reasonable. Given this lack of a defensible state interest for  the ongoing seizure of the ZTE phone, the balancing test becomes one-sided in favor of finding the prolonged  seizure unreasonable. HN43[ ] In a similar vein, courts must consider the diligence with which law enforcement seek a warrant for seized  property. See Mitchell, 565 F.3d at 1352; Pratt, 915 F. 3d at 272 (relying heavily on fact that ""government has no  persuasive justification for the delay in obtaining a search warrant"" to find 31-day delay unreasonable). ""When  police neglect to seek a warrant  [*95]  without any good explanation for that delay, it appears that the state is  indifferent to searching the item and the intrusion on an individual's possessory interest is less likely to be  justifiable."" Burgard, 675 F.3d at 1033. Such is the case here, where the ZTE phone was essentially forgotten for 15  months. This factor also strongly [**86]  urges the Court to find the delay unreasonable. Balancing all these factors together, given Mr. Wilkins's relatively undiminished possessory interest in his ZTE  Phone and the Government's utter lack of justification for both the initial seizure and its lack of diligence in obtaining  a warrant, the Court concludes that the 15 month delay violates the Fourth Amendment. Perhaps anticipating this result, the Government urged the Court in both its briefs and at oral argument to apply the  Leon good faith exception to the exclusionary rule and decline to suppress the evidence derived from the search of  the ZTE phone. See Gov't Supp. Opp'n at 26; Hr'g Tr. at 43. Mr. Wilkins argues that the good-faith exception is  unavailable here. Def.'s Supp. Reply at 5-6. For the reasons listed below, the Court agrees with Mr. Wilkins and  finds the Good Faith exception inapplicable. HN44[ ] In Leon, the Supreme Court held a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule exists such that,  ""suppression is appropriate only if the officers were dishonest or reckless in preparing their affidavit or could not  have harbored an objectively reasonable belief in the existence of probable cause."" Leon, 468 U.S. at 926. The  Government argues that none of the exceptions [**87]  to the good faith rule apply to the instant case, meaning that  the ZTE Warrant need not be suppressed. But this analysis misunderstands the source of the constitutional  violation at issue. HN45[ ] The Leon good faith exception applies to defects that arise under the search warrant  process, not unconstitutional seizures. And the Supreme Court has held that the proper remedy for an  unreasonably long delay in obtaining a warrant following a seizure under the Fourth Amendment is suppression of  the evidence. Segura, 468 U.S. at 812; Burgard, 675 F.3d. at 1035. Procuring a late-obtained warrant cannot be  enough to remedy this type of unreasonable delay, because by merit of the type of violation at issue a warrant is  always eventually obtained—meaning under this logic the exclusionary rule could not ever operate to deter this  Fourth Amendment violation. See Burgard, 675 F. 3d at 1035 (noting the proper inquiry is ""not whether police  ultimately obtained a warrant; it is whether they failed to do so within a reasonable time.""). Indeed, the Seventh and Ninth Circuits, the only two courts that appear to have specifically addressed this issue,  have both declined to apply the good faith exception to cases of an unreasonably prolonged seizure. See, e.g.,  Burgard, 675 F. 3d at 1035 (""When an officer waits an unreasonably long time to obtain [**88]  a search warrant, in  violation of the Fourth Amendment, he cannot seek to have evidence admitted simply by pointing to that late- obtained warrant.""); United States v. Song Ja Cha, 597 F.3d 995, 1006 (9th Cir. 2010) (""[T]he exclusionary rule is  applicable where seizures are unconstitutionally long"" to ""deter unreasonable police behavior and to provide for  judicial determination of probable cause.""). HN46[ ] As the Ninth Circuit went on to explain, law enforcement are  presumed to be aware of the law that a seizure must last ""no longer than reasonably necessary for the police,  538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *94; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **84 Page 40 of 43 acting with diligence, to obtain a warrant."" Id. at 1005 (citing Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326, 332, 121 S. Ct. 946,  148 L. Ed. 2d 838 (2001)). As a  [*96]  result, the application of the good faith exception would be inappropriate  because this type of Fourth Amendment violation is ""sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it""  and ""deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system."" Id. at 1004. An examination of the policy implications  of allowing the good faith exception here also helps to explain why the Court finds exclusion to be appropriate. As  the Burgard court aptly noted, allowing a ""good faith"" exception to apply ""would eliminate the [exclusionary] rule's  deterrent effect on unreasonably long seizures. Police could seize any item—a phone, a computer, a briefcase, or  even a house—for [**89]  an unreasonably long time without concern for the consequences, evidentiary and  otherwise."" 675 F.3d at 1035; Song Ja Cha, 597 F.3d at 1005 (""To create [such] an exception . . . would defeat the  purpose of the exclusionary rule . . .""). This fear is exactly what has materialized here, with law enforcement seizing  Mr. Wilkins's phone and holding it for well over a year until the search was ordered. Such an outcome cannot  possibly be in accord with the basic protections of the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, as a matter of both law and  policy, the Court finds that the Good Faith exception does not apply. Consequently, the Court will grant Mr. Wilkins's motion to suppress the tangible evidence obtained from the illegal  search of the ZTE phone. However, it appears that this finding may have little practical effect. The Government  represents that the warrant for Mr. Wilkins's ZTE phone bore no poisonous fruit, in that the Government did not rely  on any unique evidence found on the ZTE phone to obtain any subsequent warrants. Hr'g Tr. at 44. This is because  a warrant for one of the complainant's phones was authorized at the same time the warrant for the ZTE phone was  approved, and all of the relevant evidence from Mr. Wilkins's ZTE phone was also found [**90]  on the  complainant's phone. Id. Accordingly, the Government argues, there is no way the illegal ZTE search could have  tainted any subsequent evidence obtained in the case. Hr'g Tr. at 44. The Court is not so sure. Given the general  paucity of detailed information before the Court at this time, it will grant Mr. Wilkins's counsel the opportunity to  submit additional briefing on this topic to articulate what evidence, if any, should be excluded as fruit of the illegal  search of the ZTE phone. c. The Warrant to Search Mr. Wilkins's Instagram Account was Properly Supported by Probable Cause Mr. Wilkins also argues that the Facebook search warrant lacked probable cause. He alleges that neither the  warrant nor the accompanying affidavits indicate why the Government needed to search the entire Instagram  account to confirm that Mr. Wilkins owned and operated it, and that Detective Sullivan failed to provide any  ""concrete or reliable support"" for why he believed that searching the account would provide additional evidence of  Mr. Wilkins's alleged commercial sexual exploitation. Def.'s Mot. Supp. at 13-14. The Government, in response,  provides a list of facts included in the affidavit that they [**91]  believe demonstrates that probable cause existed to  search the account for evidence of sex trafficking. These facts include: (1) the target Instagram account's name is Thereal_luckycharm, and it bore a photograph of the defendant as  the profile picture; (2) the woman dropped off for a commercial sex ""date' with an undercover officer by the  defendant in September 2019 identified him as her pimp and said she knew him as ""Lucky""; and (3) based on  Detective Sullivan's training and experience, ""Pimps and their prostitutes are now meeting with  [*97]   increased regularity via social media like Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, and other popular social media  websites. Pimps use these websites to promote their lifestyles, wealth, and belongings as a way to recruit  females into their stable. Pimps use the social media accounts to directly message or contact potential  prostitutes to begin the recruitment process by applying pressure or attempting to sell the pimp lifestyle to the  victims."" Gov't Supp. Opp'n at 15-16. The Government also pointed to conversations between the @thereal_luckycharm and  an account previously used by a known trafficker, of which law enforcement had assumed control. Id. at 16.  The [**92]  conversations involved ""pimp slang terms,"" and @thereal_luckycharm provided a phone number to the  known trafficker. Id. The Court concludes that the combination of all of these facts taken together is more than  sufficient to establish probable cause that this Instagram account would contain evidence of crimes of sexual  exploitation. 538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *95; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **88 Page 41 of 43 HN47[ ] To determine whether a search warrant is supported by probable cause, courts must ask ""whether, given  all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit . . . there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime  will be found in a particular place.""

It is the duty of a reviewing court ""to ensure that the  magistrate had a 'substantial basis for . . . conclud[ing]' that probable cause existed.,"" Griffith, 867 F. 3d at 1271  (quoting Gates, 462 U.S. at 236).

Davis, 617 F.2d at 692 (quoting Gates, 462  U.S. at 236). They also may consider that, ""while each fact standing alone may be insufficient, the combination of  all the facts can establish probable cause."" United States v. Gilliam, 167 F. 3d 628, 633, 334 U.S. App. D.C. 391  (D.C. Cir. 1999). The Court concludes that the Government demonstrated probable cause in its warrant application by demonstrating  that there was a [**93]  ""substantial basis"" to believe that the Instagram account contained evidence of Mr. Wilkins's  alleged criminal activity. Detective Sullivan's experience regarding trafficking operations generally led him to believe  that Mr. Wilkins likely would have used Instagram to conduct his illegal activities. See United States v. Hodge, 246  F.3d 301, 307 (3d Cir. 2001) (magistrate judges are allowed to ""give considerable weight to the conclusions of this  experienced law enforcement officer regarding where evidence of a crime was likely to be found.""). This belief was  also supported by direct evidence from the investigation—messages between Mr. Wilkins and an account operated  by law enforcement that Mr. Wilkins believed belonged to a known trafficker. Especially given the evidence set forth  in the affidavit establishing probable cause that Mr. Wilkins had committed trafficking-related offenses, including  that he had transported women to the District to engage in commercial sex since 2017, and had exchanged  messages with a known trafficker through his Instagram, combined with Detective Sullivan's knowledge of how  traffickers use social media and the general ubiquity of social media to facilitate modern communication, the  Government established a fair [**94]  probability that evidence of trafficking-related offenses and/or identities of  other potential victims would be found in the searched Instagram account. Furthermore, because the Government  was only in possession of circumstantial evidence that pointed to Mr. Wilkins owning and operating the account, it  was perfectly reasonable  [*98]  for law enforcement to seek additional evidence that the account belonged to  him. The Government therefore has met the probable cause standard, and Mr. Wilkins's motion to suppress on  this ground is denied. d. None of the Warrants Were Fatally Overbroad Mr. Wilkins's final argument for suppression is that the ZTE Phone, Facebook, and Samsung warrants were all  overbroad and therefore prohibited under the Fourth Amendment. Def.'s Supp. Mot. at 15. HN48[ ] The Fourth  Amendment prohibits general search warrants and requires that a warrant describe, with particularity, the place to  be searched and the persons or things to be seized. U.S. Const. amend. IV. This requirement is intended to protect  people from ""general, exploratory rummaging in a person's belongings,"" Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443,  467, 91 S. Ct. 2022, 29 L. Ed. 2d 564 (1971), and to ensure that a search conducted by law enforcement be  ""carefully tailored to its justifications,"" Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 84, 107 S. Ct. 1013, 94 L. Ed. 2d 72  (1987). The Government successfully refutes Mr. Wilkins's argument [**95]  by demonstrating that the warrants  were appropriately tailored to the requirements of this case, with the information seized restricted to data related to  violations of specified statutes. Gov't Supp. Opp'n at 19-20.         538 F. Supp. 3d 49, *97; 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89419, **92 Page 42 of 43 In making his argument that the warrants at issue were overbroad, Mr. Wilkins relies heavily on United States v.  Winn, an out-of-Circuit district court case in which the defendant was charged with taking photos of young girls in  swimsuits using his cell phone. United States v. Winn, 79 F. Supp. 3d 904, 904 (S.D. Ill. 2015); Def.'s Supp. Mot. at  15. In that case, the Court found the warrant issued to obtain the defendant's relevant cell phone files fatally  overbroad. Winn, 79 F. Supp. 3d at 919. However, there are important differences between the warrant issued in  Winn and the warrants in this case. The Winn warrant authorized the seizure of ""any and all files"" related to the  Public Indecency charge brought against the defendant, including but not limited to the phone's calendar, phone  book, contacts, SMS messages, MMS messages, emails, pictures, videos, images, ringtones, and audio files, all  while the police only had probable cause to believe that photos and videos would be evidence of the crime. Id. The  Court accordingly held that the warrant was ""not as [**96]  particular as could be reasonably expected given the  nature of the crime and the information the police possessed."" Id. at 920. In short, the warrant was overbroad  because the police had enough information to more appropriately tailor the warrant to a specific type of files, and by  further refining the subject matter of the photos for which it was searching, and by the relevant timeframe, given that  the alleged criminal activity occurred only on a single day. Id.  [*99]  The facts of this case are inapposite. In the warrant applications, the Government identified with specificity  several types of records and information it sought—it did not make a request for ""any and all"" files in the overbroad  fashion that the Winn court prohibited. Gov't Supp. Opp'n at 20-21. Instead, the warrants limited the information to  be seized and searched to violations of specific statutes. See Matter of Black iPhone 4, 27 F. Supp. 3d 74, 78  (D.D.C. 2014) (indicating overbreadth concerns are appropriately addressed where the information to be seized is  limited to ""information only insofar as it pertains to violations of [two statutes].""). The warrants also indicated  parameters that the evidence retrieved must ""relat[e] to the identity or location of perpetrators, aiders and  abettors, [**97]  co-conspirators."" Gov't Supp. Opp'n Att. B (""ZTE Warrant Aff."") at 1b. HN49[ ] Courts have  frequently found that this level of specificity is permissible, especially when a comprehensive review of electronic  evidence is necessary for law enforcement to know exactly where the relevant evidence is located. See United  States v. Bishop, 910 F.3d 335, 336 (7th Cir. 2018) (rejecting overbreadth challenge to warrant and permitting  police to look at every file on a phone to decide which met criteria set forth in a warrant because ""[c]riminals don't  advertise where they keep evidence.""); Christie, 717 F.3d at 1165 (holding computer search warrant ""may pass the  particularity test if they limit their scope . . . to evidence of specific federal crimes.""); People v. Lopez, No. 341089,  2019 Mich. App. LEXIS 595, 2019 WL 1370716, at *5 (Mich. Ct. App. Mar. 26, 2019) (""When the search is limited to  evidence explicitly authorized in the warrant . . . it is reasonable for officers to search through the data and  applications on the phone to determine whether it contains the sought after evidence.""). Because Mr. Wilkins was  allegedly using his phone and Instagram accounts to conduct commercial sex trafficking, law enforcement had no  way of knowing exactly where evidence would be located. Unlike in Winn, the evidence that might be relevant could  not be confined to certain types of files. See 79 F. Supp. 3d at 919. Instead, [**98]  probative evidence could be  found, as the Government contends, ""in the defendant's contacts, call log, messages, GPS location data, etc."" Gov't  Supp. Opp'n at 23. Finally, Mr. Wilkins posits—with a noticeable lack of any supporting authority—that the lack of temporal limitation in  the warrant renders it fatally overbroad. Def.'s Supp. Mot. at 17. But, unlike in Winn, relevant evidence in this case  was not limited to a single day or narrow date range, see 79 F. Supp. 3d at 919; instead, the investigation into Mr.  Wilkins's commercial sexual exploitation scheme spanned almost a decade and involved a far more complex  investigation. Therefore, while a temporal constraint in Winn may have made sense to better ensure that that  search was ""carefully tailored to its justifications,"" Garrison, 480 U.S. at 84, such a constraint would make little  sense in this case given the duration of the alleged criminal activity and the complexity of the investigation. As a  result, the Court finds that the Instagram and Samsung Phone warrant requests were not overbroad and will deny  Mr. Wilkins's Motion to Suppress on this ground.",1
"United States v. Woods, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858","FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING STATEMENTS OF CO-CONSPIRATORS THIS MATTER comes before the Court on the issue of whether certain statements offered against Matthew Woods  may be admitted during the guilt/innocence phase of his trial. In addition to testimony from a Government witness,  the Court considered the following filings: • The Government's Notice of Intent to Introduce Evidence of Co-Conspirator Statements Pursuant to Fed. R.  Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), filed December 6, 2019 (Doc. 382) • Defendants' Joint Response to Government's Notice of Intent to Introduce Evidence of Co-Conspirator  Statements Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), filed January 17, 2020 (Doc. 398) • The Government's Second Notice of Intent to Introduce Evidence of Co-Conspirator Statements Pursuant to  Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), filed June 10, 2020 (Doc. 427)   Page 2 of 31 • Matthew Woods' Motion [*2]  for a James Hearing and Response to Government's Second Notice of Intent to  Introduce Evidence of Co-Conspirator Statements Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), filed June 30, 2020  (Doc. 436) • The Government's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, filed January 11, 2021 (Doc. 512) • Matthew Woods' Response to Government's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Notices  of Intent to Introduce Putative Co-Conspirator Statements, filed January 25, 2021 (Doc. 514). The Court held a James hearing on April 19, 2021, at which it heard the testimony of the Government's case agent,  Special Agent Scott Pharis of Homeland Security Investigations (""SA Pharis""), as well as further oral arguments  from the parties. Having considered the pleadings, the parties' arguments, and the evidence and testimony  presented at the James hearing, the Court herein makes the following findings and conclusions on the matter. The Defendants: Cornelius Galloway, Danielle Galloway, Marcus Taylor, Matthew Woods (""the Galloway  Organization"") are alleged to have entered into a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a)(1). The object of the conspiracy was, among other things, to recruit, entice, harbor, transport, [*3]  provide,  obtain, and/or maintain numerous females, knowing that some were under the age of 18 and all would be caused to  commit a commercial sex act. To achieve the goals of the conspiracy, the Galloway Organization employed force,  fraud, threats, and coercion, all methods designed to cause the females to commit a commercial sex act. A. Evidence of the Conspiracy and Matthew Woods' Membership Therein Before deciding whether the Government's proffered statements are admissible as non-hearsay co-conspirator  statements pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), the Court must determine by a preponderance of the evidence  that: (1) a conspiracy existed, (2) the declarant and Mr. Woods were both members of the conspiracy, and (3) the  statements were made in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. United States v. Owens, 70 F.3d 1118,  1123-24 (10th Cir. 1995) (citing United States v. Urena, 27 F.3d 1487, 1490 (10th Cir.)) (quoting United States v.  Johnson, 911 F.2d 1394, 1403 (10th Cir.1990)). This section deals with the first two determinations. The Court may consider the co-conspirator statements themselves, as well as independent evidence, in  determining whether the conspiracy existed, but the statement cannot ""by itself establish . . . [either] the existence  of the conspiracy or [the defendant's] participation in it."" Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2); see United States v. Lopez- Gutierrez, 83 F.3d 1235, 1242 (10th Cir. 1996); United States v. Martinez, 825 F.2d 1451, 1453 (10th Cir. 1987)  (the Government must produce some ""independent evidence [*4]  linking the defendant to the conspiracy.""); United  States v. Busch, 758 F.2d 1394, 1397 (10th Cir. 1985) (""The general rule is that the utterances and acts of one  conspirator are admissible against a co-conspirator, even though the latter was not present at the time of the act or  utterances, if there be evidence, independent of the utterances or acts themselves, which shows the existence of a  conspiracy""). Apart from the co-conspirator statements themselves, there exists substantial, independent evidence that the  charged conspiracy existed, and that Matthew Woods was a member of this conspiracy, along with Cornelius  Galloway, Danielle Galloway, and Marcus Taylor. The Government has established this by a preponderance of the  evidence by way of the following: 1. Several Grand Juries have found probable cause that Cornelius Galloway, Danielle Galloway, Marcus Taylor,  and Matthew Woods conspired with each other to commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. See Docs. 2, 54, 103,  303, and 380. 2. Cornelius Galloway and Marcus Taylor have signed plea agreements wherein they state they were engaged in a  conspiracy with each other, Danielle Galloway, and Matthew Woods in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1594(c). Danielle  Galloway signed a plea agreement in which she states she was a part of that same [*5]  conspiracy with Cornelius  Galloway, Marcus Taylor, and Matthew Woods in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *1 Page 3 of 31 3. In October 2016, Danielle Galloway brought M.V. back to the home she shared with her husband, Cornelius  Galloway, where M.V. met with Cornelius Galloway and Matthew Woods. In order to force and coerce M.V. into  participating in commercial sex acts to benefit the Galloway Organization, Matthew Woods beat her at that time.  Shortly after, she was taken to the Howard Johnson Inn in Albuquerque, New Mexico. M.V. refused to participate in  commercial sex acts at the Howard Johnson for approximately one to two weeks. After each time she refused,  Matthew Woods would come to the hotel room and beat her as punishment for failing to participate in commercial  sex acts and to force and coerce her to engage in such acts in the future. 4. During a period in which K.T. was allegedly being trafficked for commercial sex, Matthew Woods hit K.T. in the  head with a full can of liquid in an effort to wake her up. 5. The women recruited by the Galloway Organization would wait, or, in some instances, hide outside on the hotel  room balcony while other women performed commercial sex acts in the hotel room. 6. Cornelius Galloway [*6]  had pictures of several of the victims, both charged and uncharged, saved in his phone.  In many of these pictures, the victims are posing in a manner consistent with being offered for sale for commercial  sex. Several of the pictures appear to contain marketing material from advertisements for commercial sex. 7. A substantial number of photographs of the victims, both charged and uncharged, were found in  dgalloway1023@gmail.com, an email address that the Government has sufficiently established belonged to  Danielle Galloway and Cornelius Galloway. 8. Danielle Galloway booked the hotel rooms where the commercial sex acts were to occur. According to records  subpoenaed from Booking.com, an account associated with Danielle Galloway, she made over thirty separate  bookings in one month at several hotels in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 9. Danielle Galloway would answer the phone and speak with prospective commercial sex customers. 10. Cornelius Galloway collected all the revenue generated from the commercial sex acts. 11. Cornelius Galloway would provide narcotics to the women. 12. The Galloway Organization advertised the women who were within the control of the organization on  Backpage.com. 13. Matthew [*7]  Woods was able to tell law enforcement that, when T.S. was in Albuquerque, New Mexico, rates  for commercial sexual acts performed by T.S. were generally ""80 to 120 [dollars]."" 14. Matthew Woods revealed to law enforcement that he was aware that ""Backpage don't exist no more."" 15. K.T. wrote a Facebook message to an acquaintance in which she explains that she is ""freaking out"" because  ""Staxx"" (an alias of Matthew Woods, sometimes spelled ""Staccs"") pulled a gun out an said for me to get in  Backpage and stop playin' or he's gonna shoot me in the face."" 16. Matthew Woods also told law enforcement something to the effect of ""I love women, and I love getting deals  done."" 17. Marcus Taylor would drive the women to locations where they would participate in commercial sex acts.  Additionally, in an effort to mollify the women, Marcus Taylor would take them shopping and to see their families.    2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *5 Page 4 of 31 18. In his statement to law enforcement, Cornelius Galloway admitted to being a ""pimp,"" and that when the women  did not do what they were told he would send them to ""Staxx"" (Matthew Woods) who would ""tune them up"" (batter  them). 19. A.R. reported to the Albuquerque Police Department (""APD"") that she was raped [*8]  by ""Staxx"" (Matthew  Woods). 20. In his statement to law enforcement, Matthew Woods stated that T.S. was murdered ""because she be fagging  off...means she'll disappear. She was a whore, won't work for anyone."" Woods further told police that T.S. was  working for an individual he would only refer to as ""Chips Ahoy,"" (a reference SA Pharis interprets as meaning  Cornelius ""Chip"" Galloway) and that ""Chips Ahoy"" had other underage females working for him. Woods also stated  during the interview that he is in ""the inner circle,"" and that he ""used to get like 1,200 to pick a girl up and bring her  back."" Later in the interview, Woods acknowledged that ""Chip"" asked Woods to ""beat [T.S.] up."" 21. Matthew Woods told law enforcement that there were approximately three instances in which he ""got paid to  fuck T.S. up."" 22. Matthew Woods also stated to law enforcement something to the effect of ""when T.S. works for everybody she  comes to us."" 23. Matthew Woods admitted to hitting T.S. 24. Matthew Woods told law enforcement something to the effect of ""T.S. usually got a hold of me because I'm  always telling her where she goes."" 25. An individual named T.R. told law enforcement that she witnessed Matthew Woods [*9]  rape T.S. 26. M.V. directly observed and heard others advise that additional women engaged in commercial sex acts on  behalf of the Galloway Organization, to include Juvenile J, K.T, T.S, and ""Renee."" 27. M.V. called 911 to report that Cornelius Galloway was looking for her after he had trafficked her, and she had  run away. 28. After contacting law enforcement, M.V. brought up the name ""Staxx"" (Matthew Woods) in her interview with  APD Sergeant Matthew Vollmer. 29. Juvenile M reported being beaten by Cornelius Galloway and was forced to perform commercial sex acts. 30. K.T., M.V., T.S., Juvenile J, and Juvenile M were all posted on Backpage.com, a website used to advertise  individuals for commercial sex. B. The Co-Conspirator Statements The following statements were made in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. The statements intended  to promote the conspiratorial objectives to traffic women, both minors and adults, for commercial sex. 1. Statement by Danielle Galloway to M.V., ""My friend over here wants to talk to you."" This statement was made in October 2016 by co-conspirator Danielle Galloway to M.V., while at Cornelius and  Danielle Galloway's residence on Third Street in Albuquerque, [*10]  New Mexico. Danielle Galloway had just  driven M.V. from M.V.'s place of employment to the residence. At the residence, Danielle stated to M.V., ""My friend  over here wants to talk to you."" M.V. was then led down a hallway to a room in which Cornelius Galloway and  Matthew Woods were present. Once M.V. was in the room, Matthew Woods began to physically batter her. Both  Woods and Cornelius Galloway were armed with firearms at that time. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *7 Page 5 of 31 Danielle Galloway's statement to M.V. letting her know that her ""friend"" wanted to talk to M.V. was uttered to cause  M.V. to go to the room wherein she was a beaten by Matthew Woods. It furthered the conspiracy because it put  M.V. into the room where the ""recruitment"" continued. Therefore, the statement is admissible in trial against  Matthew Woods as a co-conspirator statement under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 2. Statement by Cornelius ""Chip"" Galloway to M.V. about ""what's going to happen,"" that M.V. is going to  work for Cornelius and do what Cornelius says, and if she doesn't Cornelius and Matthew Woods are going  to beat M.V. until she cooperates. During the encounter discussed above where M.V. was led into the room and beaten by Matthew Woods, co- conspirator Cornelius Galloway told [*11]  M.V. what he expected of her. In sum and substance, he stated the  following to her, ""This is what's going to happen. You are going to work for me (Cornelius), and do what I  say. If you don't, we are going to beat you like this until you cooperate."" Matthew Woods was present when  Cornelius Galloway made this statement to M.V. After this encounter, M.V. remained with the Galloway Organization but refused to perform commercial sex acts on  their behalf for approximately one-and-a-half-weeks. During that time, M.V. was, as Cornelius Galloway threatened,  beaten by Matthew Woods. Eventually, M.V. tired of the beatings and acquiesced to the Galloway Organization's  demand that she prostitute herself for them. This statement by co-conspirator Cornelius Galloway furthers the conspiracy because it explains to M.V. the terms  of how the Galloway Organization would control and use her to further the group's commercial sex trafficking  enterprise. It is substantive evidence of the ""recruitment"" of M.V., and was uttered to force, coerce, and threaten  M.V. to engage in commercial sex acts. Therefore, the statement is admissible in trial against Matthew Woods as a  co-conspirator statement under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 3. Cornelius [*12]  ""Chip"" Galloway's statements to M.V. that if she didn't do the cocaine that was there for  her, that Cornelius would have Matthew Woods come over and force her to do it, ""We'll find a way to force  you, we'll shoot you up. We'll do whatever we have to... I don't want to force you, you know, force it down  into your body to make you happy but..."" These statements were made by co-conspirator Cornelius Galloway to M.V. in October or November of 2016. M.V.  is expected to testify that there were days when she was depressed, and instead of allowing M.V. to take her  prescribed medication, Cornelius Galloway wanted her to ingest cocaine instead. Specifically, Cornelius Galloway  insisted on cocaine use by stating, ""I'm going to have [Matthew Woods] come in here and force you to do it,  you know. We'll find a way to force you... we'll shoot you up. We'll do whatever we have to... I don't want to  force you, you know, force it down into your body to make you happy but..."" This statement furthers the conspiracy because it was made to coerce and persuade M.V. to ingest cocaine  because, in the view of the Galloway Organization, it would elevate her mood. Cornelius Galloway's purpose was to  manipulate and [*13]  direct M.V.'s behavior. The Government presented evidence that in the business of sex  trafficking, a prostitute experiencing the effects of cocaine, which can include a stimulant effect and increased  sociability, will likely bring in more money. The Government has sufficiently established this statement was made for  the ultimate purpose of causing M.V. to engage in commercial sex acts, and therefore it was made to further the  conspiracy. The statement is admissible in trial against Matthew Woods as a co-conspirator statement under Fed.  R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 4. Cornelius Galloway told M.V. that if she ever left, or if she ever said anything to anyone about what was  happening to her, he would hunt her down, find her, and kill her. 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *10 Page 6 of 31 When asked by police what would happen if M.V. ever left the Galloways, or tried to leave, M.V. responded,  ""[Cornelius Galloway] said he would hunt me down and he'd find me, and he said he would kill me.... if I  ever said anything to anybody, and that's why I'm scared."" This statement is direct evidence of threats and coercion by a co-conspirator and was said to further the conspiracy  by scaring M.V. into remaining with the Galloway Organization and continuing to engage in the commercial [*14]   sex that brought in money for them. Therefore, the statement is admissible at trial against Matthew Woods as a co- conspirator statement under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 5. Cornelius ""Chip"" Galloway told M.V. to ""get your ass in here... get in here 'cause I'm going to kick your  ass for leaving...You better not be calling the cops."" The Government has already presented evidence to this Court that after M.V. escaped the Galloway Organization,  Cornelius Galloway found her on November 23, 2016, and attempted to bring her back. However, upon being  confronted by Cornelius Galloway, M.V. called 911. The Court has reviewed the recording of her phone call and has  previously determined it to be admissible at trial. (Doc. 491). M.V. reported that Cornelius told M.V., ""get your ass  in here."" M.V. did not comply and called the police. Cornelius told M.V., ""get in here 'cause I'm going to kick  your ass for leaving."" M.V. continued to refuse and brought the phone up within view so that Cornelius could see  it. Cornelius stated, ""you better not be calling the cops."" In light of the prior threats discussed above (if M.V. ever left, Cornelius Galloway would hunt her down and kill her),  these statements were uttered by co-conspirator [*15]  Cornelius Galloway on the day he did in fact hunt M.V.  down. Cornelius' statement threatening M.V. and ordering her to get in the car was made to further the conspiracy  because having M.V. in the confines of a vehicle would, of course, allow him to more easily exert control over her  again. Cornelius Galloway's statement that M.V. better not be calling the cops was made to further the conspiracy  because it was uttered to thwart a report to law enforcement. Cornelius used the statement to prevent M.V. from  telling anyone about what the Galloway Organization had done to her previously and intended to do to her moving  forward. Therefore, the statement is admissible in trial against Matthew Woods as a co-conspirator statement under  Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 6. Text Messages Discussing Finding M.V. a. Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: ""I know where [M.V.] at."" Cornelius Galloway: ""Where is she at and have that job came yet."" Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: ""No"" Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: ""And she downtown"" Cornelius Galloway: ""Where is she at"" (Exhibit 1A, lines 454-458) Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: [sends screen shot of message with J.G. with text stating ""in the car on McKight (sp)  and [C]ommercial"" ] (Exhibit 2) Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: [*16]  ""Look it up and the car is a silver Kia rio."" Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: ""And the driver side dosn't have a side mirror."" Cornelius Galloway: ""I know where it's at I'm headed there right now."" (Exhibit 1A, lines 459-461)   2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *13 Page 7 of 31 These messages were sent on November 23, 2016 at 3:18 am, less than an hour prior to the report referenced  above during which Cornelius Galloway confronted M.V. The text messages from co-conspirator Cornelius  Galloway are admissible because they were made to further the conspiracy in that their purpose was to ferret out  the whereabouts of M.V. As such, the messages are admissible at trial against Matthew Woods as co-conspirator  statements under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). Furthermore, the messages from Juvenile J, who used several  different phone numbers over the course of indicted period, are admissible because they are not offered for the  truth of the matter asserted, but to put Cornelius Galloway's statements in context. See United States v. Cesareo- Ayala, 576 F.3d 1120, 1128-29 (10th Cir. 2009). 7. Cornelius ""Chip"" Galloway told T.S.: ""Bitch I'll kill you, bitch"". ""Sit back before I beat your ass, I'll blow  your shit off your fucking head."" The Government will introduce these statements at trial through its witness Danielle Galloway, whom the  Government claims was [*17]  present when Cornelius Galloway initially made these statements to T.S. Post- arrest, Cornelius Galloway repeated these statements to law enforcement and added that he would never actually  take these actions against T.S. Regardless of his true intentions, co-conspirator Cornelius Galloway made these statements to T.S. to further the  conspiracy. They are threats of violence made to control her behavior. Controlling her behavior is an important  aspect of sex trafficking T.S. Threats and violence are an element of the crimes charged. Therefore, the statement  is admissible at trial against Matthew Woods as a coconspirator statement under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 8. Cornelius ""Chip"" Galloway asked Matthew Woods to beat T.S. up. Defendant Matthew Woods stated to police that ""Chip"" had asked him to ""beat [T.S.] up."" This information came  after discussing the perception that T.S. had been ""fagging off"" and ""won't work for anyone."" Cornelius Galloway  was a co-conspirator, and his request that Matthew Woods beat T.S. was made in the course of the conspiracy and  also furthered it by effecting physical punishment upon T.S. for her behavior that was deemed counterproductive to  the Galloway Organization's objectives, [*18]  i.e. ""fagging off."" The Court heard extensive testimony regarding the  timing and nature of Matthew Woods' statements to police regarding these interactions with Cornelius Galloway.  Consequently, it finds that the Government has sufficiently established Cornelius Galloway made these statements  under the circumstances described above. Therefore, statements by which Cornelius Galloway requests that  Matthew Woods batter T.S. due to her noncompliant behavior and actions are admissible at trial against Matthew  Woods as co-conspirator statements under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 9. Statement by Cornelius Galloway to Danielle Galloway regarding Juvenile M that ""She's good to go."" At some point between December 2016 and February 2017, Cornelius Galloway and Marcus Taylor recruited  Juvenile M. to prostitute for the Galloway Organization. At the end of the conversation/recruitment, it was necessary  for someone to advise Danielle Galloway whether Juvenile M. would be commencing ""work."" Therefore, Cornelius  Galloway advised Danielle Galloway regarding Juvenile M. that ""she's good to go,"" which SA Pharis testified he  interpreted as meaning that Juvenile M was ready to begin engaging in commercial sex work. Upon being  ""good [*19]  to go,"" Danielle could start making her arrangements to advertise Juvenile M. and arrange rooms        2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *16 Page 8 of 31 where the sex acts would occur. The basic purpose of making this statement was for Cornelius to let another  coconspirator, Danielle Galloway, know that they had an additional girl to sell. This communication was made in the  course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. Therefore, the statement is admissible at trial against Matthew  Woods as a co-conspirator statement under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 10. Statement by Marcus Taylor to Cornelius ""Chip"" Galloway communicating to Cornelius Galloway to  stop beating Juvenile M In or near the early part of 2017, Juvenile M was fighting with another unnamed victim who was also being  trafficked by the Galloway Organization. As punishment for fighting with each other, Cornelius Galloway beat the  two of them at Matthew Woods' residence with what was perceived by some to be an electrical cord. Danielle  Galloway and Marcus Taylor were outside the apartment listening to the beating. At some point, it was described to  have gotten so bad that Marcus Taylor had to go inside and tell Cornelius to stop. Marcus Taylor's communication to fellow co-conspirator Cornelius Galloway to stop [*20]  the beating was made in  the course of the conspiracy because it ultimately dealt with financial and business considerations. If Juvenile M.  had been hurt to the point of being unable to ""work,"" it would have adversely affected the Galloway Organization's  business. SA Pharis testified that, from the perspective of sex traffickers, a beaten woman may, to some  prospective buyers, have less appeal than one who was not bruised and battered. Since some customers plausibly  may not wish to engage in commercial sex with a woman who appeared to have been beaten up, the revenue  stream to the Galloway Organization was at risk. Therefore, Marcus Taylor telling Cornelius Galloway to stop the  beating furthered the monetary interests of the conspiracy, and this statement is admissible in trial against Matthew  Woods as a co-conspirator statement under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 11. Cornelius ""Chip"" Galloway's statements to Danielle Galloway that he wished to continue giving  narcotics to an uncharged victim, despite the fact that she was pregnant. One of the uncharged victims became pregnant, a development that spawned a discussion between Cornelius and  Danielle Galloway concerning whether the Galloway Organization should continue [*21]  to provide narcotics to the  pregnant victim. The Government will present evidence that Cornelius Galloway told Danielle Galloway that he  wished to continue to provide narcotics to this woman despite the fact that she was pregnant. The  Government sufficiently established that this statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy because it  allowed the Galloway Organization to continue to use narcotics to control the woman for the purpose of ensuring  that she would continue to engage in commercial sex. At this point, there is no reason to find that Cornelius  Galloway made this statement in an effort to further objectives unrelated to the conspiracy (e.g. profits from sales of  recreational drugs). Therefore, such a statement is made in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy, and  it is admissible at trial against Matthew Woods as a co-conspirator statement under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 12. Danielle Galloway's Facebook post to T.S., ""Dog Pen [T.S.]"" The Government will present evidence at trial that the Organization placed one if its victims, T.S., inside what  witnesses will describe as a dog cage or pen as punishment for failing to abide by the Galloway Organization's  rules. Afterward, co-conspirator [*22]  Danielle Galloway posted the words, ""Dog Pen [T.S.]"" on T.S.'s Facebook  page. This is not an instance of two acquaintances using the social media platform to stay in touch. Rather, this  statement made by co-conspirator Danielle Galloway communicates the consequences of T.S.'s alleged  misbehavior or noncompliance. These words are written to exert control over a victim. Furthermore, the statement  was made to a wide audience that included T.S. and everyone with access to T.S.'s Facebook page, and therefore  is written with plausible knowledge that other victims would read it, and it would act as a warning to them as well.  The statement not only furthers the conspiracy with respect to T.S., but also with respect to any other victims who  might also read it. Therefore, the statement is admissible at trial against Matthew Woods as a co-conspirator  statement under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *19 Page 9 of 31 13. Text messages between Cornelius Galloway and Prospective Buyers of Commercial Sex. The text messages put forth in subsections 13, 14, 15, and 16 are found in Government Exhibit 1A, which  catalogues incoming and outgoing text messages found on Cornelius Galloway's cell phone. Exhibit 1A uses a  color-coded system that identifies [*23]  the author of each message. Cornelius Galloway's text messages are  keyed to a gray background. The text messages in the white background are authored by unknown prospective  buyers of commercial sex (""johns""). The messages from johns are soliciting commercial sex on their face. The vast  majority of them begin as apparent inquiries to online commercial sex advertisements. A number of them also begin  within minutes of a prior text conversation that discusses or references posting an advertisement. Cornelius Galloway's side of the conversations with the johns consists of him pretending to be the female  advertised online (although the unnamed john in conversation 'l' is aware that he is communicating with Mr.  Galloway). Cornelius Galloway informs the johns of where to go, how much to pay, and what kinds of sex acts they  can perform with the women. Occasionally Cornelius Galloway asks about law enforcement affiliation, and screens  for customers he perceives not to be serious. These statements by Cornelius Galloway are direct evidence of him  selling sex by managing the flow of customers and negotiating price. Thus, they were made in the course of and in  furtherance of the conspiracy. The johns' [*24]  statements are admissible for their non-hearsay contextual value, specifically, their ability to  demonstrate that Cornelius Galloway's statements were made during the course of and in furtherance of the  conspiracy. See Cesareo-Ayala, 576 F.3d at 1129 (finding that statements that ""may well support an assertion of  the prosecution"" are not hearsay under Rule 801(c) because they were not admitted for their truth, but rather to  establish that a business relationship existed between the declarants and to put the defendant's statements in  context); see also State v. Jackson, 2018-NMCA-066, ¶ 21, 429 P.3d 674, 682 (finding under state rules of  evidence, identical to the corresponding federal rules, that text messages from prospective customers of  commercial sex ""were not offered for their truth—that the price for services was $150 per hour or that Tiffany was in  a certain location at a certain time. Rather, those statements were offered to provide context and establish that  Defendant and Tiffany were motivated by money to set up commercial sexual transactions""). Moreover, the vast  majority of the johns' text messages are non-assertive statements or questions. See United States v. Lewis, 902  F.2d 1176, 1179 (5th Cir. 1990) (questions asked by an unknown caller, like most questions and inquiries, are not  hearsay because they do not, and were not [*25]  intended to assert anything), see also United States v. Jackson,  88 F.3d 845, 847-48 (10th Cir. 1996) (the question, ""Is this Kenny?"" cannot reasonably be construed to be an  intended assertion, either express or implied). a.

Text messages between Cornelius ""Chip"" Galloway and the victims, named and unnamed. Cornelius Galloway also engages in a number of text messages with women who are ""working"" for him as  prostitutes. Specifically, he engages in conversations with K.T. (color keyed in light pink on Government Exhibit 1A),  M.V. (fuscia), T.S. (lavender), [*31]  and Juvenile J (purple). He also engages with a number of women who are not  named as victims in the indictment, but are identifiable within the context of the messages themselves, and through  reports by victims. These women include Renee (bright green), and Renee 2 (blue). There are also a few other  phone numbers of individuals who are clearly, from the face of the messages, engaged in commercial sex for the  Galloway Organization, but because Cornelius Galloway had no contact information saved, are unidentifiable. It is  likely they are not ""new"" girls but are different numbers for the women already named in this paragraph. The text  messages authored by the victims are admissible for their contextual value. The content of these conversations is generally the same and includes telling the women when they have dates,  where they should go, and ensuring their cooperation. The Government has selected the following to present to the  jury: a. Cornelius Galloway: what's up what you got K.T., 505-231-7824: ok in ready to make $$ K.T., 505-231-7824: Im sick of this shit already but wen I ask u or marcus for help I get ignored. Please chip.  Idc if I dnt get high for week's I promise I wont fuhk up. [*32]  (Exhibit 1A, lines 1-3) This message, sent on September 5, 2016, shows Cornelius Galloway checking in with victim K.T. about whether or  not she will be working for him. K.T.'s messages are admissible because they are not being presented to prove the  truth of the matter asserted. In other words, the Government will not be proving that indeed, K.T. is ""sick of this  shit,"" or that she doesn't care if she gets high for a week, or that she ""wont fuhk up."" The statements are coming in  to show recruitment by Cornelius Galloway, and that there is a connection between Cornelius Galloway and Marcus  Taylor. The statement by Cornelius Galloway is indicative of recruitment of K.T. and is made to further the  conspiracy to sex traffic K.T. b. 505-203-1506: I need the Backpage account info 2021 U.S. Dist.

Wow Cornelius Galloway: Oops wrong person (Id, lines 85-96) These texts were written in late September 2016. The messages themselves, [*34]  as well as SA Pharis'  testimony, establish that co-conspirator Cornelius Galloway was directing the advertisement of women on the  website Backpage.com, as well as posting the advertisements himself. These statements were made in furtherance  of the conspiracy. When T.S. tells him she cannot access the Backpage website, Cornelius responds with an intent  to instruct her to either go to sleep or go ""walking"" to get some money. Despite the fact that this message (line 94)  was sent to an unintended recipient, the statement was made in the course of the conspiracy, and was made to  further the money making endeavors of T.S. by ordering her to go ""walking."" d. T.S., 575-291-3706: Are u coming back to check out in a few Cornelius Galloway: I'm up here right now getting a room again but y'all going to beat your feet today.   2021 U.S. Dist.

These statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy. h.

He is dictating the victim's access to food, showers, and generally exercising control over their actions,  schedules, and movements around town. Conversation 'i' demonstrates that Cornelius Galloway exerts control over  K.T. through narcotics as it shows Cornelius Galloway agreeing to give her ""medicine"" to keep her from getting  ""sicker."" These statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy. l. Unknown victim, 505-589-2767: 50 are around be careful Cornelius Galloway: Okay (Id, lines 143-144) The term ""50"" is believed to be a common slang term [*37]  for police, pronounced 5-O (using the letter O as  opposed to a zero). In the above message l., Cornelius Galloway is stating his acknowledgement that there are  police around, and that he will be careful. This furthers the conspiracy because it is uttered for the purpose of  evading detection by law enforcement. m.

Cornelius Galloway: I am going to go get you some medicine now and sleep tonight and be ready by  tomorrow K.T. 505-570-6178: Ok (Id, lines 159-160) o. Cornelius Galloway: I'm a fuck you real bad when I catch you and tell that nigga staccs to answer the  motherfucking phone or I'm going to fuck him up to. (Id, line 161) Conversations 'm' through 'o' highlight an interaction with victim K.T., wherein Cornelius Galloway suspects she is  withholding money from him. At the same time he is dictating where she must go (SA Pharis testified that here  ""brother"" referred to Marcus Taylor) and arranging for her to get back on track by giving her a pep talk and securing  her some medication so that she can feel better and stay up, presumably to continue engaging in commercial sex  acts and making money. However, the statement in 'o' indicates that matters were not mended, and Cornelius is  threatening violence on K.T. for her non-compliance. These [*39]  statements were made in furtherance of the  conspiracy. p. T.S., 575-291-3706: Wya Cornelius Galloway: what's up Cornelius Galloway: You ready to come back yet (Id, lines 162-164) The text messages as a whole track several instances over the charging period where some victims have left and  come back. Conversation 'p' is an example of a communication Cornelius Galloway has with T.S. where he  broaches the prospect of her coming back to work. This statement is indicative of recruitment, or re-recruitment, of  T.S., and furthers the conspiracy by extending an invitation to come back. The invitation was eventually accepted  by T.S., as seen in text messages below. q. Cornelius Galloway: Tell your homeboy the one he really wanted is with me in the you can stay over  there nobody wants your nasty ass anyway but know that you can't walk around the hood. (Id, line 167) Message 'q' is an example of aggressiveness of co-conspirator Cornelius Galloway aimed at one of the victims. It's  disrespectful nature, and prohibition on free movement, is evidence of coercion and threats used in the sex  trafficking scheme. This message was made in furtherance of the conspiracy. r. Renee 1, 505-582-9802: Hey I jus got out [*40]  a shower getting ready now k Cornelius Galloway: My wife on the way to get you right now Renee 1, 505-582-9802: Ok Renee 1, 505-582-9802: ...

Cornelius Galloway: On the way u done Cornelius Galloway: [*41]  On the freeway comim for u now b there (Id, lines 197-207) Conversations 'r', 's', and 't' are indicative of Cornelius Galloway's maintenance of his victims. He tells them what to  do with their items, brings them personal hygiene supplies, and food. Conversation 't' also shows his decision  making in when his victims do dates and how much they should charge. Conversation 't' also indicates he is  transporting this victim as well. All of this is done in the course of the conspiracy to further the main objectives of the  conspiracy. u. Cornelius Galloway: He on the way up Renee 1, 505-582-9802: Yea I been done Renee 1, 505-582-9802: I  mean he got here late lol Renee 1, 505-582-9802: Wait so am I done for the night..? Er Wut...?

LEXIS 81858, *42 Page 20 of 31 Conversations 'u' through 'aa' demonstrate how Cornelius Galloway schedules his victims' days. He tells them  when their dates are coming, how long they will last, how much they will pay, and when they are done for the day.  His statements are the catalyst for the commercial sex acts, and are therefore made in the course and in  furtherance of the conspiracy. bb. Cornelius Galloway: You ready to stop bullshittin K.T., 505-306-4754: Yes but I don't wanna walk [*44]  the track an shit in still regular ol me I will comply but I  aint tobi Cornelius Galloway: You don't have to walk the track at all there's no money on the track K.T., 505-306-4754: Ok that's the only reason I tripped an you don't gotta be aggressive wit me it works better I  promise I don't lik how Yall didn't see me as a friend no more K.T., 505-306-4754: cause that's all it is im doin it so we can all eat Cornelius Galloway: when I come to the hood I'm going to pick you up and we're going to talk about it  okay (Id, lines 275-280) Conversation 'bb' shows the re-recruitment of victim K.T., in light of their previous communications (see  conversations 'm', 'n'., and 'o' above). Co-conspirator Cornelius Galloway's question of whether she is ""ready to  stop bullshittin"" is a reference to her previous non-compliance. He then proceeds to sweeten the proposition by  telling her she does not have to walk the track this time. Upon hearing K.T. still has concerns about his  aggressiveness, he states he wants to have a discussion about that aspect of their arrangement. Galloway's  statements are made to cause K.T. to re-initiate her prostitution work, and thus further the conspiracy. cc.

T.S., 575-291-3706: we're u at Cornelius Galloway: Home Cornelius Galloway: Did you get any money tonight (Id, lines 356-358) Conversations 'ff' through 'ss' involve relationships between Cornelius Galloway and T.S., and Cornelius Galloway  and K.T. The texts show both women being apologetic about falling out of line. Cornelius Galloway's statements to  them vary between trying to be somewhat comforting to giving them direct and aggressive orders. Cornelius's  statements ultimately cause both women to return and resume commercial sex acts on behalf of the Galloway  Organization, thus furthering the conspiracy. The conversations also show the deterioration of the working  ""relationship"" with T.S.—she leaves again after an apparent falling out, and when she asks to come back, Galloway  tells her she can only come back if she brings another girl (line 355). The statement furthers the conspiracy  because it is made to bring one girl back while obtaining an additional girl to sell. tt. Cornelius Galloway: Play game if you want to All [*50]  I'm gonna do is go over to your dad's house  and show him your Backpage (Id, line 359) The statement in 'tt' is uttered as a direct and unequivocal threat. The above statement is logically construed to  state that if the victim continues to ""play game,"" Cornelius is going to show her dad her Backpage advertisements.  This is a coercive statement uttered for the purpose of controlling the victim's behavior through threatened  consequences. For that reason, it furthers the conspiracy. uu.

Cornelius  statements are examples of how the victims, including M.V. were maintained. These statements were made in  furtherance of the conspiracy. yy.

Cornelius Galloway: To me. (Id, lines 418-421) Conversations yy. through ccc. involve Juvenile J and Renee 2. Cornelius's statements contain the same themes  as discussed before, namely control and maintenance of victims. The statements further the conspiracy because  Cornelius arranges and inquires about ""dates."" He orders Juvenile J around and offers to help Renee 2 continuing  ""working"" on a difficult day. ddd. Cornelius Galloway: Okay be right there she will Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: I'm scared to go back Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: Come in 10 Cornelius Galloway: Why are you scared to come back Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: I don't wanna get beat Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: ;o Cornelius Galloway: Have I ever beat you Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: Come now to the MC dondls Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: On Paseo n San pedro Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: Hurry Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: No u haven't Cornelius Galloway: She's on her way now Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: K to the McDonalds Cornelius Galloway: Okay I'm fixing to text her now [*54]  and tell her that you at the McDonald's Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: Yeah Juvenile J, 505-886-5240: What car she in?

It also shows an acceptance of the idea that Juvenile J would obtain a john  for T.S. Indeed, he gives out T.S.'s Backpage name for this purpose. These statements were made in furtherance  of the conspiracy. eee. Cornelius Galloway: Are you done yet Renee 2, 505-444-4207: Yes sorry the text didn't go through just saw Cornelius Galloway: okay somebody else on that way right now too so hurry up and clean up Renee 2, 505-444-4207: For how long and how much Cornelius Galloway: the same Renee 2, 505-444-4207: Kay Cornelius Galloway: You got another one coming for the same thing [*55]  Renee 2, 505-444-4207: Ok so like two or what do you mean cause the first one hasn't even came yet.

LEXIS 81858, *54 Page 27 of 31 Text conversations 'fff', 'ggg', and 'hhh' occurred on November 24, 2016, which was Thanksgiving Day, while  conversation 'iii' occurred shortly after midnight the next morning. It appears from the context that Cornelius  Galloway allowed Juvenile J to spend time with her family on Thanksgiving, which is the day after Juvenile J alerted  Cornelius Galloway as to the whereabouts of M.V. after M.V. ran away. Read in context, Galloway's concession  appears to ""reward"" Juvenile J's loyalty. However, when Juvenile J does not ""keep locking in"" with Cornelius, it  becomes a problem for him, and he scolds her and orders her to come back to continue engaging in commercial  sex work. Under the circumstances, these statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy. jjj.

(Id, lines 492-493) Conversations 'jjj' through 'lll' show the same themes as discussed above but as it relates to a different victim. This  particular arrangement was short lived, but ends with aggressive statements towards ""Chocolate"" when she blocks  his number. Conversation 'jjj' demonstrates maintenance of this woman. Conversations 'kkk' and 'lll' are punishment  for her non-compliance. Therefore, these statements were made in the course of and in furtherance of the  conspiracy. mmm.

Unknown individual using K.T.'s phone, 682-551-6022: [K.T.] said help her get out of jail fam Cornelius Galloway: You tell that bitch and she don't stop it I'm going to come down there just to slap  her ass (Id, lines 509-510) Conversations 'mmm' and 'nnn' show the latest re-recruitment of K.T. Cornelius's statements first serve cause her  to come back and work (mmm), and devolve in Cornelius wanting her to know that he is going to come to her and  physically batter her. These statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy. ooo. Juvenile J, 505-203-4528: I'm kinda scared to go Cornelius Galloway: Trust me you have nothing to be afraid of Cornelius Galloway: I just don't want to see you doing that bad you know we do care for you Juvenile J, 505-203-4528: [*59]  Yeah but I've made you loose out on quite a bit of money and last time Jamilla  did that to me because of that reason Cornelius Galloway: Jamilah do what I tell her to do and trust me that's far from her mind Cornelius Galloway: You didn't make us lose out on a lot of money I was doing things the wrong way  buy how I used to get mad and treat you Juvenile J, 505-203-4528: Okay, am I going to be coming back home tonight? Cornelius Galloway: Ok Juvenile J, 505-203-4528: Whaat? Juvenile J, 505-203-4528: Whaat? Cornelius Galloway: You said you was going back home and I said okay (Id, lines 511-5521) In this communication 'ooo', Cornelius Galloway is recruiting Juvenile J to start working for him again. His  statements are made to put her at ease about coming back to the Galloway Organization after an apparent falling  out, and Cornelius is telling her it will not be the way it was before. The communication ends with Cornelius telling  her it is ok to come back home, i.e., back to the Galloway Organization. These statements were made in  furtherance of the conspiracy. ppp. Cornelius Galloway: What's up Juvenile J, 505-203-4528: If your around do you think you can bring me a couple cigs please? I also told [*60]   my mom about the Jamar thing Cornelius Galloway: Okay my brother is going to call you to come outside Juvenile J, 505-203-4528: Okay is he gonna come to me? Cornelius Galloway: Ya (Id, lines 522-526) qqq. Cornelius Galloway: Get ready and come out (Id, line 527) rrr. Juvenile J, 505-203-4528: I need at of some clear Cornelius Galloway: What's up 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *58 Page 29 of 31 Cornelius Galloway: Dial my brother (Id, lines 528-530) The last three conversations indicate that Juvenile J is working for the Galloway Organization once again. Cornelius  Galloway gives her instructions to get ready and come out. And, as was the common theme, Juvenile J would  request narcotics in the course of her work, and Cornelius granted her requests. These statements were made in  the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. 15. Text messages between Cornelius ""Chip"" Galloway and the other named co-conspirators. There are text messages between Cornelius Galloway and Danielle Galloway (color keyed in orange), Marcus  Taylor (gold/yellow), and Matthew Woods (yellow). Text messages by Matthew Woods are admissible as  statements by a party opponent under Fed. R. Evid 801(d)(2)(A) if presented by the Government. Danielle Galloway  is saved in Cornelius Galloway's phone as [*61]  ""*Wife."" Marcus Taylor is saved as ""bro Lil."" Matthew Woods'  name is not saved, but Matthew Woods identifies himself as ""Staxx"" when communicating with Cornelius Galloway. a. Danielle Galloway, 505-388-3131: Had to change hotels they closed the office at 7 so has to make a  new reservation at a different hotel."" (Exhibit 1A, line 417). At the time of this message, the Galloways were conducting business out of hotel rooms. This statement by  Danielle Galloway was made in furtherance the conspiracy because it informs another co-conspirator of where they  will be continuing their commercial sex activities. b. Danielle Galloway, 505-388-3131: Renee watz the clear. (Id, line 453). This conversation shows that Renee, one of the uncharged trafficking victims, would like some methamphetamine.  Danielle's message is found in the middle of communications to and from Renee about Renee performing  commercial sex acts, therefore Renee's order for methamphetamine is made while she is being engaged in  prostitution at the Galloways behest. Danielle forwarding the order for drugs means that her text message was  made in furtherance of the conspiracy because it helped provide narcotics to a victim to facilitate [*62]  her  performing commercial sex acts. c. Danielle Galloway, 505-388-3131: she didn't answer babe I called you like 4 times I would have me to  do."" (Id. Line 462). This message was sent during the time frame Juvenile J was communicating with Cornelius Galloway regarding  completing commercial sex acts. Danielle's text message was made in furtherance of the conspiracy as it seeks  advice from Cornelius on what to do about not being able to get in touch with one of the girls. d. Cornelius Galloway: where are you at. Matthew Woods, 505-445-1716: 215 Cornelius Galloway: come out to the street right now. (Id, lines 375-377) e. Matt Woods, 317-998-0163: You want some zanies Cornelius Galloway: Ya Matthew Woods, 317-998-0163: Where you at Cornelius: I'm at home  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *60 Page 30 of 31 Matt Woods, 317-998-0163: How much for the ruger Cornelius Galloway: 300 Matt Woods, 317-998-0163: I'm coo Matt Woods, 317-998-0163: Really 300 I didn't do you that bad when I sale you anything lol smh (Id, lines 483-490) Matt Woods, 317-998-0163: I was trying to give you the thang for 175 bro (Id, line 491) While Mr. Woods' statements are statements by a party opponent, Cornelius Galloway's side of conversation 'd'  furthers the conspiracy by arranging a [*63]  face to face meeting with Mr. Woods after determining his  whereabouts. Exhibit 1A shows that this exchange occurred on November 10, 2016 and Booking.com records show  that Danielle Galloway had booked a room for that date at the Howard Johnson at 900 Medical Arts in Albuquerque,  New Mexico. Cornelius Galloway's statements to Mr. Woods here are alternatively admissible because they are not  assertions under Fed. R. Evid. 801. Mr. Galloway asks a question and then follows up with an order. Therefore,  they are non-hearsay and are admissible. As for conversation 'e', SA Pharis testified that ""zanies"" are a slang term for Xanex, which was the drug that the  Galloway Organization provided to Juvenile M. SA Pharis further testified that the terms ""ruger"" and ""thang"" both  refer to a firearm. The Government will present further evidence at trial that both Cornelius Galloway and Matthew  Woods possessed firearms in the course of their sex trafficking activities and used them as tools of force and  coercion. Communications between the two of them referencing selling each other firearms are therefore made in  the course and furtherance of the conspiracy. While Matthew Woods' statement in line 491 is sent some time after  the texts immediately [*64]  above it, it is admissible as a statement by party opponent, and offers context to the  conversation above in in lines 487-490. f. Marcus Taylor: 505-448-9104: ""Can't talk now. What's up?"" Cornelius Galloway: Bro the police is around  the corner on foot. (Id, lines 165-166) Galloway's statement about the police being around the corner is in furtherance of the conspiracy because it is  uttered to prevent a co-conspirator's detection by police, therefore furthering the objectives of the conspiracy. g. Marcus Taylor, 505-448-9105: Soo we stil in the lobby. (Id, line 337) This text message was sent after at least three instances of Cornelius Galloway ordering the women to come down  from their hotel rooms (Id. Lines 333-336). Marcus Taylor is a co-conspirator and this message furthers the  conspiracy by informing Cornelius where ""we"" are. Because each of the statements contained in subsection 15 were made by co-conspirators and were made in the  course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy, they are admissible in trial against Matthew Woods as co- conspirator statements under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). 16. Text messages between Cornelius Galloway and unnamed individual at 505-550-5491. a. Unnamed individual, 505-550-5491: Don't [*65]  worry my nigga you will have yo gun and a new one by  tonight don't sweat it Cornelius Galloway: ok (Exhibit 1A, lines 542 to 543) 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *62 Page 31 of 31 Cornelius Galloway's response of ""ok"" to the statement above is an adoption of that statement. The Government's  evidence shows that use or brandishing of firearms was part and parcel of the Galloway Organization's sex  trafficking conspiracy. Here, Cornelius Galloway's statement, which exhibits an intent to obtain firearms, was made  in furtherance of the conspiracy because firearms play a part in the force and coercion of the victims in this case.  The statement by the unnamed party is admissible because it provides the only context for Cornelius Galloway's  statement. Furthermore, the unnamed party's statements are not being offered to prove that in fact Mr. Galloway  would be receiving his gun and a new one by that particular night, but to prove that Mr. Galloway had access to  firearms during that period. C. The Court concludes the statements contained in Part B, in subsections 1 through 16, which are typewritten in  bold and underlined font, are not hearsay, and are admissible against Mr. Woods as co-conspirator statements  under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). All other statements are admissible [*66]  for context, are not being offered for the  truth of the matter asserted, or are not assertive statements that would fall under the rule against hearsay. D. The Court concludes the statements contained in Part B, in subsections 1 through 16, are not testimonial  because they were not made with an expectation to be used in a criminal prosecution. They were uttered in the  course of a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking. Therefore, they are not barred by Crawford v. Washington, 541  U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 (2004). E. The Court's rulings on Defendant's objections to the admission of statements contained in Part B and the  evidence underlying the preliminary determination of Matthew Woods' membership in the conspiracy have been  incorporated into these Findings and Conclusions. IT IS SO ORDERED. /s/ William P. Johnson WILLIAM P. JOHNSON CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81858, *65",1
"Vargasan v. MG Freesites, Ltd., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80842","MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER This is a pro se civil action brought by a prisoner  pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. This matter is before the  Court upon three motions filed by Plaintiff Stephen  Bruce Vargasan (DNs 4, 8, & 10) and for screening of  this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e) since  Plaintiff is proceeding in forma pauperis. I. MOTION TO APPOINT COUNSEL In the first motion before the Court, Plaintiff states that  he seeks the appointment of counsel because he is  incarcerated and unable to afford a lawyer; he has a  complex case ""that would require[] extent knowledge in  the areas that I am suing for""; and because a lawyer  could help him file motions and ""gather the evidence  needed to prove [his] case[]"" (DN 4). Appointment of counsel in a civil case is not a  constitutional right."" Lavado v. Keohane, 992 F.2d 601,  605 (6th Cir. 1993) (emphasis added); Turner v. Rogers,  564 U.S. 431, 441, 131 S. Ct. 2507, 180 L. Ed. 2d 452  (2011) (""[T]he Sixth Amendment does not govern civil  cases.""); Bennett v. Smith, 110 F. App'x 633, 635 (6th  Cir. 2004) (""[T]here is no right to counsel in prisoner civil  rights cases.""). Under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e), ""[t]he court  may request an attorney to represent any person unable  to afford counsel."" § 1915(e)(1) (emphasis added). It is  a matter ""'within the discretion of the court,'"" Childs v.  Pellegrin, 822 F.2d 1382, 1384 (6th Cir. 1987)  (quoting [*2]  United States v. Madden, 352 F.2d 792,  793 (9th Cir. 1965)), and ""'is a privilege that is justified  only by exceptional circumstances.'"" Lavado, 992 F.2d  at 606 (quoting Wahl v. McIver, 773 F.2d 1169, 1174  (11th Cir. 1985)). ""To determine whether these  exceptional  circumstances  exist,  courts  typically  consider 'the type of case and the ability of the plaintiff  to represent himself.'"" Lanier v. Bryant, 332 F.3d 999,  1006 (6th Cir. 2003) (quoting Archie v. Christian, 812  F.2d 250, 253 (5th Cir. 1987)). ""This generally involves  a determination of the 'complexity of the factual and  legal issues involved.'"" Lavado, 992 F.2d at 606  (quoting Cookish v. Cunningham, 787 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.  1986)). The Court finds that the complexity of the issues in this  case does not necessitate the appointment of counsel  and a review of the documents filed by Plaintiff in this  case reveals that he is sufficiently articulate and able to  present his case to the Court. Moreover, Plaintiff does  not show how his circumstances are different than other  incarcerated plaintiffs. See, e.g., Stewart v. United  States, No. 2:13-cv-02896-STA-egb, 2017 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 31834, at *1 n.1 (W.D. Tenn. Mar. 7, 2017)  (finding appointed counsel not warranted where the  plaintiff maintain that ""the issues in the case are 'too  complex for him' and that he has 'extremely limited  access to the law library,' is 'mentally ill,' 'does not have  an education,' and has 'a limited knowledge of the law'. .  . . Nothing distinguishes this case from the numerous  other petitions filed by indigent prisoners and Petitioner  has been able to proceed proficiently on his own [*3]  at  all stages of this litigation""); Coates v. Kafczynski, No.  2:05-CV-3, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8641, at *4 (W.D.  Mich. Feb. 22, 2006) (""[T]here is nothing exceptional  concerning [a prisoner's] incarceration or poverty that  extraordinarily debilitates his ability to investigate crucial  facts. These are ordinary and routine impediments  incident to prisoner litigation.""). For these reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that  Page 2 of 6 Plaintiff's motion for the appointment of counsel (DN 4)  is DENIED. II. MOTION TO AMEND COMPLAINT Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1), a party may amend its  pleading once as a matter of course within ""(A) 21 days  after serving it, or (B) if the pleading is one to which a  responsive pleading is required, 21 days after service of  a responsive pleading or 21 days after service of a  motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f), whichever is earlier."" Because this action is before the Court for screening  pursuant to § 1915A and no Defendant has been  served, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff's motion  for leave to amend the complaint (DN 8) is GRANTED.  The Court will screen the complaint and amended  complaint below. III. MOTION TO PROCEED ANONYMOUSLY The Court next turns to Plaintiff's motion to proceed  anonymously (DN 10). ""As a general matter, a complaint  must state the names of all parties."" Doe v. Porter, 370  F.3d 558, 560 (6th Cir. 2004) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P.  10(a)). ""Under certain circumstances, . [*4]  . . the  district court may allow a plaintiff to proceed under a  pseudonym by granting a protective order."" D.E. v. Doe,  834 F.3d 723, 728 (6th Cir. 2016). ""The burden is on the  Plaintiff to demonstrate that the need for anonymity  substantially outweighs both the presumption that a  party's identity is public information and the risk of  unfairness to the opposing party."" Doe v. Dordoni, No.  1:16-CV-00074, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115475, at *6-7  (W.D. Ky. Aug. 29, 2016). The Sixth Circuit has held: Several  considerations  determine  whether  a  plaintiff's privacy interests substantially outweigh  the presumption of open judicial proceedings. They  include: (1) whether the plaintiffs seeking anonymity  are suing to challenge governmental activity; (2)  whether prosecution of the suit will compel the  plaintiff to disclose information ""of the utmost  intimacy""; (3) whether the litigation compels  plaintiffs to disclose an intention to violate the law,  thereby risking criminal prosecution; and (4)  whether the plaintiffs are children. Porter, 370 F.3d at 560 (quoting Doe v. Stegall, 653  F.2d 180, 185-86 (5th Cir. 1981)). Additionally, courts  ""consider whether the defendants are being forced to  proceed with insufficient information to present their  arguments against the plaintiff's case."" Citizens for a  Strong Ohio v. Marsh, 123 F. App'x 630, 636 (6th Cir.  2005). Plaintiff presents no arguments in support of his motion  to proceed anonymously, but the only potentially  pertinent factor of those [*5]  set forth above is that the  pleadings could be construed as containing information  ""of the utmost intimacy."" The Court finds that this single  factor is not sufficient to allow Plaintiff to proceed  anonymously because it does not outweigh the ""the  strong public policy in favor of public access to judicial  proceedings."" Does v. Shalushi, No. 10-11837, 2010  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77331, at *5 (E.D. Mich. Jul. 30, 2010).  Indeed, ""where a motion to proceed anonymously has  been granted, courts have generally found further  purpose for protecting the plaintiff's identity"" than this  factor alone. K.R.B. v. Elizabethtown Indep. School  Dist., No. 3:17-CV-00605, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  226548, at *3 (W.D. Ky. Dec. 7, 2017) (concluding that  although the plaintiffs allege that they were victims of a  child pornography scheme, since they had ""chosen to  file a civil complaint for [monetary] damages as adults,""  they should be required to identify themselves).  Moreover, to the extent Plaintiff's motion is based upon  a fear of retaliation, the risk must not merely be  hypothetical but based upon real evidence. ""A plaintiff  can support his fear by demonstrating the need for  anonymity to prevent retaliation, the reasonableness of  the plaintiff's fear, the severity of the threatened harm,  and the plaintiff's vulnerability."" Doe v. Snyder, No. 12- 11194, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54492, at *5 (E.D. Mich.  Apr. 18, 2012) (quoting Does v. Shalushi, 2010 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 77331, at *3). Plaintiff's motion contains no  information which speaks to any of these factors. Thus, because [*6]  Plaintiff has failed to show that his  anonymity ""substantially outweighs the presumption of  open judicial proceedings,"" IT IS HEREBY ORDERED  that his motion to proceed anonymously (DN 10) is  DENIED. IV. § 1915 SCREENING A. SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS Plaintiff is incarcerated at the Henderson County  Detention Center. Plaintiff initiated this action by filing an  18-page handwritten complaint (DN 1) and a 14-page  handwritten attachment (DN 1-1). He names as  Defendants MG Freesites, LTD, doing business as  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80842, *3 Page 3 of 6 Pornhub.com, and Mindgeek, USA, Inc. He also lists as  Defendants nine individuals as well as ""John Does"" and  ""Jane Does."" Plaintiff writes as follows in the complaint: 18 U.S.C.S. § 1595 FOSTA, Section 1595(a) Claim Defendants 1) Knowingly benefited financially or by  receiving anything of value 2) from participation in a  venture 3) it knew or should have known engaged  in sex trafficking under section 1991. . . . Also several TORT claims: 1. Negligent Infliction of  Emotional Distress 2. Invasion of Privacy 3. Gang  cyber-stalking and cyber-bullying 4. Assault and  Battery 5. Defamation by Slander and Libel 6.  Gross Negligence 7. Negligent Supervision 8.  Negligent Training 9. Civil Conspiracy Pornhub is in violation of the Trafficking Victims  Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) 18 U.S.C. § 1591 and  1595 based on Pornhub [*7]  knew or was in  reckless disregard of the fact that through  monetization  and  providing,  obtaining  and  maintaining sexual abuse material on its platform.  Should have known that it was benefiting and  supporting of facilitating violation of 1591. Pornhub exposed me [] to various diseases, shock,  pain,  and  suffering,  mental  anguish,  embarrassment, humiliation, brain damage, and  defamation. By allowing a group of sexual sadist to  post thousands of videos of my ex-wife (then  current-fiance []), who also might be going by the  alias [] for Pornhub purposes with hundreds of  different sex partners having unprotected sex. They  posted thousands of videos within a short few  weeks, Oct. 25 - Nov. 19. I first saw videos the day  before Halloween '21. This is going to sound like an episode of the  ""Twilight Zone."" My mind and my heart was preyed  upon as soon as I got out of prison Feb 28th 2021. I  was gang cyber-stalked and bullied from May to  November. If I overdosed from the ketamine they  was slipping me or committed suicide as they  planned for Halloween of '21 this would never had  been known. A lot of the videos should be titled to  humiliate me such as ""Quickie before she goes  home to her BF,"" ""F—king [*8]  my best friend wife!""  I believe she is going by [] because I looked her up  on Truthfinder and it showed she has a sister which  she does not. Also came across a KCash account  receipt that I learned to be associated with  Pornhub. I feel Pornhub is responsible for allowing  so many degrading, humiliating, videos directed to  me to posted of [] obviously being trafficked for sex.  And obviously practicing sexual sadism. Hardly any  of the videos show their faces which [should] have  been a red flag. They would allow the same people  to use different videomaker names, they would post  10-11 videos per videomaker. [] suffers from  several mental disorders such as Borderline  Personality Disorder, BiPolar Disorder, ADHD, and  Depression. I believe she is a pedophile and suffers  from sexual sadism. I don't believe she can control  her sexual urges or fantasies and I believe [certain  individual Defendants] took advantage of her  mental illness and drug addiction. Together they  devised a plan to control my mind, humiliate me,  ruin my life, and force me to commit suicide.  Pornhub should have notified authorities after  seeing her have unprotected sex with so many  different people, not showing their faces [*9]  and  she looks unconscious. Plaintiff claims that these allegations also show that  Defendants violated his rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiff then provides explicit details of the videos he  alleges his ex-wife was in on Pornhub and then names  the Defendants he alleges recorded his ex-wife and ""set  up a lot of her sex encounters."" Plaintiff alleges that  these Defendants provided her drugs in exchange for  sex. He continues: Seeing the love of my life get sexually abused in  every way possible with countless amount of dudes  including most of my friends has been devastating.  Has brought me to my knees, was such a blow to  my brain that it caused me to go into a mental  psychosis. The pain and humiliation did cause to  want to end my life and die. Pornhub failed to take adequate steps to prevent its  occurrence. . . . Pornhub allowed obvious sexual  sadism trafficking. . . . They were held to know  obvious sex trafficking was going one based on  different dudes entering and leaving the room,  amount of towels needs, and they paid in cash.  Pornhub allowed these sadistic predators to use  their platform to allow my ex-wife [] to be trafficked  for sex, spread diseases, and raped from what I  seen along ALONG with torturing [*10]  my mind,  my heart, my emotions, and my spirit. Only GOD  has kept me afloat. Pornhub has structured its website to facilitate sex  trafficking . . . . Pornhub requires verification but  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80842, *6 Page 4 of 6 allows the actors to hide their faces, wear masks  (sadism), edit out potential identifying marks. Allow  the same person to use different videomaker  names. And I also believe allow phone identification  and credentials. In Kentucky, every individual has a universal duty of  care that imposes on each person ""a duty to every  other person to exercise ordinary care in his  activities to prevent foreseeable injury."" []. This  group of sex sadists cause Intentional Infliction of  Emotional Distress. []. I was in what I thought was  monogamous relationships with [] and with []. . . .  This is the most sophisticated pure evil case of  cyber-stalking and cyber-bullying, mind control case  ever imaginable. I will provide events that  happened to drive me crazy, plant seeds, things to  humiliate me, and separately, along with titles and  videomakers on Pornhub. On TikTok and in person,  they would tell stories about a cat or they would  make ""meow"" sounds. Subliminal cat references. I  was  completely  lost  for  a  while.  I  would  stumble [*11]  around and felt like my feet had  bricks on them. Just became aware that these are  effects of Ketamine . . . . Plaintiff next alleges that his ex-fiancee and ex-wife  would ""get together and assassinate him on Roblox."" He  also alleges that they ""clowned"" him on TikTok. He  states that ""unknown to him, [] was a prostitute and  apparently heavy into BDSM."" He states that both  women were ""with the police"" including the Evansville  Sheriff's Department and a ""Fed."" He continues: There are tons of instances that she would be  wearing something on Pornhub just so I would  know it was her. They would rarely show her face  but I know it was her by her long black hair, the title,  the name of the videomaker or the outfits should  would be wearing. Also when I would have sex with  them, they would intentionally try to push their  bodily fluids back onto me. Trying to infect me with  their diseases which I still have been checked for. [Both women] had access to my email and every  other app I had. On TikTok I would [see] the most  depressing suicide promoting videos.

I seen [her]  naked body showing on the reflection of [] (my best  friend) T.V. . . . They would steal my phone, record sex acts, post it  to Pornhub, then try to give it back. . . . There is a [illegible] with a video portraying me to  be a child molester, thief, woman beater, amongst  other things. There are a lot of people involved, to  what extent I don't know. It is hard to investigate  from a jail cell, which they also set up. This is just  the tip of the iceberg of the torture I endured for  better than 6 months I was out. . . . . This group of people potentially going by the name  ""Muatang gang"" devised a deviant plan to belittle,  degrade,  humiliate,  frighten,  infect  me  with  diseases, confuse me, destroy my mind, my  confidence, my trust, but their single plan of action  was to force me to commit suicide. I allege that 1) a single plan consisted 2) the  conspirators shared an objective to deprive me of  my constitutional rights 3) an overact was  committed. . . . . I would guess the damages to my brain is  extensive. The Ketamine that was unknowingly  gave to me on top of the trauma.

This whole ordeal consumes my mind. Humiliation,  Defamation, Embarrassment, Shock, Pain and  Suffering. I will never trust another soul. I will  always feel like people are talking out me or being  subliminal. Feel like I have to figure riddles out.  Mental Anguish. Loneliness. Depression. Brain  Damage. The attachment to the complaint continues in the same  vein as the complaint with even more explicit sexual  allegations. Plaintiff then alleges that ""this group devised  a plan to have some sort of mind control over me and  they laid out a plan to destroy me and force me to  commit suicide."" In the amended complaint (DN 8), Plaintiff names a car  insurance company as a Defendant, make additional  explicit sexual allegations, and states that he would like  to add the following ""claims"" to this action — torture,  betrayal,  loathsome  disease,  forced  isolation,  outrageous  conduct,  serious  sexual  misconduct,  psychological distress, attempt forced suicide by shame,  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80842, *10 Page 5 of 6 anxiety, indignity, and trauma. B. LEGAL STANDARD Because Plaintiff is proceeding in forma pauperis, the  Court must review [*14]  this action pursuant to 28  U.S.C. § 1915(e). Upon review under § 1915(e), a  district court must dismiss a case at any time if it  determines that the action is frivolous or malicious, fails  to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or  seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune  from such relief. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B); see also  McGore v. Wrigglesworth, 114 F.3d 601, 608 (6th Cir.  1997), overruled on other grounds by Jones v. Bock,  549 U.S. 199, 127 S. Ct. 910, 166 L. Ed. 2d 798 (2007).  In order to survive dismissal for failure to state a claim,  ""a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,  accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is  plausible on its face.'"" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,  678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.  Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). Although this Court recognizes that pro se pleadings are  to be held to a less stringent standard than formal  pleadings drafted by lawyers, Haines v. Kerner, 404  U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S. Ct. 594, 30 L. Ed. 2d 652  (1972); Jourdan v. Jabe, 951 F.2d 108, 110 (6th Cir.  1991), ""[o]ur duty to be 'less stringent' with pro se  complaints does not require us to conjure up unpled  allegations."" McDonald v. Hall, 610 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir.  1979) (citation omitted). And this Court is not required to  create a claim for Plaintiff. Clark v. Nat'l Travelers Life  Ins. Co., 518 F.2d 1167, 1169 (6th Cir. 1975). To  command otherwise would require the Court ""to explore  exhaustively all potential claims of a pro se plaintiff,  [and] would also transform the district court from its  legitimate advisory role to the improper role of an  advocate seeking out the strongest arguments and most  successful strategies for a party."" Beaudett v. City of  Hampton, 775 F.2d 1274, 1278 (4th Cir. 1985). C. ANALYSIS [*15]  1. Federal Anti-Trafficking Statutes Section 1595 of The Trafficking Victims Protection  Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) ""provides trafficking  victims with a private right of action to pursue claims  against perpetrators of trafficking (""direct liability"") or  those who knowingly benefit financially from trafficking  (""beneficiary liability"")."" Doe v. Mindgeek USA Inc., No.  SACV 21-00338-CJC (ADSx), 558 F. Supp. 3d 828,  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176833, at *12 (C.D. Cal. Sept.  3, 2021) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 1595). The ""Allow States to  Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act"" of 2018 (FOSTA)  exempts certain provisions of the TRVPA from the  immunity  provided  by  Section  230  of  the  Communications Decency Act which ""affords Interactive  Computer Service Providers broad immunity from  liability for content posted [to] their websites by third  parties."" Id. at *10-12 (citing 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)(A)). Upon consideration, the Court concludes that Plaintiff  has no private cause of action under these statutes  because he does not allege that he was a victim of  human trafficking. See Prunty v. Arnold & Itkin LLP, 753  F. App'x 731, 736-37 (11th Cir. 2018) (""Although 18  U.S.C. § 1595 . . . provides a civil remedy for violations  of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, Brown failed to  allege any facts suggesting that the defendants  subjected him to human trafficking, peonage, or the  like.""); Brown v. City of Phila. Off. of Human Res., 735  F. App'x 55, 56 (3d Cir. 2018) (same). Thus, Plaintiff's claims brought under these statutes will  be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which  relief may be granted. 2. 42 U.S.C. § 1983 Section 1983 creates [*16]  no substantive rights but  merely provides remedies for deprivations of rights  established elsewhere. Flint ex rel. Flint v. Ky. Dep't of  Corr., 270 F.3d 340, 351 (6th Cir. 2001). Two elements  are required to state a claim under § 1983. Gomez v.  Toledo, 446 U.S. 635, 640, 100 S. Ct. 1920, 64 L. Ed.  2d 572 (1980). ""A plaintiff must allege the violation of a  right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United  States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was  committed by a person acting under color of state law.""  West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S. Ct. 2250, 101 L.  Ed. 2d 40 (1988). ""Absent either element, a section  1983 claim will not lie."" Christy v. Randlett, 932 F.2d  502, 504 (6th Cir. 1991). Plaintiff's § 1983 claims must be dismissed for failure to  state a claim upon which relief may be granted because  he has not alleged that any constitutional violation was  committed by a person acting under color of state law. 3. State-Law Claims 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80842, *13 Page 6 of 6 As to Plaintiff's remaining state-law claims, the Court  concludes that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over  them because there is not complete diversity of  citizenship since it is evident from the complaint that  Plaintiff and at least some of the Defendants are citizens  of Kentucky. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332. Further, the Court  declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over  Plaintiff's state-law claims. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).  Thus, Plaintiff's state-law claims will be dismissed  without prejudice.",1
"Vidal v. Galaxy 2439 Enters., LLC, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217264","MEMORANDUM OPINION SHIPP, District Judge This matter comes before the Court upon the Motion to  Dismiss Plaintiff Leslie Vidal's (""Plaintiff"") Complaint  (ECF No. 1), jointly filed by Defendants Galaxy 2439  Enterprises, LLC (""Galaxy"") and Genesis Biotechnology  Group,  LLC  (""Genesis"")  (hereinafter  collectively  ""Defendants""). (ECF No. 5). Plaintiff opposed the Motion  (ECF No. 8), and Defendants replied (ECF No. 9). The  Court has considered the parties' written submissions  and decides the Motion without oral argument, pursuant  to Local Civil Rule 78.1. For the reasons set forth below,  Counts One, Three, and Four against Genesis are  dismissed  with  prejudice;  Count  Two  against  Defendants is dismissed with prejudice; and Counts  One, Three, and Four against Galaxy are dismissed  without prejudice. I. BACKGROUND A. Statement of Facts On or about February 22, 2021, Defendants hired  Plaintiff [*2]   as  a  part-time  Human  Resources  Consultant to assist ""Defendants in its [sic] review of  current Human Resources practices, and assist with  Defendants' launch of its [sic] new professional  employer organization division, Professional Core  Solutions."" (Compl. ¶¶ 9-10, ECF No. 1.) Around May  2021, Defendants promoted Plaintiff to a full-time  ""Human Resources & Business Development Manager.""  (Id. ¶¶ 12-13 .) Plaintiff alleges that, throughout her employment, she  ""continuously  raised  concerns,  objections,  and  complaints to her supervisors regarding . . . Defendants'  unlawful, discriminatory employment practices."" (Id. ¶       Page 2 of 11 14.) Plaintiff asserts that she raised, disclosed, and  reported the following concerns to employees in  Defendants' Human Resources Department: (1) failure  to follow standardized hiring procedures; (2) improper  payment of hourly employees; and (3) inconsistencies  in employee discipline and performance processes,  such as that ""female employees and employees in  racially protected classes were severely disciplined for  infractions  or  performance  concerns  and  white  employees were not severely disciplined, if at all."" (Id.  ¶¶ 15, 18, 20.) Despite such reports, Plaintiff states  that [*3]  Defendants did not take any action to address  the improper behavior. (Id. ¶¶ 16-17, 19, 20-21.) On or about June 28, 2021, Defendants had a job fair to  recruit employees for various positions; Plaintiff, as the  Human  Resources  and  Business  Development  Manager, ""was tasked with . . . attempting to match  each candidate with an open position."" (Id. ¶¶ 23-24.)  Based on an executive's (the ""Executive"") request ""that  Plaintiff direct all candidates [with hospitality experience]  to her job station first,"" Plaintiff ""directed [to the  Executive] a Black male job fair attendee . . . who  indicated that he had experience in the hospitality  industry."" (Id. ¶¶ 25-26.) Plaintiff [*4]  asserts that as  she approached the Executive with the Black job fair  attendee, the Executive ""began to make a shooing  gesture toward Plaintiff stating kilo, I am not going to  interview him,' or words to that effect."" (Id. ¶ 27.) Plaintiff  states that she informed several employees about the  Executive's conduct, which ""she believed . . . constituted  discrimination."" (Id. ¶ 28.) In turn, Plaintiff alleges that a                                       Human Resources Generalist ""informed Plaintiff that  [the Executive] had exhibited racially discriminatory  behavior in the past."" (Id. ¶ 29.) The next day, Plaintiff had a phone call with Defendants'  Human Resources team wherein the team members  discussed how they were ""pleased with the outcome of  the job fair and had deemed it a success."" (Id. ¶ 30.)  Later that day, Plaintiff alleges that the Black job fair  attendee called and stated that ""he believed that [the  Executive] refused to interview him . . . because he is  Black.""  (Id.  ¶¶  31-32.)  Plaintiff  then  informed  Defendants' Senior Human Resources Manager and  Human  Resources  Director  of  the  Executive's  supposedly discriminatory conduct at the job fair and the  job fair attendee's complaint. (Id. ¶ 33.) Plaintiff alleges  that the [*5]  Senior Human Resources Manager  responded that the Executive ""previously exhibited  discriminatory behavior in Defendants' workplace,"" and  ""that [the Executive] is not an 'FIR expert.'"" (Id. ¶ 34.)  Plaintiff further states that the Senior Human Resources  Manager  ""refused  to  commit  to  conducting  an  investigation,"" because ""the matter 'was quite sensitive'  due to [the Executive's] position within the company,  and her romantic relationship with [the CEO]."" (Id. ¶  36.) On June 30, 2021, Defendants' Human Resources  Director and Chief Legal Officer held a meeting with  Plaintiff. (Id. ¶ 38.) Plaintiff states that she reiterated the  alleged discriminatory conduct she observed, including  the Executive's conduct at the job fair and Defendants'  hiring, payroll, and disciplinary practices. (Id. at ¶¶ 39- 40.) Plaintiff alleges the Human Resources Director and  Chief Legal Officer ""instructed [her] to keep the  substance  of  her  complaints  and  the  meeting  confidential."" (Id. ¶¶ 39-41.) Plaintiff asserts that, at the  end of that same day, Defendants terminated her ""for  'poor performance,' for 'not meeting goals set for the job  fair,' and finally because the discrimination concerns  raised by Plaintiff [*6]  were investigated and 'did not  line up.'"" (Id. ¶ 42.) Plaintiff states that she had ""not  been told previously that there were any issues with her  job performance."" (Id. ¶ 43.) B. Procedural History     Page 3 of 11 This is not the first time Plaintiff has litigated the  circumstances leading to her termination. On June 24,  2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint in New Jersey Superior  Court against Defendants, along with their CEO, Human  Resources Director, and Senior Human Resources  Manager. (See generally N.J. Super. Ct. Compl., ECF  No. 5-2., Ex. B.) The state complaint pled essentially the  same facts as Plaintiff pleads in this case Plaintiff  claimed that she was terminated after complaining to  Defendants' Human Resources Department about  supposed unlawful practices in hiring, payroll, and  discipline, as well as at the job fair incident. (Compare  Compl. ¶¶ 9-46 with N.J. Super. Ct. Compl. ¶¶ 21-32.)  Plaintiff asserted three counts in her state court  complaint: (1) retaliation under the Conscientious  Employee Protection Act (""CEPA""); (2) retaliation under  the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (""NJLAD"");  and (3) associational discrimination and wrongful  discharge under the NJLAD. (See generally N.J. Super.  Ct. Compl.) On October 27, 2022, the state [*7]  court entered a  consent order dismissing with prejudice Count Three of  Plaintiffs complaint. (Oct. 27, 2022 N.J. Super. Ct.  Consent Order, ECF No. 5-2, Ex. C.) The state court  also dismissed with prejudice Plaintiffs complaint in its  entirety as to Genesis, its CEO, and its Senior Human  Resources Manager. (Id.) The state court reserved  decision on whether Plaintiff stated a claim for retaliation  under CEPA or the NJLAD against Galaxy and its  Human Resources Director. (Id. at 46.) On December 12, 2022, the state court dismissed  Counts One and Two of Plaintiff's state law complaint  against Galaxy and its Human Resources Director  without prejudice. (Dec. 12, 2022 N.J. Super. Ct. Order,  ECF No. 5-2, Ex. C.) The court found Plaintiff's CEPA  claim failed because ""[her] references to unspecified  employment practices [were] insufficient to support the  assertion that [she] had a reasonable belief that any law  was being violated."" (Id. at 49.) The state court found  Plaintiff's NJLAD claim also failed because ""[her]  allegations  [were]  not  enough  to  support  [her]  conclusion that the executive refused to interview the  [j]ob [f]air [a]ttendee because he was Black."" (Id. at 50.) On April 4, 2023, Plaintiff [*8]  filed a complaint in this  Court. (ECF No. 1.) Defendants moved to dismiss  Plaintiff's complaint for failure to state a claim upon  which relief may be granted, pursuant to Federal Rule of  Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (ECF No. 5.) Plaintiff opposed   (ECF No. 8), and Defendants replied (ECF No. 9). II. LEGAL STANDARD A district court conducts a three-part analysis when  considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).  Malleus v. George, 641 F.3d 560, 563 (3d Cir. 2011).  First, the court must identify ""the elements a plaintiff  must plead to state a claim."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.  662, 675, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009).  Second, the court must identify and accept as true, all of  the plaintiff's well-pleaded factual allegations and  ""construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the  plaintiff."" Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210  (3d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). The court can discard  bare  legal  conclusions  or  factually  unsupported  accusations that merely state the defendant unlawfully  harmed the plaintiff. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citing  Twombly v. Bell Atl. Corp., 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.  Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). Third, the court  must determine whether ""the [well-pleaded] facts  alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show that the  plaintiff has a 'plausible claim for relief.' Fowler, 578  F.3d at 211 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679). A facially  plausible claim ""allows the court to draw the reasonable  inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct  alleged."" Id. at 210 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678). On  a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the ""defendant bears the burden  of showing [*9]  that no claim has been presented.""  Hedges v. United States, 404 F.3d 744, 750 (3d Cir.  2005) (citing Kehr Packages, Inc. v. Fidelcor, Inc., 926  F.2d 1406, 1409 (3d Cir. 1991)). III. DISCUSSION Plaintiff asserts four Counts against Defendants: (1)  retaliation under 42 U.S.C. § 1981; (2) violation of  CEPA; (3) wrongful termination in violation of New  Jersey public policy pursuant to Pierce v. Ortho  Pharmaceutical Corp., 84 N.J. 58, 417 A.2d 505 (1980);  and (4) violation of the NJLAD. (See Compl. ¶¶ 47-79.)  Each claim stems from Plaintiff's allegation that  Defendants fired her because she ""made complaints  about unlawful human resources practices and racial  discrimination in the workplace."" (See Compl. ¶¶ 48, 60,  66, 72.) A. Claim Preclusion  Page 4 of 11 i. Claims Against Genesis The Court first addresses the question of whether the  previous dismissal of Plaintiff's claims in state court has  preclusive effect in this proceeding. See Giordano v.  Saxon Mortg. Servs. Inc., No. 12-7937, 2013 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 202677, 2013 WL 12158378, at *5 (D.N.J. Oct.  31, 2013) (""Judicial estoppel is a fact-specific, equitable  doctrine, applied at courts' discretion."" (citing New  Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749, 121 S. Ct.  1808, 149 L. Ed. 2d 968 (2001)). Pursuant to the Full  Faith and Credit Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1738, federal courts  must ""give preclusive effect to state-court judgments  whenever the courts of the State from which the  judgments emerged would do so."" Allen v. McCurry, 449  U.S. 90, 96, 101 S. Ct. 411, 66 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1980)  (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1738); see also Adelphia Gateway,  LLC v. Pa. Env't Hearing Bd., 62 F.4th 819, 825 (3d Cir.  2023). Federal courts must ""look to the law of the  adjudicating state"" to determine whether a prior state  court judgment has preclusive effect. Greenleaf v.  Garlock, Inc., 174 F.3d 352, 357 (3d Cir. 1999). In New  Jersey,  the  claim  preclusion  doctrine  gives  preclusive [*10]  effect ""to a prior judgment if a particular  issue, although not litigated, could have been raised in  the earlier proceeding."" Bd. of Trs. of Trucking Emps. of  N. Jersey Welfare Fund, Inc. v. Centra, 983 F.2d 495,  504 (3d Cir. 1992). In other words, claim preclusion bars  consideration of any claims a plaintiff actually brought or  ""could have asserted in the previous lawsuit."" Beasley v.  Howard, 14 F.4th 226, 231-32 (3d Cir. 2021). Claim preclusion requires: ""(1) a final judgment on the  merits in a prior suit involving (2) the same parties or  their privies and (3) a subsequent suit based on the  same causes of action."" United States v. Athlone Indus.,  Inc., 746 F.2d 977, 983 (3d Cir. 1984); Pittman v. La  Fontaine, 756 F. Supp. 834, 841 (D.N.J. 1991) (""To  invoke preclusion, it is required that the subsequent  action must involve substantially similar or identical  causes of action, issues, parties and relief as were  involved in the prior action.""). First, here, there was a final judgment on the merits in  which the state court dismissed all claims against  Genesis with prejudice. (N.J. Super. Ct. Consent Order  45-46.) See Dowdell v. Univ. of Med. & Dentistry, 94 F.  Supp. 2d 527, 533 (D.N.J. 2000) (finding that under  New Jersey law, ""dismissal with prejudice 'constitutes  an adjudication on the merits as fully and completely as  if the order had been entered after a trial.""' (quoting  Feinsod v. Noon, 261 N.J. Super. 82, 617 A.2d 1234,  1235 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1992))). Second,  Genesis was a defendant in the state suit and is also a  defendant in the instant action. Id. at 536 n.10 (finding  the second factor satisfied when ""[Noth parties in the  present [*11]  action were engaged in the state suit."").  Third, Plaintiff's current suit against Genesis is based on  the same causes of action as her previous state action.  To find two causes of action the same, a court must  analyze: (1) whether the wrong for which redress is sought is  the same in both actions (that is, whether the acts  complained of and the demand for relief are the  same)[;] (2) whether the theory of recovery is the  same[;] (3) whether the witnesses and documents  necessary at trial are the same[;] and (4) whether  the material facts alleged are the same. Pittman, 756 F. Supp. at 841 (citing Culver v. Ins. Co. of  N. Am., 115 N.J. 451, 559 A.2d 400, 405 (N.J. 1989)).  Plaintiff's Complaint in this action and her complaint in  the state action both assert claims under the theory that  Plaintiff  was  wrongfully  terminated  based  on  Defendants' retaliation, and both complaints seek relief  through damages. See Dowdell, 94 F. Supp. 2d at 540  (finding that the wrong for which redress is sought is the  same in federal court as it was in state court when  ""termination and its surrounding events served as the  basis for both [plaintiff's] state and federal complaints"").  Plaintiff pleads the same material facts as she did in her  dismissed state action, which would require the  assessment of the same evidence and possible  witnesses. [*12]  The Court, accordingly, finds that  claims under CEPA and the NJLAD against Genesis,  which were brought in state court, must be dismissed.                   Page 5 of 11 See id. (precluding plaintiff's claim because the plaintiff  ""raise[d] claims predicated on events indistinguishable  from those raised in his state complaint.""). Further, Plaintiff had the opportunity to plead her § 1981  and Pierce claims against Genesis in New Jersey state  court, which had jurisdiction to hear all of Plaintiff's  claims brought in this federal action, but failed to do so.  See Marina Bay Towers Urb. Renewal II, L.P. v. City of  N. Wildwood, No. 09-369, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60147,  2009 WL 2147356, at *3 (D.N.J. July 14, 2009) (""[C]ivil  rights claims based on federal law can be brought and  heard in state court."" (citing Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S.  455, 458-59, 110 S. Ct. 792, 107 L. Ed. 2d 887 (1990))).  Claim preclusion thus bars Plaintiff's remaining claims  as to Genesis. See In re Dex Media, Inc., 595 B.R. 19,  33 (D. Del. 2018) (""Claim preclusion 'bars not only  claims that were brought in the previous action, but also  claims that could have been brought.' (quoting  Elkadrawy v. Vanguard Grp., Inc., 584 F.3d 169, 173  (3d Cir. 2009))); Dowdell, 94 F. Supp. 2d at 540 (""The  mere fact that [plaintiff] predicates his instant claims on  Title VII, rather than the NJLAD, does not bar preclusion  of these claims.""); Davis v. U.S. Steel Supply, 688 F.2d  166, 175 (3d Cir. 1982) (precluding plaintiff's § 1981  claim because a nearly identical claim was brought in  state  court  pursuant  to  a  municipal [*13]   antidiscrimination  ordinance  and  dismissed  with  prejudice). Finally, finding that the claims against Genesis are  precluded does not violate any due process concerns.  See Pittman, 756 F. Supp. at 845 (""[E]ven where . . . a  prior decision meets a state's requirements for claim  preclusion, the prior decision will not be given preclusive  effect if due process was not provided by the state  forum in which the claim was previously litigated."");  Kremer v. Chem. Constr. Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 482, 102  S. Ct. 1883, 72 L. Ed. 2d 262 (1982) (finding that the  state must satisfy applicable requirements of the Due  Process Clause, and that ""other state and federal courts  are not required to accord full faith and credit"" if the  state judgment is ""constitutionally infirm""). Based on the  record, the Court cannot find any due process violations  or concerns arising out of the state action. (See  generally Oct. 27, 2022 N.J. Super. Ct. Consent Order;        Dec. 12, 2022 N.J. Super. Ct. Order.) Moreover, Plaintiff  has not alleged that she did not have a full and fair  opportunity to litigate in state court. See Peduto v. City  of N. Wildwood, 878 F.2d 725, 726 (3d Cir. 1989)  (finding that appellants were not denied due process of  law in state court because they were afforded ""a full and  fair  opportunity""  and  appellants  never  alleged  otherwise). Nor did Plaintiff object to the state court  dismissing all claims against Genesis with prejudice—in  fact, she consented to that dismissal. (Oct. 27, [*14]   2022 N.J. Super. Ct. Consent Order 2.) See Nanavati v.  Burdette Tomlin Mem? Hosp., 857 F.2d 96, 111 (3d Cir.  1988) (finding no due process violation where plaintiff  did not object to dismissal of complaint, file an appeal,  or move to reconsider). The Court therefore dismisses Plaintiff's Complaint with  prejudice in its entirety as to Genesis under the claim  preclusion doctrine. ii. Claims Against Galaxy Claim preclusion does not bar Plaintiffs claims against  Galaxy because the state court dismissed Plaintiffs  claims against Galaxy without prejudice. (Dec. 12, 2022  N.J. Super. Ct. Order.) Dismissal without prejudice ""is  neither final nor appealable because the deficiency may  be corrected by the plaintiff without affecting the cause  of action."" Borelli v. Reading, 532 F.2d 950, 951 (3d Cir.  1976). The Court, accordingly, addresses each Count  remaining against Galaxy. B. CEPA Claim Against Galaxy Plaintiff asserts that she was wrongfully terminated by  Defendants for engaging in a protected activity. (Compl.                Page 6 of 11 ¶¶ 55-64.) Plaintiff alleges Defendants' retaliation and  adverse treatment of Plaintiff are in violation of CEPA.  (See id.) Defendants counter that Plaintiff's CEPA claim  is barred by the statute of limitations. (Defs.' Moving Br.,  14-18, ECF No. 5-1; Defs.' Reply Br. 1-13, ECF No. 9.) i. Statute of Limitations [*15]  Although a motion to dismiss is generally not the proper  vehicle for asserting a time bar, the Third Circuit permits  a defendant to assert a statute of limitations defense via  a motion to dismiss if ""the time alleged in the statement  of a claim shows that the cause of action has not been  brought within the statute of limitations."" Viney v.  Jenkintown Sch. Dist., 51 F. Supp. 3d 553, 555 (E.D.  Pa. 2014) (quoting Robinson v. Johnson, 313 F.3d 128,  135 (3d Cir. 2002)); Oshiver v. Levin, Fishbein, Sedran  & Berman, 38 F.3d 1380, 1384 n.1 (3d Cir. 1994)  (finding that an exception exists ""where the complaint  facially shows noncompliance with the limitations period  and the affirmative defense clearly appears on the face  of the pleading.""). Defendants assert that that is the  case here, and Plaintiff does not allege that the dates  set out in the Complaint are insufficient to examine the  timeliness of her claims; instead, Plaintiff relies upon the  equitable tolling doctrine to assert that her CEPA claim  should not be dismissed. (Defs.' Moving Br. 17-18; Pl.'s  Opp'n Br. 16, ECF No. 8-1.) Plaintiff alleges in her Complaint that Defendants  discharged her on June 30, 2021. (Compl. ¶ 42.) The  parties do not dispute that the statute of limitations for a  CEPA claim is one year. N.J.S.A. 34:19-5. (See Pl.'s  Opp'n Br. 13-16; Defs.' Moving Br. 17-18.) When an  employer wrongfully terminates an employee, the  statute of limitations [*16]  begins to run on the date of  actual discharge. See Farneski v. County of Hunterdon,  916 F. Supp. 2d 573, 588 (D.N.J. 2013) (citing Alderiso  v. Med. Ctr. of Ocean Cnty., Inc., 167 N.J. 191, 770  A.2d 275 (N.J. 2001)); Jones v. Jersey City Med Ctr., 20  F. Supp. 2d 770, 773 (D.N.J. 1998) (dismissing a CEPA  claim brought two years after discharge). The one-year  statute of limitations for Plaintiffs CEPA claim is thus  June 30, 2022. See N.J.S.A. 34:19-5. Plaintiff timely  filed a CEPA claim in New Jersey Superior Court on  June 24, 2022, which the court dismissed without  prejudice against Galaxy on December 12, 2022. (See  N.J. Super. Ct. Compl.; Dec. 12, 2022 N.J. Super. Ct.  Order.) On April 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed her Complaint in  this Court, well after CEPA's one year statute of  limitations expired. (See Compl.) The Court, therefore,  can conclusively determine that the applicable one-year  statute of limitations bars Plaintiffs claim and finds  Defendants' statute of limitations defense at the motion  to dismiss stage to be proper. Plaintiffs CEPA claim is  thus barred unless the equitable tolling doctrine applies. ii. Equitable Tolling Equitable tolling allows a plaintiff to bring suit ""after the  statutory time period for filing a complaint has expired if  [the plaintiff has] been prevented from filing in a timely  manner due to sufficiently inequitable circumstances.""  Seitzinger v. Reading Hosp. & Med. Ctr., 165 F.3d 236,  240 (3d Cir. 1999) (emphasis added). These inequitable  circumstances are ""narrowly [*17]  defined."" Fahey v.  Hollywood Bicycle Ctr., Inc., No. 08-3573, 2009 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 22179, 2009 WL 749856, at *4 (D.N.J. Mar.  18, 2009) (quoting R.A.C. v. P.J.S., Jr., 192 N.J. 81, 927  A.2d 97, 107 (N.J. 2007)). Specifically, the Third Circuit  has held that ""equitable tolling may be appropriate[:] . . .  (1) [if] the defendant has actively misled the plaintiff[;]  (2) if the plaintiff has 'in some extraordinary way' been  prevented from asserting [her] rights[;] or (3) if the  plaintiff has timely asserted [her] rights mistakenly in the  wrong forum."" United States v. Midgley, 142 F.3d 174,  179 (3d Cir. 1998) (quoting Kocian v. Getty Refin. &  Mktg. Co., 707 F.2d 748, 753 (3d Cir. 1983)). Plaintiff invokes the doctrine of equitable tolling to  prevent her CEPA claim from being dismissed as time  barred. (Pl.'s Opp'n Br. 13-16.) Plaintiff states that her  claims  in  state  court  were  ""dismissed  on  procedural/pleading grounds,"" but were filed in this  Court with additional federal civil rights claims. (Pl.'s  Opp'n Br. 16.) Plaintiff does not assert that she was  actively misled by Defendants, was prevented from  asserting her rights in an extraordinary way, or timely  asserted her rights in the wrong forum. Instead, Plaintiff  argues equitable tolling should apply because she  timely filed her CEPA claim in state court without  ""sle[eping] on her rights."" (Id.) Plaintiff fails to allege a valid basis for equitable tolling  on her CEPA claim. As noted, Plaintiff has not alleged  any  inequitable  circumstances  or  improper [*18]   conduct by Defendants in the state action or the instant  case. See Midgley, 142 F.3d at 179 (""Absent a showing  of intentional inducement or trickery by the defendant, a  statute of limitations should be tolled only in the 'rare  situation where equitable tolling is demanded by sound  legal principles as well as the interests of justice.'""  (quoting Alvarez-Machain v. United States, 96 F.3d  1246, 1251 (9th Cir. 1996))). The state court dismissed  Page 7 of 11 Plaintiff's CEPA claim for failure to state a claim, not for  any technical errors involving jurisdiction or venue. See  Schmidt v. Celgene Corp., 425 N.J. Super. 600, 42 A.3d  892, 900 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2012) (finding that  ""the primary purpose of these equitable doctrines  avoiding a technical defeat of a meritorious claim on  which the doors of the courthouse have been shut—was  not implicated"" because plaintiff's initial CEPA claim was  dismissed on the merits rather than on jurisdictional  grounds); but see Galligan v. Westfield Ctr. Serv., Inc.,  82 N.J. 188, 412 A.2d 122 (N.J. 1980) (granting  equitable tolling to plaintiff's claim that was misfiled and  dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in  federal court). It was Plaintiff who chose to commence  litigation in state court only six days before CEPA's  statute of limitations ran. See Gonzalez v. Portfolio  Recovery Assocs., LLC, No. 13-1350, 2013 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 135909, 2013 WL 5334075, at *3 (D.N.J. Sept.  20, 2013) (declining to apply equitable tolling because  ""[plaintiff] chose to file his first complaint just two months  before the statute of limitations ran . . . . That [*19]  the  statute of limitations ran while the state-court motion to  dismiss was pending cannot be blamed on [d]efendant;  [d]efendant did nothing to mislead [p]laintiff or prevent  [p]laintiff from exercising his rights.""). Plaintiffs mere  assertion that Defendants received timely notice of the  potential claim is insufficient to overcome the hurdles for  equitable tolling to apply. See Midgley, 142 F.3d at 179  (""Federal courts invoke the doctrine of equitable tolling  'only  sparingly.'  (citations  omitted)).  The  Court,  accordingly, dismisses Plaintiffs CEPA claim against  Galaxy with prejudice. C. 42 U.S.C. § 1981 Claim Against Galaxy                   Count One of Plaintiffs Complaint asserts a retaliation  claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 based on her termination  after she raised complaints regarding ""unlawful human  resources practices and racial discrimination in the  workplace."" (Compl. ¶ 48.) Specifically, Plaintiff alleges  she engaged in protected conduct when she made  separate complaints to Defendants regarding their: (1)  engagement in disparate disciplinary treatment towards  women and minority employees; and (2) discriminatory  refusal to hire a Black job applicant. (See id. ¶¶ 47-54;  Pl.'s Opp'n Br. 9-10.) ""The Supreme Court has established that § 1981  protects [*20]  individuals against retaliation."" Curry v.  Devereux Found., 541 F. Supp. 3d 555, 559 (E.D. Pa.  2021) (citing CBOCS, 553 U.S. at 451). 42 U.S.C. §  1981 further prohibits retaliation against individuals who  help others ""suffering direct racial discrimination.""  CBOCS, 553 U.S. at 452. To maintain a prima facie § 1981 retaliation claim,  Plaintiff must adequately allege that: (1) she engaged in  a protected activity; (2) she suffered an adverse  employment action by Defendants, her employer; and  (3) a causal connection exists between the protected  activity and the adverse employment action. See Est. of  Oliva ex rel. McHugh v. New Jersey, 604 F.3d 788, 798  (3d Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). The Third Circuit then  utilizes a burden-shifting framework: if the plaintiff  succeeds in establishing a prima facie case, the burden  shifts to the defendant ""to articulate some legitimate,  nondiscriminatory [or nonretaliatory] reason for the  employee's rejection[;]"" if the defendant successfully  carries this burden, the plaintiff then must have an  opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the  evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the  defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext  for retaliation. See Jarmon v. Trader Joe 's Co., No. 21- 3889, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38448, 2023 WL 2402874,  at *3 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 8, 2023) (first alteration in original)  (quoting Shaner v. Synthes, 204 F.3d 494, 500-01 (3d  Cir. 2000)); see also Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534  U.S. 506, 511, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002)  (finding  that  the  McDonnell  Douglas  evidentiary           Page 8 of 11 standard does not apply if a plaintiff is able to produce  direct evidence of employment [*21]  discrimination)  (citing Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U.S.  111, 121, 105 S. Ct. 613, 83 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1985)). Importantly, ""[t]he Supreme Court has held that in  employment discrimination cases, a plaintiff is not  required to establish a prima Ade case at the pleadings  stage."" Kelly v. HD Supply Holdings, Inc., No. 14-372,  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154711, 2014 WL 5512251, at *3  (D.N.J. Oct. 31, 2014). ""Instead, plaintiff's claim must be  facially plausible and give fair notice to the defendants  of the basis of the claim."" Id. at 4 (citing Huggard v.  Crown Bank, No. 11-6194, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  20501, 2012 WL 529548, at *4 (D.N.J. Feb.17, 2012)).  ""[S]tating . . a claim requires a complaint with enough  factual matter (taken as true) to suggest the required  element . . . The complaint must state enough facts to  raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal  evidence of the necessary element."" Id. (quoting  Wilkerson v. New Media Tech. Charter Sch. Inc., 522  F.3d 315, 321-22 (3d Cir. 2008) (emphasis in original)). ""In a retaliation case[,] a plaintiff must demonstrate that  there had been an underlying § 1981 violation.""  Castleberry v. STI Grp., 863 F.3d 259, 267 (3d Cir.  2017) (quoting Est. of Oliva, 604 F.3d at 798) (noting  that a plaintiff must have ""acted under a good faith,  reasonable belief that [an underlying § 1981] violation  existed."" (quoting Daniels v. Sch. Dist. of Phila., 776  F.3d 181, 193 (3d Cir. 2015))). The Court, therefore,  first considers whether Plaintiff adequately alleges that  there is an underlying § 1981 violation. See id. For the  two events at issue, Plaintiff appears to allege that §  1981's guarantee that all persons are entitled to the  same ""full and equal benefit"" of the law was violated  because Galaxy, an employer, [*22]  discriminated and  disparately treated employees and a job applicant  differently based on race and/or sex. (See Compl. ¶ 21.)  See also 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a); Est. of Oliva, 604 F.3d at  798. i. Disparate Treatment         Plaintiff alleges that ""while reviewing Defendants'  Human  Resources  practices,  [she]  identified  inconsistencies  in  the  employee  discipline  and  performance processes; specifically, Plaintiff's review  identified that female employees and employees in  racially protected classes were severely disciplined for  infractions  or  performance  concerns  and  white  employees were not severely disciplined, if at all.""  (Compl. ¶ 20.) Plaintiff states that she ""reasonably  believed that Defendants' practices of disparate  treatment towards employees based [on] sex and/or  race were unlawful"" and reported them to Defendants'  Human Resources Department. (Id. ¶¶ 21, 22).  Defendants argue that Plaintiff ""fails to plead any facts  supporting the reasonableness of [the] allegation,  including who these employees were, what positions  they held, what they were disciplined for, and how  exactly they were treated disparately."" (Defs.' Moving  Br. 11-12; see also Defs.' Reply 1 3-14.) As previously set forth, ""a plaintiff establishes a [§ 1981]  retaliation claim if she [*23]  shows that she had a  reasonable belief that her employer was engaged in an  unlawful employment practice and that the employer  retaliated against her for protesting against that  practice."" Curry, 541 F. Supp. 3d at 560 (quoting  Drinkwater v. Union Carbide Corp., 904 F.2d 853, 865  (3d Cir. 1990)). Yet, a ""§ 1981 cause of action in the  employment  context  which  is  based  on  racial  discrimination must set forth facts to establish that the  allegedly disparate treatment was the result of  'intentional' or 'purposeful' discrimination."" Hicks v.  Arthur, 843 F. Supp. 949, 954 (E.D. Pa. 1994) (quoting  Weldon v. Kraft, 896 F.2d 793, 796 (3d Cir. 1990)); see  also Brown v. Joel Tanis & Sons, Inc., No. 13-02984,  2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95149, 2016 WL 3951378, at *4  (D.N.J. July 21, 2016). ""A § 1981 plaintiff cannot satisfy  the 'purposeful' criterion with 'vague and conclusory  allegations' in the complaint."" Id. (citing Armstrong v.  Sch. Dist. of Phila., 597 F. Supp. 1309, 1312 (E.D. Pa.  1984). With Plaintiff's allegations accepted as true, this Court  finds that Plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts to survive  the motion to dismiss. Plaintiff fails to provide any facts  from her review of Defendants' Human Resources  practices  that  suggest  intentional  or  purposeful  discrimination. For example, despite stating that she  ""identified"" such concerns through her review, Plaintiff  fails to list any inconsistencies in the employee  discipline and performance process, the number of  employees who were treated disparately, or what  infractions or performance concerns were addressed  Page 9 of 11 with the disparately treated employees. [*24]  See Lara,  2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 158267, 2020 WL 5211206, at *9  (denying a motion to dismiss in part because the plaintiff  cited specific interactions and comments made by  defendants, which suggested a plausible claim for  disparate treatment based on race-based discrimination  and retaliation); Warrick v. N.J. Off. of Att'y Gen., No.  20-14274, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96999, 2022 WL  1763855, at *5 (D.N.J. May 31, 2022) (finding that the  plaintiff pled sufficient facts for a disparate treatment  claim  because  the  amended  complaint  alleged  ""numerous examples of, for instance, [d]efendants  promoting white colleagues within four years and  promoting African American employees within twenty- one years""). Here, Plaintiff's pleadings amount only to  vague and conclusory allegations that fail to raise a  reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal  evidence of a necessary element. ii. The Executive's Conduct Plaintiff next alleges that the Executive's refusal to  interview  a  job  applicant  constitutes  illegal  discriminatory conduct because Plaintiff reasonably  believes the Executive based her decision on racial  discrimination. (Compl. ¶¶ 25-35.) Defendants again  state that Plaintiff ""fails to plead sufficient facts to  establish an underlying violation."" (Defs.' Moving Br. 13;  see also Defs.' Reply Br. 14.) To establish a discrimination claim under § 1981, ""a  plaintiff must show (1) [*25]  that he [or she] belongs to  a racial minority; (2) an intent to discriminate on the  basis of race by the defendant; and (3) discrimination  concerning one or more of the activities enumerated in §  1981."" Castleberry, 863 F.3d at 266 (citing Est. of Oliva,  604 F.3d at 797). The Court, accepting all reasonable inferences as true,  does not identify any factual support to suggest or  satisfy the second prong—that the Executive refused to  interview the job applicant because he was Black. (See  Compl. ¶¶ 25-34.) Plaintiff relies only upon her and the  job applicant's belief that the Executive declined to  interview the Black job applicant because of his race.  (Id. ¶ 28.) Without more factual detail, Plaintiff fails to  adequately allege an underlying § 1981 violation.      ""[S]uch allegations are conclusory since [Plaintiff] fails to  allege facts to show that [the Executive's] actions were  somehow connected to any protected category, let  alone [to the job applicant's] race."" Mudie v. Phila. Coll.  of Osteopathic Med., 577 F. Supp. 3d 375, 381 (E.D.  Pa. 2021) (finding that plaintiff's allegations that are  ""race-related are bald legal conclusions and lack factual  support"" because ""[plaintiff] fail[ed] to provide facts to  show that [d]efendants' actions were related to her race,  as opposed to some other reason or due to a  personality conflict); Curry, 541 F. Supp. 3d at 562  (finding [*26]  that an employee's direct comments such  as ""angry Black woman"" was enough to allow  discovery); Savage v. Temple Univ. - of Commonwealth  Sys. of Higher Educ., No. 19-6026, 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 111715, 2020 WL 3469039, at *6 (E.D. Pa. June  25, 2020) (finding that plaintiff made ""legal conclusions,  not factual allegations,"" which are not ""consider[ed] . . .  in deciding a motion to dismiss[,]"" because plaintiff ""pled  that he was terminated and discriminated against]  because of his race.""); Doe v. Triangle Doughnuts, LLC,  472 F. Supp. 3d 115, 137 (E.D. Pa. 2020) (finding that  plaintiff's allegations failed to state enough facts to raise  a reasonable expectation that discovery would reveal  evidence of discriminatory intent, despite plaintiff's  allegation that a racial comment was made at her). The Court finds that Plaintiff fails to state a claim for  retaliation because she has not adequately alleged that  there was an underlying § 1981 violation of sex and/or  race discrimination, even under the more deferential  pleading standard applicable to discrimination claims.  See Castleberry, 863 F.3d at 267; Triangle Doughnuts,  472 F. Supp. 3d at 136. The Court, accordingly,  dismisses Plaintiffs § 1981 claim against Galaxy without  prejudice. D. NJLAD Claim Against Galaxy              Page 10 of 11 Under Count Four, Plaintiff asserts that ""Defendants'  decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment is a  retaliatory action and constitutes a violation of the  [NJLAD]."" (Compl. ¶ 76.) In short, Plaintiff alleges a  claim [*27]  of retaliation under the NJLAD against  Galaxy. The NJLAD makes it illegal for an employer to terminate  an employee on the basis of race, national origin, sex  and other protected characteristics. Victoria v. Fluor  Enters. Inc., No. 13-7587, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  134574, 2015 WL 5822056, at *6 (D.N.J. Oct. 2, 2015)  (citing N.J.S.A. 10:5-12). The factors to establish a  prima facie case of retaliation under the NJLAD are the  same as those required under § 1981. Mann v. Prince  Telecom, LLC, No. 12-6263, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  104699, 2013 WL 3884189, at *5 (D.N.J. July 26, 2013).  The analysis for Plaintiffs NJLAD claim against Galaxy  is, thus, also the same. See Venson v. Pro Custom  Solar, LLC, No. 19-19227, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  205438, 2021 WL 4963294, at *3 (D.N.J. Oct. 25, 2021)  (finding plaintiff's failed to articulate a claim of retaliation  under § 1981, and thus ""their claims of retaliation under  the NJLAD are also futile."") This Court, accordingly,  adopts the analysis previously provided for Plaintiffs §  1981 claim and dismisses Plaintiffs NJLAD claim  without prejudice. E. Pierce Claim Against Galaxy Plaintiffs Complaint asserts a Pierce claim for common  law wrongful termination under Pierce v. Ortho  Pharmaceutical Corp., 84 N.J. 58, 417 A.2d 505, 512  (1980). (Compl. ¶¶ 65-70.) Plaintiff alleges that she was  discharged in retaliation for making complaints about  alleged unlawful racial discrimination and Human  Resources procedures. (Id. at 68.) Defendants move to  dismiss Plaintiffs Pierce claim for failure to identify any  clear mandate of public policy. (Defs.' Moving Br. 22.)  Defendants assert that even if such a mandate is  identified, Plaintiff [*28]  cannot support that such a  policy was violated or that she sufficiently expressed  more than just her ""vague concerns."" (Id.) Where a plaintiff bases her common law Pierce claim on  the public policy of the NJLAD and asserts a claim  under both, the former claim is subsumed by the latter.  See, e.g., Campbell v. Sedgwick Detert, Moran &  Arnold, No. 11-642, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126480,  2011 WL 5248150, at *3 (D.N.J. Nov. 2, 2011) (citation  omitted); Rodriguez v. Springhill Suites by Marriott, No.  13-6841, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16605, 2014 WL  575529, at *2 (D.N.J. Feb. 10, 2014) (""New Jersey  courts and courts interpreting New Jersey law have held  that common law claims for wrongful discharge in  violation of public policy are preempted when a statutory  remedy under the NJLAD exists."" (quoting Santiago v.  City of Vineland, 107 F. Supp. 2d 512, 567 (D.N.J.  2000))); N.J.S.A. § 10:5-13(b) (""All remedies available in  common law tort actions shall be available to prevailing  plaintiff's [under the NJLAD].""). The only exception to  when a Pierce claim is not preempted as coterminous  with the NJLAD is if the cause of action finds its basis in  the New Jersey State Constitution. Campbell, 2011 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 126480, 2011 WL 5248150, at *3. Here,  Plaintiff does not cite or refer to the New Jersey State  Constitution; thus Plaintiffs Pierce claim is coterminous  with her NJLAD claim and must be dismissed. See  Schanzer v. Rutgers Univ., 934 F. Supp. 669, 679  (D.N.J. 1996) (dismissing plaintiff's Pierce claim  because the ""NJLAD provides the full panoply of rights  and remedies that are available under the common  law.""); Santiago, 107 F. Supp. 2d at 568 (dismissing  plaintiff's common law Pierce claims [*29]  because they  ""are duplicative of the cause of action under the NJLAD  and therefore are preempted by the statute.""); see also  Rodriguez, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16605, 2014 WL  575529, at *2 (""To the extent [p]laintiff may allege that  the NJLAD supplies the clear mandate of public policy,  a common law claim for wrongful discharge cannot be  predicated on the policy expressed through the NJLAD  in light of the statutory remedy available.""). For the reasons stated above, Plaintiff's Pierce claim  against Galaxy is dismissed without prejudice.",0

To establish Article III standing, plaintiffs must allege ""  (i) that [they] suffered an injury in fact that is concrete,  particularized, and actual or imminent; (ii) that the injury  was likely caused by the defendant; and [*2]  (iii) that  the injury would likely be redressed by judicial relief.""  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2203  (2021) (citing Lujanv. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S.  555, 560-61 (1992)). The second element, traceability,  is at issue here. To meet that requirement, plaintiffs  must allege that their injuries are ""fairly traceable"" to the  defendants' conduct and  *** The Honorable David A. Ezra, United States District  Judge for the   District of Hawaii, sitting by designation.   2  ""not the result of the independent action of some third  party not before the court."" Namisnak v. Uber Techs., Inc., 971 F.3d 1088, 1094  Page 2 of 2 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561).  Although this does not require a showing of proximate  cause, it does require plaintiffs to ""establish a 'line of  causation' between defendants' action and their alleged  harm that is more than 'attenuated.'"" Maya v. Centex  Corp., 658 F.3d 1060, 1070 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting  Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 757 (1984)). Particularly  relevant here, ""[i]n cases where a chain of causation  'involves numerous third parties' whose 'independent  decisions' collectively have a 'significant effect' on  plaintiffs' injuries, the Supreme Court and this court  have found the causal chain too weak to support  standing at the pleading stage."" Id. The district court correctly concluded that plaintiffs lack  Article III standing to sue the government defendants  because plaintiffs' injuries are the result of allegedly  illegal third-party conduct in Nevada's [*3]  commercial  sex industry. While the government defendants have  various roles in regulating that industry, the injuries  plaintiffs suffered were allegedly inflicted by the  ""independent action[s]"" of third parties, Lujan, 504 U.S.  at 560-namely, the traffickers, escort agencies, strip  clubs, and brothels who were also named in their  complaint. Plaintiffs' allegations are therefore insufficient  to support traceability under Article III. See id. When  plaintiffs raise claims based on government action or  inaction, they must sufficiently allege that government  defendants' actions ""exert[] a 'determinative or coercive 3 effect' on the third-party conduct that directly causes  the[ir] injury."" WildEarthGuardians v. United States  Forest Serv., 70 F.4th 1212, 1217 (9th Cir. 2023)  (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997)).  Plaintiffs' allegations do not meet that standard,  especially when by the allegations of the complaint  certain third parties engaged in conduct that violated  federal and state laws against sex trafficking. The record does not support plaintiffs' assertions that  the district court failed to consider all their allegations.  Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in denying  leave to amend because amendment as to the  government defendants would have been futile. See  Bonin v. Calderon, 59 F.3d 815, 845 (9th Cir. 1995)  (""Futility of amendment can, by itself, justify the  denial [*4]  of a motion for leave to amend.""). AFFIRMED. 4",1
"Wilson v. Conn. DOT, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217795","[*1] RULING  ON  DEFENDANT'S  MOTION  TO  DISMISS THIS ACTION is before the court upon Defendant's  Motion to Dismiss and memorandum in support thereof  (together, ""Motion"").1 See ECF Nos. 14 and 14-1. The  court has reviewed the Motion, Plaintiff's opposition to  the Motion (""Opposition""), see ECF No. 17, Defendant's  reply brief, see ECF No. 18, all exhibits to the parties'  briefs, and the record in this matter and is thoroughly  apprised in the premises. For the reasons discussed  herein, the court hereby GRANTSin part andDENIESin  part the Motion. I. BACKGROUND2 Plaintiff Wilson is an African-American man. ECF No. 1  ¶ 3. Plaintiff Del Valle is a Hispanic woman and Plaintiff  Wilson's mother. Id. ¶ 4. Defendant is Plaintiff Wilson's  former employer and Plaintiff Del Valle's current  employer. Id. ¶¶ 3-4. Plaintiff Wilson was hired on or about December 7,  2019. Id. ¶ 6. He asserts that while working for  Defendant, he observed employees who were not  African-American 1 This action currently is stayed pending disposition of  the Motion. Plaintiffs have filed a motion to lift the stay,  see ECF No. 23, which is mooted by this ruling. 2 All background facts are taken from the complaint and  as such are allegations. [*2]  1 being given ""special privileges"" that were denied to  him.3 Id. ¶ 8. Plaintiff Wilson complained of this  disparate treatment to his union representative, who  allegedly replied that Plaintiff Wilson should stop  complaining and be glad he had a job. Id. ¶ 9. Plaintiff  Wilson was terminated on April 15, 2020. Id. ¶¶ 10-11.  The reason given for his termination was that he had  been observed sleeping on the job on February 23,  2020. Id. ¶ 11. Plaintiff Wilson denies ever falling asleep on  the job, and he asserts that between the date of the  alleged infraction and the date of his termination, no one  addressed the incident with him. Id. ¶¶ 13-14. The  acting director, who handed Plaintiff Wilson his  termination letter, allegedly said that if Plaintiff Wilson  had kept his mouth shut, he would not have lost his job.  Id. ¶¶ 11, 45. Plaintiff Wilson filed a complaint with the Connecticut  Commission on Human Rights  and  Opportunities  (""CHRO""),  which  was  Page 2 of 12 dismissed on January 18, 2022.4 Id. ¶ 15; see also ECF  No. 14-3. Plaintiff Del Valle has been employed by Defendant  since 2014. ECF No. 1 ¶ 17. She alleges that  throughout her time working for Defendant, she has  been treated differently than non-Hispanic [*3]  and  male employees. Id. ¶ 18. More specifically, Plaintiff Del  Valle alleges she was made to ""perform harder, more  physically demanding work"" than non-Hispanic women,  and has been denied work breaks. Id. ¶ 19. Plaintiff Del  Valle describes one white female coworker who is  absent when toilsome work needs doing and who only  appears when the work is done. Id. ¶ 23. This behavior  has not been 3 It is not clear what these ""special privileges"" were,  specifically. 4 Plaintiff Wilson asserts that he received a release of  jurisdiction on this date, but the exhibits to the Motion  clearly show that what he received was a dismissal. 2 addressed. Id. Another white woman Plaintiff Del Valle  works with is not disciplined for taking long lunch  breaks. Id. ¶ 22. Plaintiff Del Valle also alleges that she has not been  permitted to wear shoes other than steel-toed boots, but  a white colleague is permitted to do so and ""to go  where[]ever she wants."" Id. ¶ 21. The complaint also  describes an incident where a white female colleague  broke some equipment but was not disciplined for the  error. Id. ¶ 20. Plaintiff Del Valle speculates that a  minority employee would have been scrutinized if they  had made the same [*4]  mistake. Id. She does not  describe any other incident that would support her  speculation, though. She also states that she has heard her crew leader  comment that women should not be working for  Defendant, and that her supervisor and her crew leader  have referred to Hispanic employees as ""you people.""  Id. ¶¶ 24-25. Finally, she asserts that over the course of  her  employment,  she  has  been  given  fewer  opportunities for overtime than her peers who are not  Hispanic women. Id. ¶ 26. Plaintiff Del Valle filed an internal complaint of race and  gender discrimination with Defendant's Affirmative  Action Unit on January 22, 2020.5 Id. ¶ 27. On February  4, 2020, she complained to someone in management  about the pattern of discrimination. Id. ¶ 43. On May 5,  2020, she was notified that her complaints would yield  no responsive action from management. Id. ¶ 44. On  May 15, 2020, the acting director and a supervisor told 5 A substantial part of the complaint is devoted to  describing an incident earlier in January where Plaintiff  Del Valle argued with the acting director and Plaintiff  Wilson's supervisor about an apparent discrepancy in  Plaintiff Wilson's paycheck. The director and the  supervisor allegedly [*5]  told her that Plaintiff Wilson  was a liar and a poor worker, and they accused Plaintiff  Del Valle of using the office computers to collect  information about her son's paycheck, which she  denied. ECF No. 1 ¶ 28-40. Plaintiff Del Valle accused  the others of being disrespectful. The altercation  culminated in Plaintiff Del Valle's office keys being  confiscated. These allegations are never relied upon for  any of Plaintiffs' claims, and their relevance are unclear,  so the court will not discuss them in any further detail. 3 her that they had known her complaint would go  nowhere, and that now they would get rid of her. Id. ¶  45. On May 12, 2021, Plaintiff Del Valle suffered an injury  while at work and was reassigned to light duty. Id. ¶ 46.  She claims that her multiple requests to be assigned to  the position of backup clerk have been denied because  she is restricted to light duty, but she asserts that her  physical limitations do not prevent her performing the  tasks of a backup clerk. Id. ¶ 48-49. She also asserts  that she has been denied access to certain trainings  although her physical limitations would not prevent her  being able to participate in those trainings. Id. ¶¶ 42, 51- 52. Plaintiff [*6]  del Valle filed a complaint of discrimination  and retaliation with the CHRO on June 30, 2020. Id. ¶  54. On March 23, 2022, a Release of Jurisdiction was  issued. Id. Plaintiffs filed their complaint on April 23, 2022,  asserting six claims. See generally ECF No. 1. Counts One and Two raise Title VII claims  as to both the plaintiffs (racial discrimination and  retaliation, respectively). Counts Three and Four allege  discrimination against Plaintiff Del Valle on the basis of  her disability in violation of the Americans with  Page 3 of 12 Disabilities Act (""ADA"") and the Connecticut Fair  Employment Practices Act (""CFEPA""), respectively.  Counts Five and Six allege gender discrimination as to  Plaintiff in violation of Title VII and the CFEPA,  respectively. Plaintiffs seek damages plus costs and  fees. II. LEGAL STANDARD It is axiomatic that federal courts have limited jurisdiction  and must dismiss actions where subject matter  jurisdiction is lacking. See Nike, Inc. v. Already, LLC,  663 F.3d 89, 4 94 (2d. Cir. 2011). A party may move to dismiss a claim  where the federal courts do not have jurisdiction to hear  it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). In resolving a motion to  dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, a district  court may refer to evidence outside the pleadings.  Makarova v. United States, 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir.  2000). Dismissal also is appropriate where the [*7]  facts  alleged in the complaint are insufficient to state a  plausible claim for relief. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.  662, 678 (2009). To avoid dismissal under Federal Rule  of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a plaintiff must plead  ""enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible  on its face,"" and not merely ""conceivable."" Bell Atl.  Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). When  reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6),  the court must accept as true all factual allegations in  the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in the  nonmovant's favor. See ATSI Commc'ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d  87, 98 (2d Cir. 2007). Although a complaint ""does not  need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiff's obligation  to provide the 'grounds' of his 'entitle[ment] to relief'  requires more than labels and conclusions, and a  formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action  will not do."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555; see also  Ashcroft, 556 U.S. at 684 (concluding that the Twombly  pleading standard applies in ""all civil actions""). III. DISCUSSION Defendant alleges that all the claims must be dismissed.  With respect to Plaintiff Wilson's two claims, they argue that both his  discrimination and retaliation claim (Counts One and  Two, respectively) must be dismissed because he has  failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. They also  argue that he has failed to state a claim for 5 discrimination. And with respect to Plaintiff Del Valle's  claims, [*8]  they argue that the Eleventh Amendment  bars her CFEPA and ADA claims (Counts Three, Four,  and Six), that she has failed to exhaust administrative  remedies for her disability claim under the CFEPA  (Count Four), and that she has failed to state any of her  claims. Because the Eleventh Amendment argument calls  jurisdiction into question, the court will begin there. 1. CFEPA and ADA Claims The Eleventh Amendment bars federal courts from  hearing suits brought against a state by its citizens. See  generally Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890). But ""[a]  sovereign's immunity may be waived, and the [Supreme  Court of the United States] consistently has held that a  State may consent to suit against it in federal court."" Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S.  89, 99 (1984). Such a waiver of immunity must be  expressed in clear terms. Id. Similarly, Congress ""has  power with respect to the rights protected by the  Fourteenth Amendment to abrogate the Eleventh  Amendment immunity,"" but this exercise of power also  must be done unequivocally. Id. A state agency enjoys the protection of the Eleventh  Amendment where it functions as an ""arm of the State.""  Regents of the Univ. of California v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425,  429- 30 (1997). Where an action names a state agency  as a defendant, but the suit ""is in essence one for the  recovery of money from the state, the state is the real,  substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its  sovereign immunity from suit . . . ."" Id. [*9]  At 429  (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury of  Ind., 323 U.S. 459 (1945)). Because a suit against the  Connecticut Department of Transportation essentially is  a suit against the State of Connecticut, the court finds  that Defendant is entitled to exercise 6 sovereign immunity where that protection has not been  waived. See Martires v.Connecticut Dep't of Transp.,  596 F. Supp. 2d 425, 445 (D. Conn. 2009) (finding that  the Connecticut Department of Transportation was  protected by sovereign immunity against civil rights  claims). Page 4 of 12 And it is well settled that Connecticut has not consented  to defend CFEPA claims in federal court. See Lyon v.  Jones, 168 F. Supp. 2d 1, *6 (D. Conn. 2001)  (dismissing CFEPA claims as barred by the Eleventh  Amendment). To the contrary, the CFEPA specifies that  suits may be brought only in the state's superior court.  Pawlow v. Dep't ofEmergency Servs. & Pub. Prot., 172  F. Supp. 3d 568, 578 (D. Conn. 2016). Therefore, this  federal court may not hear the CFEPA claims brought in  this action. Plaintiffs argue that the court may hear the CFEPA  claims pursuant to supplemental jurisdiction, but  supplemental  jurisdiction  cannot  defeat  Eleventh  Amendment immunity. Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 121  (""[N]either pendent jurisdiction nor any other basis of  jurisdiction may override the Eleventh Amendment."");  see also Vadenv. Connecticut, 557 F. Supp. 2d 279,  289 (D. Conn. 2008) (""[T]he Eleventh Amendment  necessarily also bars exercise of federal statutory  supplemental jurisdiction over suits against a State."").  Therefore, it is clear that Counts Four6 and Six must be  dismissed. Plaintiff Del Valle's ADA claim is barred for [*10]  the  same reason. The Supreme Court has held, clearly and  unequivocally, that the Eleventh Amendment shields  state employers from claims arising under Title I of the  ADA, which is the part of the ADA that addresses  discrimination in employment. Bd. of Trustees of Univ.  of Alabama v. Garrett, 6 Because the court concludes that Count Four is  barred by sovereign immunity, the court need not reach  the question of whether Plaintiff Del Valle exhausted her  administrative remedies with respect to this claim. 7 531 U.S. 356, 360 (2001); see also Mary Jo C. v. New  York State & Loc. Ret. Sys., 707 F.3d 144, 171 (2d Cir.  2013) (""A public employee may not bring a Title II claim  against his or her employer, at least when the defendant  employer employs fifteen or more employees."").7 Thus,  there can be no argument that Count Three also must  be dismissed.8 2. Title VII Claims The Eleventh Amendment does not bar citizens from  suing state agencies under Title VII, though. The court  therefore turns to Counts One, Two, and Five. Counts  One  and  Two  assert  claims  of  racial  discrimination and retaliation, respectively, as to each  plaintiff. Count Five asserts gender discrimination as to  Plaintiff Del Valle. Defendant argues that all these  counts must be dismissed as they relate to Plaintiff Del  Valle because they fail to state a claim. And Defendant  argues  that  Counts  One  and  Two  must  be  dismissed [*11]  as they relate to Plaintiff Wilson  because he failed to exhaust his administrative  remedies. Finally, Defendant argues that Plaintiff Wilson  has failed to state a claim in Count One (the  discrimination claim). i. Exhaustion The court takes up the exhaustion argument first. There  is a comprehensive administrative framework in place to  address claims arising under Title VII. Plaintiffs must  first file a complaint with the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission (""EEOC""), who 7 The complaint names 14 of Defendant's employees by  name, and references others more generally, so the  court is satisfied that this case fits within the ambit of  Mary Jo C. 8Plaintiffs have filed a motion to amend the complaint,  see ECF No. 25, asserting that such amendment is  necessary to incorporate the fact that the CHRO and the  EEOC have issued a release of jurisdiction and a notice  of right to sue in relation to a complaint of disability  discrimination from Plaintiff Del Valle. The court finds  the proposed amendment would be futile, since this new  factual allegation does not save the disability claims  from dismissal under the Eleventh Amendment. The  motion to amend therefore must be denied, and the  court  need  not  address  the  additional  communications [*12]  from the CHRO or the EEOC any  further. 8 investigates the allegations and determines whether  they ought to bring claims against the employer, or  whether they ought to release jurisdiction and allow the  plaintiff to pursue their claims individually. 42 U.S.C.A. §  2000e-5(b), (e). Many states, Connecticut among them,  have an analogous state agency that also reviews  allegations  of  employment  discrimination.  In  Connecticut, it is the CHRO.9 The EEOC is required to  defer to the CHRO for 60 days following the filing of a  discrimination complaint to allow the state to handle the  claim, if it chooses to do so. 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-5(c).  After this deferral period, the EEOC has jurisdiction to  Page 5 of 12 review the claim. Id. If the EEOC fails to make any  determination as to the complaint within 180 days of  having jurisdiction over it, the EEOC ""shall"" so notify the grievant, and the grievant then has  90 days to commence a civil suit. 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e- 5(f)(1). The administrative timeline for Plaintiffs is not entirely  clear. It appears that each plaintiff filed their grievance  with the CHRO, which in turn sent each complaint to the  EEOC for dual filing. ECF Nos. 14-2, 14-4. Plaintiff Del  Valle's complaint is dated June 30, 2020, and is stamped as being received by the State  of Connecticut [*13]  on July 10, 2020. ECF No. 14-4.  Plaintiff Wilson's complaint is dated June 30, 2020, and  is stamped as being received by the State of  Connecticut on July 21, 2020. ECF No. 14-2. Plaintiff Del Valle asserts that the CHRO released its  jurisdiction as to her complaint on March 23, 2022,  though the release itself was not docketed. ECF No. 1 ¶  54. Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiff Del Valle  has exhausted the administrative remedies for her Title  VII claims, and so the court will accept that there is no  procedural impediment to her claims in Counts One,  Two, and Five. 9 There are specific time periods within which a  complaint must be filed with the CHRO and the EEOC,  but there is no argument that Plaintiffs' complaints were  untimely. 9 However, it appears that Plaintiff Wilson never received  a release of jurisdiction from the CHRO. Rather, on  January 18, 2022, he received a final agency action of  ""No Reasonable Cause,"" ECF No. 14-3, which is a dismissal  for the reason that there is ""no reasonable possibility  that investigating the complaint will result in a finding of  reasonable cause."" Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 46a-83(c).  Defendant argues in the Motion that this final agency  action does not serve to exhaust Defendant's [*14]   administrative remedies absent an official release of  jurisdiction. The court need not address this argument, though,  because whatever happened with the CHRO, it is clear  that Plaintiff Wilson did receive a right-to-sue notice  from the EEOC on June 14, 2022. See ECF No. 17-1.  The court finds that this notice satisfies the exhaustion  requirement as to his Title VII claims. Defendant's argument to the contrary is unavailing.  Defendant contends that Plaintiff Wilson's Title VII  claims still should be dismissed because he was  required to wait until after he had received this release  to file this action, but he filed suit well before receipt of  the notice, and thus his claims were premature. Defendant concedes, though, that under Title VII, the  exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional, and so it  may be waived or estopped where appropriate. Pietras  v. Bd.of Fire Comm'rs of Farmingville Fire Dist., 180  F.3d 468, 474 (2d Cir. 1999) (""The Supreme Court has  stated that 'filing a timely charge of discrimination with  the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in  federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of  limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable  tolling.'"") (quoting Zipes v.Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455  U.S. 385, 393 (1982)). Still, Defendant argues that  allowing these claims to proceed under these [*15]   circumstances would defeat the purpose of 10 exhaustion, namely, to allow an administrative agency  the first opportunity to take remedial action. The court is unpersuaded. In the first instance, the  EEOC had ample time to exercise its authority to  adjudicate the complaint, and it declined to take any  remedial action with respect to Plaintiff Wilson's claims.  Moreover, according to the relevant regulations, Plaintiff  Wilson should have received a release of jurisdiction  long before he did. By the court's calculation, had the  EEOC disposed of his complaint within 180 days of  having jurisdiction over it, Plaintiff Wilson would have  had his right-to-sue notice by March 18, 2021.10 But, of  course, a global pandemic can affect an agency's ability  to function efficiently, and for that same reason, the  court finds it appropriate to approach Plaintiff Wilson's  complaint with appreciation for the unique challenges  presented in navigating the administrative process when  the administration is not operating at full capacity. Moreover, even absent a global emergency, the court  finds  equitable  modification  of  the  exhaustion  requirement to be uniquely necessary in the present  circumstances. The court [*16]  recognizes that district  courts often dismiss premature Title VII claims, but  without prejudice to refiling once the right to sue has  been issued. See, e.g., Hladki v.Jeffrey's Consol., Ltd.,  652 F. Supp. 388, 393 (E.D.N.Y. 1987). In this case,  though, the notice did not issue until after this case had  Page 6 of 12 been initiated and the Motion had been filed, and so  refiling a separate action may well have rendered  Plaintiff Wilson's claim subject to claim preclusion. But  the 90-day period to initiate a civil suit has long expired  by the 10 This date is 240 days from the date the State of  Connecticut stamped its receipt of the complaint, which  represents the 180 days the EEOC has to investigate a  claim, plus 60 days for which it was required to defer  jurisdiction to the CHRO. 11 date of this ruling, which may well preclude Plaintiff  Wilson from pursuing his claims in a separate suit.  Thus, the court finds it in the interest of justice to grant  Plaintiff Wilson equitable relief in this case, and to  excuse him from strict compliance with the exhaustion  requirement. See Pinkard v. Pullman-Standard, 678  F.2d 1211, 1219 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982), reh'g en banc  denied, 685 F.2d 1383, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1105  (1983) (waiving exhaustion where procedural anomalies  related to class actions caused a plaintiff to miss his  opportunity to file suit after receipt of the right to  sue [*17]  notice). Because failure to exhaust is Defendant's only argument  for dismissing Plaintiff Wilson's retaliation claim in Count  Two, the Motion is denied with respect to that claim. 3. Failure to State a Claim Finally,  Defendant  argues  that  Plaintiff  Wilson's  discrimination claim and each of Plaintiff Del Valle's  remaining claims should be dismissed because they fail  to state a cognizable claim under Title VII. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that it is  unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an  employee because of that employee's race, color, or  sex. 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-2. The statute is intended ""to assure  equality of employment opportunities and to eliminate  those discriminatory practices and devices which have  fostered racially stratified job environments to the  disadvantage of minority citizens."" McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 800  (1973), holding modified by Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,  507 U.S. 604 (1993). ""Title VII prohibits both intentional  discrimination (known as 'disparate treatment') as well  as, in some cases, practices that are not intended to  discriminate but in fact have a disproportionately  adverse effect on minorities (known as 'disparate  impact')."" Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 577 (2009). Recognizing that ""most discrimination and retaliation is  not carried out so openly as to 12 provide direct proof of it,"" Sanders v. New York City  Hum. Res. Admin., 361 F.3d 749, 755 (2d Cir. 2004),  plaintiffs asserting [*18]  disparate treatment claims11  may show discriminatory intent by either direct or  circumstantial evidence of animus, Radwan v.Manuel,  55 F.4th 101, 132 (2d Cir. 2022). Direct evidence of discriminatory animus includes  employer policies, practices, or decisions that expressly  rely upon a protected characteristic. Young v. United  ParcelServ., Inc., 575 U.S. 206, 213 (2015). Plaintiffs do  not allege that Defendant took any action against them  explicitly because of their race or gender, so there is no  direct evidence of discrimination. The absence of direct  evidence is not fatal to their claims, though. They still  may show circumstantial evidence of discriminatory  animus using the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. First,  they must make out a prima facie case by showing that  they are a member of a protected class, that they are  qualified for the positions they held or continue to hold,  that they suffered an adverse action, and that the facts  imply a discriminatory intent. Radwan, 55 F.4th at 130.  With respect to the third element, an adverse action is  defined as a materially adverse change in the terms and  conditions of employment. Sanders, 361 F.3d at 755. It  must be more than an inconvenience or a change in an  employee's responsibilities. Id. And with respect to the  fourth element, there are several recognized methods  by  which  a  Title  VII  plaintiff [*19]   can  show  circumstances which might lead a reasonable juror to  infer discriminatory animus, one of which is to point to  comparators who are similarly situated to the plaintiff,  but who are not of the same protected class, and who  were not treated as harshly as the plaintiff. Radwan, 55 F.4th at 132. 11 Plaintiffs do not proceed under a disparate impact  theory. 13 If the plaintiffs successfully present a prima facie case of  discrimination, the burden shifts to Defendant to proffer  a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse  Page 7 of 12 action. Id. at 130. Then the burden shifts back to  Plaintiffs to show that the proffered reason is pretextual.  Id. There is no dispute that Plaintiffs have satisfied the first  and second elements of the prima facie test (that they  are members of a protected class and are qualified for  the work they were hired to perform). Defendant argues,  however, that neither plaintiff has alleged an adverse  action nor any facts that support an inference of  discrimination. i. Discrimination as to Plaintiff Wilson With respect to Plaintiff Wilson, Defendant argues that  the alleged denial of ""special privileges"" does not qualify as an adverse  action for purposes of Title VII. The court hesitates to  find that [*20]  the denial of perquisites made available  to some workers can never provide the basis for a Title  VII claim, but it agrees with Defendant in this instance.  Absent any description in the complaint of what these  ""special privileges"" were, the court cannot assess  whether they qualify as materially adverse changes to  the terms of Plaintiff Wilson's employment. Accordingly, the Motion is  granted insofar as Count One seeks to recover for the  denial of these ""special privileges."" However, it cannot be argued that Plaintiff Wilson's  termination qualifies as an adverse action sufficient to  carry his Title VII claim. Thus, the court finds the third  element of the prima facie case satisfied with respect to  Plaintiff Wilson in Count One. 14 The court also finds the fourth element satisfied.12  There are two facts which, when taken together, may  lead a reasonable factfinder to infer discriminatory  animus. First, Plaintiff Wilson was fired for an incident  (which he denies occurs at all) that allegedly occurred  over a month before he was fired, for which he received  no intervening discipline before his termination. And  second, at the termination itself, Defendant's acting  director allegedly told Plaintiff [*21]  Wilson that if he  had ""kept his mouth shut"" then he would not have been  losing his job. That remark appears to refer to Plaintiff  Wilson's complaints about racial discrimination, and the  fact that the remark was made at the moment of his  termination is sufficient to allow a reasonable factfinder  to infer that the termination was motivated by  discriminatory animus.13 Although the McDonnell Douglas framework has two  additional steps, Defendant does not make any  argument as to their burden at the next step. That is to  say, Defendant does not argue that they had a  legitimate reason for terminating Plaintiff Wilson. But  even assuming that they were to point to the same  justification given at the time of the termination (Plaintiff  Wilson's alleged nap on the job), the court would find  that these same two facts would support an inference  that the justification is pretextual. Accordingly, the Motion must be denied with respect to  Plaintiff Wilson's Title VII claim for discrimination in  Count One. 12Defendant argues that Plaintiff Wilson has not  described any similarly-situated individuals, and this is  true, but that argument related to the individuals  receiving ""special treatment,"" which the court already  has [*22]  found is not an adequately-pled adverse  action. Thus, the court will not address this argument  here. 13The court acknowledges Defendant's point that  Plaintiff Wilson made his complaint to his union representative and not to his manager, but again, the  fact that a manager referred to it allows the court to  draw the reasonable inference from the alleged facts  that the complaint had made its way to Defendant. 15 ii. Discrimination as to Plaintiff Del Valle Plaintiff Del Valle asserts that she has experienced  adverse action in the denial of training and overtime  opportunities, the assignment of more arduous tasks,  fewer perquisites, and the rejection of her request to be  the backup clerk. Plaintiff Del Valle points out that courts have concluded  that the denial of opportunities for professional  development, like trainings, can qualify as an adverse  action, where those opportunities ""bear on either [the]  plaintiff's opportunities for professional growth and  career advancement or directly on [the] plaintiff's  compensation."" Nakis v. Potter, No. 01 CIV. 10047 (HBP), 2004 WL  2903718, at *20 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 2004). But it is not  alleged that the trainings from which Plaintiff Del Valle  was excluded had any effect on her career or  Page 8 of 12 compensation. The only trainings she cites are one on  [*23] ""the double wing"" and one involving ""signs and  markings,"" the latter of which enabled employees to  earn some sort of ""fuel certification."" There is no  explanation of what it would mean for Plaintiff Del  Valle's career if she were trained on the double wing, or  if she had the referenced certification. Plaintiff Del Valle  never alleges that these trainings (or any other) would  have enabled her to progress in her career. For this  reason, the court cannot conclude that the exclusion  from trainings qualifies as an adverse action.14 Similarly, it is not clear that the position of backup clerk  is superior in any way to Plaintiff Del Valle's current position. The simple fact that  an individual has sought but has been denied a  particular position is not, in itself, an adverse action.  There must be some affirmative indicia as to why the  denied position is more desirable, perhaps because it 14 The court notes, too, that Plaintiff Del Valle's  allegation with respect to the signs-and-markings  training appears to be that she was excluded from the  training because she was on light duty at the time,  which she claims was an example of disability  discrimination. But, as discussed previously, the  disability [*24]  claims have been dismissed. 16 has better pay or better hours. See Beyer v. Cnty. of  Nassau, 524 F.3d 160, 164 (2d Cir. 2008) (""A denial of a  transfer may also constitute an adverse employment  action, but we require a plaintiff to proffer objective  indicia of material disadvantage; 'subjective, personal  disappointment[ ]' is not enough."") (quoting Galabya v.  N.Y. City Bd. of Educ., 202 F.3d 636, 640 (2d Cir.2000))  (alteration in original). But here again, Plaintiff Del Valle  fails to offer any specifics as to the backup clerk  position. Consequently, the court cannot find that the  failure to make her the backup clerk qualifies as an  adverse action for the purposes of her discrimination  claim. Plaintiff Del Valle also asserts that she has been denied  certain perquisites and has been made to perform more  arduous tasks than others. But, here, too, there are  insufficient facts from which the court can find an  adverse action. With respect to perquisites, she alleges  that one white coworker is permitted to wear shoes that  do not have steel toes and may ""go where[]ever she  wants."" ECF No. 1 ¶ 21. In the first instance, it is not  clear what Plaintiff Del Valle is alleging when she says  this other individual may go where she wants. The court  will assume for this discussion that the allegation is that  this colleague [*25]  is permitted to be off-task without  being disciplined. Even with that assumption, though,  the court cannot find that these de minimus allowances  for other coworkers materially affects the terms and  conditions of Plaintiff Del Valle's employment. While in  some cases the inconsistent application of discipline  may qualify as an adverse action, Plaintiff Del Valle  does not allege that she was subjected to discipline for  these workplace violations. She states that she ""was not  permitted"" to wear shoes without steel toes, but it is not  clear  whether  she  was  disciplined  for  wearing  nonconforming shoes, and if so, what discipline was  meted out. The same is true for the 17 alleged allowance of a white coworker to have long  lunch breaks. Thus, even making several inferences (or  perhaps assumptions) in Plaintiff Del Valle's favor, the  court cannot find that these alleged facts show an  adverse action. And with respect to her work assignments, generally  speaking, ""[t]he assignment of tasks that are within the  description or duties of the position, even if less  desirable, do not rise to the level of an adverse  employment  action.""  Nidzon  v.  Konica  Minolta  Bus.Sols., USA, Inc., 752 F. Supp. 2d 336, 350  (S.D.N.Y. 2010). Plaintiff Del Valle does not assert that  the tasks she was asked to [*26]  perform were not  within her usual job description, and her ""subjective  dissatisfaction with her assignments is insufficient"" to  show an adverse action, even in combination with all  Plaintiff Del Valle's other allegations. Reckard v. Cnty. of Westchester, 351 F. Supp. 2d 157,  161 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). The only alleged conduct that may satisfy the ""adverse  action""  requirement  is  the  denial  of  overtime  opportunities. The allegation, though, is devoid of any  specifics. The entire assertion states, ""Consistently  throughout her employment by DOT Del Valle has been  given less overtime opportunities [sic] than employees  who are not Hispanic women."" ECF No. 1 ¶ 26. It is  difficult to ascertain from this single, unsupported  statement whether this alleged denial rises to the level  of an adverse action. But the court need not make any conclusions as to the  sufficiency of the factual allegation because it is clear  Page 9 of 12 that Plaintiff Del Valle's discrimination claim still fails at  the next element. Even if the court were to accept this  bald accusation as a plausibly-pled adverse action, the  court could not infer from that single sentence any  discriminatory animus. 18 Plaintiff Del Valle has not asserted any facts that could  show that the women who were given overtime instead  of her [*27]  were similarly situated to her. She does not  specifically identify these comparators in any way, much  less state their positions or level of experience, or even  their relevant demographic characteristics. There simply  is insufficient information from which the court could  conclude that the referenced comparators are similarly  situated to Plaintiff Del Valle. And there are no other alleged facts from which the  court could infer that the denial of overtime resulted  from discriminatory animus. Although Plaintiff Del Valle  alleges that her crew leader made disparaging  comments about women working for the Department of  Transportation and that her supervisor referred to  Hispanics as ""you people,"" this is insufficient to show  discriminatory animus as to the denied overtime. In the first instance, it is nowhere alleged that the crew  leader and supervisor had anything to do with the denial  of her overtime. And even assuming that they did  control her schedule, it is unclear whether their remarks  were sufficiently inflammatory or frequent. Stray  comments ""do not amount to the 'steady barrage of  opprobrious ... comments' sufficient to alter the conditions"" of Plaintiff  Del Valle's employment. Brennerv. City of New York  Dep't of Educ., 659 F. App'x 52, 54 (2d Cir. 2016)  (quoting [*28]  Tolbert v. Smith, 790 F.3d 427, 439 (2d  Cir. 2015)) (alteration in original). Plaintiff asserts that  her crew leader says things ""to the effect"" that women  should not be working for Defendant, but she gives no  specifics. The court therefore cannot assess the content  and context of these comments to corroborate her  conclusion. Similarly, while referring to a particular  group as ""you people"" certainly can denote a bias  relevant to a Title VII claim, the allegation in the  complaint is only that Plaintiff Del Valle's crew leader  and supervisor 19 have used this reference. Again, absent any context for  these comments, it is difficult for the court to conclude  that these comments alone can sustain her claim. It also is unclear when and how often these comments  were made. Plaintiff Del Valle alleges that she has  heard her crew leader comment about the unsuitability  of women to Defendant's work ""[f]rom the beginning of  her employment,"" but she does not allege the frequency  of these comments. And her allegation as to the use of  ""you people"" could just as easily show a single incident  as several. Accordingly, even assuming that Plaintiff Del  Valle's denied overtime opportunities constitute an  adverse employment action, she has not adequately  pled [*29]   discriminatory  animus  such  that  her  discrimination claims could survive dismissal. Accordingly, Counts One and Five are dismissed (Count  One as it relates to Plaintiff Del Valle). iii. Retaliation as to Plaintiff Del Valle15 Retaliation claims follow a similar burden-shifting  framework as discrimination claims follow. ""First, the  plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of retaliation  by showing: '(1) participation in a protected activity; (2)  that the defendant knew of the protected activity; (3) an  adverse  employment  action;  and  (4)  a  causal  connection between the protected activity and the  adverse employment action.'"" Hicks v. Baines, 593 F.3d  159, 164 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Jute v. Hamilton  Sundstrand Corp., 420 F.3d 166, 173 (2d Cir.2005).  Again, success at this step shifts the burden to  Defendant to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory  reason for the adverse action. Id. And finally, 15 As noted supra, Defendant does not argue for  dismissal of Plaintiff Wilson's retaliation claim. 20 the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to proffer evidence  from which a factfinder reasonably could infer a  retaliatory motive for the adverse action. Id. Here, Plaintiff Del Valle complained about discrimination  in the workplace, which qualifies as protected activity for  purposes of Title VII. See Littlejohn v. City of New York,  795 F.3d 297, 319 (2d Cir. 2015) (finding [*30]  that  internal complaints of discrimination are protected  activities). And, since she complained directly to  management, Defendant certainly knew of the protected  activity. Thus, the first two elements clearly are satisfied. The third and fourth elements prove as problematic for  Plaintiff Del Valle's retaliation claim as they were for her  discrimination claim, though, despite the more lax  Page 10 of 12 standard applied to retaliation claims. ""An adverse  employment action in a retaliation case includes  conduct that is 'harmful to the point that it could well  dissuade a reasonable worker from making or  supporting a charge of discrimination.'"" Duplan v. City of  New York, 888 F.3d 612, 626-27 (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting  Shultz v. Congregation Shearith Israel, 867 F.3d 298,  309 (2d Cir. 2017)). ""This definition covers a broader  range of conduct than does the adverse-action standard  for claims of discrimination under Title VII . . . ."" Vegav.  Hempstead Union Free Sch. Dist., 801 F.3d 72, 90 (2d  Cir. 2015). ""[T]he antiretaliation provision, unlike the  substantive [discrimination] provision, is not limited to  discriminatory actions that affect the terms and  conditions of employment."" Id. (quoting Burlington N.  &Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 57 (2006))  (alterations in original). There is no bright-line test courts  employ in determining whether particular conduct  constitutes an adverse employment action. Fincher v.  Depository Tr. & Clearing Corp., 604 F.3d 712, 721 (2d  Cir. 2010). Rather, courts take a fact-intensive  approach, scrutinizing [*31]  each case to determine  whether a challenged action rises to the level required  by the statute. Id. 21 Thus, although Plaintiff Del Valle could not show an  adverse action for purposes of her discrimination claim,  the court must reassess that conduct (denial of training  and overtime, denial of appointment as backup clerk,  denial of perquisites, and assignment to more arduous  tasks) to determine whether it yet can satisfy the  requirements of her retaliation claim. The Second Circuit has held that the assignment of  more difficult tasks, see Vega, 801 F.3d at 91 (finding  that a teacher's assignment of more difficult classes  qualified as an adverse employment action), and the  denial of overtime, see Lewis v. TriboroughBridge &  Tunnel Auth., 31 F. App'x 746, 748 (2d Cir. 2002)  (affirming a jury verdict in a plaintiff's favor where the  plaintiff alleged, inter alia, denial of overtime as the  basis for her retaliation claim), may qualify as an  adverse employment actions for purposes of a Title VII  retaliation claim. But Plaintiff Del Valle clearly fails to  establish that she experienced these actions following  her January 22, 2020, complaint to management. To the  contrary, Plaintiff Del Valle clearly asserts that she has  been made to perform harder tasks and has been  denied  overtime  throughout [*32]   her  time  with  Defendant. Thus, the causal connection between this  conduct and the protected activity is absent. Similarly, without any specifics as to when the alleged  denial of perquisites and longer breaks occurred, the  court cannot find the requisite causal connection to that  conduct, even assuming it could qualify as an adverse  employment action. See Chungv. City Univ. of New  York, 605 F. App'x 20, 23 (2d Cir. 2015)(stating that  where ""timing is the only basis for a claim of retaliation,  and gradual adverse job actions began well before the  plaintiff had ever engaged in any protected activity, an  inference of retaliation 22 does not arise."") (quoting Slattery v. Swiss Reins. Am.  Corp., 248 F.3d 87, 95 (2d Cir.2001). And with respect to the denial of training opportunities  and her request to be backup clerk,16 here, again,  Plaintiff Del Valle fails to allege that these trainings had  any effect on her progression in her career, or that the  position of backup clerk was superior in any way to her  usual role. Absent some allegation that these trainings  would have led to some advantage to Plaintiff Del Valle,  the court cannot find that exclusion therefrom would  dissuade a reasonable person from asserting charges of  discrimination. See Leiferv. New York State Div. of  Parole, 391 F. App'x 32, 34 (2d Cir. 2010) (finding that  failing to provide a training to the plaintiff, inter alia, was  insufficient [*33]   to  demonstrate  an  adverse  employment action). Even if this conduct could qualify as an adverse  employment action for purposes of her retaliation claim,  there is nothing from which the court could infer  discriminatory motivation. One of the trainings she  specifically mentions (of only two) was held in  November 2021, over a year and a half after she had  made her internal complaint and over a year after she  had filed her complaint with the CHRO. Similarly, her  request to be stationed at the backup clerk position  came at some point after May 2021,17 over a year after  the internal complaint and almost a year after the CHRO  complaint. The lengthy period between the protected  activity and the allegedly retaliatory conduct attenuates  any causal connection. Thus, even taking as given that  Plaintiff Del Valle experienced an 16Again, the court acknowledges that these actions  appear to be pleaded in connection with Plaintiff Del Valle's disability discrimination claims, but the court  addresses them here nonetheless. 17While it is clear that Plaintiff Dell Valle made several  Page 11 of 12 requests for the backup clerk position, it is not clear  when she first made the request. But it appears from the  complaint that [*34]  her first request came after her on- the-job accident, since management told her she could  not be backup clerk while on light duty, and since she  was on light duty after the accident. ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 46- 49. So, because the accident occurred in May 2021, her  pleading shows that her request could not have been  before that time. 23 adverse employment action that satisfied the third  element of her prima facie case, she has not  established a causal connection between her internal  complaint and those actions that satisfies the fourth  element. However, though it is not clearly stated in the complaint  or thoroughly argued in Plaintiff Del Valle's opposition, the court finds that she  does have an actionable claim for Plaintiff Wilson's termination. Title VII's antiretaliation  provision covers a broad range of employer conduct.  Burlington, 548 U.S. at 62-63 (discussing the broader  language Congress employed in the antiretaliation  provision  as  compared  to  the  antidiscrimination  provision). Violative actions need not affect the  employee's terms of employment or employment  conditions. Id. at 63. It need only dissuade an employee  from engaging in protected activity, and actions taken  against a third party may certainly serve that  purpose. [*35]  See Thompson v. N. Am. Stainless, LP,  562 U.S. 170, 175 (2011) (""We think there is no textual  basis for making an exception to [the broad standard for  retaliatory conduct] for third-party reprisals . . . .""). And  while the Supreme Court of the United States has  declined to explicitly list those relationships that could  support a retaliation claim, this court finds that the  plaintiffs' relationship as mother and son certainly is  close enough to render adverse action against one to be  adequate deterrence for the other. Id. at 174. (""We think it obvious that a reasonable worker might be  dissuaded from engaging in protected activity if she  knew that her fiancé would be fired.""). Furthermore, the court finds that Plaintiff Del Valle has  alleged sufficient facts to support the rational inference  of a causal connection. First, Plaintiff Del Valle's  complaint (in January 2020) and Plaintiff Wilson's  termination (in April 2020) were close enough in time  that temporal proximity alone may carry the requisite  causal inference. Second, the 24 clear closeness of the plaintiffs' relationship, as  indicated by Plaintiff Del Valle's attention to her son's  employment concerns (namely, her attention to the  discrepancy in his paycheck), would indicate to others at  her job [*36]  a maternal sense of affection and  responsibility toward him.18 And finally, the threat  Plaintiff Del Valle received from her higher-ups that they  would ""get rid"" of her after her internal complaint had  been disposed of indicates a retaliatory predilection that,  though the threat postdated her son's termination, yet  could lead a factfinder to conclude that Plaintiff Wilson's  termination was a result of that predilection. Accordingly, the court finds that Plaintiff Del Valle has  stated a cognizable claim for retaliation under Title VII.",0
"Wisdom v. Perez, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 217366","MEMORANDUM & ORDER KIYO A. MATSUMOTO, United States District Judge: Petitioner  Atara  Wisdom  (""Petitioner"")  currently  incarcerated in the custody of the New York State  Department of Corrections and Community Supervision,  petitions for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28  U.S.C. § 2254. On July 10, 2014, Petitioner was  convicted after a jury trial of murder in the second  degree (N.Y. Penal Law § 125.25[1]). (See ECF No. 1,  Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus (""Pet.""), at 1; ECF  No. 5, State's Affidavit in Opposition (""State Opp.""), at  26.) On October 8, 2014, the trial court sentenced  Petitioner to an indeterminate prison term of 18 years to  life for the murder. (State Opp. at 26.) The Petitioner  claims that (1) her custodial statements were improperly  admitted as evidence in trial, (2) the trial court violated  her [*2]  rights to due process, to present a defense,  and to the effective assistance of counsel by requiring  defense counsel to interview a state's witness in the  presence of the prosecutor, (3) the trial court violated  her right to present a defense by precluding her from  admitting records and from cross-examining prosecution  witnesses on certain topics, and (4) the trial court  violated her due process right to a fair trial by admitting  Anthony Wilson's 911 call as a hearsay exception. (Pet.  at 42, 54, 60, 72.) For the reasons set forth below, the  petition is respectfully DENIED. BACKGROUND I. Factual Background At trial, the prosecution presented evidence showing  that on November 29, 2011, Petitioner stabbed Anthony  Wilson to death inside his studio apartment at 832  Bushwick Avenue in Brooklyn, New York. (State Opp. at  2.) In March 2012, DNA evidence recovered at the  scene was found to match the DNA profile of Petitioner,  and, following a search, NYPD detectives learned in      Page 2 of 16 July 2012 that Petitioner was staying at a women's  homeless shelter. (Id. at 3.) Detectives subsequently  brought Petitioner to the NYPD's 83rd Precinct on July  25, 2012, to conduct an interview, where the petitioner  was [*3]  advised of, and waived her Miranda rights and  agreed to speak with the Detective Christopher  Scandole. (Id. at 3-4.) Petitioner admitted to stabbing  Mr. Wilson, claiming that she had done so in self- defense, and was subsequently arrested after being  identified in a lineup by a witness who knew Mr. Wilson.  (Id. at 5-6, 16.) Following her arrest, Petitioner made  two further statements on the evening of July 25, 2012,  and gave an additional statement to Detective Scandole  the following morning, on July 26, 2012. (Id. at 16-18.) II. Pre-trial Proceedings A. Pre-trial Huntley/Wade Suppression Hearing On October 30, 2013, the Kings County Supreme Court  held a Huntley/Wade hearing regarding Petitioner's  motion to suppress her statements from July 26, 2012.  (ECF No. 5-1, Exhibit 1 to State's Opposition (""Ex. 1""),  at  9.)  Detective  Scandole  provided  testimony  recounting his interviews with Petitioner on July 25 and  July 26, 2012. (Id. at 10-22.) Detective Deborah  Batanjany also testified with respect to the lineup she  conducted on July 25, 2012. (Id. at 27-39.) The trial court determined that there were two issues to  be resolved in the hearing, including whether the  identification of Petitioner during [*4]  the lineup was  ""unduly suggestive in this case,"" and whether the  Petitioner voluntarily and knowingly waived her Miranda  rights during the interrogation. (Id. at 40-42.) The court, after reviewing the lineup photos and  Detective Batanjany's testimony, determined that there  was no serious issue regarding the suggestiveness of  the lineup to warrant suppressing the identification  testimony. (Id. at 41.) Based on the documented  Miranda form, the written statement read to and signed  by Petitioner, and a video statement where the  Detective provided Petitioner with another set of  Miranda warnings on July 25, 2012, the court ruled on  October 30, 2023, that Petitioner knowingly and    voluntarily waived her rights to remain silent and agreed  to speak with the police. (Id. at 41-42.) The court denied  Petitioner's motion to suppress in full. (Id. at 42.) B. Second Huntley Hearing On July 1, 2014, during trial, defense counsel made an  oral motion for a mistrial arguing that the testimony of a  prosecution witness regarding the use of Mr. Wilson's  Electronic  Benefits  Transfer  (EBT)  card  was  inadmissible for its prejudicial effect. (ECF No. 5-4,  Exhibit 4 to State's Opposition (""Ex. 4""), at 160.) The  defense [*5]  counsel made an alternative request to  strike the witness's testimony. (Id. at 162.) The trial court  denied the application for a mistrial and to strike the  testimony regarding the use of the EBT card but granted  a separate second Huntley hearing to determine the  admissibility of Petitioner's July 26 statements, in which  Petitioner stated, among other things, that she did not  use Mr. Wilson's benefits card. (Id. at 162-67.) During the second Huntley hearing before the trial court,  Detective Scandole testified that on the morning of July  26, 2012, he reminded Petitioner that she had waived  her Miranda rights the previous day, and asked if she  would be willing to speak with him further. (Id. at 165.)  Detective Scandole further testified that Petitioner  agreed to speak with him and provided further details  regarding her actions on the night of Mr. Wilson's death.  (Id. at 165-67.) The trial court also questioned Detective  Scandole regarding how Petitioner was advised of her  Miranda rights, and how Petitioner's interview on the  evening of July 25, 2012, concluded. (Id. at 168-70.)  Defense counsel cross-examined Detective Scandole  and asked if Petitioner stated on July 25 that ""she  didn't [*6]  want to speak anymore,"" to which Detective  Scandole answered: ""Correct."" (Id. at 173.) Upon  redirect questioning by the prosecution, Detective  Scandole clarified that Petitioner never asked for a  lawyer and did not say anything about not wanting to  speak with Detective Scandole on the morning of July  26, 2012. (Id. at 175.) The prosecution argued at the close of the hearing that  Petitioner's statements were admissible because she  had acknowledged that Detective Scandole provided  her with Miranda warnings on July 25, she did not  refuse to speak with Detective Scandole when he  reminded her of the Miranda warnings given on July 25  and asked on the morning of July 26 to follow up with  more questions, and because the police did not ""force[]  her to talk."" (Id. at 176.) The prosecution also argued  Page 3 of 16 that the video of Petitioner's statement on the evening of  July 25, 2012, showed that Petitioner was ""visibly  upset,"" which was the reason that the Assistant District  Attorney present asked if she wanted to stop the  interview at the time. (Id.) The court read in the relevant  portion of the video transcript to the record, which was  as follows: [A.D.A's ]QUESTION: You okay? You want to take  a minute? [*7]  You want us to stop for a second or  do you want to continue? You want to stop for a  second? [Petitioner]: All right. A.D.A. Purce: We're just going to hold out here for a  little bit. You just take your time, all right?  [Petitioner]: All right. [A.D.A. Purce: ] You know what, I think we're going to-we're going  to stop now, and if you want to continue, we'll talk in  a second, okay. You want us to stop right now? [Petitioner's] ANSWER: Yeah. A.D.A. Purce: All right, just stop the tape for now. There will be no further questions until we resume  the tape. (Id. at 178-79.) The trial court noted that the next day,  July 26, Detective Scandole reminded Petitioner of her  rights and asked if she wanted to continue, and that a  full recitation of the Miranda rights again was not  required. (Id. at 179.) Accordingly, the trial court ruled  that Petitioner voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently  made statements on July 26, 2012, to the police,  thereby rendering the statements admissible at trial. (Id.  at 181.) C. Admissibility of the 911 Call On June 30, 2014, the prosecution submitted a  Molineux application to admit a 911 call made by Mr.  Wilson at 12:37 A.M. on the early morning of the  stabbing. (ECF No. [*8]  5-2, Exhibit 2 to State's  Opposition (""Ex. 2""), at 2.) The 911 call was determined  to be 26 seconds long, and contained only the following  statement by Mr. Wilson: ""I got this girl in my house and  I don't know what's wrong with her, she's acting all crazy  and I want her out of my house."" (Ex. 4 at 131; Ex. 2 at  2-3). The prosecutor argued that the audio recording of  Mr. Wilson's 911 call was admissible under the present  sense impression or the excited utterance exception to  the hearsay rule. (Ex. 2 at 3.) Defense counsel objected  to the inclusion of the evidence, arguing that the  prejudice to Petitioner outweighed the probative value.  (Id. at 3.) Defense counsel further argued that there was  uncertainty about the context of the 911 call - whether  the call referred to the stabbing or a different matter.  (Id.) The prosecution responded by arguing that phone  records showed that, shortly after the 911 call, Petitioner  used Mr. Wilson's cell phone, including to call an  individual that the prosecution planned to call as a  witness. (Id. at 4-5.) The court admitted the 911 call  recording  under  the  present  sense  impression  exception. (Id. at 6.) III. Trial Jury selection for the trial against [*9]  Petitioner began  on June 26, 2014, and concluded on June 30, 2014, at  which point the trial began. (ECF No. 5-1, Exhibit 1 to  State's Opposition (""Ex. 1""), at 43; Ex. 2 at 292.)  Petitioner's trial defense was based upon justification  under N.Y. Penal Law § 35.15 Subsection 2B, relating  to the justified use of deadly force when a person  reasonably believes that the person they kill is  ""committing or attempting to commit a kidnapping,  forcible rape, forcible criminal sexual act or robbery.""  (ECF No. 5-7, Exhibit 7 to State's Opposition (""Ex. 7""),  at 25.) A. The Testimony of Prosecution Witness Matthew  Shepard During the trial, on July 9, 2014, the prosecution  obtained a material witness order to compel Matthew  Shepard to testify at trial. (Id. at 32.) Prior to Mr.  Shepard testifying, the trial court granted defense  counsel's request to confirm with Mr. Shepard that the  prosecutor had accurately represented Mr. Shepard's  unwillingness to speak with defense counsel. (Id. at 30.)  Defense counsel subsequently spoke with Mr. Shepard  but objected to the presence of a detective and the  prosecutor during the conversation. (Id. at 31.) Defense  counsel asked the trial court to direct the prosecutor to  permit a closed-door conversation [*10]  with the  witness, however, the prosecutor objected, stating that  defense counsel was not Mr. Shepard's lawyer, and Mr.  Shepard was the prosecutor's witness pursuant to a  material witness order signed by the trial court the  previous day. (Id. at 32.) The trial court ultimately  decided to allow the prosecutor to be present for  defense counsel's conversation with Mr. Shepard. (Id. at  Page 4 of 16 34.) Defense counsel objected to the condition and the  trial court acknowledged the objection. (Id.) Mr. Shepard testified at the trial following the dispute  over defense counsel being able to speak with him  alone. (Id. at 37.) Mr. Shepard testified that Petitioner  called him a few days after Thanksgiving in the early  morning hours from Mr. Wilson's cell phone number. (Id.  at 45-46.) Mr. Shepard testified that later that day,  following the call, he met Petitioner on DeKalb Avenue  in Brooklyn. (Id. at 45-47.) Mr. Shepard testified that  Petitioner arrived with three or four bags and explained  to Mr. Shepard that she and Mr. Wilson had an  altercation and that she was ""not going to pay rent and  fuck him too,"" and that she had ""poked"" him. (Id. at 47- 48.) Mr. Shepard testified that he was ""almost sure""  Petitioner [*11]  ""had a swelling up on her face, a little  bit,"" but did not see any blood on her. (Id. at 50.) Mr.  Shepard testified that he had had no further contact with  Petitioner after she left his apartment. (Id. at 51.) B. Trial Court's Exclusion of Victim's Medical  Records Also during the trial, on July 1, 2014, the trial court held  a Molineux hearing to discuss various evidentiary issues  raised by the parties. (Ex. 4, at 2.) Defense counsel  explained that he wanted to admit a certified copy of Mr.  Wilson's mental health medical records into evidence  and to call Mr. Wilson's physician to testify about the  use of Seroquel (which was not detected in Mr. Wilson's  toxicology report) and alcohol and their effects on  hallucinations. (Id. at 13-20.) Defense counsel explained  that Mr. Wilson's medical records would be used to  establish that Mr. Wilson had experienced hallucinations  in the past and was prescribed Seroquel. (Id. at 15-16.)  The trial court reviewed the records and declined to  admit the medical records, noting that that Mr. Wilson  was being treated for depression and not psychosis,  that there was no evidence that Mr. Wilson's reported  hallucinations were violent, that Mr. Wilson was  not [*12]  hearing voices, that there was no evidence  that Seroquel was prescribed to Mr. Wilson for  hallucinations or that failure to take Seroquel caused Mr.  Wilson to harm or want to harm Petitioner, and that  defense counsel was attempting to ""dirty the victim"" with  the evidence. (Id. at 13-17-20.) The trial court found that  Mr. Wilson was treated for depression and that the  defense theory was speculative, and that Petitioner  never told police that Mr. Wilson had been hallucinating.  (Id. at 15-20.) C. Defense Counsel's Motion to Dismiss At the close of the prosecution's case, defense counsel  moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the prosecution  failed to substantiate the crime of intentional murder in  the second degree. (Ex. 7, at 92-94.) The court denied  the defense counsel's motion to dismiss. (Id. at 96.) IV. Verdict and Sentence On July 10, 2014, the jury found Petitioner guilty of  murder in the second degree. (Ex. 7, at 220.) On  October 8, 2014, Petitioner was sentenced to 18 years  to life in prison for second-degree murder. (ECF No. 5- 6, Exhibit 6 to State's Opposition (""Ex. 6""), at 13.) PROCEDURAL HISTORY I. State-Murder Conviction Direct Appeal Petitioner, represented by counsel, appealed [*13]  her  conviction  to  the  Appellate  Division,  Second  Department, arguing that (1) the verdict was against the  weight of the evidence; (2) the trial court violated  Petitioner's right to due process, to present a defense,  and to the effective assistance of counsel in its decision  to allow the prosecutor to be present during defense  counsel's interview of Mr. Shepard; (3) the trial court  violated Petitioner's right to present a defense by  declining to admit Mr. Wilson's medical records and  medical testimony in evidence; (4) the trial court erred in  admitting Mr. Wilson's 911 call; (5) the trial court erred  by refusing to suppress Petitioner's July 26, 2012,  statement; and (6) the prosecutor's summation violated  Petitioner's right to a fair trial. (ECF No. 1-2 (""App. Div.  Appellant Brief""), at 3-4.) On August 29, 2018, the Appellate Division unanimously  affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence.  People v. Wisdom, 164 A.D.3d 928, 82 N.Y.S.3d 97 (2d  Dep't 2018). First, the Appellate Division concluded that  the prosecution's case was legally sufficient to disprove  the  defendant's  justification  defense  beyond  a  reasonable doubt and to establish the defendant's guilt  of murder in the second degree beyond a reasonable  doubt. Id. at 98. Second, the Appellate Division [*14]   agreed with the trial court's decision to deny  suppression of Petitioner's July 26, 2012, statement: After waiving her Miranda rights (see Miranda v.  Page 5 of 16 Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d  694), the defendant freely and voluntarily made a  videotaped statement at the police station on July  25, 2012, beginning at approximately 9:00 p.m. The  interview ended after approximately 30 minutes, not  because the defendant unequivocally invoked her  right to remain silent, but rather, to allow her to  compose herself. The idea for ending the interview  and stopping the videotape was that of the  Assistant  District  Attorney  (hereinafter  ADA)  conducting the interview. The ADA said, ""Let's stop  the tape for now,"" and ""there will be no further  questions until we resume the tape."" Questioning  resumed the following morning at approximately  10:00 a.m., at which time the defendant was  reminded of the rights she had been read the  previous day, and the defendant agreed to continue  answering more questions. During that session, the  defendant stated that after she stabbed the victim,  she took the victim's cell phone, keys, and wallet.  The wallet contained the victim's welfare benefit  card, but the defendant specifically denied ever  using the card. . . . The suppression [*15]  hearing testimony of a  detective who, in response to questions by defense  counsel that the defendant did not want to talk  anymore during the prior evening's videotaped  interview, answered, ""Right,"" and in another  instance said, ""Correct,"" does not require a different  result. This testimony does not change the fact that  there was no unequivocal invocation of the  defendant's right to remain silent at that time. The  suggestion that the detective's answers refer  instead to an unrecorded communication by the  defendant, despite the colloquy on the videotape  that there would be no further questioning until the  tape is resumed, is mere speculation and  conjecture that reads into the record information  that simply is not present, and provides no basis for  concluding  that  the  defendant's  10:00  a.m.  statement should have been suppressed. Id. at 98-99. Third, the Appellate Division agreed with  the trial court's determination to ""admit evidence of a  prior uncharged crime involving [Petitioner's] theft and  use of certain property that belonged to the victim, as it  completed the narrative and provided circumstantial  evidence of the date of the victim's death."" Id. at 99. The  Appellate Division found that the ""probative [*16]  value  of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect and the  court's limiting instruction was sufficient to avert any  potential prejudice."" Id. (citation omitted). Fourth, the  Appellate Division found that Petitioner's contention that  she was denied a fair trial by the admission of the 911  call was ""unpreserved for appellate review"" under N.Y.  Crim. Proc. Law § 470.05, but was nonetheless ""without  merit."" Id. Fifth, the Appellate Division found Petitioner's  contention that certain comments made by the  prosecutor during summation deprived her of a fair trial  was partially unpreserved for appellate review, but that  ""to the extent that the prosecutor exceeded the bounds  of permissible rhetorical comment or made other  improper remarks during summation, the remarks were  not so egregious as to have deprived the defendant of a  fair trial, and any other error in this regard was  harmless."" Id. at 100. Sixth, the Appellate Division found  that ""it was improper for the Supreme Court to condition  her ability to interview a prosecution witness upon the  interview occurring either in the presence of the  prosecutor or a detective"" but that ""the error was  harmless."" Id. Finally, the Appellate Division noted that  Petitioner's remaining [*17]  contention was ""without  merit."" Id. On February 14, 2019, the New York Court of Appeals  denied Petitioner's application for leave to appeal, in  which she raised the same arguments and incorporated  her briefs submitted to the Appellate Division. People v.  Wisdom, 32 N.Y.3d 1211, 99 N.Y.S.3d 227, 122 N.E.3d  1140 (N.Y. 2019) (Rivera, J.). II. Habeas Corpus Petition On May 14, 2020, Petitioner filed this petition, raising a  subset of the claims she raised on appeal: first, that the  trial court erred in refusing to suppress her July 26  statement and that the use of the statement prejudiced  her in trial, (Pet. at 42); second, that the trial court  violated her right to due process and to the effective  assistance of counsel by conditioning defense counsel's  ability to interview Mr. Shepard on the presence of  either a detective or prosecutor, (id. at 54); third, that the  trial court violated her right to present a defense by  declining to admit Mr. Wilson's medical records, (id. at  60); fourth, that the trial court violated her right to due  process by improperly admitting Mr. Wilson's 911 call at  trial, (id. at 72.). On  November  12,  2020,  Respondent  filed  a  memorandum of law in opposition to the petition. (State  Opp. at 1.) On January 13, 2021, Petitioner filed a reply  brief [*18]  in support of her petition. (ECF No. 7 (""Pet.  Reply""), at 1.) Page 6 of 16 STANDARD OF REVIEW The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of  1996 (""AEDPA"") requires a federal court reviewing a  state prisoner's habeas petition to give deference to a  state court's decision on the merits. 28 U.S.C. §  2254(d). A federal court may not issue a writ of habeas  corpus unless the state court's decision was ""contrary  to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly  established Federal law"" or was ""based on an  unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the  evidence presented in the State court proceeding."" Id.;  see also Johnson v. Williams, 568 U.S. 289, 292, 133 S.  Ct. 1088, 185 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2013); Chrysler v. Guiney,  806 F.3d 104, 116-17 (2d Cir. 2015). For the purposes of federal habeas review, ""clearly  established law"" means ""the holdings, as opposed to  the dicta, of [the Supreme] Court's decisions as of the  time of the relevant state-court decision."" Williams v.  Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed.  2d 389 (2000). A state court decision is ""contrary to"" or  an ""unreasonable application of"" clearly established law  if the decision: (1) is contrary to Supreme Court  precedent on a question of law; (2) arrives at a  conclusion different than that reached by the Supreme  Court on ""materially indistinguishable"" facts; or (3)  identifies  the  correct  governing  legal  rule  but  unreasonably applies it to the facts [*19]  of the  petitioner's case. Id. at 412-13. The court reviews the  last reasoned state court decision. Ylst v. Nunnemaker,  501 U.S. 797, 804, 111 S. Ct. 2590, 115 L. Ed. 2d 706  (1991); Jones v. Stinson, 229 F.3d 112, 118 (2d Cir.  2000). The state court's factual determinations are  presumed to be correct, and the petitioner bears the  burden of rebutting that presumption by clear and  convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1). ""In all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his  federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent  and adequate state procedural rule, federal habeas  review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can  demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice  as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or  demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result  in a fundamental miscarriage of justice."" Coleman v.  Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L.  Ed. 2d 640 (1991). A petitioner can seek federal habeas corpus relief only  after she exhausts state court remedies and gives the  state courts a fair and full opportunity to review the  merits of the claim. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1); O'Sullivan v.  Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 842, 119 S. Ct. 1728, 144 L.  Ed. 2d 1 (1999). In other words, a petitioner must  present ""the essential factual and legal premises of [her]  federal constitutional claim to the highest state court  capable of reviewing it."" Jackson v. Conway, 763 F.3d  115, 133 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting Rosa v. McCray, 396  F.3d 210, 217 (2d Cir. 2005)). DISCUSSION I. Refusal to Suppress the July 26 Statement Petitioner renews her claim that the trial court should  have suppressed her [*20]  statement made on July 26,  2012, because she invoked her right to remain silent,  and the questioning detective subsequently failed to  fully readminister her Miranda rights. (Pet. at 42.) The  Appellate Division's decision rejecting Petitioner's claim  that the July 26, 2012, statements should have been  suppressed is entitled to AEDPA deference, and  Petitioner must show that the state court's decision was  either ""contrary to, or involved an unreasonable  application of, clearly established Federal law"" or was  ""based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in  light of the evidence presented in the State court  proceeding."" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). For the foregoing reasons, this Court finds that the  Appellate Division's decision was consistent with clearly  established federal law and was based on a reasonable  determination of the facts in light of the evidence  presented, specifically, from the video transcript of  Petitioner's questioning on the evening of July 25, 2012.  (Ex. 4 at 176-78.) A. Invoking the Fifth Amendment It is well-settled law that when an individual in custody  has shown that they intend to invoke their Fifth  Amendment right to remain silent, the interrogation must  cease. Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U.S. 96, 100, 96 S. Ct.  321, 46 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1975) (citing Miranda v. Arizona,  384 U.S. 436, 473-74, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694  (1966)). This right is invoked when the individual [*21]   indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during  questioning, that they wish to remain silent. Id. In a  parallel line of cases, the Supreme Court held that an  individual must unambiguously and unequivocally  invoke their right to counsel to prevent further police  Page 7 of 16 questioning. Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452, 462,  114 S. Ct. 2350, 129 L. Ed. 2d 362 (1994) (explaining  that an individual in custody merely stating, ""[m]aybe I  should talk to a lawyer,"" is not a request for counsel.)  Subsequently, in Berghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U.S. 370,  130 S. Ct. 2250, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1098 (2010), the  Supreme Court clarified that this unambiguous standard  applies both to the invocation of an individual's right to  counsel and their right to remain silent. Id. at 381-82  (holding that had the petitioner stated ""that he wanted to  remain silent or that he did not want to talk with the  police . . . either of these simple, unambiguous  statements [] would have invoked his right to cut off  questioning""). Even prior to the Supreme Court's holding in Berghuis,  however, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals had  consistently required an unambiguous assertion of the  right to remain silent in cases where a defendant sought  to suppress statements made while in custody. In  United States v. Ramirez, 79 F.3d 298 (2d Cir. 1996),  the Second Circuit found that the defendant did not  unambiguously invoke his right to remain silent because  he continued [*22]  to answer questions by interrogating  officers after previously refusing to answer questions by  those officers. Id. at 303. In United States v. Plugh, 648  F.3d 118 (2d Cir. 2011), the only statements that the  defendant made to the interrogating officers were: ""I am  not sure if I should be talking to you,"" and ""I don't know  if I need a lawyer."" Id. at 121. In both cases, the Second  Circuit found that the statements did not expressly  invoke the defendant's right to counsel or right to remain  silent in a manner sufficient to cut off all further  questioning. Id. at 126; Ramirez, 79 F.3d at 303. Further, a court will assess the entire context of the  situation, including anything said by the Petitioner  before or after the statement that the petitioner alleges  invoked their right to remain silent. See Bradley v.  Meachum, 918 F.2d 338, 342 (2d Cir. 1990) (finding that  there was not an unambiguous invocation where the  petitioner stated he did not want to talk about the  alleged crime but continued to speak, denying the  officer's allegations and proffering explanations of his  whereabouts). Recently, a district court in the Eastern  District of New York applied the Berghuis standard to a  statement made by a defendant while in custody: ""I  don't want to talk and get myself into more trouble,  man."" See United States v. Ross, No. 21-CR-571 (BMC)  (LB), 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 169579, 2023 WL 6160436,  at  *10  (E.D.N.Y.  July  31,  2023),  report  and  recommendation adopted, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  169579, 2023 WL 6158840 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2023).  The court noted that [*23]  such a statement could have  been considered an unambiguous invocation of the right  to remain silent when considered alone, but that the  defendant continued to speak, stating: ""But I got a lot of  stuff going on. I don't know what the fuck is going on.  My whole life is fucked up."" Id. The court reasoned that  the defendant's subsequent statements turned what  may have been an unequivocal statement into an  ambiguous one. Id. As a result, the court found that the  defendant's statements were insufficient to invoke his  Fifth Amendment rights. 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 169579,  [WL] at *11. When an individual in custody unambiguously and  unequivocally invokes the right to remain silent, the  admissibility of statements obtained by questioning  officers after this invocation depends on whether their  ""right to cut off questioning"" was ""scrupulously honored.""  Mosley, 423 U.S. at 104. After the invocation of that  right, however, there is no ""per se proscription of  indefinite duration upon any further questioning by any  police officer on any subject"" with that individual. Id. at  102-03. Accordingly, the Second Circuit has held that  when a person has invoked the right to remain silent,  questioning can resume after new Miranda warnings  have been administered and the right to remain silent is  otherwise [*24]   scrupulously  honored.  Perkins  v.  Herbert, 596 F.3d 161, 174 (2d Cir. 2010). B. Whether Petitioner Invoked the Fifth Amendment In contending that her July 26, 2012, statements should  be suppressed, Petitioner argues that she invoked her  Fifth Amendment right to remain silent when, on July 25,  2012, she ""agreed during the [ADA's] videotaped  interview about the stabbing that she wanted to 'stop  right now.'"" (Pet. at 42.) Petitioner refers to language  from Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602,  16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), cited in Mosley, which states  that the invocation of the right to remain silent can be  done ""in any manner, at any time prior to or during  questioning."" (Pet. at 44.) Petitioner contends that her  invocation was sufficient because she ""did not remain  mute or express uncertainty about wanting to stop"" or         Page 8 of 16 ""merely request a break."" (Id. at 44-45.) Petitioner also  argues that because she invoked her right to remain  silent, the investigators were accordingly ""required to re- read her rights before questioning her again."" (Id. at 46.) This Court finds Petitioner's argument that she invoked  her right to remain silent unpersuasive. The statements  Petitioner made on July 25, 2012, cannot be read in  isolation from the actual context of the interrogation. The  video transcript referenced by the trial court reflects the  following [*25]  conversation after Petitioner became  emotional: QUESTION: You okay? You want to take a minute?  You want us to stop for a second or do you want to  continue? You want to stop for a second? [Petitioner]: All right. A.D.A. Purce: We're just going to hold out here for a  little bit. You just take your time, all right? [Petitioner]: All right. You know what, I think we're going to-we're going  to stop now, and if you want to continue, we'll talk in  a second, okay. You want us to stop right now? [Petitioner's] ANSWER: Yeah. A.D.A. Purce: All right, just stop the tape for now.  There will be no further questions until we resume  the tape. (Ex. 4 at 178-79.) Courts in this District have previously found an  individual's invocation of the Fifth Amendment to be  ambiguous where they merely display reticence to  answering  questions,  they  remain  silent,  they  equivocate in exercising their rights, or they indicate that  they may not want to continue speaking, but  nevertheless  continue  speaking  and  answering  questions. See Lopez v. Keyser, No. 19-CV-2655  (ARR), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 219311, 2020 WL  6873427, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 23, 2020) (determining  that under Berghuis, the petitioner's reticence to answer  questions did not invoke his right to remain silent); see  also Festus v. Noeth, No. 17-CV-3941 (JMA), 2020 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 224372, 2020 WL 7042666, at *11  (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 30, 2020) (reasoning that a petitioner's  silence did not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights,  especially in [*26]  light of the fact that the petitioner had  already waived his Miranda rights); Plugh, 648 F.3d at  125 (finding that although the petitioner refused to sign  a waiver of his Miranda rights, his concurrent     statements, such as ""I am not sure if I should be talking  to you,"" were too ambiguous to cut off further  questioning); Ross, 2023 WL 6160436, at *10-11  (finding that although the petitioner may have invoked  his right to silence, his actions in continuing to speak  with the questioning officers after doing so rendered his  invocation ambiguous). The Court finds that such  ambiguity also exists here. In this case, Petitioner waived her Miranda rights in  writing prior to speaking to officers during the July 25,  2012, questioning. (Ex. 4 at 168.) Further, Petitioner at  no point explicitly stated that she did not wish to speak  to the questioning officers any further. Rather, Petitioner  agreed with the ADA's suggestion to take a break and  resume questioning at a later time. (Id. at 178.) When  the ADA told Petitioner that ""there will be no further  questions until we resume the tape,"" Petitioner did not  object to continued questioning later. (Id. at 175.) The  next day, the questioning officer reminded Petitioner of  her Miranda rights and asked if she [*27]  wanted to  continue. (Id. at 175.) Petitioner agreed and continued  to answer questions. (Id. at 176.) Furthermore,  Petitioner does not suggest that she subsequently  invoked her Fifth Amendment rights at any point on July  26, 2012. Based  on  Petitioner's  mere  acquiescence  to  suggestions to pause questioning by the ADA, the fact  that she did not initiate the cessation in questioning  herself, and that after being reminded of her Miranda  rights administered the day before, she continued  answering questions the next day, a reasonable officer  would have understood only that the Petitioner agreed  to the ADA's suggested break from questioning at that  moment on July 25, 2012, and that it would resume at a  later time, not that she was unambiguously invoking her  right to remain silent. See Ramirez, 79 F.3d at 303  (when a suspect has ""waived [her] right to remain silent  and has answered some questions . . . [s]he must  articulate [her] desire to cut off questioning with  sufficient clarity that a reasonable police officer in the  circumstances would understand the statement to be  assertion of the right to remain silent"") (internal  quotation marks and citation omitted). Consequently,  this  Court  finds  that  the  Petitioner  did  not  unambiguously [*28]  invoke her right to remain silent  on July 25, 2012, and that the Appellate Division was  correct in finding no error in the trial court's decision to  admit the statement Petitioner made on July 26, 2012.  Because Petitioner's Miranda claim fails, it cannot be  the basis of federal habeas relief, and the Court  therefore denies habeas relief on this ground. Page 9 of 16 II. The Trial Court's Ruling Conditioning Defense  Counsel's Ability to Interview a Witness During Trial Petitioner asserts that the trial court erred when it  ""refused to allow defense counsel to interview [Witness  Matthew Shepard] alone."" (Pet. at 54.) Petitioner  contends that this interference violated ""[her] rights to  due process, to present a defense, and to the effective  assistance of counsel."" (Id.) The Appellate Division held  that ""it was improper for the [trial court] to condition  [Petitioner's] ability to interview a prosecution witness  upon the interview occurring either in the presence of  the prosecutor or a detective."" People v. Wisdom, 164  A.D.3d 928, 82 N.Y.S.3d 97, 100 (2d Dep't 2018).  Despite the fact that the condition was improper,  however, the Appellate Division found the error to be  harmless. Id. As such, the Appellate Division's merits- based decision rejecting the claim is entitled to [*29]   AEDPA deference and Petitioner must show that the  decision was ""contrary to, or involved an unreasonable  application of, clearly established Federal law"" or was  ""based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in  light of the evidence presented in the State court  proceeding."" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). A. Conditions on Access to Witnesses Second Circuit precedent clearly establishes that  ""constitutional notions of fair play and due process  dictate that defense counsel be free from obstruction,  whether it come from the prosecutor [or other officials]""  in  their  interviews  of  ""prospective  prosecution  witness[es]."" Int'l Bus. Machines Corp. v. Edelstein, 526  F.2d 37, 44 (2d Cir. 1975) (citing Coppolino v. Helpern,  266 F. Supp. 930, 935 (S.D.N.Y. 1967)); see also  United States v. Hyatt, 565 F.2d 229, 232 (2d Cir. 1977)  (""[W]e shall not tolerate the view that the government  has some special right or privilege to control access to  trial witnesses.""). Similarly, ""New York State courts have  consistently held that prosecutors may not refuse  defense  counsel  requests  for  interviews  with  prosecution witnesses, and that courts will enable these  interviews if necessary."" Schulz v. Marshall, 528 F.  Supp. 2d 77, 98 (E.D.N.Y. 2007), aff'd sub nom. Schulz  v. Marshal, 345 F. App'x 627 (2d Cir. 2009) (citing  several New York appellate and trial court decisions in  support). However, this right is not without limit, as courts are  permitted to, for example, limit the disclosure of the  identity or address of a confidential [*30]  informant pre- trial, unless their testimony is ""material to [the] defense.""  United States v. Saa, 859 F.2d 1067, 1073 (2d Cir.  1988); see also United States v. Heatley, 994 F. Supp.  483, 489 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (ordering the government to  disclose the identities of informants and cooperators to  the court a week before trial and make them available  for interviews as needed). Further, while not binding  authority from this Circuit, Respondent cites to a case  from the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in which a  court, confronted with facts similar to the instant case,  stated: Here, [defendant] does not allege that the  prosecution told [the witness] not to talk to  [defendant's] counsel or in any other way denied  [defendant] access to witnesses. Neither does  [defendant] allege that the Court in any way  prevented or limited his access to [the witness]  before or during trial, except at the moment she  was arriving to testify. Therefore, [defendant's]  argument that he was prevented from having a fair  opportunity  to  interview  [the  witness]  is  unpersuasive. United States v. Kemp, 379 F. Supp. 2d 690, 714 (E.D.  Pa. 2005), aff'd, 500 F.3d 257 (3d Cir. 2007) (trial  court's limitation on defense counsel's access to a  witness by requiring an FBI agent to be present to  protect the witness from harassment did not violate  defendant's constitutional rights). As such, not all  limitations on access to a witness prior [*31]  to or  during a trial necessarily constitute a constitutional  violation. B. Harmless Error On federal habeas review, unless the ""error 'had  substantial  and  injurious  effect  or  influence  in  determining the jury's verdict'"", a violation of a  petitioner's federal rights during her state criminal  proceeding is harmless. Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507  U.S. 619, 623, 113 S. Ct. 1710, 123 L. Ed. 2d 353  (1993) (quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S.  750, 776, 66 S. Ct. 1239, 90 L. Ed. 1557 (1946)). As  compared to direct review, a showing of harmlessness  on collateral review requires ""more than a 'reasonable  possibility' that the error was harmful."" Davis v. Ayala,  576 U.S. 257, 268, 135 S. Ct. 2187, 192 L. Ed. 2d 323  (2015) (quoting Brecht, 507 U.S. at 637). However, if a  ""conscientious judge [remains] in grave doubt about the  likely effect of an error on the jury's verdict"" — that is, ""in  the judge's mind, the matter is so evenly balanced that  [the judge] feels ... in virtual equipoise as to the  Page 10 of 16 harmlessness of the error,"" — then ""the uncertain judge  should treat the error, not as if it were harmless, but as if  it affected the verdict (i.e., as if it had a 'substantial and  injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's  verdict')."" O'Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, 435, 115  S. Ct. 992, 130 L. Ed. 2d 947, (1995) (quoting Brecht,  507 U.S. at 623). ""[I]n [section] 2254 proceedings[,] a  [federal] court must assess the prejudicial impact of  constitutional error in a state-court criminal trial under  the 'substantial and injurious effect' standard set forth in  Brecht, ... [*32]  whether or not the state appellate court  recognized the error and reviewed it for harmlessness  under the 'harmless beyond a reasonable doubt'  standard"" generally applicable on direct review. Fry v.  Pliler, 551 U.S. 112, 121-22, 127 S. Ct. 2321, 168 L. Ed.  2d 16, (2007) (quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U.S.  18, 24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967)). However, ""[w]hen a state court holds that a federal  constitutional violation tainted a defendant's trial but that  the violation as harmless"" the analysis of harmless error  becomes more complicated, as ""the state court has  adjudicated a constitutional claim on the merits."" Wilson  v. Capra, No. 15-CV-6495 (MKB), 2020 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 257587, 2020 WL 10506052, at *21 (E.D.N.Y.  Oct. 12, 2020), aff'd, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 28979,  2023 WL 7179268 (2d Cir. Nov. 1, 2023) (internal  quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, the  AEDPA prohibits habeas relief unless the state court's  adjudication on the merits was ""contrary to, or involved  an unreasonable application of, clearly established  Federal law"" or was ""based on an unreasonable  determination of the facts in light of the evidence  presented in the State court proceeding."" 28 U.S.C. §  2254(d). ""[A] state-court decision [finding a federal  constitutional violation harmless] is not unreasonable if  'fairminded jurists could disagree on [its] correctness.'""  Ayala, 576 U.S. at 269 (quoting Harrington v. Richter,  562 U.S. 86, 101, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d 624  (2011)). A federal court ""may not grant [a petitioner's]  habeas petition, however, if the state court simply erred  in concluding that the errors were harmless; rather,  habeas relief [*33]  is appropriate only if the [state court]  applied  harmless-error  review  in  an  'objectively  unreasonable' manner."" Mitchell v. Esparza, 540 U.S.  12, 18, 124 S. Ct. 7, 157 L. Ed. 2d 263 (2003) (per  curiam) (quoting Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U.S. 63, 75,  123 S. Ct. 1166, 155 L. Ed. 2d 144 (2003)). ""While a  federal habeas court need not formally apply both  Brecht and AEDPA/Chapman, AEDPA nevertheless  sets forth a precondition to the grant of habeas relief.""  Ayala, 576 U.S. at 268 (internal quotation marks  omitted) (citing Fry v. Pliler, 551 U.S. 112, 119-120, 127  S. Ct. 2321, 168 L. Ed. 2d 16, (2007)). C. Defense Counsel's Attempted Interview Petitioner argues that because ""the [trial] court refused  to allow defense counsel to interview [Mr. Shepard]  alone,"" her counsel ""was unable to effectively prepare to  defend  Petitioner  and  attacked  [Mr.]  Shepard's  credibility before [Mr.] Shepard unexpectedly revealed  petitioner's outcry."" (Pet. at 54.) The Court finds that the  trial court's condition on defense counsel's access to the  witness just prior to testimony was harmless error and  did not have a ""substantial and injurious effect or  influence in determining the jury's verdict."" Brecht, 507  U.S. at 623 In Petitioner's case, Mr. Shepard had been disclosed as  a witness and thus was not a surprise witness, defense  counsel was not restricted by the court or prosecutor  from contacting the witness prior to trial, and Petitioner  does not allege that the prosecutor did anything to  dissuade [*34]  Mr. Shepard from speaking with defense  counsel. (State Opp. at 55; Pet. at 54.) Rather, defense  counsel sought to speak to Mr. Shepard after he had  been held on a material witness order to testify, and the  trial court granted defense counsel's request to interview  Mr. Shepard. (Ex. 7 at 30.) Defense counsel stated that  Mr. Shepard was willing to speak with him, but defense  counsel objected to the presence of a detective in the  room. (Id. at 31.) Defense counsel acknowledged ""there  is a matter of security"" but stated he should be able to  interview Mr. Shepard alone due to the fact that the  room had ""three detectives standing outside"" and was  ""on the 21st floor of a building which you can only get  down in the elevators."" (Id.) The prosecution objected to  defense counsel interviewing Mr. Shepard without a  detective in the room on the grounds that defense  counsel was ""not [Mr. Shepard's] lawyer."" (Id. at 32.)  Ultimately, the trial court ruled that a detective should  ""stand outside with the door open so he can hear what  you do and say."" (Id. at 32.) Defense counsel again  objected after being prevented from speaking with Mr.  Shepard with the door closed, and the Court again  denied the defense [*35]  request, and stated that the  prosecutor could be present if she desired. (Id. at 34.)  Ultimately, defense counsel again returned to Mr.  Shepard and stated to the witness that he was not  allowed to speak to him privately and that they would  ""speak on the stand."" (Id. at 35.) Defense counsel told  the court that he ""think[s] it's objectionable and I would  move for a mistrial."" (Id.) The trial court responded that  defense counsel ""may be right"" regarding the legal  Page 11 of 16 principle regarding access to a witness but nonetheless  proceeded with the trial. (Id. at 35-36.) Petitioner is correct in contending that courts do ""not  tolerate the view that the government has some special  right or privilege to control access to trial witnesses.""  United States v. Hyatt, 565 F.2d 229, 232 (2d Cir.  1977). It is also true, however, that a court may exercise  discretion to protect witnesses from harassment  immediately prior to testimony, see United States v.  Kemp, 379 F. Supp. 2d 690, 714 (E.D. Pa. 2005), or  issue a court order preventing contact with a witness by  a defendant to prevent harassment and intimidation, see  United States v. Soape, 169 F.3d 257, 270-71 (5th Cir.  1999). It is not clear from the record why the trial court in the  instant case required the presence of a detective or the  prosecutor during a defense interview with Mr. Shepard,  or whether the trial court was motivated [*36]  to prevent  intimidation of a witness who had required a material  witness order to secure his testimony. Similarly, the trial  court did not state whether the presence of a detective  was necessary for the safety of defense counsel, or to  prevent flight by the witness. Nonetheless, even though  the Appellate Court found, and this Court agrees, that  the trial court's conditions were improper, this Court  does not find that the trial court's condition on defense  counsel's ability to question Mr. Shepard had a  substantial  and  injurious  effect  or  influence  in  determining the jury's verdict, Brecht, 507 U.S. at 623,  and does not find that the condition rises to the level of  a constitutional violation. The Appellate Division's  conclusion that the trial court's condition was improper  but a harmless error, People v. Wisdom, 164 A.D.3d  928, 82 N.Y.S.3d 97, 100 (2d Dep't 2018), is not ""an  unreasonable application of[] clearly established Federal  law"" and, as such, is entitled to AEDPA deference, 28  U.S.C. § 2254(d). Accordingly, assuming that the  condition was improper, this Court will turn to the  Appellate Division's conclusion that any error was  harmless under the standard set out by People v.  Crimmins, 36 N.Y.2d 230, 326 N.E.2d 787, 791, 367  N.Y.S.2d 213 (N.Y. 1975) (explaining the New York  state appellate standard of review for constitutional  errors—which  mirrors  Chapman's  beyond  a  reasonable [*37]   doubt  standard—and  non- constitutional errors—which requires a showing of a  ""significant probability"" of acquittal by the jury had it not  been for the error). The Court agrees with the Appellate Division that the  trial court's condition on defense counsel's interview of  Mr. Shepard was harmless error, to the extent it was  error. The prosecution disclosed Mr. Shepard's grand  jury testimony to Petitioner prior to trial, and listed Mr.  Shepard as a witness at the beginning of trial. (State  Opp. at 55.) As such, defense counsel knew that Mr.  Shepard would be testifying, and what the contents of  his testimony would likely be. Furthermore, defense  counsel conducted an extensive and successful cross- examination of Mr. Shepard, which elicited Mr.  Shepard's statement that Wilson ""tried to take it, tried to  force his self on [Petitioner]."" (Ex. 7 at 62-63.) Petitioner  argues here, as she did before the Appellate Division,  that defense counsel ""may have been able to elicit  additional exculpatory evidence, such as [P]etitioner's  exact words to [Mr.] Shepard, given a fair and  meaningful opportunity to interview [Mr.] Shepard."" (Pet.  at 58; see also App. Div. Appellant Brief at 54.)  However, Petitioner [*38]  does not proffer any further  ""additional exculpatory evidence"" that Mr. Shepard  might have provided, or explain how Mr. Shepard's  ""exact words"" would have made a meaningful difference  in proving her justification defense. Petitioner also argues that defense counsel ""surely  would have done things differently"" and would have  refrained from impeaching [Mr.] Shepard's credibility if  defense counsel had known [Mr.] Shepard would state  Wilson had tried to ""force"" himself on Petitioner. (Pet. at  59.) As noted by Petitioner, defense counsel elicited Mr.  Shepard's criminal history and reminded Mr. Shepard  that he told ""[the D.A.] that you weren't paying attention  to what [Petitioner] was telling you."" (Ex. 7 at 57-61.)  However, defense counsel's cross-examination of Mr.  Shepard was not focused solely on impeaching Mr.  Shepard, but was also focused on eliciting evidence  supporting Petitioner's justification defense. Shortly after  impeaching Mr. Shepard, defense counsel asked  ""[Petitioner] did tell you she was hit by Anthony [Wilson],  right?"" (Id. at 61.) Subsequently, defense counsel asked  if ""[Petitioner told] you that Anthony [Wilson] tried to  rape her at that time?"" (Id. at 62.) Defense  counsel [*39]  clearly intended to use-and did use-his  cross-examination not just to impeach Mr. Shepard, but  also to elicit information that would be helpful to  Petitioner's justification defense. Immediately afterward,  defense counsel appeared quite pleased with the result  of that cross-examination, as well, noting that ""based  upon the testimony we heard this morning . . .  [Petitioner] has decided not to testify."" (Id. at 91.)  Defense counsel continued, stating that ""[w]e felt that  [Mr. Shepard] was a very strong witness for [Petitioner].""  (Id.) Page 12 of 16 In light of the facts of this case, the Court finds that the  Appellate Division was not unreasonable in deeming  any error related to defense counsel's access to Mr.  Shepard harmless. Defense counsel was able to elicit  information helpful to Petitioner on cross-examination,  and there is no evidence that further helpful information  might have been uncovered in a private interview of Mr.  Shepard just prior to his testimony. Furthermore, any  strategic error regarding impeachment of Mr. Shepard  was harmless. Though Mr. Shepard did offer testimony  helpful to the defense, he also offered testimony that  corroborated the prosecution's version of events, stating  that [*40]  ""[Petitioner] said, I'm not paying rent and  fucking him . . . [s]he said she poked him."" (Id. at 48.) As  such, a decision by defense counsel not to impeach Mr.  Shepard would also have carried strategic risks, given  his importance to the prosecution's case. Taken  together, the Court finds that to the extent there was an  error in conditioning defense counsel's access to Mr.  Shepard on the day of trial, it did not have a ""substantial  and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's  verdict."" Brecht, 507 U.S. at 623. Accordingly, the  Appellate Division's holding was not unreasonable, and  is entitled to AEDPA deference. III. The Trial Court's Decision to Admit the 911 Call  and Preclude Use of Mr. Wilson's Medical Records Petitioner contends that the trial court deprived her of  her right to a fair trial and to present a defense by  preventing defense counsel from admitting Mr. Wilson's  medical records relating to his mental health. (Pet. at  60-62.) Petitioner argues she was entitled to present  evidence showing Mr. Wilson was ""quarrelsome,  vindictive, or violent"" to demonstrate her state of mind.  (Id. at 61.) She also argues that she was entitled to  introduce documentary evidence-Mr. Wilson's medical  records-proving [*41]   Mr.  Wilson  was  exhibiting  aberrant behavior sufficient to cause fear and warrant a  forceful response. (Id. at 62.) Finally, Petitioner argues  that by preventing her counsel from cross-examining the  medical examiner, Mr. Wilson's sister, and Mr. Wilson's  friend about Mr. Wilson's psychiatric prescription and  substance abuse, her right to confrontation was  ""improperly curtailed."" (Id. at 67.) Petitioner also contends that the state court violated her  right to a fair trial by improperly admitting Mr. Wilson's  statements made in a 911 call under the present sense  impression exception to the rule against hearsay. (Id. at  72.) Petitioner argues that the call was inadmissible for  lack of contemporaneity and corroboration as required  under New York State Law, and further alleges that the  admission of the call into evidence removed reasonable  doubt that would have otherwise existed on the record,  resulting in the deprivation of a fundamentally fair trial.  (Id. at 73-78.) The Appellate Division dismissed Petitioner's claims  regarding the admission of medical records and cross- examination of witnesses as ""without merit."" People v.  Wisdom, 164 A.D.3d 928, 82 N.Y.S.3d 97, 100 (2d Dep't  2018). Regarding the admission of the 911 call, the  Appellate  Division  found  the [*42]   contention  ""unpreserved for appellate review"" but nonetheless  agreed with the trial court's ""determination to admit the  recording  under  the  present  sense  impression""  exception to the hearsay rule on the merits. Id. at 99.  The Appellate Division's merits-based decision rejecting  both claims is entitled to AEDPA deference, and as  such, Petitioner must show that the decision was  ""contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,  clearly established Federal law"" or was ""based on an  unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the  evidence presented in the State court proceeding."" 28  U.S.C. § 2254(d). A. Review of Trial Court Evidentiary Rulings Under  AEDPA In reviewing a habeas petition pursuant to the AEDPA,  courts in this Circuit have found that the ""unreasonable  application of the law"" prong cannot be satisfied by  showing a ruling was ""merely . . . incorrect or  erroneous."" Delancy v. Lee, No. 15-CV-891 (RRM)  (CLP), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 192295, 2019 WL  9051134 at *14 (citing Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362,  409-411, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2000)).  Rather, the ruling must be so unreasonable that it is  impossible for fair-minded jurists to disagree that it was               Page 13 of 16 in violation of Supreme Court precedent. Harrington v.  Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 101, 131 S. Ct. 770, 178 L. Ed. 2d  624 (2011). This is an intentionally high standard, as the  purpose of habeas relief is to ""guard against extreme  malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems, not a  substitute [*43]  for ordinary error correction."" Id. at 102  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Where a petitioner alleges an incorrect evidentiary ruling  at trial, this Court must first ascertain whether the state  court ruling was proper under state law; if the ruling  correctly applied the state evidentiary rule, there is no  constitutional violation. Delancey, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  192295, 2019 WL 9051134, at *17. Second, if this Court  finds the evidentiary ruling was made in error, it must  determine whether the error violated a constitutional  right. Id. For a ruling to rise to such a level, the error  must have deprived petitioner of a fundamentally fair  trial. Collins v. Scully, 755 F.2d 16, 18 (2d Cir. 1985).  Courts have clarified that such deprivation occurs when  the error in question has removed reasonable doubt that  was otherwise present in the context of the entire  record. Rosario v. Kuhlman, 839 F.2d 918, 925 (2d Cir.  1988) (citing United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 112- 13, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 49 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1976)). B. Admissibility of a Decedent's Mental Health  Records Under New York evidence law ""a defendant, in a  prosecution for homicide, may introduce evidence that  the deceased had a reputation as a 'quarrelsome,  vindicative or violent' person, provided that the  defendant was aware of this reputation at the time of the  incident."" People v. Miller, 39 N.Y.2d 543, 349 N.E.2d  841, 845, 384 N.Y.S.2d 741 (N.Y. 1976). However, this  is only applicable to the admission of medical records  when it can be shown the accused [*44]  had  knowledge of the decedent's psychiatric history at the  time of confrontation. People v. Trivette, 175 A.D.2d  330, 572 N.Y.S.2d 85, 87 (3d Dep't 1991). Without  establishing that the medical records are relevant to the  defendant's state of mind at the time of the  confrontation, medical records relating to the mental  health of the decedent are inadmissible. People v.  Adams, 272 A.D.2d 953, 708 N.Y.S.2d 766, 767 (4th  Dep't 2000). This applies to other forms of documentary  proof as well; ""[e]vidence of a conviction for a violent act  is, of course, acceptable documentary evidence that  would support the defendant's contention, provided he  was aware of the conviction at the time of the incident.""  Miller, 349 N.E.2d at 848. An exception to this rule  exists for toxicology reports of the decedent showing  use of intoxicants at time of death, which are admissible  regardless of the accused's knowledge. People v.  Chevalier, N.Y.S.2d 508, 509 (1st Dep't 1996), aff'd, 681  N.E.2d 1292 (N.Y. 1997). C. The Trial Court's Preclusion of Mr. Wilson's  Medical Records At trial, defense counsel sought to admit evidence of Mr.  Wilson's psychiatric health and past substance abuse,  requesting to: ""put a certified copy of [Mr. Wilson's medical]  records into evidence which will show what he said  to the doctor... if I don't have that physician, I want  to put on my expert, Dr. Siegel, he will -- who  can [*45]  talk about psychosis. I can ask him what  drugs are given for psychosis and he would  undoubtedly say he gives some of them and  Seroquel."" (Ex. 4 at 13, 14). The trial court denied counsel's  request, calling counsel's argument ""an inference and  then an inference upon an inference"". (Id. at 14). The  trial court further disagreed with defense counsel's  suggestion that the medical records showed that Mr.  Wilson was psychotic, finding after court review of the  medical records that Mr. Wilson's diagnosis was  ""depressive."" (Id. at 15.) Defense counsel subsequently  argued that it was possible that Mr. Wilson's failure to  take Seroquel might have caused him to have  hallucinations, or to attack Petitioner. (Id. at 16). The  trial court again found defense counsel's argument to be  speculative and stated that Mr. Wilson's medical records  did not show any evidence of violence or violent  hallucinations. (Id. at 16-17.) Ultimately, the trial court  ruled that defense counsel had ""no evidence at all that  the failure to take the Seroquel caused [Mr. Wilson] to  harm or want to harm [Petitioner]"" and thus the medical  records were not admissible. (Id. at 20). Under New York law, the only proper purpose for [*46]   which the records in question could be admitted by the  trial court would have been to illustrate an underlying  condition that Petitioner was aware of, and the impact of  that awareness on Petitioner's state of mind. See  People v. Miller, 39 N.Y.2d 543, 349 N.E.2d 841, 845,  384 N.Y.S.2d 741 (N.Y. 1976). Accordingly, what is  pertinent is whether Petitioner had actual knowledge of  Mr. Wilson's psychiatric history. This court finds no  evidence in the record indicating as much. Petitioner  argues that Mr. Wilson kept prescription bottles in plain  Page 14 of 16 view, asserting that ""[Petitioner] undoubtedly was []  aware of Wilson's psychiatric issues, given that she had  been living with him for about a month . . . ."" (Pet. at 63).  This argument, however, falls short of the required  factual support in the record; no evidence was  presented to the trial court that Petitioner observed Mr.  Wilson's medication or medical records, much less  researched the information on the bottles to ascertain  the myriad of psychiatric conditions Seroquel is  prescribed to treat. Furthermore, evidence admitted at  trial showed that the ""pill bottles [] were recovered from  under the bed,"" as opposed to being in plain sight. (Ex.  2 at 180.) Similarly, Petitioner's statement to police that  Mr. Wilson was saying [*47]  ""crazy shit,"" (id.), is not  sufficient to show prior knowledge of Mr. Wilson's  psychiatric history, both because it generally refers to  Mr. Wilson's statements during the altercation as  opposed to beforehand, and because it is ambiguous  enough that it simply indicates Mr. Wilson was saying  things Petitioner found disagreeable, rather than  reflective of an abnormal mental state. Petitioner asserts in the alternative, that the trial court  should have admitted Mr. Wilson's psychiatric records  into evidence in order to impeach his character, claiming  that the State put his character at issue when relying on  Mr. Wilson's statements made during his call to  emergency services. (Pet. at 65). Upon review of the  trial record, this court cannot identify any point at which  the argument regarding impeaching Mr. Wilson's  character was raised, and as such this argument was  not properly preserved under C.P.L. § 470.05(2).  However, the Appellate Division plainly stated its  intention to address the argument on its merits  regardless. See People v. Wisdom, 164 A.D.3d 928, 82  N.Y.S.3d 97, 100 (2d Dep't 2018) (""The defendant's  remaining contention is without merit.""). This court is  therefore obliged to contend with the substance of the  Petitioner's  argument,  rather  than  finding  it  procedurally [*48]  barred. See Jones v. Stinson, 229  F.3d 112, 118 (2d Cir. 2000) (""[W]e follow the  presumption established by the Supreme Court and ask  not what we think the state court actually might have  intended but whether the state court plainly stated its  intention.""). In evaluating the merits of the argument  regarding use of the medical records for impeachment,  this court finds that the Appellate Division was correct in  finding no error in the trial court's decision to exclude  Mr. Wilson's mental health records. Under New York law, it is recognized that mental health  history, including evidence of a history of delusions, is  particularly probative of a witness' credibility. People v.  Rensing, 14 N.Y.2d 210, 199 N.E.2d 489, 491, 250  N.Y.S.2d 401 (N.Y. 1964). However, the party seeking  to admit such evidence must have a ""good faith basis  for believing that the witness' mental condition affected  a material issue in the case, for example, [the witness']  ability to perceive or remember."" People v. Knowell, 94  A.D.2d 255, 464 N.Y.S.2d 525, 529 (2d Dep't 1983).  New York state courts typically only find an abuse of  discretion in precluding evidence of a witness' mental  health history when there is substantial, undisputed,  documentation of a testifying witness' mental illness,  such  as  multiple  hospitalizations,  diagnosis  as  paranoiac or schizophrenic, or involuntary commitment.  See  Rensing,  199  N.E.2d  at  491  (court,  in  reversing [*49]  conviction and granting a new trial, held  that the jury should have been made aware that a key  witness experienced, inter alia, ""visual and auditory  hallucinations with marked memory defect"" and had  been diagnosed with ""Paranoid Schizophrenia""); see  also People v. Knowell, 127 A.D.2d 794, 512 N.Y.S.2d  190, 192 (2d Dep't 1987) (finding that a court erred in  refusing to conduct an in camera inspection of  psychiatric records of a witness who ""had a lengthy  history of psychiatric problems, had been confined in  mental hospitals on several occasions in the recent past  and had been diagnosed as paranoiac""). These  circumstances simply do not exist in the instant case. Mr. Wilson's medical records, reviewed by the trial court,  spanned a three-month period - from September 6,  2011, through November 26, 2011. (ECF 1-7 (""Pet. Ex.  H"") at 11, 22.) Mr. Wilson was originally referred for  substance abuse treatment but was given a psychiatric  evaluation as part of his intake to the Chemical  Dependency program. (Id. at 11-14.) As later noted by  the medical provider who examined him, Mr. Wilson was  diagnosed with ""Major Depressive Disorder"" and was  taking ""Seroquel, Benadryl, and Prozac while enrolled in  [the] clinic."" (Id. at 23.) The medical provider also stated  in her notes [*50]  from her psychiatric evaluation that  Mr. Wilson ""[n]otes hallucinations to harm self or  others."" (Id. at 14). However, the medical provider also  noted that Mr. Wilson had ""no gross cognitive deficits,  [d]enie[d] both suicidal and homicidal ideation, [and  was] alert and oriented to time, place, and person."" (Id.)  Mr. Wilson was not diagnosed with a mental illness such  as paranoid schizophrenia, and no other annotations  regarding delusions, violence, or his ability to accurately  perceive events are present in his medical records.  Furthermore, Petitioner does not offer any evidence to  suggest that Mr. Wilson exhibited any hallucinatory  behavior in the month she lived with him, or on the night  when he called 911 on November 29, 2011, or that she  Page 15 of 16 was aware of his psychiatric evaluation. Accordingly, the  instant case is distinguishable from precedent cited by  Petitioner and noted above. As such, this court cannot  find that the trial court acted unreasonably in excluding  evidence of Mr. Wilson's mental health records for  purposes of impeachment. Considering Petitioner's  claim under the standards set out by the AEDPA, the  Court finds that the Appellate Division's rejection of this  claim  on [*51]   appeal  was  not  an  objectively  unreasonable  application  of  existing  federal  constitutional principles, and Petitioner's claim regarding  her right to present a defense is denied. D. New York State's Present Sense Impression  Exception For hearsay to be admissible under the present sense  impression exception under New York state evidence  law, a statement must be (1) ""made while the declarant  was perceiving the event or condition, or immediately  thereafter"" and must be accompanied by (2) ""some  independent verification of the declarant's descriptions  of the unfolding events."" People v. Vasquez, 88 N.Y.2d  561, 670 N.E.2d 1328, 1334, 647 N.Y.S.2d 697 (N.Y.  1996). The New York Court of Appeals has emphasized  that the level and nature of the corroboration required  ""will depend on the particular circumstances of each  case and must be left largely to the sound discretion of  the trial court."" People v. Brown, 80 N.Y.2d 729, 610  N.E.2d 369, 374, 594 N.Y.S.2d 696 (N.Y. 1993). The  inquiry must determine ""whether the corroboration  offered to support admission of the statement truly  serves to support its substance and content."" Vasquez,  670 N.E.2d at 1335. Brown serves as an example,  where  apprehension  of  a  suspect  matching  a  description in a 911 call was found to be sufficient  corroboration to admit the underlying 911 call. 610  N.E.2d at 374. New York courts have observed that  ""[t]he 'present sense impression' [*52]  exception has  been utilized mainly to introduce 911 calls made by  either the victim or witnesses while they observe events  as they are unfolding."" People v. Semple, 174 Misc. 2d  879, 666 N.Y.S.2d 900, 902 (Sup. Ct. 1997) (citing  People v. Hughes, 228 A.D.2d 618, 645 N.Y.S.2d 493  (2d Dep't 1996) and People v. Cook, 220 A.D.2d 522,  632 N.Y.S.2d 193 (2d Dep't 1995)). Once a New York trial court finds that the hearsay  statement qualifies for admission under the present  sense impression exception, it retains discretion to  refuse to admit the evidence if ""its probative value is  substantially outweighed by the danger that it will  unfairly prejudice the other side or mislead the jury.""  People v. Scarola, 71 N.Y.2d 769, 525 N.E.2d 728, 732,  530 N.Y.S.2d 83 (N.Y. 1988). As such, the decision to  admit evidence that satisfies the present sense  impression exception to hearsay is also reviewable by  the Appellate Division for abuse of discretion. People v.  Smith, 22 N.Y.3d 462, 982 N.Y.S.2d 809, 5 N.E.3d 972,  974 (N.Y. 2013) (stating that a court retains discretion  regarding excluding otherwise admissible evidence  ""when it reasonably finds that evidence to be more  prejudicial than probative""). E. The Trial Court's Ruling during the Molineux  Hearing Defense counsel objected to the admission of the 911  call during a Molineux hearing on the basis that it failed  to satisfy both requirements of the present sense  impression exception under New York State law, and  that its prejudicial effect would outweigh its probative  value. (Ex. 2 at 3, 6.) Specifically, defense [*53]   counsel argued: ""During the evening of this call we actually don't  know when this man is killed. Time of death was  never set, the date itself was never set. We don't  know what it refers to, whether it refers to this  incident or something else, and so absent any  background or testimony, it is just this man calling.  We don't know if there's an upsetment, an  intervening event, things calm down and something  happened. It's significant, there's nothing on the call  like look out or ouch or hearing anything, it  essentially just cuts off with that . . ."" (Id. at 3-4). The prosecutor responded that both medical  evidence and Mr. Wilson's phone records indicated that  the call was made shortly before his death, and that  phone records also showed Petitioner began using Mr.  Wilson's phone shortly after the 911 call was made. (Id.  at 4-5.) Specifically, the prosecution argued that Mr. Wilson's  phone was used to call a witness, Matthew Shepard,  following the 911 call, and that when Mr. Shepard  answered the call, expecting Mr. Wilson, it was  Petitioner calling. (Id. at 4.) The prosecution further  argued that Petitioner subsequently made ""third-party  admissions"" to Mr. Shepard that she was not going  to [*54]  give Mr. Wilson money and have sex with him,  and subsequently ""poked"" Mr. Wilson as a result. (Id. at  4-5.) Continuing, the prosecutor noted that the medical  examiner would be able to corroborate that the time of  Page 16 of 16 death was close in proximity to the time of the 911 call.  (Id. at 5.) After further argument from defense counsel  that there may have been intervening actions between  the call and the stabbing, the trial court ultimately ruled  that Mr. Wilson's call was admissible hearsay under the  present sense impression exception. (Id. at 6.) This Court finds that the trial court was not  unreasonable in its determination that Mr. Wilson's  statements were adequately contemporaneous and  corroborated. First, the trial court properly considered  extrinsic evidence that established the time of the call in  relation to Mr. Wilson's stabbing based on the proffered  medical examiner's evidence, as well as subsequent  phone calls from Mr. Wilson's phone that matched the  petitioner's pattern of phone calls from her own cell  phone in establishing the contemporaneity of the  statements. (Id. at 4-5). Furthermore, based on the  prosecution's characterization of Mr. Wilson's word  choices in describing the perceived [*55]  behavior on  the 911 call as occurring while he was speaking, the trial  court admitted the 911 call as a present sense  impression exception to the hearsay rule. (Id. at 2-4.)  The record sufficiently establishes that Mr. Wilson's  statements were made while the described event was  taking place. With respect to corroboration of the call's substance, the  trial  court  properly  considered  petitioner's  later  statements to Mr. Shepard, in which she acknowledged  that an argument took place between her and Mr.  Wilson. (Id. at 4-5.) Mr. Shepard's later testimony on the  stand confirmed that this corroboration occurred. (Ex. 7  at 47-48.) Moreover, Petitioner admitted during her July  26, 2012, interview that she took Mr. Wilson's cell phone  after she stabbed him. (Ex. 4 at 165-66.) This totality of  evidence  adequately  corroborates  Mr.  Wilson's  statements through independent means, as required  under New York law regarding the present sense  impression. Finally, this court does not find persuasive Petitioner's  claims that Mr. Wilson's statements were overly  prejudicial and should have been excluded. Once  properly admitted under the present sense impression  exception to hearsay, Mr. Wilson's statements [*56]   would have been admissible for the truth of the matter  asserted. Whether or not Petitioner was indeed ""acting  crazy"" shortly prior to Mr. Wilson's death would have  been highly probative of the veracity of her justification  defense. Furthermore, the fact that Mr. Wilson, the  declarant,  was  unavailable  weighs  in  favor  of  admissibility of the statement. See People v. Buie, 86  N.Y.2d 501, 658 N.E.2d 192, 195, 634 N.Y.S.2d 415  (N.Y. 1995) (holding that ""the present sense impression  exception does not require a showing of the declarant's  unavailability as a sine qua non to admissibility,""  although the trial judge may weigh the declarant's  availability in the ""traditional probativeness versus  undue prejudice calculus"" for determining admissibility). Based on the foregoing, this Court finds that the trial  court's decision to admit Mr. Wilson's 911 call was a  correct evidentiary ruling under New York State's  present sense impression exception to hearsay.  Accordingly, the Appellate Division's decision upholding  the  trial  court's  ruling  was  not  an  objectively  unreasonable  application  of  existing  federal  constitutional principles and Petitioner's due process  claim is denied.",0
"Woodhull Freedom Found. v. United States, 72 F.4th 1286","[*1292]  M, Circuit Judge: In 2018, Congress  enacted the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online  Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 (commonly referred to as  ""FOSTA""). Pub. L. No. 115-164, 132 Stat. 1253 (2018)  (codified [**2]  as amended in 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(e),  1595, 2421A and 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)). Section  2421A(a) of FOSTA makes it a felony to ""own[],  manage[],  or  operate[]""  an  interactive  computer  service—for example, a website, chat room, or search  engine—""with the intent to promote or facilitate the  prostitution of another person[.]"" 18 U.S.C. § 2421A(a).  Section  2421A(b),  in  turn,  denominates  as  an  aggravated offense a violation of Section 2421A(a) that  either ""promotes or facilitates the prostitution of 5 or  more persons"" or is ""in reckless disregard of the fact  that such conduct contributed to sex trafficking"" in  Page 2 of 13 violation of Section 1591(a) of the Trafficking Act. Id. §  2421A(b). FOSTA also subjects the providers of those computer  services to liability in civil and state-law criminal actions  for any third-party content they publish that violates 18  U.S.C. § 2421A or the Trafficking Victims Protection Act  of 2000 (""Trafficking Act""), Pub. L. No. 106-386, 114  Stat. 1466 (codified as amended in various Sections of  8, 18, and 22 of the United States Code), denying them  an immunity from lawsuits that is otherwise generally  accorded to computer service providers under 47 U.S.C.  § 230. FOSTA withholds immunity regardless of  whether the outlawed conduct occurred before, on, or  after FOSTA's enactment. 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5) & note. Finally, FOSTA adds a new definitional provision to the  Trafficking Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(4), and authorizes  parens patriae suits by States against persons who  violate that same Act's prohibition of sex trafficking, id. §  1595(d). The Woodhull Freedom Foundation [**3]  and four other  plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of FOSTA on  numerous grounds, but the district court upheld FOSTA  in full. We affirm. Neither Section 2421A of FOSTA nor  FOSTA's amendments to the Trafficking Act are  overbroad  or  unconstitutionally  vague.  FOSTA's  clarification that Section 230 withholds immunity for  violations of federal sex trafficking laws comports with  the First Amendment. And the district court correctly  dismissed  the  challenge  to  Section  230(e)(5)'s  retroactive application. I A For decades, Congress has worked to protect minors  online while promoting free speech over the Internet. In  1996, Congress enacted the Communications Decency  Act, Pub. L. No. 104-104, Title V, 110 Stat. 56, 133-143  (codified in various Sections of 18 and 47 of the United  States Code), which prohibited the online transmission  of obscene and indecent speech. See 47 U.S.C. §  223(a); see generally Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844,  858-861, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 138 L. Ed. 2d 874 (1997). As relevant here, the Communications Decency Act had  twin aims. On the one hand, it sought to protect minors  by shielding them from exposure to sexually explicit  materials posted online. See Woodhull Freedom Found.  v. United States, 948 F.3d 363, 367, 445 U.S. App. D.C.  111 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (""Woodhull II""). The Supreme Court  ultimately struck down that portion of the Act on  overbreadth grounds because it ""lack[ed] the precision  that the First Amendment requires when a statute  regulates the content of speech."" Reno v. ACLU, 521  U.S. at 874.  [*1293]  At the same time, the Act shields interactive  computer services from liability for speech posted [**4]   on their sites. Congress did so to ""promote the  continued development of the Internet and other  interactive computer services"" and to ""preserve the  vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists  for the Internet and other interactive computer  services[.]"" 47 U.S.C. §§ 230(b)(1)-(2). To that end,  Section 230 of the Act immunizes providers of such  computer services—like YouTube, Facebook, and  Craigslist—from liability for content that is posted on  their sites by third parties. Id. § 230(c)(1). Congress, though, limited Section 230's grant of  immunity to conduct that does not independently violate  federal criminal law. 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(1). One such  law is the Trafficking Act, which broadly outlaws sex  trafficking. In 2003, Congress authorized survivors of  sex trafficking to file civil actions for violations of the  Trafficking  Act.  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-193, 117  Stat. 2875 (codified as amended in 18 U.S.C. § 1595). Nevertheless, when sex-trafficking survivors attempted  to sue the publishers of online classified advertising that  allegedly helped their traffickers avoid detection, the  lawsuits failed because courts found the publishers to  be immune from liability under Section 230 for the third- party speech posted on their sites. See Woodhull II, 948  F.3d at 367-368 (detailing Section 230's role in  preventing lawsuits by survivors of sex trafficking). B Congress  enacted  FOSTA  to  strengthen [**5]   protections against online sex trafficking. In doing so,  Congress underscored that Section 230 of the  Communications Decency Act ""was never intended to     Page 3 of 13 provide legal protection to websites that unlawfully  promote and facilitate prostitution"" or to ""websites that  facilitate traffickers in advertising the sale of unlawful  sex acts with sex trafficking victims[.]"" 47 U.S.C. § 230  note. Congress added that ""websites that promote and  facilitate prostitution have been reckless in allowing the  sale of sex trafficking victims and have done nothing to  prevent the trafficking of children and victims of force,  fraud, and coercion[.]"" Id. FOSTA, Congress explained,  was designed to make clear that Section 230 does not  cloak ""such websites"" with immunity. Id. As relevant here, FOSTA changed the law in four ways. First, FOSTA amended Section 1591 of the Trafficking  Act to define what it means to ""participat[e] in a  venture."" 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(4). Since 2015, Section  1591(a)(2) of the Trafficking Act has proscribed  knowingly ""benefit[ing], financially or by receiving  anything of value, from participation in a venture which  has  engaged  in""  recruiting,  enticing,  harboring,  transporting,  providing,  obtaining,  advertising,  maintaining, patronizing, or soliciting a person, while knowing, or, except where the act * * * is  advertising, in reckless disregard of the fact, [**6]   that means of force, threats of force, fraud, [or]  coercion * * * will be used to cause the person to  engage in a commercial sex act, or that the person  [is under] the age of 18 and will be caused to  engage in a commercial sex act[.] Id. § 1591(a)(2). FOSTA clarified Section 1591(a)(2)'s reach by defining  ""participation in a venture"" as ""knowingly assisting,  supporting,  [*1294]  or facilitating a violation of  subsection  (a)(1)[,]""  which  criminalizes  active  participation in sex trafficking. 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(4).  Putting the two together, Section 1591(a)(2) now  provides: Whoever knowingly— * * * benefits, financially or by  receiving anything of value, from [knowingly  assisting, supporting, or facilitating a violation of  subsection (a)(1)] knowing, or, except where the act  constituting the violation of paragraph (1) is  advertising, in reckless disregard of the fact, that  means of force, threats of force, fraud, coercion  described in subsection (e)(2), or any combination  of such means will be used to cause the person to  engage in a commercial sex act, or that the person  has not attained the age of 18 years and will be  caused to engage in a commercial sex act, shall be  punished as provided in subsection (b). See id. §§ 1591(a)(2), (e)(4). Second, FOSTA amended Section 1595 of Title 18 by  authorizing States' attorneys general to bring civil  actions against those who violate [**7]  Section 1591.  18 U.S.C. § 1595(d). Third, FOSTA created Section 2421A of Title 18, a  brand-new felony offense. In relevant part, that provision  states: (a) In General.—Whoever, using a facility or means  of interstate or foreign commerce or in or affecting  interstate or foreign commerce, owns, manages, or  operates an interactive computer service (as such  term is defined in * * * 47 U.S.C. 230(f))[], or  conspires or attempts to do so, with the intent to  promote or facilitate the prostitution of another  person shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for  not more than 10 years, or both. (b) Aggravated Violation.—Whoever, using a  facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce  or in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce,  owns,  manages,  or  operates  an  interactive  computer service (as such term is defined in * * * 47  U.S.C. 230(f))[], or conspires or attempts to do so,  with the intent to promote or facilitate the  prostitution of another person and— (1) promotes or facilitates the prostitution of 5  or more persons; or (2) acts in reckless disregard of the fact that  such conduct contributed to sex trafficking, in  violation of 1591(a), shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for not  more than 25 years, or both. 18 U.S.C. §§ 2421A(a)-(b). As used in Section 2421A, ""interactive computer  service[s]"" are [**8]  online platforms that ""provide[] or  enable[] computer access by multiple users to a  computer server[.]"" 47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(2). (Going  forward, we will refer to interactive computer services  more colloquially as ""online platforms."") Section 2421A(a) makes it a felony, punishable by up to  ten years of imprisonment, to ""own[], manage[], or  operate[] an interactive computer service, * * * or  conspire[] or attempt[] to do so"" if done ""with the intent  to promote or facilitate the prostitution of another  person[.]"" 18 U.S.C. § 2421A(a). Page 4 of 13 Section 2421A(b) separately creates an aggravated  offense, punishable by up to 25 years of imprisonment,  for anyone who both violates Section 2421A(a) and also  ""promotes or facilitates the prostitution of 5 or more  persons"" or ""acts in reckless disregard of the fact that  such conduct contributed to sex trafficking"" in violation  of Section 1591(a) of the Trafficking Act. 18 U.S.C. §  2421A(b).  [*1295]  Fourth, FOSTA clarifies that Section 230's  immunity shield does not impair or limit liability for (i)  civil actions brought under Section 1595 of the  Trafficking Act if the underlying conduct violates Section  1591 of the Trafficking Act, or (ii) criminal charges  brought under state law if the underlying conduct  violates Section 1591 of the Trafficking Act or Section  2421A of Title 18. 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5). FOSTA adds that its amendments to Section 230 ""shall  apply regardless of whether the conduct alleged  occurred, or is alleged [**9]  to have occurred, before,  on, or after [FOSTA's] enactment."" 47 U.S.C. § 230  note. C In response to FOSTA's enactment, several online  platforms removed content and deleted entire sections  of their websites. Woodhull II, 948 F.3d at 368-369. For  example, two days after Congress passed the Act,  Craigslist eliminated all personal ads, including those in  non-sexual categories, and named FOSTA as the  reason for doing so. Other websites followed suit, and  many blamed the Act's broad criminal prohibitions and  severe penalties. See COYOTE-RI, et al., Amicus Br. A.  15 (""FOSTA changes [liability] in a way that makes sites  operated by small organizations * * * much riskier to  operate. [The Act] essentially says that if we facilitate  the prostitution of another person we're liable. * * * [T]he  problem is that 'or facilitate' is ill-defined.""). The plaintiffs in this case similarly allege that FOSTA  has chilled or halted their constitutionally protected  speech. Plaintiff Woodhull Freedom Foundation is an  advocacy organization that supports the health, safety,  and protection of sex workers. Because of the Act,  Woodhull has censored its publication of information  that might, in its view, be considered to promote or  facilitate sex work. Plaintiff [**10]  Alex Andrews is the cofounder and  organizer of several advocacy groups for sex workers.  Andrews created Rate That Rescue, a website that  allows sex workers to report and warn others about  violence and other harmful behavior by clients. Rate  That Rescue also shares information about products  and services that sex workers can use, including online  payment processors and contact information for rescue  organizations. See Woodhull II, 948 F.3d at 369.  Because Rate That Rescue has thousands of users,  and because Andrews has alleged that she intends to  use Rate That Rescue to host discussions that in her  view ""facilitate"" sex trafficking, Andrews's conduct is  arguably proscribed by FOSTA. Id. at 372. In addition,  an organization of which Andrews is a board member  canceled its acquisition and development of an  electronic tool for sex workers to report violent and  harmful behavior because of FOSTA. Plaintiff  Human  Rights  Watch  is  an  advocacy  organization that, among other things, advocates for the  human rights of sex workers. In so doing, Human Rights  Watch chronicles rights violations committed against  sex workers and describes police tactics targeted at  their work. Human Rights Watch alleges that the Act  endangers its human rights [**11]  advocacy work,  especially its documentation of abuses against sex  workers. Plaintiff the Internet Archive captures, displays, and  stores all types of historical website data and third-party  material. It fears prosecution for its preservation of web  pages that may later be found to violate FOSTA, and for  the third-party material it hosts. Finally, plaintiff Eric Koszyk is a licensed massage  therapist. Before FOSTA, Koszyk advertised his  business on Craigslist.  [*1296]  But Craigslist removed  its  ""therapeutic  services""  section  after  FOSTA's  enactment and took down his ads, allegedly causing  Koszyk to lose revenue and a substantial number of  clients. II A In June 2018, Woodhull Freedom Foundation, Human  Rights Watch, the Internet Archive, Andrews, and  Koszyk (collectively, ""Woodhull"") filed a pre-enforcement  facial challenge to FOSTA. Woodhull mounts several  First Amendment attacks on the Act, including that it is  an overbroad, content-based restriction on speech that  fails strict scrutiny. Woodhull also alleges that the Act is  unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fifth  Page 5 of 13 Amendment and that it imposes an unconstitutional  retroactive criminal penalty in violation of the Ex Post  Facto Clause of Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution. The district court originally dismissed the case  and [**12]  denied Woodhull's preliminary injunction for  lack of standing. Woodhull Freedom Found. v. United  States, 334 F. Supp. 3d 185, 203 (D.D.C. 2018)  (""Woodhull I""), rev'd and remanded, 948 F.3d 363, 445  U.S. App. D.C. 111 (D.C. Cir. 2020). This court reversed, holding that at least some plaintiffs  had established standing, and remanded the case for  further proceedings. See Woodhull II, 948 F.3d at 371- 374. We held that, at a minimum, Andrews had standing  because she ""operates a website that allows sex  workers to share information"" that arguably violates  Section 2421A. Id. at 372. The court noted that the Act  could be read one of two ways. First, because Section  2421A does not define ""promote"" or ""facilitate,"" and the  terms are listed disjunctively, the Act could separately  proscribe  promoting  prostitution  and  facilitating  prostitution. Id. Given that the ordinary meaning of  ""facilitate"" is ""to make easier,"" this court concluded that  FOSTA may criminalize any behavior that makes  unlawful sex work easier. See id. (quoting United States  v. Rivera, 775 F.2d 1559, 1562 (11th Cir. 1985)) (further  citation omitted). On the other hand, FOSTA could be  read to use ""facilitate"" in its criminal law context, which  would outlaw only conduct that aids and abets unlawful  sex work. Id. Because Andrews's website allows sex workers to share  information about payment processors, the court  reasoned that it faced regulation under either reading of  the statute. Woodhull II, 948 F.3d at 372-373. For [**13]   that reason, this court held that Andrews had standing  to bring a pre-enforcement First Amendment challenge  to FOSTA. This court also held that Koszyk had standing because  Craigslist's removal of his advertisements is traceable to  FOSTA. Woodhull II, 948 F.3d at 374. In addition, his  injury is redressable because a favorable ruling  invalidating  the  Act  would  likely  result  in  the  reinstatement  of  personalized  ads.  Id.  Because  Andrews and Koszyk established standing, the court did  not evaluate whether the three institutional plaintiffs also  had standing. Id. at 371.   B On remand, the district court granted the Government's  motion for summary judgment and denied Woodhull's  cross-motion, holding that the Act is not unconstitutional  under the First or Fifth Amendments. Woodhull  Freedom Found. v. United States, No. CV 18-1552  (RJL), 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57747, 2022 WL 910600,  at *1 (D.D.C. March 29, 2022) (""Woodhull III""). The  district court  [*1297]  found that FOSTA is not  overbroad if ""promote or facilitate"" is read in its criminal  law context. 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57747, [WL] at *5-6  (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 2421A(a)). When read that way,  the court reasoned, FOSTA does not target advocacy,  but instead is narrowly tailored to target ""services that  are owned, operated, or managed with the intent to aid,  abet, or assist"" acts of prostitution. 2022 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 57747, [WL] at *6. On that same basis and in  light of FOSTA's scienter requirements, the district court  rejected Woodhull's vagueness challenge. 2022 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 57747, [WL] at *8-9 [**14] . As for the amendment of Section 230, the district court  found no constitutional basis for the immunity Woodhull  claimed, and it rejected Woodhull's challenge based on  content and viewpoint discrimination on the ground that  FOSTA does not regulate speech. Woodhull III, 2022  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57747, 2022 WL 910600, at *9. Finally,  the district court dismissed Woodhull's Ex Post Facto  Clause challenge to FOSTA's effective date. 2022 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS 57747, [WL] at *11. That provision allows  civil liability under Section 1595 of the Trafficking Act  and state criminal liability against online platforms for  conduct that violates FOSTA and applies even if the  conduct occurred before FOSTA's enactment. 47 U.S.C.  § 230 note. The only actors who can enforce that  provision are private plaintiffs and state law enforcement  officers. Id. § 230(e)(5)(C). Because the named  defendants in this pre-enforcement challenge are all  federal officials who cannot bring lawsuits under Section  230(e)(5)(C), the district court ruled that it could not  provide Woodhull with a remedy for its Ex Post Facto  Clause claim. Woodhull III, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  57747, 2022 WL 910600, at *11. III Woodhull timely filed a notice of appeal. We have  jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We review the  district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. See  Edwards v. District of Columbia, 755 F.3d 996, 1000,  Page 6 of 13 410 U.S. App. D.C. 354 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Questions of  statutory interpretation and constitutional law are  likewise reviewed de novo. See Blackman v. District of  Columbia, 456 F.3d 167, 176, 372 U.S. App. D.C. 324  (D.C. Cir. 2006); United States v. Bronstein, 849 F.3d  1101, 1106, 428 U.S. App. D.C. 27 (D.C. Cir. 2017). IV Woodhull levels multiple First and Fifth Amendment  challenges to FOSTA. None of them [**15]  succeeds. A Woodhull argues that FOSTA's amendment of Section  1591(e)(4) of the Trafficking Act to define ""participation  in a venture"" is unconstitutionally overbroad under the  First Amendment. We disagree. ""[A] statute is facially invalid [under the overbreadth  doctrine] if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected  speech."" United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 292,  128 S. Ct. 1830, 170 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2008). Invalidation  for overbreadth is ""strong medicine"" that is not to be  ""casually employed."" Id. at 293 (citations and quotation  marks  omitted).  Accordingly,  courts  ""vigorously  enforce[]"" the requirement that any ""overbreadth be  substantial, not only in an absolute sense, but also  relative to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep."" Id. at  292 (citations omitted); see United States v. Stevens,  559 U.S. 460, 473, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 176 L. Ed. 2d 435  (2010); Initiative & Referendum Inst. v. United States  Postal Serv., 417 F.3d 1299, 1312-1313, 368 U.S. App.  D.C. 50 (D.C. Cir. 2005). To determine if Section 1591(e)(4) is overbroad, we  must first construe the provision's meaning, for ""it is  impossible to determine whether a statute reaches too  far without first knowing what the statute  [*1298]   covers."" Williams, 553 U.S. at 293; see United States v.  Hansen, No. 22-179, slip op. at 5, 2023 U.S. LEXIS  2638 (U.S. June 23, 2023) (same). So we start, as we  must, with the statutory text. See Republic of Sudan v.  Harrison, 139 S. Ct. 1048, 1055-1056, 203 L. Ed. 2d  433 (2019). Recall  that  Section  1591(a)  outlaws  knowingly  benefiting from ""participation in a venture"" that one  knows has engaged in sex trafficking. 18 U.S.C. §  1591(a)(2). FOSTA defines ""participation in a venture""  as ""knowingly assisting, supporting, or facilitating [sex  trafficking]."" Id. § 1591(e)(4). Woodhull argues that  Section 1591(e)(4) is overbroad because the operative  verbs—assisting, [**16]  supporting, or facilitating—are  broad and potentially sweeping in their reach. That is  incorrect. Standing alone, verbs like ""assisting"" and ""facilitating""  can be broad in their reach. But we read statutory terms  in context, not in isolation. See Williams, 553 U.S. at  294. When read together, with each word drawing  meaning from the other, the string of verbs ""assisting,  supporting, or facilitating"" is most naturally understood  to refer to aiding and abetting sex trafficking. After all,  the word assist means ""to lend aid; to help."" See Assist,  W'SNID 167 (2d ed.  1954) (def. 2); see also OED  715 (2d ed. 1989) (def. 1) (""An act of assistance; aid,  help.""); AHD 108 (5th ed.  2018) (def. 1) (""To give help or support to[.]""). Similarly,  ""support"" commonly means ""assist"" or ""help[.]"" Support,  M-WD 1256 (11th ed. 2014)  (def. 2 b (1)); OED 257 (2d ed.  1989) (def. 1. a.) ([A]ssistance[.]""). In addition, ""assist"" is commonly used by Congress as  part of aiding-and-abetting language. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C.  § 1227(a)(1)(E) (""Any alien who * * * knowingly has  encouraged, induced, assisted, abetted, or aided any  other alien to enter [**17]  or to try to enter the United  States in violation of law is deportable.""); 15 U.S.C. §  3057(a)(2)(K) (""Assisting, encouraging, aiding, abetting,  conspiring, covering up, or any other type of intentional  complicity involving a safety, performance, or anti- doping and medication control rule[.]""); 18 U.S.C. §  3014(a) (special assessment for persons who aid and  abet immigration violations unless ""the person induced,  assisted, abetted, or aided"" a child, spouse, or parent);  26 U.S.C. § 6701(a) (applying to ""[a]ny person—(1) who  aids or assists in, procures, or advises with respect to,  the preparation or presentation of any portion of a  return, affidavit, claim, or other document""); 43 U.S.C. §  1064 (punishing any person ""who shall aid, abet,  counsel, advise, or assist in any violation hereof""). Given the company it keeps in Section 1591(e)(4),  ""facilitating"" similarly connotes helping to make sex  trafficking happen—that is, aiding and abetting the  offense. See Facilitation, B'SLD (10th  ed. 2014) (def. 2) (""The act or an instance of aiding or  helping; esp., in criminal law, the act of making it easier  for another person to commit a crime.""). The Supreme Court has come to the same conclusion.  Most recently, the Court explained that ""[f]acilitation— Page 7 of 13 also called aiding and [**18]  abetting—is the provision  of assistance to a wrongdoer with the intent to further an  offense's commission."" Hansen, slip op., at 6, 2023 U.S.  LEXIS 2638. Likewise, in Abuelhawa v. United States,  556 U.S. 816, 129 S. Ct. 2102, 173 L. Ed. 2d 982  (2009), the statute at issue made it ""a felony 'to use any  communication facility in committing or in causing or  facilitating' certain felonies prohibited by"" the Controlled  Substances Act, id. at 818  [*1299]  (quoting 21 U.S.C.  § 843(b)). There the Court held that, when used that  way, the term ""facilitate"" had ""comparable scope"" to aid  and abet. Id. at 821. As the Second Circuit has  explained, when Congress uses ""'facilitate' * * * to  describe an action distinct from 'committing' a crime, its  meaning is commonly limited to actions taken to assist  someone else's crime."" United States v. Desposito, 704  F.3d 221, 228 n.8 (2d Cir. 2013) (emphasis omitted);  see id. (citing Abuelhawa, 556 U.S. at 821, for the  proposition that ""'facilitate' has an 'equivalent meaning'  to 'aid,' 'abet,' and 'assist'""). Likewise, here, Section 1591(e)(4) uses ""facilitates"" to  describe a criminal act distinct from a direct violation of  the law. Compare 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)(1), with id. §§  1591(a)(2) & (e)(4). And by placing ""facilitate"" alongside  ""assist"" and ""support,"" Congress framed it in a manner  that indicates an aiding-and-abetting offense. In sum, reading Section 1591(e)(4)'s definition of  ""participation in a venture"" in light of its context and  placement in the statutory scheme, the definition  permissibly [**19]  prohibits aiding and abetting a  venture that one knows to be engaged in sex trafficking  while knowingly benefiting from that venture. We thus  hold that the provision does not have the expansive  scope that Woodhull fears, but instead, proscribes only  speech that falls within the traditional bounds of aiding- and-abetting liability, which is not a form of speech  protected by the First Amendment. See Stevens, 559  U.S. at 468 (First Amendment allows restrictions on the  content of ""speech integral to criminal conduct"")  (citations omitted); National Org. for Women v.  Operation Rescue, 37 F.3d 646, 656, 308 U.S. App.  D.C. 349 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (""That 'aiding and abetting' of  an illegal act may be carried out through speech is no  bar to its illegality.""); see also Hansen, slip op. at 17,  2023 U.S. LEXIS 2638 (""Section 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv)  reaches no further than the purposeful * * * facilitation of  specific acts known to violate federal law. So  understood, the statute does not 'prohibi[t] a substantial  amount of protected speech' relative to its 'plainly  legitimate sweep.'"") (quoting Williams, 553 U.S. at 292). B Woodhull also argues that Sections 2421A(a) and (b)(1)  of FOSTA are overbroad because the phrase ""promote  or facilitate"" has a variety of meanings, many of which  include protected speech, such as general advocacy  and the provision of safety and health information. The  Government, on the other hand, contends that ""promote  or facilitate"" should be read to mean aid or [**20]  abet.  The Government is correct. Sections 2421A(a) and  (b)(1) of FOSTA are not unconstitutionally overbroad  under the First Amendment. 1 Start with the statutory text. Section 2421A(a) provides: Whoever, using a facility or means of interstate or  foreign commerce or in or affecting interstate or  foreign commerce, owns, manages, or operates an  interactive computer service (as such term is  defined in * * * 47 U.S.C. § 230(f))[], or conspires or  attempts to do so, with the intent to promote or  facilitate the prostitution of another person shall be  fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than  10 years, or both. 18 U.S.C. § 2421A(a). Section 2421A(a)'s mens rea is clear: An intent to  promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person.  As we have already held, ""'promote' and 'facilitate,'  when considered in isolation, 'are susceptible  [*1300]   of multiple and wide-ranging meanings.'"" Woodhull II,  948 F.3d at 372 (quoting and citing Williams, 553 U.S.  at 294). But contrary to Woodhull's assertion, when read  in context, Section 2421A(a)'s mens rea requirement is  constitutional. Section 2421A is a criminal statute and, as the district  court noted, ""promoting prostitution"" has a distinct  meaning in criminal law. Woodhull III, 2022 U.S. Dist.  LEXIS 57747, 2022 WL 910600, at *6. For example,  Black's Law Dictionary defines ""promoting prostitution""  as ""[t]he act or offense of recruiting a prostitute, finding  a place of business for a prostitute, or soliciting [**21]   customers for a prostitute."" Promoting Prostitution,  B'SLD (10th ed. 2014).     Page 8 of 13 That specialized meaning is important because, ""when  Congress  'borrows  terms  of  art  in  which  are  accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of  centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts  the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed  word.'"" Hansen, slip op. at 9-10, 2023 U.S. LEXIS 2638  (quoting Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 263,  72 S. Ct. 240, 96 L. Ed. 288 (1952)). So when read  within its traditional criminal law context, Section  2421A(a)'s prohibition on promoting the prostitution of  another person proscribes owning, managing, or  operating an online platform with the intent to recruit,  solicit, or find a place of business for a sex worker—that  is, to aid and abet prostitution. While ""facilitating prostitution"" has not been so defined,  the context in which it is used in Section 2421A(a)  similarly narrows its reach to additional forms of aiding  and abetting that go beyond the recruitment, solicitation,  or finding of a place of business, which ""promote""  already covers. As a preliminary matter, the Supreme Court explained in  Hansen that the word ""facilitate"" is a synonym for aiding  and abetting when that word is used [**22]  in the  context of criminal statutes. See Hansen, slip op. at 6,  2023 U.S. LEXIS 2638 (""Facilitation—also called aiding  and abetting[.]""). The Court further observed that  facilitation is a ""longstanding criminal theor[y] targeting  those who support the crimes of a principal wrongdoer.""  Id. So it seems clear that, in this statute, ""facilitating                        prostitution"" is most naturally read to mean aiding and  abetting prostitution. Notably, elsewhere in FOSTA, ""facilitate"" appears in the  company of other aiding-and-abetting verbs, suggesting  that  [*1301]  Congress meant to carry that sense  forward into Section 2421A. See Section IV.A., supra.  So too here: ""[F]acilitate"" appears alongside ""promote""  and is directly tied to the criminal offense of prostituting  another person, so reading ""facilitate"" to mean aiding  and abetting makes textual sense. See National Postal  Policy Council v. Postal Regul. Comm'n, 17 F.4th 1184,  1191, 454 U.S. App. D.C. 453 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (""[A]  standard principle of statutory construction provides that  identical words and phrases within the same statute  should normally be given the same meaning."") (quoting  Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Servs., Inc., 551 U.S.  224, 232, 127 S. Ct. 2411, 168 L. Ed. 2d 112 (2007)),  cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. 2868, 213 L. Ed. 2d 1090  (2022). What is more, the phrase ""promote or facilitate"" is often  used as the mens rea for accomplice liability in the  Model Penal Code and state aiding-and-abetting  statutes. For example, the Model Penal Code defines an  accomplice as a person who aids or [**23]  agrees with  another in planning or committing a crime ""with the  purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of  the offense[.]"" MPC § 2.06(3)(a). State aiding-and-abetting statutes mirror this language  by defining aiding and abetting as engaging in a  circumscribed act with the purpose of ""promoting or  facilitating"" a crime. See, e.g., AS. §  11.16.110(2)(B) (2022); C.R.S. § 18-1-603  (2023); D.C.A. tit. 11, § 271 (2023); 720 I. C.S. 5/5-2 (2022); N.J. S.A. § 2C:2-6  (West 2023); 18 P.C.S. § 306 (2023). Federal  criminal law also employs a similar phrase in the Travel  Act, which in part outlaws traveling with the intent to  ""promote or * * * facilitate the promotion"" of unlawful  activity. 18 U.S.C. § 1952(a)(3); cf. Urena-Ramirez v.  Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 51, 54 (1st Cir. 2003) (conduct  underlying  promotion  of  unlawful  activity  was  tantamount to aiding and abetting).        Page 9 of 13 2 In addition to employing ""promotes or facilitates"" in an  aiding-and-abetting context, Section 2421A(a) uses a  very specific criminal object that itself narrows the reach  of ""facilitates."" Congress, after all, did not use ""facilitate""  or ""facilitate prostitution"" in isolation. Instead, the statute  outlaws ""facilitat[ing] * * * the prostitution of another  person."" 18 U.S.C. § 2421A(a). By placing both  ""facilitate"" and ""promote"" in relation to the same  object—namely ""the prostitution of another person""— Congress  signaled  that  ""facilitate""  should  carry  the [**24]  same criminal-law meaning of aiding and  abetting the prostitution of another as the companion  phrase ""promotes"" prostitution does, with ""facilitates""  capturing those forms of aiding and abetting not covered  by the verb ""promotes."" See Woodhull II, 948 F.3d at  372 (""'[F]acilitate' could be interpreted as a  [*1302]   synonym for terms like 'aid,' 'abet,' and 'assist,' in which  case the term's meaning would be limited by the  background law of aiding and abetting."") (formatting  modified); see also Williams, 553 U.S. at 295 (the  meaning of ""facilitate"" can be narrowed by neighboring  words). In that way, ""promote or facilitate prostitution of  another person"" encompasses both actions that count  as promoting prostitution—like running a ""prostitution  business,"" or ""procur[ing] a prostitute for a patron,"" see  N.J. S.A. § 2C:34-1(a)(4) (West 2023)—and other  actions that aid and abet prostitution, like getting  someone addicted to drugs, stealing their money or  passports, or threatening them against leaving. Section 2421A(a)'s object—""the prostitution of another  person""—also focuses the otherwise potentially broad  reach of ""facilitates."" 18 U.S.C. § 2421A(a). Notably,  that statutory phrasing does not proscribe facilitating  prostitution more generally, which could extend to  speech arguing for the legalization of prostitution [**25]   or  that  discusses,  educates,  or  informs  about  prostitution.  The  person  ""being  prostituted""  (in  Congress's words) is the object of the facilitation and the             offense of being prostituted. See Williams, 553 U.S. at  298-299 (""[T]here remains an important distinction  between a proposal to engage in illegal activity and the  abstract  advocacy  of  illegality."").  The  language  bespeaks something done to a particular person— aiding their prostitution by someone else or some force  independent  of  the  person  being  prostituted.  Prostitution, M-WD (11th ed.  2014) (def. 2) (""The state of being prostituted.""); see  also Williams, 553 U.S. at 300 (While the First  Amendment does not allow criminalizing ""abstract  advocacy,""  it  does  permit  outlawing  ""the  recommendation of a particular piece of purported child  pornography with the intent of initiating a transfer."").  That understanding also maps onto Congress's intent in  FOSTA to deny protection to ""websites that facilitate  traffickers in advertising the sale of unlawful sex acts  with sex trafficking victims[.]"" 47 U.S.C. § 230 note. This understanding of ""facilitate the prostitution of  another person"" likewise parallels the definition of  ""promote prostitution"" employed in the Model Penal  Code and state statutes, adopting [**26]  it as actions  that ""encourag[e], induc[e] or otherwise purposely  caus[e] another to become or remain a prostitute[.]""  MPC § 251.2(2)(c); see also note 4,  supra. In that way, ""facilitate the prostitution of another  person"" encompasses actions that cause a specific  person to ""be prostituted"" or helps to orchestrate their  prostitution. We therefore hold that Section 2421A(a)'s mental state  requirement does not reach the intent to engage in  general advocacy about prostitution, or to give advice to  sex workers generally to protect them from abuse. Nor  would it cover the intent to preserve for historical  purposes webpages that discuss prostitution. Instead, it  reaches a person's intent to aid or abet the prostitution  of another person. That reading also makes sense in a  statute that targets prostitution alongside sex trafficking,  and seeks to eradicate the use of online platforms when  they contribute to sex work that is compelled by ""force,  fraud, and coercion[.]"" 47 U.S.C. § 230 note. Undoubtedly, the term ""facilitate"" could be read more  broadly. See Woodhull II, 948 F.3d at 372. But nothing  in Section 2421A(a) compels us to read ""facilitate"" that  way. Doubly so when a more expansive reading could  raise grave constitutional concerns. See Judicial Watch,  Inc. v. United States Secret Serv., 726 F.3d 208, 226,  406 U.S. App. D.C. 440 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (canon of  constitutional  [*1303]  avoidance requires [**27]  courts  to ""interpret[] statutes to avoid deciding difficult  Page 10 of 13 constitutional questions where the text fairly admits of a  less problematic construction"") (quoting Public Citizen v.  Department of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 455, 109 S. Ct.  2558, 105 L. Ed. 2d 377 (1989)). Rather, as the  Supreme Court emphasizes, we must adopt any ""fairly  possible"" reading that assures the constitutionality of the  text. Hansen, slip op. at 16, 2023 U.S. LEXIS 2638  (quoting Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 842,  200 L. Ed. 2d 122 (2018)). And that reading is plainly  available here, especially when ""facilitate"" is read as a  companion to the verb ""promote,"" and with the very  specific object of ""the prostitution of another person."" 3 Woodhull also argues that Section 2421A(b)(1) is  substantially overbroad, just like Section 2421A(a).  Because we have already concluded that the provision's  mens rea clause, which is identical to that in subsection  (a), can be read narrowly to fall within constitutional  bounds, see Sections IV.B.1-2., supra, that challenge  fails. C Woodhull separately argues that certain portions of  FOSTA are void for vagueness. In particular, Woodhull  objects to Section 1591(e)(4)'s definition of ""participation  in a venture,"" Section 2421A's mens rea clause, Section  2421A(b)(2)'s aggravated offense provision, and Section  230(e)(5)(A)'s scienter requirement. All of Woodhull's  challenges fail. ""Vagueness doctrine is an outgrowth not of the First  Amendment, but of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth  Amendment."" Williams, 553 U.S. at 304. A law is  unconstitutionally vague if it ""fails to provide a person  of [**28]  ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is  prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or  encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement."" Id.  ""What renders a statute vague is not the possibility that  it will sometimes be difficult to determine whether the  incriminating fact it establishes has been proved; but  rather the indeterminacy of precisely what that fact is.""  Id. at 306. That concern takes no root here. First, there is no relevant indeterminacy in Section  1591(e)(4)'s definition of ""participation in a venture[,]"" or  in Section 2421A's mens rea clause. Instead, as  explained above, conventional tools of statutory  construction  show  that  both  provisions  capture  traditional aiding-and-abetting liability. See Bronstein,  849 F.3d at 1106 (""A statute's vagueness is either  susceptible to judicial construction or is void for  vagueness based on the application of traditional rules  for statutory interpretation.""). That long-settled standard  for criminal liability puts persons on fair notice that  aiding and abetting a group engaged in sex trafficking or  acting with the intent to aid and abet the prostitution of  another person is prohibited. See Hansen, slip op. at 6,  2023 U.S. LEXIS 2638 (concept of facilitation is a  ""longstanding criminal theor[y]""). Nothing in Section  1591(e)(4)'s definition of participating [**29]  in a  venture or in Section 2421A's mens rea depends on the  type of subjective or wholly discretionary or indiscernible  judgments  that  courts  have  struck  down  as  unconstitutionally vague. See Williams, 553 U.S. at 306  (terms like ""annoying"" or ""indecent"" lack sufficient  objective content to provide fair notice). Second, Woodhull argues that Section 2421A(b)(2) is  unconstitutionally vague because it imposes liability on  anyone who acts in ""reckless disregard"" of the fact that  their conduct ""contributed to sex trafficking""  [*1304]  in  violation of Section 1591 of the Trafficking Act without  defining those phrases. Woodhull is incorrect. For one, ""reckless disregard"" is a commonly used mens  rea with a settled criminal law meaning. See Borden v.  United States, 141 S. Ct. 1817, 1824, 210 L. Ed. 2d 63  (2021) (""A person acts recklessly, in the most common  formulation,  when  he  'consciously  disregards  a  substantial and unjustifiable risk' attached to his  conduct, in 'gross deviation' from accepted standards."")  (quoting MPC § 2.02(2)(c)). In addition, while ""contributes to"" sex trafficking can  range from helping to bring about sex trafficking to  aiding and abetting sex trafficking, the breadth of the  standard does not make it vague. See Williams, 553  U.S. at 304; see also Pennsylvania Dep't of Corr. v.  Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212, 118 S. Ct. 1952, 141 L. Ed.  2d 215 (1998) (""[T]he fact that a statute can be 'applied  in situations not expressly anticipated by Congress does  not demonstrate ambiguity. It demonstrates [**30]   breadth.'"") (quoting Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473  U.S. 479, 499, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346  (1985)). Nor does its operation turn on wholly  discretionary  and  unpredictable  judgments.  See  Contribute, AHD 399 (5th ed.  2016) (def. 2) (""[T]o help bring about a result; act as a  factor[.]""); W'SNW 324 (5th ed. 2014)  (def. 3) (""[T]o give or furnish (knowledge, ideas, etc.)— to have a share in bringing about (a result); be partly  responsible for[.]""); Williams, 553 U.S. at 304. As such,  Page 11 of 13 the provision is not unconstitutionally vague. Third, Section 230(e)(5)(A)'s scienter requirement  likewise passes constitutional muster. Recall that  Section 1595 of the Trafficking Act allows survivors of  sex trafficking to bring a civil action against a perpetrator  or anyone who ""knowingly benefits, * * * from  participation in a venture which that person knew or  should have known has engaged in [sex trafficking]."" 18  U.S.C. § 1595(a). At the same time, Section 230 broadly  immunizes providers of online platforms from civil  liability for content posted on their platforms by third  parties. 47 U.S.C. § 230(c). In FOSTA, Congress clarified that online platforms sued  in civil actions under Section 1595 do not enjoy Section  230 immunity ""if the conduct underlying the claim  constitutes a violation of section 1591""—that is, conduct  that involves either directly engaging in sex trafficking or  knowingly benefiting from [**31]  participation in a  venture that one knows has engaged in sex trafficking,  18 U.S.C. § 1591. See 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(5)(A). While  both  Sections  1591  and  1595  prohibit  ""participation in a venture"" that has engaged in sex  trafficking, Section 1595's civil liability provision does not  explicitly specify a mens rea for ""participation in a  venture[.]"" While the statutory text is not explicit and a  few initial rulings were contradictory, court rulings are  now consistent that Section 1595 requires an actual  knowledge mens rea for participation in a venture.  [*1305]  Woodhull points to that evolution in case law                      as evidence that the provision is unconstitutionally  vague. But the fact that a statutory construction question  may be difficult or unresolved does not make the law  unconstitutionally vague. Otherwise, countless laws  would be invalidated. ""[P]erfect clarity and precise  guidance have never been required even of regulations  that restrict expressive activity."" Williams, 553 U.S. at  304 (quoting Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S.  781, 794, 109 S. Ct. 2746, 105 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1989)).  Rather, a statute is unconstitutionally vague only ""if,  applying the rules for interpreting legal texts, its  meaning specifies no [determinable] standard of  conduct [**32]  at all."" Bronstein, 849 F.3d at 1107  (formatting modified). Section 230(e)(5)(A) suffers from no such problem.  Principles of statutory construction have proven up to  the task of interpreting that provision. And whatever  mens rea is required, it does not turn on subjective,  unascertainable, or wholly discretionary judgments, or  on the absence of any standard at all. See Williams, 553  U.S. at 304. That suffices to foreclose Woodhull's  vagueness challenge. See Bronstein, 849 F.3d at 1107  (""[A] statutory term is not rendered unconstitutionally  vague because it 'do[es] not mean the same thing to all  people, all the time, everywhere.'"") (quoting Roth v.  United States, 354 U.S. 476, 491, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 1 L.  Ed. 2d 1498 (1957)); see also United States v. Kernell,  667 F.3d 746, 754 (6th Cir. 2012) (""[T]he fact that  different courts have interpreted a statute differently  does not make the statute vague—if that were true, a  circuit split over the interpretation of a criminal statute  would by definition render the statute unconstitutional.""). V Woodhull also argues that Section 4(b) of FOSTA runs  afoul of the Constitution's prohibition of ex post facto  laws. See U.S.C. Art. I, § 9, cl. 3. Section 4(b)  provides that the amendments to Section 230(e)(5)'s  immunity  provision,  which  exclude  criminal  sex  trafficking conduct, ""shall apply regardless of whether  the conduct alleged occurred, or is alleged to have  occurred, before, on, or after"" FOSTA's enactment. 47  U.S.C. § 230 note. Woodhull argues that Section  4(b) [**33]  violates the Ex Post Facto Clause because it  allows private parties and States to prosecute online  platforms for third parties' speech on their sites even  when that speech predated FOSTA's enactment.  Woodhull seeks a declaration that the Act violates the  Ex Post Facto Clause and a permanent injunction  forbidding the defendants to enforce that provision.  Page 12 of 13 Compl. at 50-51, J.A. 61-62. Woodhull's argument does not get out of the starting  gate. The only persons who could even arguably violate  the Ex Post Facto Clause by prosecuting the state-law  actions authorized by Section 230(e)(5)(C) are state  officials and private parties. None of the federal  defendants whom Woodhull has sued have any ability  or authority to bring the state-law actions that Section  230(e)(5)(C) authorizes. So there is no possible conduct  by these federal defendants that a court could declare  unconstitutional or enjoin as unlawful on ex post facto  grounds. Nor does the complaint  [*1306]  name any  state  or  private  defendants.  A  pre-enforcement  declaratory  judgment  cannot  be  issued  against  defendants who do not enforce the challenged provision  of law. See California v. Texas, 141 S. Ct. 2104, 2116,  210 L. Ed. 2d 230 (2021) (denying declaratory relief  when ""[t]here is no one, and nothing, to enjoin[]""); see  also Haaland v. Brackeen, No. 21-376, slip op. at 30-31,  143 S. Ct. 1609, 216 L. Ed. 2d 254 (U.S. June 15, 2023)  (declining request for injunctive relief and declaratory  judgment against federal [**34]  officials where ""'[t]here  is no federal official who administers [the statute] or  carries out its mandates' * * * [and] state officials are  nonparties who would not be bound by the judgment"")  (quoting Brief for Individual Pet'rs at 63, Haaland v.  Brackeen (No. 21-376)). Usually, dismissal with prejudice for failure to name a  proper defendant is granted only if ""the allegation of  other facts consistent with the challenged pleading  could not possibly cure the deficiency."" Jarrell v. United  States Postal Serv., 753 F.2d 1088, 1091, 243 U.S.  App. D.C. 350 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (quoting Bonanno v.  Thomas, 309 F.2d 320, 322 (9th Cir. 1962)). But  Woodhull never asked the district court (or this court) for  the opportunity to amend the complaint and add a  proper defendant for the ex post facto claim. With  Woodhull having made no effort to substitute in a proper  party, the district court did not abuse its discretion in  dismissing the ex post facto claim without allowing leave  to amend. See Atchinson v. District of Columbia, 73  F.3d 418, 426, 315 U.S. App. D.C. 318 (D.C. Cir. 1996)  (""[W]e review district court decisions under Rule 15(a)  for abuse of discretion.""). VI Woodhull brings an additional challenge to the Act's  amendment of Section 230. Prior to FOSTA, Section  230 withheld immunity for online platform owners,  managers, and operators if the content posted on the  platform violated federal criminal law. See 47 U.S.C. §  230(e)(1). FOSTA clarified that Section 230's immunity  carve-out includes civil [**35]  liability in private actions  under Section 1595 of the Trafficking Act, 18 U.S.C. §  1595, and state criminal liability if the underlying  conduct violates Section 1591 of the Trafficking Act, id.  § 1591, or Section 2421A of FOSTA, id. § 2421A. 47  U.S.C. § 230(e)(5). Woodhull argues that selective withdrawal of Section  230 immunity only for those who speak on disfavored  subjects like the promotion of prostitution and sex  trafficking violates the First Amendment. Once again,  Woodhull's argument fails. To start, FOSTA does not criminalize promoting  prostitution broadly. It only punishes aiding or abetting  the ""prostitution of another person,"" which has a much  narrower reach. See Section IV.B., supra. As for Woodhull's argument that Section 230(e)(5)  selectively withdraws immunity on the basis of speech's  content or viewpoint, that misunderstands the law.  Sections 230(e)(5)(A)-(B) withhold immunity only for  content that violates the federal criminal prohibition on  sex trafficking in Section 1591, and Woodhull makes no  argument that Section 1591 itself is unconstitutional  under the First Amendment or otherwise. Neither does  Woodhull explain how denying immunity for speech  integral to criminal conduct would trench on the First  Amendment. Nor did the amendment make a material or selective  change in the scope of immunity. Section 230's text has  always withheld immunity for speech that violates  federal criminal law. 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(1). Woodhull  brings  no  constitutional  challenge  to  Section  230(e)(1)'s [**36]  original withholding of immunity for  violations of all federal criminal  [*1307]  laws, including  Section 1591. And Woodhull does not argue that  Section 230(e)(1)'s original withholding applies only to  federal laws in effect at the time of Section 230's  enactment. That means that Section 230(e)(1)'s  withholding of immunity automatically applies to new  criminal laws such as Section 2421A as a textual  matter. That automatic inclusion of all new criminal laws  belies Woodhull's claim of selective targeting based on  content. Congress was explicit in FOSTA that Section 230's  immunity provision ""was never intended to provide legal  protection""  to  websites  that  unlawfully  promote  prostitution or assist traffickers, and accordingly  Page 13 of 13 determined that ""clarification * * * [wa]s warranted to  ensure that such section does not provide such  protection to such websites."" 47 U.S.C. § 230 note.  Congress amended Section 230 in response to the  many court decisions immunizing websites hosting  unlawful speech in a manner that was deemed to be  contrary to Congress's original design. See Woodhull II,  948 F.3d at 367-368 (explaining that courts frequently  held that Section 230 prevented liability for violations of  federal law). So all FOSTA does is clarify and reinforce  the prior exclusion of immunity within the specific  context of sex trafficking, and explain that the [**37]   limit on immunity extends to civil liability as well. Nothing in the First Amendment required Congress to  confer Section 230 immunity on speech that violates  federal criminal laws in the first place, and nothing in the  First Amendment ossifies such immunity once granted  against any later clarification. VII In  addition  to  its  overbreadth  and  vagueness  challenges, Woodhull asserts that, as regulations of  speech, Sections 2421A and 1591(e)(4) do not survive  strict scrutiny. But those Sections, as we have  interpreted them in response to the challenges raised,  only cover speech integral to criminal conduct, which  does not receive First Amendment protection. See  Hansen, slip op. at 18, 2023 U.S. LEXIS 2638 (""Speech  intended to bring about a particular unlawful act has no  social value; therefore, it is unprotected.""); Stevens, 559  U.S. at 468 (First Amendment allows restrictions on the  content of ""speech integral to criminal conduct""). Thus,  Woodhull's strict scrutiny challenge must be rejected. VIII For all of the foregoing reasons, the district court's  judgment is affirmed. So ordered.",1
